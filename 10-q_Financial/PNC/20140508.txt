(a) The Executive Summary and Consolidated Income Statement Review portions of the Financial Review section of this Report provide information regarding items impacting the comparability of the periods presented.    (b) Prior period amounts have been updated to reflect the first quarter 2014 adoption of Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-01 related to investments in low income housing tax credits.    (c) We believe that pretax, pre-provision earnings, a non-GAAP measure, is useful as a tool to help evaluate the ability to provide for credit costs through operations.    (d) Calculated as annualized taxable-equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets. The interest income earned on certain earning assets is completely or partially exempt from federal income tax. As such, these tax-exempt instruments typically yield lower returns than taxable investments. To provide more meaningful comparisons of net interest margins for all earning assets, we use net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis in calculating net interest margin by increasing the interest income earned on tax-exempt assets to make it fully equivalent to interest income earned on taxable investments. This adjustment is not permitted under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the Consolidated Income Statement. The taxable-equivalent adjustments to net interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and March 31, 2013 were $46 million and $40 million, respectively.

PNC has businesses engaged in retail banking, corporate and institutional banking, asset management and residential mortgage banking, providing many of its products and services nationally, as well as other products and services in PNC’s primary geographic markets located in Pennsylvania, Ohio, New Jersey, Michigan, Illinois, Maryland, Indiana, North Carolina, Florida, Kentucky, Washington, D.C., Delaware, Alabama, Virginia, Missouri, Georgia, Wisconsin and South Carolina. PNC also provides certain products and services internationally.  KEY STRATEGIC GOALS  At PNC we manage our company for the long term. We are focused on the fundamentals of growing customers, loans, deposits and fee revenue and improving profitability, while investing for the future and managing risk, expenses and capital. We continue to invest in our products, markets and brand, and embrace our corporate responsibility to the communities where we do business.  We strive to expand and deepen customer relationships by offering a broad range of fee-based and credit products and services. We are focused on delivering those products and services where, when and how our customers want to receive them with the goal of offering insight that reflects their specific needs. Our approach is concentrated on organically growing and deepening client relationships that meet our risk/return measures. Our strategies for growing fee income across our lines of business are focused on achieving deeper market penetration and cross selling our diverse product mix.  Our strategic priorities are designed to enhance value over the long term. A key priority is to drive growth in acquired and underpenetrated markets, including in the Southeast. In addition, we are seeking to attract more of the investable assets of new and existing clients. PNC is focused on redefining our retail banking business to a more customer-centric and sustainable model while lowering delivery costs as customer banking preferences evolve. We are also working to build a stronger residential mortgage banking business with the goal of becoming the provider of choice for our customers. Additionally, we continue to focus on expense management while bolstering critical infrastructure and streamlining our processes.  Our capital priorities are to support client growth and business investment, maintain appropriate capital in light of economic uncertainty and the Basel III framework and return excess capital to shareholders, in accordance with the capital plan included in our 2014 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) submission to the Board of Governors of the   Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve). We continue to improve our capital levels and ratios through retention of quarterly earnings and expect to build capital through retention of future earnings. PNC continues to maintain adequate liquidity positions at both PNC and PNC Bank, National Association (PNC Bank, N.A.). For more detail, see the Capital and Liquidity Actions portion of this Executive Summary, the Funding and Capital Sources portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section and the Liquidity Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review and the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 Business of our 2013 Form 10-K.  PNC faces a variety of risks that may impact various aspects of our risk profile from time to time. The extent of such impacts may vary depending on factors such as the current economic, political and regulatory environment, merger and acquisition activity and operational challenges. Many of these risks and our risk management strategies are described in more detail in our 2013 Form 10-K and elsewhere in this Report.  RECENT MARKET AND INDUSTRY DEVELOPMENTS  There have been numerous legislative and regulatory developments and dramatic changes in the competitive landscape of our industry over the last several years. The United States and other governments have undertaken major reform of the regulation of the financial services industry, including engaging in new efforts to impose requirements designed to strengthen the stability of the financial system and protect consumers and investors. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), enacted in July 2010, mandates the most wide-ranging overhaul of financial industry regulation in decades. Many parts of the law are now in effect, and others are now in the implementation stage, which is likely to continue for several years. We expect to face further increased regulation of our industry as a result of Dodd-Frank as well as other current and future initiatives intended to enhance the regulation of financial services companies, the stability of the financial system, the protection of consumers and investors, and the liquidity and solvency of financial institutions and markets. We also expect in many cases more intense scrutiny from our supervisors in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels. Compliance with new regulations will increase our costs and reduce our revenue. Some new regulations may limit our ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities.  The Federal Reserve on April 7, 2014 announced its intent to give banking entities an additional two years (i.e., until July 21, 2017) to conform their ownership interests in and sponsorship of certain collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) that are treated as covered funds to the requirements of section 619 of Dodd-Frank (commonly known as the Volcker Rule). These extensions will allow more time for PNC’s senior debt interests in CLOs that may be considered covered     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 3      funds to pay down over time before compliance is required, and should reduce the potential for adverse consequences that otherwise might result from a forced sale or restructuring of these investments due to the Volcker Rule.  On April 8, 2014, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (collectively the “banking agencies”) requested public comment on a notice of proposed rulemaking that would revise the denominator of the supplementary leverage ratio adopted by the banking agencies in July 2013 for banking organizations, such as PNC, subject to the advanced approaches framework to determine risk-based capital. The proposal, among other things, would modify (and in many cases reduce) the credit conversion factors applied to certain off-balance sheet exposures and would revise the treatment of derivatives and certain securities financing transactions. The proposal also would expand the supplementary leverage-related disclosures that covered banking organizations are required to make starting January 1, 2015. Comments on the proposal are due June 13, 2014.  Also on April 8, 2014, the banking agencies released final rules imposing a higher supplementary leverage ratio requirement on bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of more than $700 billion or assets under custody of more than $10 trillion, as well as the insured depository institution subsidiaries of these bank holding companies. Based on the asset and custody thresholds adopted in the final rules, these higher supplementary leverage requirements do not apply to PNC or PNC Bank, N.A.  On March 26, 2014, the Federal Reserve announced the results of its 2014 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review exercise (“CCAR 2014”). Of the 30 bank holding companies participating in CCAR 2014, the Federal Reserve announced that it did not object to the capital plans of 25 bank holding companies (including PNC) and objected to the capital plans of five bank holding companies (four for qualitative reasons and one due to the institution’s projected failure to meet the applicable minimum, post-stress capital ratios). In connection with the announcement of these results, the Federal Reserve emphasized that its qualitative assessment of a bank holding company’s capital planning and stress testing processes—which includes an assessment of the extent to which these processes capture and appropriately address potential risks across the organization, the robustness of the organization’s capital planning process, and corporate governance and internal controls over capital planning—is a critical component of the Federal Reserve’s CCAR review process.  On July 31, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia granted summary judgment to the plaintiffs in NACS, et al. v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The decision vacated the debit card interchange and network processing rules that went into effect in October 2011   and that were adopted by the Federal Reserve to implement provisions of Dodd-Frank. The court found among other things that the debit card interchange fees permitted under the rules allowed card issuers to recover costs that were not permitted by the statute. The court stayed its decision pending appeal, and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit granted an expedited appeal. In March 2014, the court of appeals reversed the district court. It upheld the Federal Reserve’s network processing rule and upheld its interchange fee rule except as to the issue of transaction monitoring costs, and remanded that issue back to the Federal Reserve for further explanation. The court’s mandate has not yet been issued and the plaintiffs could seek rehearing from the court of appeals or review from the United States Supreme Court.  For additional information concerning recent legislative and regulatory developments, as well as certain governmental, legislative and regulatory inquiries and investigations that may affect PNC, please see the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business, Item 1A Risk Factors, Recent Market and Industry Developments in the Executive Summary section of Item 7, and Note 23 Legal Proceedings and Note 24 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of our 2013 Form 10-K, as well as Note 16 Legal Proceedings and Note 17 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.  KEY FACTORS AFFECTING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE  Our financial performance is substantially affected by a number of external factors outside of our control, including the following:      •    General economic conditions, including the continuity, speed and stamina of the current U.S. economic expansion in general and on our customers in particular,      •    The monetary policy actions and statements of the Federal Reserve and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC),      •    The level of, and direction, timing and magnitude of movement in, interest rates and the shape of the interest rate yield curve,      •    The functioning and other performance of, and availability of liquidity in, the capital and other financial markets,      •    Loan demand, utilization of credit commitments and standby letters of credit, and asset quality,      •    Customer demand for non-loan products and services,      •    Changes in the competitive and regulatory landscape and in counterparty creditworthiness and performance as the financial services industry restructures in the current environment,      •    The impact of the extensive reforms enacted in the Dodd-Frank legislation and other legislative, regulatory and administrative initiatives and actions,     4 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q             including those outlined elsewhere in this Report, in our 2013 Form 10-K and in our other SEC filings, and      •    The impact of market credit spreads on asset valuations.  In addition, our success will depend upon, among other things:      •    Focused execution of strategic priorities for organic customer growth opportunities,      •    Further success in growing profitability through the acquisition and retention of customers and deepening relationships,      •    Driving growth in acquired and underpenetrated geographic markets, including our Southeast markets,      •    Our ability to effectively manage PNC’s balance sheet and generate net interest income,      •    Revenue growth from fee income and our ability to provide innovative and valued products to our customers,      •    Our ability to utilize technology to develop and deliver products and services to our customers and protect PNC’s systems and customer information,      •    Our ability to enhance our critical infrastructure and streamline our core processes,      •    Our ability to manage and implement strategic business objectives within the changing regulatory environment,      •    A sustained focus on expense management,      •    Improving our overall asset quality,      •    Managing the non-strategic assets portfolio and impaired assets,      •    Continuing to maintain and grow our deposit base as a low-cost funding source,      •    Prudent risk and capital management related to our efforts to manage risk to acceptable levels and to meet evolving regulatory capital and liquidity standards,      •    Actions we take within the capital and other financial markets,      •    The impact of legal and regulatory-related contingencies, and      •    The appropriateness of reserves needed for critical accounting estimates and related contingencies.  For additional information, please see the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information section in this Financial Review and Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2013 Form 10-K.  INCOME STATEMENT HIGHLIGHTS      •    Net income for the first quarter of 2014 of $1.1 billion increased 7% compared to the first quarter of 2013. The increase was driven by a decline in provision for credit losses and a 4% reduction of noninterest expense, partially offset by a 5% decline in revenue, which resulted from lower net interest income while noninterest income increased slightly.          For additional detail, please see the Consolidated Income Statement Review section in this Financial Review.      •    Net interest income of $2.2 billion for the first quarter of 2014 decreased 8% compared with the first quarter of 2013, reflecting the impact of lower yields on loans and securities, higher borrowed funds balances and lower purchase accounting accretion. These decreases were somewhat offset by loan growth and the impact of lower rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds.      •    Net interest margin decreased to 3.26% for the first quarter of 2014 compared to 3.81% for the first quarter of 2013. The decline was driven by lower rates on new loans and purchased securities in the ongoing low rate environment, as well as lower purchase accounting accretion. In addition, the decline reflected the impact of balance sheet activity in light of new short-term liquidity regulatory standards, partially offset by lower overall rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and redemptions of higher-rate borrowed funds.      •    Noninterest income of $1.6 billion for the first quarter of 2014 increased slightly compared to the first quarter of 2013, as strong fee income and the impact from the gain on a sale of Visa Class B common shares in the first quarter of 2014 was mostly offset by lower residential mortgage fee revenue.      •    The provision for credit losses decreased to $94 million for the first quarter of 2014 compared to $236 million for the first quarter of 2013 due to overall credit quality improvement.      •    Noninterest expense of $2.3 billion for the first quarter of 2014 decreased 4% compared with the first quarter of 2013. The decline was primarily driven by lower personnel expense and also reflected our continued focus on expense management.  CREDIT QUALITY HIGHLIGHTS      •    Overall credit quality continued to improve during the first quarter of 2014. For additional detail, see the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review.      •    Nonperforming assets decreased $.2 billion, or 4%, to $3.3 billion at March 31, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013. Nonperforming assets to total assets were 1.02% at March 31, 2014, compared to 1.08% at December 31, 2013.      •    Overall loan delinquencies of $2.2 billion at March 31, 2014 decreased $.3 billion, or 11%, compared with December 31, 2013.      •    The allowance for loan and lease losses was 1.78% of total loans and 120% of nonperforming loans at March 31, 2014, compared with 1.84% and 117% at December 31, 2013, respectively.     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 5         •    Net charge-offs of $186 million were down 59% compared to net charge-offs of $456 million for the first quarter of 2013. Annualized net charge-offs were 0.38% of average loans in the first quarter of 2014 and 0.99% of average loans in the first quarter of 2013. These charge-off comparisons were impacted by alignment with interagency guidance in the first quarter of 2013 on practices for loans and lines of credit related to consumer lending. In the first quarter 2013, this alignment had the overall effect of (i) accelerating charge-offs, (ii) increasing nonperforming loans and (iii) in the case of loans accounted for under the fair value option, increasing nonaccrual loans. See the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review and Note 4 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for further detail.  BALANCE SHEET HIGHLIGHTS      •    Total loans increased by $2.6 billion to $198 billion at March 31, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013.      •    Total commercial lending increased by $3.6 billion, or 3%, from December 31, 2013, as a result of growth in commercial and commercial real estate loans to new and existing customers.      •    Total consumer lending decreased $1.0 billion, or 1%, from December 31, 2013, due to lower home equity, residential mortgage and education loans as well as seasonal declines in credit card loans partially offset by growth in automobile loans.      •    Total deposits increased by $1.5 billion to $222 billion at March 31, 2014 compared with December 31, 2013, driven primarily by growth in transaction deposits.      •    PNC continued to enhance its liquidity position in preparation for implementation of new short-term liquidity regulatory standards as reflected in higher interest-earning deposits with banks, which are primarily maintained with the Federal Reserve Bank, and activity relating to investment securities and borrowed funds.      •    PNC’s well-positioned balance sheet remained core funded with a loans to deposits ratio of 89% at March 31, 2014.      •    PNC took actions reflecting its strong capital position at March 31, 2014.      •    In April 2014 the Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to 48 cents per share, an increase of 4 cents per share, or 9 percent, effective with the May dividend.      •    PNC announced share repurchase programs of up to $1.5 billion for the four quarter period beginning in the second quarter of 2014 under its existing common stock repurchase program authorization.      •    The Transitional Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, calculated using the regulatory capital methodology applicable to PNC during 2014, was 10.8% at March 31, 2014.      •    Pro forma fully phased-in Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio based on the standardized approach rules increased to an estimated 9.7 percent at March 31, 2014 from 9.4 percent at December 31, 2013. See the Capital discussion and Table 18 in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review for more detail.  Our Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Balance Sheet Review sections of this Financial Review describe in greater detail the various items that impacted our results during the first three months of 2014 and 2013 and balances at March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.  CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY ACTIONS  Our ability to take certain capital actions, including plans to pay or increase common stock dividends or to repurchase shares under current or future programs, is subject to the results of the supervisory assessment of capital adequacy undertaken by the Federal Reserve and our primary bank regulators as part of the CCAR process.  In connection with the 2014 CCAR, PNC submitted its 2014 capital plan, approved by its Board of Directors, to the Federal Reserve in January 2014. As we announced on March 26, 2014, the Federal Reserve accepted the capital plan and did not object to our proposed capital actions, which included a recommendation to increase the quarterly common stock dividend in the second quarter of 2014. The capital plan also included share repurchase programs of up to $1.5 billion for the four quarter period beginning in the second quarter of 2014 under PNC’s existing common stock repurchase authorization. These programs include repurchases of up to $200 million to mitigate the financial impact of employee benefit plan transactions. For additional information concerning the CCAR process and the factors the Federal Reserve takes into consideration in evaluating capital plans, see the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 Business of our 2013 Form 10-K.  On April 3, 2014, consistent with our 2014 capital plan, our Board of Directors approved an increase to PNC’s quarterly common stock dividend from 44 cents per common share to 48 cents per common share. For the second quarter of 2014, the increased dividend was payable to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 15, 2014 and was paid on May 5, 2014.  See the Liquidity Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review for more detail on our 2014 capital and liquidity actions.     6 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    AVERAGE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET HIGHLIGHTS  Table 2: Summarized Average Balance Sheet                         Three months ended March 31 Dollars in millions                 Change      2014     2013     $     %     Average assets                        Interest-earning assets                        Investment securities   $ 58,379     $ 58,531     $ (152 )      –     Loans     196,581       186,099       10,482       6 %    Interest-earning deposits with banks     12,157       2,410       9,747       404 %    Other     8,661       9,140       (479 )      (5 )%    Total interest-earning assets     275,778       256,180       19,598       8 %    Noninterest-earning assets     43,784       47,186       (3,402 )      (7 )%    Total average assets   $ 319,562     $ 303,366     $ 16,196       5 %    Average liabilities and equity                        Interest-bearing liabilities                        Interest-bearing deposits   $ 150,684     $ 144,801     $ 5,883       4 %    Borrowed funds     46,388       39,727       6,661       17 %    Total interest-bearing liabilities     197,072       184,528       12,544       7 %    Noninterest-bearing deposits     67,679       64,850       2,829       4 %    Other liabilities     10,364       12,107       (1,743 )      (14 )%    Equity     44,447       41,881       2,566       6 %    Total average liabilities and equity   $ 319,562     $ 303,366     $ 16,196       5 %     Various seasonal and other factors impact our period-end balances, whereas average balances are generally more indicative of underlying business trends apart from the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. The Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review provides information on changes in selected Consolidated Balance Sheet categories at March 31, 2014 compared with December 31, 2013. Total assets were $323.4 billion at March 31, 2014 compared with $320.2 billion at December 31, 2013.  Average investment securities remained relatively stable in the comparison of the first three months of 2014 compared with the first three months of 2013, as a net decrease in average residential mortgage-backed securities from principal payments was mostly offset by an increase in average U.S. Treasury and government agency securities, which was driven by the impact of fourth quarter 2013 purchases to enhance our liquidity position in light of new short-term liquidity regulatory standards. Total investment securities comprised 21% of average interest-earning assets for the first quarter of 2014 and 23% for the first quarter of 2013.  The increase in average total loans in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the prior year quarter was driven by increases in average commercial loans of $6.0 billion, average commercial real estate loans of $2.8 billion and average consumer loans of $1.7 billion. The increase in average total loans was driven by increased average loans in our Corporate & Institutional   Banking segment, primarily in Real Estate, Corporate Banking and Business Credit.  Loans represented 71% of average interest-earning assets for the first quarter of 2014 and 73% of average interest-earning assets for the first quarter of 2013.  Average interest-earning deposits with banks, which are primarily maintained with the Federal Reserve Bank, increased significantly in the comparison of first quarter 2014 to first quarter 2013, as we continued to enhance our liquidity position in preparation for implementation of new short-term liquidity regulatory standards.  The decrease in average noninterest-earning assets for the first three months of 2014 compared to the first three months of 2013 was driven primarily by decreased unsettled securities sales and securities valuations, both of which are included in noninterest-earning assets for average balance sheet purposes.  Average total deposits increased $8.7 billion in the comparison of the first quarter of 2014 compared with the prior year quarter, primarily due to an increase of $11.1 billion in average transaction deposits, which grew to $184.3 billion for the first quarter of 2014. Growth in business and consumer customer deposits as well as continued customer preference for liquidity drove the increase in average transaction deposits. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $3.0 billion in average retail certificates of deposit attributable to run-off of maturing accounts.     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 7     Total deposits at March 31, 2014 were $222.4 billion compared with $220.9 billion at December 31, 2013 and are further discussed within the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review.  Average total deposits represented 68% of average total assets for the first quarter of 2014 and 69% for the first quarter of 2013.  The increase in average borrowed funds in the current year first quarter compared with the prior year first quarter was primarily due to increases in average Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings and average bank notes and senior debt, including increases as part of the enhancement of our liquidity position in light of new short-term liquidity regulatory standards. Total borrowed funds at March 31, 2014 were $46.8 billion compared with $46.1 billion at December 31, 2013 and are further discussed within the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial   Review. The Liquidity Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review includes additional information regarding our sources and uses of borrowed funds.  BUSINESS SEGMENT HIGHLIGHTS  The Business Segments Review section of this Financial Review includes further analysis of our business segment results over the first three months of 2014 and 2013 including presentation differences from Note 18 Segment Reporting in our Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report. Note 18 Segment Reporting presents results of businesses for the first three months of 2014 and 2013.  We provide a reconciliation of total business segment earnings to PNC total consolidated net income as reported on a GAAP basis in Note 18 Segment Reporting in our Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report.

(c) “Other” includes differences between the total business segment financial results and our total consolidated net income. Additional detail is included in Note 18 Segment Reporting in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.    (d) The increase in net income in the first quarter 2014 compared to the first quarter 2013 for “Other” primarily reflects a decline in noninterest expense due to lower personnel expense related to lower benefits costs and the impact of a first quarter 2013 contribution to the PNC Foundation.    CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT REVIEW  Our Consolidated Income Statement is presented in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.  Net income for the first three months of 2014 was $1.1 billion, an increase of 7% compared with $1.0 billion for the first three months of 2013. The increase was driven by lower provision for credit losses and a decline in noninterest expense of 4%, partially offset by a 5% decline in revenue. Lower revenue in the comparison resulted from lower net interest income while noninterest income increased slightly.  NET INTEREST INCOME  Table 4: Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin                    Three months endedMarch 31    Dollars in millions   2014     2013     Net interest income   $ 2,195     $ 2,389     Net interest margin     3.26 %      3.81 %   Changes in net interest income and margin result from the interaction of the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and related yields, interest-bearing liabilities and related rates paid, and noninterest-bearing sources of funding. See the Statistical Information (Unaudited) – Average Consolidated Balance Sheet And Net Interest Analysis section of this Report and the discussion of purchase accounting accretion on     8 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q      purchased impaired loans in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Review section of this Financial Review for additional information.  Net interest income decreased by $194 million, or 8%, in the first quarter of 2014 compared with the first quarter of 2013. The decline was driven by lower purchase accounting accretion, lower yields on loans and securities and higher borrowed funds balances, somewhat offset by loan growth and the impact of lower rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds. Purchase accounting accretion declined $86 million from lower scheduled accretion and lower excess cash recoveries on purchased impaired loans.  Net interest margin declined 55 basis points in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the first quarter of 2013 due to lower yields on interest-earning assets, which decreased 57 basis points, slightly offset by a 4 basis point decrease in the weighted-average rate paid on total interest-bearing liabilities, both of which include the impact of lower purchase accounting accretion in the comparison.  The yield on interest-earning assets decreased primarily due to lower rates on new loans and purchased securities in the ongoing low rate environment, as well as the impact of higher interest-earning deposits with banks maintained with the Federal Reserve Bank and investment securities activity in light of new short-term liquidity regulatory standards. The decrease in the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities was primarily due to lower overall rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and redemptions of higher-rate bank notes and senior debt and subordinated debt.  In the second quarter of 2014, we expect net interest income to be down modestly compared to first quarter 2014 due to the continued decline in purchase accounting accretion and further interest rate spread compression.  For full year 2014, we expect total purchase accounting accretion to be down approximately $300 million compared with 2013.  NONINTEREST INCOME  Table 5: Noninterest Income                         Three months ended March 31 Dollars in millions          Change      2014     2013     $     %     Noninterest income                        Asset management   $ 364     $ 308     $ 56       18 %    Consumer services     290       296       (6 )      (2 )%    Corporate services     301       277       24       9 %    Residential mortgage     161       234       (73 )      (31 )%    Service charges on deposits     147       136       11       8 %    Net gains on sales of securities     10       14       (4 )      (29 )%    Net other-than-temporary impairments     (2 )      (10 )      8       (80 )%    Other     311       311       –       –     Total noninterest income   $ 1,582     $ 1,566     $ 16       1 %    Noninterest income increased slightly during the first quarter of 2014 compared to first quarter of 2013, reflecting strong fee income and a gain on sale of Visa Class B common shares in the first quarter of 2014, mostly offset by lower residential mortgage fee revenue. Noninterest income as a percentage of total revenue was 42% in the first quarter of 2014, up from 40% in the first quarter of 2013.  Higher asset management revenue in the first three months of 2014 was driven by stronger equity markets and sales production, as well as increased earnings from our BlackRock investment. Discretionary assets under management grew to $130 billion at March 31, 2014 compared with $118 billion at March 31, 2013 driven by higher equity markets and strong sales.  Consumer service fees declined slightly in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the prior year quarter, as growth in customer-initiated transaction volumes was more than offset by several individually insignificant items.  Corporate services revenue increased to $301 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared to $277 million in the first quarter of 2013, principally due to higher merger and acquisition advisory fees. Net commercial mortgage servicing rights valuations were stable at $11 million in both first quarters of 2014 and 2013.  Residential mortgage fee revenue decreased to $161 million in the first three months of 2014 from $234 million in the first three months of 2013, which was driven by a decline in loan sales revenue from a reduction in origination volume and lower net hedging gains on residential mortgage servicing rights. These declines were partially offset by a net benefit of $19 million from the release of reserves for residential mortgage repurchase obligations in the first quarter 2014. The repurchase reserve provision recorded during the first quarter of 2013 was not significant.  Service charges on deposits increased in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the prior year quarter due to growth in customer activity and changes in product offerings.  Other noninterest income was stable at $311 million for both first quarters of 2014 and 2013, as a $62 million gain on the sale of 1 million Visa Class B common shares in the first quarter of 2014 was substantially offset by lower commercial mortgage loans held for sale activity and a net expense of $14 million in the current year quarter from credit valuations for customer-related derivatives activities. The first quarter 2013 impact to other noninterest income related to these credit valuations was not significant.  We held approximately 9 million Visa Class B common shares with a fair value of approximately $850 million and recorded investment of $135 million as of March 31, 2014.     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 9     Other noninterest income typically fluctuates from period to period depending on the nature and magnitude of transactions completed. Further details regarding our customer-related trading activities are included in the Market Risk Management – Customer-Related Trading Risk portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review. Further details regarding private and other equity investments are included in the Market Risk Management – Equity And Other Investment Risk section, and further details regarding gains or losses related to our equity investment in BlackRock are included in the Business Segments Review section.  In the second quarter 2014, we expect fee-based noninterest income to increase in the low single digits, on a percentage basis, compared to first quarter 2014, reflecting our continued focus on our strategic priorities.  Assuming a continuation of the current economic environment, we expect that full year 2014 revenue will be under some pressure, and as a result, could likely be down compared to full year 2013 revenue due to expected purchase accounting accretion declines as well as lower residential mortgage revenues.  PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES  The provision for credit losses totaled $94 million for the first quarter of 2014 compared with $236 million for the first quarter of 2013. The decrease in provision reflected overall credit quality improvement. A contributing economic factor was the increasing value of residential real estate that improved expected cash flows on our purchased impaired loans.  We currently believe that credit trends may not remain at first quarter levels and expect our provision for credit losses in the second quarter of 2014 to be between $100 million and $150 million.  The Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review includes additional information regarding factors impacting the provision for credit losses.  NONINTEREST EXPENSE  Noninterest expense decreased $104 million, or 4%, to $2.3 billion for the first quarter of 2014 compared with first quarter 2013 reflecting overall disciplined expense management. A decrease in personnel expense related to lower headcount and benefit costs and the impact of a first quarter 2013 contribution to the PNC Foundation were partially offset by higher legal accruals associated with the residential mortgage banking business and investments in technology.  In the first quarter of 2014 we have captured savings of more than 35% of our 2014 continuous improvement savings goal of $500 million, and we expect to achieve the full-year goal. We expect cost savings to fund investments in our infrastructure,   including those related to cybersecurity, and investments in our diversified businesses, including our Retail Banking transformation, consistent with our strategic priorities.  In the first quarter of 2014, we adopted new accounting guidance which changes how investments in low income housing tax credits are recognized. As a result, losses on certain tax credit investments which were previously recorded in noninterest expense will be recorded to income taxes. While this change is expected to reduce our expenses for full year 2014, retrospective application of this accounting change was required upon adoption, which had the effect of reducing reported expenses for 2013 as well. As a result, this reclassification did not have an impact on our expense guidance for the year. See the following Effective Income Tax Rate portion of this Consolidated Income Statement Review for more detail.  In the second quarter of 2014, we expect noninterest expense to increase by low single digits, on a percentage basis, compared to first quarter 2014 due to the expected impact of seasonality with second quarter expenses typically higher than first quarter expenses.  We plan to remain focused on disciplined expense management in the current environment and continue to expect noninterest expense for full year 2014 to be lower compared with full year 2013, apart from the impact of potential legal and regulatory contingencies.  EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE  The effective income tax rate was 25.3% in the first quarter of 2014 compared with 26.4% in the first quarter of 2013. The effective tax rate is generally lower than the statutory rate primarily due to tax credits PNC receives from our investments in low income housing and new markets investments, as well as earnings in other tax exempt investments.  The lower effective income tax rate in the first quarter 2014 compared to the prior year quarter was primarily attributable to the impact of higher tax-exempt income and tax credits.  The effective tax rate for both first quarters of 2014 and 2013 reflect the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2014-01, which relates to amortization of investments in low income  housing tax credits. See the Recent Accounting Pronouncements portion of Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for further detail. The retrospective application of this guidance resulted in increased income tax expenses in both periods due to the reclassification of noninterest expense associated with these investments.  As a result of the adoption of this accounting guidance, we now expect our 2014 effective tax rate to be approximately 26%.     10 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET REVIEW  Table 6: Summarized Balance Sheet Data                         Dollars in millions    March 31 2014      December 31 2013     Change          $     %     Assets                                   Interest-earning deposits with banks   $ 14,877     $ 12,135     $ 2,742       23 %    Loans held for sale     2,102       2,255       (153 )      (7 )%    Investment securities     58,644       60,294       (1,650 )      (3 )%    Loans     198,242       195,613       2,629       1 %    Allowance for loan and lease losses     (3,530 )      (3,609 )      79       2 %    Goodwill     9,074       9,074       –       – %    Other intangible assets     2,115       2,216       (101 )      (5 )%    Other, net     41,899       42,214       (315 )      (1 )%    Total assets   $ 323,423     $ 320,192     $ 3,231       1 %    Liabilities                        Deposits   $ 222,382     $ 220,931     $ 1,451       1 %    Borrowed funds     46,806       46,105       701       2 %    Other     9,317       9,119       198       2 %    Total liabilities     278,505       276,155       2,350       1 %    Equity                        Total shareholders’ equity     43,321       42,334       987       2 %    Noncontrolling interests     1,597       1,703       (106 )      (6 )%    Total equity     44,918       44,037       881       2 %    Total liabilities and equity   $ 323,423     $ 320,192     $ 3,231       1 %     The summarized balance sheet data above is based upon our Consolidated Balance Sheet in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.  The increase in total assets was primarily due to higher interest-earning deposits with banks and loan growth, partially offset by lower investment securities. The increase in interest-earning deposits with banks resulted from the continuation of PNC’s efforts to enhance its liquidity position in preparation for implementation of new short-term liquidity regulatory standards. Interest-earning deposits with banks included balances held with the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland of $14.5 billion and $11.7 billion at March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. The increase in liabilities was largely due to growth in deposits and higher Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings and bank notes and senior debt, partially offset by a decline in federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements. An analysis of changes in selected balance sheet categories follows.  LOANS  Outstanding loan balances of $198.2 billion at March 31, 2014 and $195.6 billion at December 31, 2013 were net of unearned income, net deferred loan fees, unamortized discounts and premiums, and purchase discounts and premiums totaling $2.0 billion at March 31, 2014 and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2013, respectively. The balances include purchased impaired loans but do not include future accretable net interest (i.e., the difference between the undiscounted expected cash flows and the carrying value of the loan) on those loans.

(b) Includes both construction loans and intermediate financing for projects.    (c) Construction loans with interest reserves and A/B Note restructurings are not significant to PNC.    The increase in loans was driven by the increase in commercial lending as a result of growth in commercial and commercial real estate loans, primarily from new customers and organic growth. The decline in consumer lending resulted from lower home equity, residential mortgage and education loans as well as seasonal declines in credit card loans partially offset by growth in automobile loans.  Loans represented 61% of total assets at both March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. Commercial lending represented 61% of the loan portfolio at March 31, 2014 and 60% at December 31, 2013. Consumer lending represented 39% of the loan portfolio at March 31, 2014 and 40% at December 31, 2013.  Commercial real estate loans represented 11% of total loans at both March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 and represented 7% of total assets at both March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. See the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review for additional information regarding our loan portfolio.  Total loans above include purchased impaired loans of $5.8 billion, or 3% of total loans, at March 31, 2014, and $6.1 billion, or 3% of total loans, at December 31, 2013.  Our loan portfolio continued to be diversified among numerous industries, types of businesses and consumers across our principal geographic markets.     12 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q     ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES (ALLL)  Our total ALLL of $3.5 billion at March 31, 2014 consisted of $1.5 billion and $2.0 billion established for the commercial lending and consumer lending categories, respectively. The ALLL included what we believe to be appropriate loss coverage on all loans, including higher risk loans, in the commercial and consumer portfolios. We do not consider government insured or guaranteed loans to be higher risk as defaults have historically been materially mitigated by payments of insurance or guarantee amounts for approved claims. Additional information regarding our higher risk loans is included in the Credit Risk Management portion of the Risk Management section of this Financial Review and Note 4 Asset Quality and Note 6 Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit in our Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.

The remaining net reclassifications were predominantly due to future cash flow improvements within the commercial portfolio.    (b) As of March 31, 2014, we estimate that the reversal of contractual interest on purchased impaired loans will total approximately $1.1 billion in future periods. This will offset the total net accretable interest in future interest income of $2.0 billion on purchased impaired loans.     Information related to the valuation of purchased impaired loans at March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 follows.

We currently expect to collect total cash flows of $6.9 billion on purchased impaired loans, representing the $4.9 billion net investment at March 31, 2014 and the accretable net interest of $2.0 billion shown in Table 9.  WEIGHTED AVERAGE LIFE OF THE PURCHASED IMPAIRED PORTFOLIOS  The table below provides the weighted average life (WAL) for each of the purchased impaired portfolios as of March 31, 2014.

(b) Portfolio primarily consists of nonrevolving home equity products.    (c) In first quarter 2014, the weighted average life of the purchased impaired portfolio increased, primarily driven by residential real estate and home equity loans. Increasing a portfolio’s weighted average life will result in more interest income being recognized on purchased impaired loans in future periods.  PURCHASED IMPAIRED LOANS – ACCRETABLE DIFFERENCE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS  The following table provides a sensitivity analysis on the Total Purchased Impaired Loans portfolio. The analysis reflects hypothetical changes in key drivers for expected cash flows over the life of the loans under declining and improving conditions at a point in time. Any unusual significant economic events or changes, as well as other variables not considered below (e.g., natural or widespread disasters), could result in impacts outside of the ranges represented below. Additionally, commercial and commercial real estate loan settlements or sales proceeds can vary widely from appraised values due to a number of factors including, but not limited to, special use considerations, liquidity premiums and improvements/deterioration in other income sources.  Table 12: Accretable Difference Sensitivity – Total Purchased Impaired Loans                    In billions   March 31,2014     DecliningScenario (a)     ImprovingScenario (b)     Expected Cash Flows   $ 6.9     $ (.2 )    $ .3     Accretable Difference     2.0       –       .1     Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses     (.9 )      (.1 )      .2      (a) Declining Scenario – Reflects hypothetical changes that would decrease future cash flow expectations. For consumer loans, we assume home price forecast decreases by ten percent and unemployment rate forecast increases by two percentage points; for commercial loans, we assume that collateral values decrease by ten percent.    (b) Improving Scenario – Reflects hypothetical changes that would increase future cash flow expectations. For consumer loans, we assume home price forecast increases by ten percent, unemployment rate forecast decreases by two percentage points and interest rate forecast increases by two percentage points; for commercial loans, we assume that collateral values increase by ten percent.  The present value impact of declining cash flows is primarily reflected as immediate impairment charge to the provision for credit losses, resulting in an increase to the allowance for loan and lease losses. The present value impact of increased cash flows is first recognized as a reversal of the allowance with any additional cash flow increases reflected as an increase in accretable yield over the life of the loan.  NET UNFUNDED CREDIT COMMITMENTS  Net unfunded credit commitments are comprised of the following:  Table 13: Net Unfunded Credit Commitments                In millions   March 312014     December 312013     Total commercial lending (a)   $ 89,044     $ 90,104     Home equity lines of credit     18,632       18,754     Credit card     17,476       16,746     Other     4,492       4,266     Total   $ 129,644     $ 129,870      (a) Less than 5% of net unfunded credit commitments relate to commercial real estate at each date.  Commitments to extend credit represent arrangements to lend funds or provide liquidity subject to specified contractual conditions. Commercial commitments reported above exclude syndications, assignments and participations, primarily to financial institutions, totaling $25.9 billion at March 31, 2014 and $25.0 billion at December 31, 2013.  Unfunded liquidity facility commitments and standby bond purchase agreements totaled $1.0 billion at March 31, 2014 and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2013 and are included in the preceding table, primarily within the Total commercial lending category.  In addition to the credit commitments set forth in the table above, our net outstanding standby letters of credit totaled $10.6 billion at March 31, 2014 and $10.5 billion at December 31, 2013. Standby letters of credit commit us to make payments on behalf of our customers if specified future events occur.  Information regarding our Allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit is included in Note 6 Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.     14 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    INVESTMENT SECURITIES  The following table presents the distribution of our investment securities portfolio. We have included credit ratings information because the information is an indicator of the degree of credit risk to which we are exposed. Changes in credit ratings classifications could indicate increased or decreased credit risk and could be accompanied by a reduction or increase in the fair value of our investment securities portfolio. For those securities, where during our quarterly security-level impairment assessments we determined losses represent other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI), we have recorded cumulative credit losses of $1.2 billion in earnings and accordingly have reduced the amortized cost of our securities. See Table 77 in Note 7 Investment Securities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for more detail. The majority of these cumulative impairment charges relate to non-agency residential mortgage backed and asset-backed securities rated BB or lower.

(d) Includes available for sale and held to maturity securities.    Investment securities represented 18% of total assets at March 31, 2014 and 19% at December 31, 2013.  We evaluate our investment securities portfolio in light of changing market conditions and other factors and, where appropriate, take steps to improve our overall positioning. We consider the portfolio to be well-diversified and of high quality. At March 31, 2014, 84% of the securities in the portfolio were rated AAA/AA, with U.S. Treasury and government agencies, agency residential mortgage-backed and agency commercial mortgage-backed securities collectively representing 58% of the portfolio.  The investment securities portfolio includes both available for sale and held to maturity securities. Securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value with net unrealized gains and losses, representing the difference between amortized cost and fair value, included in Shareholders’ equity as Accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Securities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost. As of March 31, 2014, the amortized cost and fair value of available for sale securities totaled $46.6 billion and $47.5 billion, respectively, compared to an amortized cost and fair value as of December 31, 2013 of $48.0 billion and $48.6 billion, respectively. The amortized cost and fair value of held to maturity securities were $11.2 billion and $11.3 billion, respectively, at March 31, 2014, compared to $11.7 billion and $11.8 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2013.  The fair value of investment securities is impacted by interest rates, credit spreads, market volatility and liquidity conditions. The fair value of investment securities generally decreases when interest rates increase and vice versa. In addition, the fair value generally decreases when credit spreads widen and vice versa. Net unrealized gains in the total investment securities portfolio increased to $1.1 billion at March 31, 2014 from $.7 billion at December 31, 2013 primarily due to the impact of market interest rates and credit spreads. The comparable amounts for the securities available for sale portfolio were $.9 billion and $.6 billion, respectively.  Unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt securities do not impact liquidity. However these gains and losses do affect risk-based capital under the regulatory capital rules in effect beginning in 2014 for PNC. Also, a change in the securities’ credit ratings could impact the liquidity of the securities and may be indicative of a change in credit quality, which could affect our risk-weighted assets and, therefore, our regulatory capital ratios under the regulatory capital rules in effect for 2014. In addition, the amount representing the credit-related portion of OTTI on available for sale securities would reduce our earnings and regulatory capital ratios.     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 15     The duration of investment securities was 2.7 years at March 31, 2014. We estimate that, at March 31, 2014, the effective duration of investment securities was 2.8 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel increase in interest rates and 2.6 years for an immediate 50 basis points parallel decrease in interest rates. Comparable amounts at December 31, 2013 were 3.0 years and 2.8 years, respectively.  At least quarterly, we conduct a comprehensive security-level impairment assessment on all securities. For securities in an unrealized loss position, we determine whether the loss represents OTTI. For debt securities that we neither intend to sell nor believe we will be required to sell prior to expected recovery, we recognize the credit portion of OTTI charges in current earnings and include the noncredit portion of OTTI in Net unrealized gains (losses) on OTTI securities on our Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and net of tax in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. During the first quarters of 2014 and 2013 we recognized OTTI credit losses of $2 million and $10 million, respectively. The credit losses related to residential mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities collateralized by non-agency residential loans.  If housing and economic conditions were to deteriorate from current levels, and if market volatility and illiquidity were to deteriorate from current levels, or if market interest rates were to increase or credit spreads were to widen appreciably, the valuation of our investment securities portfolio could be adversely affected and we could incur additional OTTI credit losses that would impact our Consolidated Income Statement.  Additional information regarding our investment securities is included in Note 7 Investment Securities and Note 8 Fair Value in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.  LOANS HELD FOR SALE  Table 15: Loans Held For Sale                In millions   March 312014     December 312013     Commercial mortgages at fair value   $ 577     $ 586     Commercial mortgages at lower of cost or fair value     155       281     Total commercial mortgages     732       867     Residential mortgages at fair value     1,057       1,315     Residential mortgages at lower of cost or fair value     31       41     Total residential mortgages     1,088       1,356     Other     282       32     Total   $ 2,102     $ 2,255     For commercial mortgages held for sale at fair value, we stopped originating these and continue to pursue opportunities to reduce these positions.  For commercial mortgages held for sale carried at lower of cost or fair value, we sold $439 million during the first three months of 2014 compared to $926 million during the first three months of 2013. All of these loan sales were to government agencies. Total gains of $7 million were recognized on the valuation and sale of commercial mortgage loans held for sale, net of hedges, during the first three months of 2014, and $23 million during the first three months of 2013.  Residential mortgage loan origination volume was $1.9 billion during the first three months of 2014 compared to $4.2 billion for the first three months of 2013. Substantially all such loans were originated under agency or Federal Housing Administration (FHA) standards. We sold $2.1 billion of loans and recognized related gains of $88 million during the first three months of 2014. The comparable amounts for the three months of 2013 were $3.8 billion and $172 million, respectively.  Interest income on loans held for sale was $23 million in the first three months of 2014 and $53 million in the first three months of 2013. These amounts are included in Other interest income on our Consolidated Income Statement.  Additional information regarding our loan sale and servicing activities is included in Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities and Note 8 Fair Value in our Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.  GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS  Goodwill and other intangible assets totaled $11.2 billion at March 31, 2014 and $11.3 billion at December 31, 2013. The decrease of $.1 billion was primarily due to fair value changes of residential mortgage servicing rights, partially offset by new additions and purchases of mortgage servicing rights.

The increase in deposits during the first quarter of 2014 was primarily driven by seasonal increases in money market and savings deposits, partially offset by decreases in time deposits and retail certificates of deposit driven by the decline in customer sweep activity and continued run-off, respectively. Interest-bearing deposits represented 68% of total deposits at both March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. Total borrowed funds increased $.7 billion since December 31, 2013 as higher Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings and bank notes and senior debt were partially offset by a decline in federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements.

We manage our funding and capital positions by making adjustments to our balance sheet size and composition, issuing debt, equity or other capital instruments, executing treasury stock transactions and capital redemptions, managing dividend policies and retaining earnings.  Total shareholders’ equity increased $1.0 billion compared with December 31, 2013, primarily reflecting an increase in retained earnings of $759 million (driven by net income of $1.1 billion and the impact of $303 million of common and preferred dividends declared) and an increase of $220 million in accumulated other comprehensive income. This increase was primarily due to the impact of market interest rates and credit spreads on securities available for sale and derivatives that are part of cash flow hedging strategies, along with the impact of pension and other postretirement benefit plan adjustments. Common shares outstanding were 534 million at March 31, 2014 and 533 million at December 31, 2013.  Our current common stock repurchase program authorization permits us to purchase up to 25 million shares of PNC common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. This program will remain in effect until fully utilized or until modified, superseded or terminated. The extent and timing of share repurchases under this program will depend on a number of factors including, among others, market and general economic conditions, economic and regulatory capital considerations, alternative uses of capital, the potential impact on our credit ratings, contractual and regulatory limitations, and the results of the supervisory assessment of capital adequacy and capital planning processes undertaken by the Federal Reserve and our primary bank regulators as part of the CCAR process. The Federal Reserve accepted our 2014 capital plan and did not object to our proposed capital actions. The capital plan included share repurchase programs of up to $1.5 billion for the four quarter period beginning in the second quarter of 2014 under PNC’s existing common stock repurchase authorization. These programs include repurchases of up to $200 million to mitigate the financial impact of employee benefit plan transactions. Under the “de minimis” safe harbor of the Federal Reserve’s capital plan rule, PNC may make limited repurchases of common stock or other capital distributions in amounts that exceed the amounts included in its most recently approved capital plan, provided that, among other things, such distributions do not exceed, in the aggregate, 1% of PNC’s Tier 1 capital and the Federal Reserve does not object to the additional repurchases or distributions. Under this “de minimis” safe harbor, PNC repurchased $50 million of common shares to mitigate the financial impact of employee benefit plan transactions in the first quarter of 2014. See the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business of our 2013 Form 10-K for further information concerning the CCAR process and the factors the Federal Reserve takes into consideration in its evaluation of capital plans and the Capital and Liquidity Actions portion of the Executive Summary section of our Financial Review for the impact of the Federal Reserve’s current supervisory assessment of the capital adequacy program.

(n) Leverage ratio is calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by Average quarterly adjusted total assets.    18 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q     The Basel II framework, which was adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in 2004, seeks to provide more risk-sensitive regulatory capital calculations and promote enhanced risk management practices among large, internationally active banking organizations. The U.S. banking agencies initially adopted rules to implement the Basel II capital framework in 2004. In July 2013, the U.S. banking agencies adopted final rules (referred to as the advanced approaches) that modified the Basel II framework effective January 1, 2014. See the Supervision and Regulation section in Item 1 Business and Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2013 Form 10-K. Prior to fully implementing the advanced approaches established by these rules to calculate risk-weighted assets, PNC and PNC Bank, N.A. must successfully complete a “parallel run” qualification phase. Both PNC and PNC Bank, N.A. entered this parallel run phase on January 1, 2013. This phase must last at least four consecutive quarters, although, consistent with the experience of other U.S. banks, we currently anticipate a multi-year parallel run period. After PNC exits parallel run, its regulatory risk-based capital ratio for each measure (e.g., Common equity Tier 1 ratio) will be the lower of the ratios as calculated under the standardized approach and the advanced approaches.  As a result of the staggered effective dates of the final U.S. capital rules issued in July 2013, as well as the fact that PNC remains in the parallel run qualification phase for the advanced approaches, PNC’s regulatory risk-based capital ratios in 2014 are based on the definitions of, and deductions from, capital under Basel III (as such definitions and deductions are phased-in for 2014) and Basel I risk-weighted assets (but subject to certain adjustments as defined by the Basel III rules). We refer to the capital ratios calculated using these Basel III phased-in provisions and Basel I risk-weighted assets as the Transitional Basel III ratios.  Federal banking regulators have stated that they expect the largest U.S. bank holding companies, including PNC, to have a level of regulatory capital well in excess of the regulatory minimum and have required the largest U.S. bank holding companies, including PNC, to have a capital buffer sufficient to withstand losses and allow them to meet the credit needs of their customers through estimated stress scenarios. We seek to manage our capital consistent with these regulatory principles, and believe that our March 31, 2014 capital levels were aligned with them.  At March 31, 2014, PNC and PNC Bank, N.A., our domestic bank subsidiary, were both considered “well capitalized,” based on applicable U.S. regulatory capital ratio requirements. To qualify as “well capitalized”, PNC and PNC Bank, N.A. must have, during 2014, Transitional Basel III capital ratios of at least 6% for Tier 1 risk-based and 10% for Total capital risk-based, and PNC Bank, N.A. must have a Transitional Basel III leverage ratio of at least 5%.  Common equity Tier 1 capital as defined under the Basel III rules adopted by the U.S. banking agencies differs materially   from Basel I. For example, under Basel III, significant common stock investments in unconsolidated financial institutions, mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets must be deducted from capital to the extent they individually exceed 10%, or in the aggregate exceed 15%, of the institution’s adjusted Common equity Tier 1 capital. Also, Basel I regulatory capital excludes accumulated other comprehensive income related to securities currently and previously held as available for sale, as well as pension and other postretirement plans, whereas under Basel III these items are a component of PNC’s capital. The Basel III final rules also eliminate the Tier 1 treatment of trust preferred securities for bank holding companies with $15 billion or more in assets. In the third quarter of 2013, we concluded our redemptions of the discounted trust preferred securities previously assumed through acquisitions.  The access to and cost of funding for new business initiatives, the ability to undertake new business initiatives including acquisitions, the ability to engage in expanded business activities, the ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares or other capital instruments, the level of deposit insurance costs, and the level and nature of regulatory oversight depend, in large part, on a financial institution’s capital strength.  We provide additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements and some of their potential impacts on PNC in the Banking Regulation and Supervision section of Item 1 Business, Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 22 Regulatory Matters in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of our 2013 Form 10-K.  PNC’s Basel I ratios, which were PNC’s effective regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2013 were 10.5% for Tier 1 common capital ratio, 12.4% for Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, 15.8% for Total risk-based capital ratio and 11.1% for leverage ratio. Our 2013 Form 10-K included additional information regarding our Basel I capital ratios.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES  We engage in a variety of activities that involve unconsolidated entities or that are otherwise not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet that are generally referred to as “off-balance sheet arrangements.” Additional information on these types of activities is included in our 2013 Form 10-K and in the following sections of this Report:      •    Commitments, including contractual obligations and other commitments, included within the Risk Management section of this Financial Review,      •    Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements,      •    Note 10 Capital Securities of a Subsidiary Trust and Perpetual Trust Securities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements, and     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 19         •    Note 17 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements.  PNC consolidates variable interest entities (VIEs) when we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is determined to be the party that meets both of the following criteria: (i) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and (ii) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE.  A summary of VIEs, including those that we have consolidated and those in which we hold variable interests but have not consolidated into our financial statements, as of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 is included in Note 2 of this Report.  TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES  We are subject to certain restrictions, including restrictions on dividend payments, in connection with $206 million in   principal amount of an outstanding junior subordinated debenture associated with $200 million of trust preferred securities that were issued by PNC Capital Trust C, a subsidiary statutory trust (both amounts as of March 31, 2014). Generally, if there is (i) an event of default under the debenture, (ii) PNC elects to defer interest on the debenture, (iii) PNC exercises its right to defer payments on the related trust preferred security issued by the statutory trust or (iv) there is a default under PNC’s guarantee of such payment obligations, as specified in the applicable governing documents, then PNC would be subject during the period of such default or deferral to restrictions on dividends and other provisions protecting the status of the debenture holders similar to or in some ways more restrictive than those potentially imposed under the Exchange Agreement with PNC Preferred Funding Trust II. See Note 14 Capital Securities of Subsidiary Trusts and Perpetual Trust Securities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of our 2013 Form 10-K for information on contractual limitations on dividend payments resulting from securities issued by PNC Preferred Funding Trust I and PNC Preferred Funding Trust II.     FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  In addition to the following, see Note 8 Fair Value in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for further information regarding fair value.  The following table summarizes the assets and liabilities measured at fair value at March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, and the portions of such assets and liabilities that are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.  Table 19: Fair Value Measurements – Summary                            March 31, 2014     December 31, 2013    In millions   Total Fair Value     Level 3     Total Fair Value     Level 3     Total assets   $ 61,349     $ 11,052     $ 63,096     $ 10,635     Total assets at fair value as a percentage of consolidated assets     19 %            20 %          Level 3 assets as a percentage of total assets at fair value          18 %           17 %    Level 3 assets as a percentage of consolidated assets             3 %              3 %    Total liabilities   $ 4,712     $ 621     $ 5,460     $ 623     Total liabilities at fair value as a percentage of consolidated liabilities     2 %            2 %          Level 3 liabilities as a percentage of total liabilities at fair value          13 %           11 %    Level 3 liabilities as a percentage of consolidated liabilities             <1 %              <1 %   The majority of assets recorded at fair value are included in the securities available for sale portfolio. The majority of Level 3 assets represent non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities in the securities available for sale portfolio for which there was limited market activity, equity investments and mortgage servicing rights.  An instrument’s categorization within the hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. PNC reviews and updates fair value hierarchy classifications quarterly. Changes from one quarter to the next related to the observability of inputs to a fair value measurement may result in a reclassification (transfer) of assets or liabilities between hierarchy levels. PNC’s policy is to recognize transfers in and transfers out as of the end of the reporting period. For additional information regarding the transfers of assets or liabilities between hierarchy levels, see Note 8 Fair Value in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.    20 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    EUROPEAN EXPOSURE  Table 20: Summary of European Exposure  March 31, 2014                                          Direct Exposure                      Funded     Unfunded                      In millions   Loans     Leases     Securities     Total     Other (a)     Total DirectExposure     Total IndirectExposure     TotalExposure     Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain (GIIPS)   $ 70     $ 127          $ 197     $ 1     $ 198     $ 34     $ 232     United Kingdom     1,034       72            1,106       661       1,767       628       2,395     Europe – Other (b)     145       583     $ 375       1,103       81       1,184       1,193       2,377     Total Europe (c)   $ 1,249     $ 782     $ 375     $ 2,406     $ 743     $ 3,149     $ 1,855     $ 5,004    December 31, 2013                                          Direct Exposure                      Funded     Unfunded                      In millions   Loans     Leases     Securities     Total     Other (a)     Total DirectExposure     Total IndirectExposure     TotalExposure     Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain (GIIPS)   $ 78     $ 126          $ 204     $ 1     $ 205     $ 32     $ 237     United Kingdom     903       75            978       580       1,558       734       2,292     Europe – Other (b)     95       582     $ 267       944       48       992       1,192       2,184     Total Europe (c)   $ 1,076     $ 783     $ 267     $ 2,126     $ 629     $ 2,755     $ 1,958     $ 4,713      (a) Includes unfunded commitments, guarantees, standby letters of credit and sold protection credit derivatives.    (b) Europe – Other primarily consists of Germany, Norway, Netherlands, and Sweden.    (c) Included within Europe – Other is funded direct exposure of $132 million and $8 million consisting of AAA-rated sovereign debt securities at March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. There was no other direct or indirect exposure to European sovereigns as of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.    European entities are defined as supranational, sovereign, financial institutions and non-financial entities within the countries that comprise the European Union, European Union candidate countries and other European countries. Foreign exposure underwriting and approvals are centralized. PNC currently underwrites new European activities if the credit is generally associated with activities of its United States commercial customers, and, in the case of PNC Business Credit’s United Kingdom operations, loans with acceptable risk as they are predominantly well secured by short-term assets or, in limited situations, the borrower’s appraised value of certain fixed assets. Country exposures are monitored and reported regularly. We actively monitor sovereign risk, banking system health, and market conditions and adjust limits as appropriate. We rely on information from internal and external sources, including international financial institutions, economists and analysts, industry trade organizations, rating agencies, econometric data analytical service providers and geopolitical news analysis services.  Among the regions and nations that PNC monitors, we have identified five countries for which we are more closely monitoring their economic and financial situation. The basis for the increased monitoring includes, but is not limited to, sovereign debt burden, near term financing risk, political instability, GDP trends, balance of payments, market confidence, banking system distress and/or holdings of stressed sovereign debt. The countries identified are: Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain (collectively “GIIPS”).  Direct exposure primarily consists of loans, leases, securities, derivatives, letters of credit and unfunded contractual   commitments with European entities. Indirect exposure principally arises where our clients, primarily U.S. entities, appoint PNC as a letter of credit issuing bank and we elect to assume the joint probability of default risk. For PNC to incur a loss in these indirect exposures, both the obligor and the financial counterparty participating bank would need to default. PNC assesses both the corporate customers and the participating banks for counterparty risk, and where PNC has found that a participating bank exposes PNC to unacceptable risk, PNC will reject the participating bank as an acceptable counterparty and will ask the corporate customer to find an acceptable participating bank.  BUSINESS SEGMENTS REVIEW  We have six reportable business segments:      •    Retail Banking      •    Corporate & Institutional Banking      •    Asset Management Group      •    Residential Mortgage Banking      •    BlackRock      •    Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio  Business segment results, including inter-segment revenues, and a description of each business are included in Note 18 Segment Reporting included in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report. Certain amounts included in this Financial Review differ from those amounts shown in Note 18 primarily due to the presentation in this Financial Review of business net interest revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis. Note 18 presents results of businesses for the first three months of 2014 and 2013.

(k) Percentage of total deposit transactions processed at an ATM or through our mobile banking application.    (l) Represents consumer checking relationships that process the majority of their transactions through non-branch channels.  Retail Banking earned $158 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared with earnings of $120 million for the same period a year ago. The increase in earnings was driven by an increase in noninterest income and lower noninterest expense and provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower net interest income.  Retail Banking continues to augment and refine its core checking account products to enhance the customer experience and grow value. In the first quarter of 2014 we improved the Cash Flow Insight features and customer experience, and we discontinued the sale of free checking to our business banking customers. Retail Banking also continued to focus on growing consumer share of wallet through the sale of liquidity, banking and investment products and improved product value for customers. We are currently piloting Total Insight, an integrated banking and investing experience for our customers.     22 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q     Retail Banking also continued to focus on providing more cost effective alternative servicing channels that meet customers’ evolving preferences for convenience.      •    In the first quarter of 2014, approximately 43% of consumer customers used non-branch channels for the majority of their transactions compared with 37% for the same period in 2013.      •    Non-branch deposit transactions via ATM and mobile channels increased to 31% of total deposit transactions in the first quarter of 2014 compared with 20% for the same period a year ago.      •    As part of PNC’s retail branch transformation strategy, 45 branches were converted to universal branches as of March 31, 2014 in a pilot program, and 22 branches were closed or consolidated in the first quarter of 2014. Retail Banking’s primary geographic footprint extends across 17 states and Washington, D.C. Our retail branch network covers nearly half the U.S. population, with 2,703 branches and 8,001 ATMs.  Total revenue for the first three months of 2014 remained stable at $1.5 billion. Net interest income of $980 million decreased $69 million compared with the same period a year ago. The decrease resulted primarily from interest rate spread compression on the value of deposits due to the continued low rate environment and lower purchase accounting accretion and lower yields on loans. Noninterest income increased $80 million compared to the first quarter of 2013. The increase was due primarily to the $62 million pretax gain on the sale of 1 million Visa Class B common shares in the first quarter of 2014, the impact of higher customer-initiated fee-based transactions and growth in brokerage fees.  Net charge-offs were $145 million in the first quarter of 2014 compared with $250 million for the same period in 2013. The decrease was primarily attributable to the impact of alignment with interagency guidance in the first quarter of 2013.  Noninterest expense decreased $31 million in the first three months of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013. The decrease was due to disciplined expense management and the impact of branch consolidations in 2013, partially offset by higher non-credit losses and marketing expense.  Growing core checking deposits is key to Retail Banking’s growth and to providing a source of low-cost funding and liquidity to PNC. The deposit product strategy of Retail Banking is to remain disciplined on pricing, target specific products and markets for growth, and focus on the retention and growth of customer balances. In the first three months of 2014, average total deposits of $135.5 billion increased $2.1 billion, or 2%, compared with the same period in 2013.      •    Average transaction deposits grew $4.1 billion, or 4%, and average savings deposit balances grew $751          million, or 7%, compared to the prior year quarter as a result of organic deposit growth and continued customer preference for liquidity. In the first three months of 2014, compared with the same period a year ago, average demand deposits increased $2.9 billion, or 6%, to $54.8 billion and average money market deposits increased $1.2 billion, or 2%, to $49.5 billion.      •    Total average certificates of deposit decreased $2.8 billion, or 12%, compared to the same period of 2013. The decline in average certificates of deposit was due to the expected run-off of maturing accounts.  Retail Banking continued to focus on a relationship-based lending strategy that targets specific products and markets for growth, small businesses, and auto dealerships. In the first quarter of 2014, average total loans were $67.1 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion, or 2%, over the first quarter of 2013.      •    Average indirect auto loans increased $2.0 billion, or 28%, compared to the first three months of 2013. The increase was primarily due to the expansion of our indirect sales force and product introduction to acquired markets, as well as overall increases in auto sales.      •    Average home equity loans increased $404 million, or 1%, compared to the first three months of 2013. The portfolio grew modestly as increases in term loans were partially offset by declines in lines of credit. Retail Banking’s home equity loan portfolio is relationship based, with 97% of the portfolio attributable to borrowers in our primary geographic footprint.      •    Average auto dealer floor plan loans grew $359 million, or 18%, in the first three months of 2014, compared to the same period a year ago, primarily resulting from dealer line utilization and penetration into the Southeast market.      •    Average credit card balances increased $163 million, or 4%, over the first three months of 2013 as a result of organic growth.      •    For the first three months of 2014, compared to the same period a year ago, average loan balances for the remainder of the portfolio declined a net $1.3 billion, driven by a decline in the education portfolio of $673 million and commercial & commercial real estate of $239 million. The discontinued government guaranteed education loan, indirect other and residential mortgage portfolios are primarily run-off portfolios.  Nonperforming assets totaled $1.2 billion at March 31, 2014, a decrease of $49 million, or 4%, over the same period of 2013, driven by a $58 million decline in commercial nonperforming assets.

Corporate & Institutional Banking earned $523 million in the first three months of 2014, a decrease of $18 million compared with the first three months of 2013. The decrease in earnings was due to lower net interest income and lower noninterest income partially offset by a current quarter benefit from the provision for credit losses compared to provision expense in the 2013 period. We continued to focus on building client relationships, including increasing cross sales and adding new clients where the risk-return profile was attractive.  Highlights of Corporate & Institutional Banking’s performance include the following:      •    Corporate & Institutional Banking continued to execute on strategic initiatives, including in the Southeast, by organically growing and deepening client relationships that meet our risk-return measures.      •    Loan commitments increased 1%, or $2.4 billion, to $198.5 billion at March 31, 2014 compared to $196.1 billion at December 31, 2013 and 9%, or $15.9 billion, compared to $182.6 billion at March 31, 2013, primarily due to growth in our Real Estate, Corporate Banking and Business Credit businesses.      •    Period-end loan balances have increased for the fourteenth consecutive quarter increasing 4%, or $3.6 billion, to $105.4 billion at March 31, 2014 compared with $101.8 billion at December 31, 2013 and 11%, or $10.6 billion, compared with $94.8 billion at March 31, 2013.      •    Our Treasury Management business, which ranks among the top providers in the country, continued to invest in markets, products and infrastructure as well as major initiatives such as healthcare. During the first quarter of 2014, following the receipt of regulatory approvals, PNC Bank Canada Branch, PNC Bank, N.A.’s branch in Toronto, Canada, expanded its commercial banking capabilities to include commercial deposits and a comprehensive range of treasury management services.      •    Midland Loan Services was the number one servicer of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac multifamily and healthcare loans and was the second leading servicer     24 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q             of commercial and multifamily loans by volume as of December 31, 2013 according to Mortgage Bankers Association. Midland is the only U.S. commercial mortgage servicer to receive the highest primary, master and special servicer ratings from Fitch Ratings, Standard & Poor’s and Morningstar.  Net interest income was $934 million in the first three months of 2014, a decrease of $22 million from the first three months of 2013, reflecting lower purchase accounting accretion and continued interest rate spread compression on loans and deposits, partially offset by higher average loans and deposits.  Corporate service fees were $268 million in the first three months of 2014, increasing $22 million compared to the first three months of 2013. This increase was primarily due to higher merger and acquisition advisory fees. Corporate service fees include the noninterest portion of treasury management revenue, corporate finance fees, including revenue from certain capital markets-related products and services, the noninterest portion of commercial mortgage loan servicing income, and commercial mortgage servicing rights valuation, net of economic hedge.  Other noninterest income was $96 million in the first three months of 2014 compared with $139 million in the first three months of 2013. The decrease of $43 million was driven by lower revenue associated with credit valuations for customer-related derivatives activities and lower multifamily loans originated for sale, primarily to Agencies.  For the first three months of 2014, there was a benefit from the provision for credit losses of $13 million compared to a provision for credit losses of $14 million in first three months of 2013, reflecting continuing improvement in credit quality. Net charge-offs were $2 million in first three months of 2014, which represents a decrease of $56 million compared with the first three months of 2013, primarily attributable to lower levels of commercial real estate and commercial charge-offs.  Nonperforming assets were $786 million, a 27% decrease from March 31, 2013 resulting from improving credit quality.  Noninterest expense was $488 million in the first three months of 2014, an increase of $8 million from the first three months of 2013, primarily driven by higher incentive compensation costs associated with business activity.  Average loans were $103.5 billion in the first three months of 2014 compared with $94.3 billion in the first three months of 2013, an increase of 10% reflecting strong growth in Real Estate, Corporate Banking and Business Credit.      •    Corporate Banking provides lending, treasury management and capital markets-related products and services to mid-sized and large corporations, government and not-for-profit entities. Average loans for this business increased $3.0 billion, or 6%, in the          first three months of 2014 compared with the first three months of 2013, primarily due to an increase in loan commitments from specialty lending businesses.      •    PNC Real Estate provides commercial real estate and real estate-related lending and is one of the industry’s top providers of both conventional and affordable multifamily financing. Average loans for this business increased $5.2 billion, or 25%, in the first three months of 2014 compared with the first three months of 2013 due to increased originations.      •    PNC Business Credit was one of the top four asset-based lenders in the country as of December 31, 2013, with increasing market share according to the Commercial Finance Association. The loan portfolio is relatively high yielding, with acceptable risk as the loans are mainly secured by short-term assets. Average loans increased $1.4 billion, or 12%, in the first three months of 2014 compared with the first three months of 2013 due to an increase in loan usage and new customer loan originations.      •    PNC Equipment Finance is a recognized leader in providing equipment financing solutions to clients throughout the U.S. and in Canada with over $11.6 billion in equipment finance assets as of March 31, 2014. Average equipment finance assets for the leasing company in the first three months of 2014 were $11.6 billion, an increase of $473 million, or 4%, compared with the first three months of 2013.  Average deposits were $71.0 billion in the first three months of 2014, an increase of $6.4 billion, or 10%, compared with the first three months of 2013 as a result of business growth and inflows into money market and noninterest-bearing deposits.  The commercial mortgage servicing portfolio was $313 billion at March 31, 2014, an increase of 2% compared with December 31, 2013 and an increase of 8% compared to March 31, 2013, as servicing additions exceeded portfolio run-off.  Product Revenue  In addition to credit and deposit products for commercial customers, Corporate & Institutional Banking offers other services, including treasury management, capital markets-related products and services, and commercial mortgage banking activities, for customers of all our business segments. On a consolidated basis, the revenue from these other services is included in net interest income, corporate service fees and other noninterest income. From a segment perspective, the majority of the revenue and expense related to these services is reflected in the Corporate & Institutional Banking segment results and the remainder is reflected in the results of other businesses. The Other Information section in Table 22 in this Business Segments Review section includes the consolidated revenue to PNC for these services. A discussion of the consolidated revenue from these services follows.     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 25     Treasury management revenue, comprised of fees and net interest income from customer deposit balances, totaled $311 million for the first three months of 2014 compared with $329 million for the first three months of 2013. Lower spreads on deposits drove the decline in revenue in the first three months of 2014 compared with the first three months of 2013. Growth in deposit balances and products such as liquidity management products and payables was strong.  Capital markets revenue includes merger and acquisition advisory fees, loan syndications, derivatives, foreign exchange, asset-backed finance revenue and fixed income activities. Revenue from capital markets-related products and services totaled $157 million in the first three months of 2014 compared with $131 million in the first three months of 2013. The increase in the comparison was driven by the impact of higher merger and acquisition advisory fees and higher corporate finance fees partially offset by lower revenue associated with credit valuations for customer-related derivatives activities.  Commercial mortgage banking activities include revenue derived from commercial mortgage servicing (including net interest income and noninterest income from loan servicing and ancillary services, net of changes in commercial mortgage servicing rights due to time and payoffs, and commercial mortgage servicing rights valuations, net of economic hedge and, for the 2013 periods, mortgage servicing rights amortization), and revenue derived from commercial mortgage loans held for sale and related hedges (including loan origination fees, net interest income, valuation adjustments and gains or losses on sales).  Commercial mortgage banking activities resulted in revenue of $85 million in the first three months of 2014 compared with $102 million in the first three months of 2013. The decrease in the comparison was mainly due to lower multifamily loans originated for sale, primarily to Agencies.

Assets under administration were $255 billion as of March 31, 2014 compared to $236 billion as of March 31, 2013. Earnings decreased due to higher noninterest expense and provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher noninterest income.  The core growth strategies of the business include increasing sales sourced from other PNC lines of business, maximizing front line productivity and optimizing market presence including additions to staff in high opportunity markets. Wealth Management and Hawthorn provide investment management, private banking and family wealth services to affluent and ultra affluent clients. The businesses have 103 offices operating in 7 out of the 10 most affluent states with a majority co-located with retail banking branches. The businesses’ strategies primarily focus on growing assets under management through expanding relationships directly and through other PNC lines of business and increasing the share of our clients’ investable assets. Institutional Asset Management provides advisory, custody, and retirement administration services to institutional clients primarily within our banking footprint. The business segment also offers a lineup of PNC proprietary mutual funds. Institutional Asset Management is strengthening its partnership with the Corporate Bank to drive growth and is focused on building retirement capabilities and expanding product solutions for all customers.  Assets under administration increased $19 billion compared to a year ago. Discretionary assets under management were $130 billion at March 31, 2014 compared with $118 billion at March 31, 2013. The increase was driven by higher average equity markets and strong sales resulting in positive net flows of $1.6 billion primarily from the institutional business, after adjustments to total net flows for cyclical client activities.  Total revenue for the first quarter of 2014 increased $15 million to $270 million compared with $255 million for 2013, primarily relating to noninterest income due to stronger average equity markets and positive net flows.  Noninterest expense was $199 million in the first quarter of 2014, an increase of $16 million, or 9%, from the prior year first quarter. The increase was primarily attributable to compensation expense and the impact of a legal benefit in the first quarter of 2013. Over the last 12 months, total full-time headcount has increased by approximately 105 positions, or 3%. The business remains focused on managing expenses as it invests in growth opportunities.  Average deposits for the first quarter of 2014 increased $.3 billion, or 3%, from the prior year first quarter. Average transaction deposits grew 4% to $9.1 billion compared with the first quarter of 2013 and were partially offset by the run-off of maturing certificates of deposit. Average loan balances of $7.1 billion increased $.5 billion, or 8%, from the prior year first quarter due to continued growth in the consumer loan portfolio, primarily home equity installment loans, due to favorable interest rates.

Residential Mortgage Banking lost $4 million in the first three months of 2014 compared with earnings of $45 million in the first three months of 2013. Earnings declined from the prior year three month period primarily as a result of decreased loan sales revenue.  The strategic focus of the business is the acquisition of new customers through a retail loan officer sales force with an emphasis on home purchase transactions. Our strategy involves competing on the basis of superior service to new and existing customers in serving their home purchase and refinancing needs. A key consideration in pursuing this approach is the cross-sell opportunity, especially in the bank footprint markets.  Residential Mortgage Banking overview:      •    Total loan originations were $1.9 billion for the first three months of 2014 compared with $4.2 billion in the comparable period of 2013. Loans continue to be originated primarily through direct channels under Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) and Federal Housing Administration (FHA)/Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) agency guidelines. Refinancings were 63% of originations for the first three months of 2014 and 81% in the first three months of 2013. During the first three months of 2014, 28% of loan originations were under the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP).      •    Investors having purchased mortgage loans may request PNC to indemnify them against losses on certain loans or to repurchase loans that they believe do not comply with applicable contractual loan origination covenants and representations and warranties we have made. At March 31, 2014, the liability for estimated losses on repurchase and indemnification claims for the Residential Mortgage Banking business segment was $103 million compared with $522 million at March 31, 2013. See the Recourse And Repurchase Obligations section of this Financial Review and Note 17 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for additional information.      •    Residential mortgage loans serviced for others totaled $114 billion at March 31, 2014 and $120 billion at March 31, 2013 as payoffs continued to outpace new direct loan origination volume and acquisitions.      •    Noninterest income was $166 million in the first three months of 2014 compared with $243 million in the first three months of 2013. Increased servicing fees and improvement in residential mortgage repurchase obligations provision were more than offset by decreased loans sales revenue and MSR valuation, net of economic hedge.      •    Noninterest expense was $213 million in the first three months of 2014 compared with $200 million in the first three months of 2013. Increased legal accruals were partially offset by a decrease in foreclosure expenses.      •    The fair value of mortgage servicing rights was $1.1 billion at March 31, 2014 compared with $.8 billion at March 31, 2013. The increase was due to higher mortgage interest rates at March 31, 2014.

(d) Recorded investment of purchased impaired loans related to acquisitions. At March 31, 2014, this segment contained 80% of PNC’s purchased impaired loans.  This business segment consists of non-strategic assets primarily obtained through acquisitions of other companies. The business activity of this segment is to manage the wind-down of the portfolios while maximizing the value and mitigating risk.  Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio had earnings of $110 million in the first three months of 2014 compared with $79 million in the first three months of 2013. Earnings increased year-over-year due to a current quarter benefit from the provision for credit losses compared to provision expense in the prior year period and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by lower net interest income.  Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio overview:      •    Net interest income was $142 million in the first three months of 2014 compared with $203 million in the first three months of 2013. The decrease was driven by lower scheduled accretion and excess cash recoveries on purchased impaired loans as well as lower average loan balances.      •    Noninterest income was $6 million in the first three months of 2014 compared with $16 million in the first three months of 2013. The decrease was driven by higher provision for estimated losses on home equity loans/lines repurchase obligations.      •    The first three months of 2014 reflected a benefit from the provision for credit losses of $52 million compared to an expense of $42 million in the first three months of 2013. The decline in provision reflected overall credit quality improvement. A contributing economic factor was the increasing value of residential real estate that improved expected cash flows on our purchased impaired loans.      •    Noninterest expense in the first three months of 2014 was $26 million compared with $52 million in the first three months of 2013. The decrease was driven by lower OREO expense, primarily due to lower write-downs on commercial properties as well as lower write-offs of protective advances on residential mortgages.      •    Average portfolio loans declined to $9.6 billion in the first three months of 2014 compared with $11.3 billion in the first three months of 2013. The overall decline was driven by customer payment activity and portfolio management activities to reduce under-performing assets.      •    Nonperforming loans were $.6 billion at March 31, 2014 and $.7 billion at March 31, 2013. The consumer lending portfolio comprised 90% of the nonperforming loans in this segment at March 31, 2014. Nonperforming consumer loans decreased $20 million from March 31, 2013. The commercial lending portfolio comprised 10% of the nonperforming loans as of March 31, 2014. Nonperforming commercial loans decreased $76 million from March 31, 2013.      •    Net charge-offs were $31 million in the first three months of 2014 and $87 million in the first three months of 2013. The decline was due to lower charge-offs experienced across the entire lending portfolio.     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 29         •    At March 31, 2014, the liability for estimated losses on repurchase and indemnification claims for the Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio was $19 million compared to $25 million at March 31, 2013. See Note 17 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for additional information.  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS  Note 1 Accounting Policies in Item 8 of our 2013 Form 10-K and in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report describe the most significant accounting policies that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements. Certain of these policies require us to make estimates or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or be subject to variations that may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods.  We must use estimates, assumptions and judgments when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at, or adjusted to reflect, fair value.  Assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility. Fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on either quoted market prices or are provided by independent third-party sources, including appraisers and valuation specialists, when available. When such third-party information is not available, we estimate fair value primarily by using cash flow and other financial modeling techniques. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could materially impact our future financial condition and results of operations.  We discuss the following critical accounting policies and judgments under this same heading in Item 7 of our 2013 Form 10-K:      •    Fair Value Measurements      •    Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit      •    Estimated Cash Flows on Purchased Impaired Loans      •    Goodwill      •    Lease Residuals      •    Revenue Recognition      •    Residential and Commercial Mortgage Servicing Rights      •    Income Taxes      •    Recently Issued Accounting Standards      •    Recent Accounting Pronouncements  We provide additional information about many of these items in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item l of this Report.  The following critical accounting estimate and judgment has been updated during the first three months of 2014.   ALLOWANCES FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES AND UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT  We maintain the ALLL and the Allowance for Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit at levels that we believe to be appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolio and on the unfunded credit facilities as of the balance sheet date. Our determination of these allowances is based on periodic evaluations of the loan and lease portfolios and unfunded credit facilities and other relevant factors. These critical estimates include the use of significant amounts of PNC’s own historical data and complex methods to interpret them. We have an ongoing process to evaluate and enhance the quality, quantity and timeliness of our data and interpretation methods used in the determination of these allowances. These evaluations are inherently subjective as they require material estimates, and may be susceptible to significant change, and include, among others:      •    Probability of default (PD),      •    Loss given default (LGD),      •    Exposure at date of default,      •    Movement through delinquency stages,      •    Amounts and timing of expected future cash flows,      •    Value of collateral, which may be obtained from third parties, and      •    Qualitative factors, such as changes in current economic conditions, that may not be reflected in modeled results.  In determining the appropriateness of the ALLL, we make specific allocations to impaired loans and allocations to portfolios of commercial and consumer loans. We also allocate reserves to provide coverage for probable losses incurred in the portfolio at the balance sheet date based upon current market conditions, which may not be reflected in historical loss data. Commercial lending is the largest category of credits and is sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the ALLL. We have allocated approximately $1.5 billion, or 44%, of the ALLL at March 31, 2014 to the commercial lending category. Consumer lending allocations are made based on historical loss experience adjusted for recent activity. Approximately $2.0 billion, or 56%, of the ALLL at March 31, 2014 has been allocated to these consumer lending categories.  RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  In January 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-04, Receivables – Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors (Subtopic 310-40): Reclassification of Residential Real Estate Collateralized Consumer Mortgage Loans upon Foreclosure. This ASU clarifies that an in substance repossession or foreclosure occurs, and a creditor is considered to have received physical possession of residential real estate property collateralizing a consumer mortgage loan, upon (1) the     30 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q      creditor obtaining legal title to the residential real estate property upon completion of a foreclosure or (2) the borrower conveying all interest in the residential real estate property to the creditor to satisfy the loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement. This ASU will also require additional disclosures, including: (1) the amount of foreclosed residential real estate property held by the creditor and (2) the recorded investment in consumer mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate properties that are in the process of foreclosure. This guidance is effective as of January 1, 2015 and may be adopted using either a modified retrospective transition method or a prospective transition method. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect this ASU to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position.  In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360): Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity. This ASU will limit discontinued operations reporting to disposals of components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that have (or will have) a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results. Additionally, the ASU will also require expanded disclosures for discontinued operations. This ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2014 and is to be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted for disposals or classifications as held for sale that have not been previously reported in financial statements. We do not expect this ASU to have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position.  RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item I of this Report regarding the impact of new accounting standards which we have adopted.  STATUS OF QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN  We have a noncontributory, qualified defined benefit pension plan (plan or pension plan) covering eligible employees. Benefits are determined using a cash balance formula where earnings credits are applied as a percentage of eligible compensation. We calculate the expense associated with the pension plan and the assumptions and methods that we use include a policy of reflecting trust assets at their fair market value. On an annual basis, we review the actuarial assumptions related to the pension plan.  We currently estimate pretax pension income of $9 million in 2014 compared with pretax expense of $74 million in 2013. This year-over-year expected decrease reflects the impact of favorable returns on plan assets experienced in 2013, as well as the effects of the higher discount rate required to be used in 2014.  The table below reflects the estimated effects on pension expense of certain changes in annual assumptions, using 2014 estimated expense as a baseline.  Table 27: Pension Expense – Sensitivity Analysis            Change in Assumption (a)   EstimatedIncrease/(Decrease) to2014 Pension Expense(In millions)     .5% decrease in discount rate   $ (2 )    .5% decrease in expected long-term return on assets   $ 21     .5% increase in compensation rate   $ 1      (a) The impact is the effect of changing the specified assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.  We provide additional information on our pension plan in Note 15 Employee Benefit Plans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of our 2013 Form 10-K.  RECOURSE AND REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS  As discussed in Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report, PNC has sold commercial mortgage, residential mortgage and home equity loans/ lines of credit directly or indirectly through securitization and loan sale transactions in which we have continuing involvement. One form of continuing involvement includes certain recourse and loan repurchase obligations associated with the transferred assets.  COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE LOAN RECOURSE OBLIGATIONS  We originate, close and service certain multi-family commercial mortgage loans which are sold to FNMA under FNMA’s Delegated Underwriting and Servicing (DUS) program. We participated in a similar program with the FHLMC. Our exposure and activity associated with these recourse obligations are reported in the Corporate & Institutional Banking segment. For more information regarding our Commercial Mortgage Loan Recourse Obligations, see the Recourse and Repurchase Obligations section of Note 17 Commitments and Guarantees included in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.  RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS  While residential mortgage loans are sold on a non-recourse basis, we assume certain loan repurchase obligations associated with mortgage loans we have sold to investors. These loan repurchase obligations primarily relate to situations where PNC is alleged to have breached certain origination covenants and representations and warranties made to purchasers of the loans in the respective purchase and sale agreements. Residential mortgage loans covered by these     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 31      loan repurchase obligations include first and second-lien mortgage loans we have sold through Agency securitizations, Non-Agency securitizations, and loan sale transactions. As discussed in Note 2 in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report, Agency securitizations consist of mortgage loan sale transactions with FNMA, FHLMC and the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA), while Non-Agency securitizations consist of mortgage loan sale transactions with private investors. Mortgage loan sale transactions that are not part of a securitization may involve FNMA, FHLMC or private investors. Our historical exposure and activity associated with Agency securitization repurchase obligations has primarily been related to transactions with FNMA and FHLMC, as indemnification and repurchase losses associated with FHA and VA-insured and uninsured loans pooled in GNMA securitizations historically have been minimal. In addition to indemnification and repurchase risk, however, we face other risks of loss with respect to our participation in these programs, some of which are described in Note 23 Legal Proceedings in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 in our 2013 Form 10-K with respect to governmental inquiries related to FHA-insured loans. Repurchase obligation activity associated with residential mortgages is reported in the Residential Mortgage Banking segment.  Origination and sale of residential mortgages is an ongoing business activity and, accordingly, management continually assesses the need to recognize indemnification and repurchase liabilities pursuant to the associated investor sale agreements. We establish indemnification and repurchase liabilities for estimated losses on sold first and second-lien mortgages for which indemnification is expected to be provided or for loans that are expected to be repurchased. For the first and second-lien mortgage sold portfolio, we have established an indemnification and repurchase liability pursuant to investor sale agreements based on claims made and our estimate of future claims on a loan by loan basis. To estimate the mortgage repurchase liability arising from breaches of representations and warranties, we consider the following factors: (i) borrower performance in our historically sold portfolio (both actual and estimated future defaults); (ii) the level of outstanding unresolved repurchase claims; (iii) estimated probable future repurchase claims, considering information about file requests, delinquent and liquidated loans, resolved and unresolved mortgage insurance rescission notices and our historical experience with claim rescissions; (iv) the potential ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchase claims (“rescission rate”) and (v) the estimated severity of loss upon repurchase of the loan or collateral, make-whole settlement or indemnification.  For more information see the Recourse and Repurchase Obligations section included in Item 7 of our 2013 Form 10-K and Note 17 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.  The following tables present the unpaid principal balance of repurchase claims by vintage and total unresolved repurchase claims at the respective balance sheet dates.

(b) Represents both i) amounts paid for indemnification/settlement payments and ii) the difference between loan repurchase price and fair value of the loan at the repurchase date. These losses are charged to the indemnification and repurchase liability.    (c) Represents fair value of loans repurchased only as we have no exposure to changes in the fair value of loans or underlying collateral when indemnification/settlement payments are made to investors.    (d) Repurchase activity associated with insured loans, government-guaranteed loans and loans repurchased through the exercise of our removal of account provision (ROAP) option are excluded from this table. Refer to Note 2 Loan Sale and Servicing Activities and Variable Interest Entities in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for further discussion of ROAPs.    (e) Activity relates to loans sold through Non-Agency securitizations and loan sale transactions.    Residential mortgages that we service through FNMA, FHLMC and GNMA securitizations, and for which we could experience a loss if required to repurchase a delinquent loan due to a breach in representations or warranties, were $49 billion at March 31, 2014, of which $230 million was 90 days or more delinquent. These amounts were $48 billion and $253 million, respectively, at December 31, 2013.  In the fourth quarter of 2013, PNC reached agreements with both FNMA and FHLMC to resolve their repurchase claims with respect to loans sold between 2000 and 2008. PNC paid a total of $191 million related to these settlements. The volume of new repurchase demand claims dropped significantly in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 as a result of the settlement agreements. Additionally, the liability for estimated losses on indemnification and repurchase claims for residential mortgages decreased to $103 million at March 31, 2014 from $131 million at December 31, 2013.  We believe our indemnification and repurchase liability appropriately reflects the estimated probable losses on indemnification and repurchase claims for all residential mortgage loans sold and outstanding as of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. In making these estimates, we consider   the losses that we expect to incur over the life of the sold loans. See Note 17 Commitments and Guarantees in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for additional information.  HOME EQUITY REPURCHASE OBLIGATIONS  PNC’s repurchase obligations include obligations with respect to certain brokered home equity loans/lines of credit that were sold to a limited number of private investors in the financial services industry by National City prior to our acquisition of National City. PNC is no longer engaged in the brokered home equity lending business, and our exposure under these loan repurchase obligations is limited to repurchases of the loans sold in these transactions. Repurchase activity associated with brokered home equity loans/ lines of credit is reported in the Non-Strategic Assets Portfolio segment.  For more information regarding our Home Equity Repurchase Obligations, see the Recourse and Repurchase Obligations section under Item 7 of our 2013 Form 10-K and Note 17 Commitments and Guarantees included in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 33     RISK MANAGEMENT  PNC encounters risk as part of the normal course of operating our business. Accordingly, we design risk management processes to help manage these risks.  The Risk Management section included in Item 7 of our 2013 Form 10-K describes our enterprise risk management framework including risk appetite and strategy, risk culture, risk organization and governance, risk identification and quantification, risk control and limits, and risk monitoring and reporting. Additionally, our 2013 Form 10-K provides an analysis of our key areas of risk, which include but are not limited to credit, operational, model, liquidity and market. Our use of financial derivatives as part of our overall asset and liability risk management process is also addressed within the Risk Management section.  The following information updates our 2013 Form 10-K risk management disclosures.  CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT  Credit risk represents the possibility that a customer, counterparty or issuer may not perform in accordance with contractual terms. Credit risk is inherent in the financial services business and results from extending credit to customers, purchasing securities, and entering into financial derivative transactions and certain guarantee contracts. Credit risk is one of our most significant risks. Our processes for managing credit risk are embedded in PNC’s risk culture and in our decision-making processes using a systematic approach whereby credit risks and related exposures are: identified and assessed, managed through specific policies and processes, measured and evaluated against our risk tolerance and credit concentration limits, and reported, along with specific mitigation activities, to management and the Board through our governance structure.  ASSET QUALITY OVERVIEW  Asset quality trends for the first three months of 2014, improved from both December 31, 2013 and March 31, 2013.      •    Overall credit quality continued to improve during the first quarter of 2014. Nonperforming assets at March 31, 2014 decreased $153 million compared with December 31, 2013 as a result of improvements in both consumer and commercial lending. Consumer lending nonperforming loans decreased $84 million, commercial real estate nonperforming loans declined $38 million and commercial nonperforming loans decreased $20 million. Nonperforming assets to total assets were 1.02 percent at March 31, 2014 compared with 1.08 percent at December 31, 2013 and 1.31 percent at March 31, 2013.      •    Overall loan delinquencies of $2.2 billion decreased $.3 billion, or 11%, from year-end 2013 levels. The reduction was largely due to a reduction in accruing          government insured residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more of $101 million, the majority of which we took possession of and conveyed the real estate, or are in the process of conveyance and claim resolution.      •    Net charge-offs for the first quarter of 2014 were stable compared with fourth quarter 2013 as lower home equity loan net charge-offs were offset by higher residential real estate and commercial loan net charge-offs. In the comparison with first quarter 2013, net charge-offs decreased $270 million reflecting improving credit quality, which was partially offset by $134 million of charge-offs due to the impact of alignment with interagency supervisory guidance in the first quarter of 2013.      •    Provision for credit losses for first quarter 2014 decreased $19 million compared with fourth quarter 2013 and $142 million compared with first quarter 2013 as overall credit quality has continued to improve. A contributing economic factor was the increasing value of residential real estate, which improved expected cash flows from our purchased impaired loans.      •    The level of ALLL decreased to $3.5 billion at March 31, 2014 from $3.6 billion at December 31, 2013 and $3.8 billion at March 31, 2013.  NONPERFORMING ASSETS AND LOAN DELINQUENCIES  NONPERFORMING ASSETS, INCLUDING OREO AND FORECLOSED ASSETS  Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans and leases for which ultimate collectability of the full amount of contractual principal and interest is not probable and include nonperforming troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), OREO and foreclosed assets. Loans held for sale, certain government insured or guaranteed loans, purchased impaired loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option are excluded from nonperforming loans. Additional information regarding our nonperforming loans and nonaccrual policies is included in Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report. The major categories of nonperforming assets are presented in Table 31.  In the first quarter of 2013, we completed our alignment of certain nonaccrual and charge-off policies consistent with interagency supervisory guidance on practices for loans and lines of credit related to consumer lending. This alignment primarily related to (i) subordinate consumer loans (home equity loans and lines of credit and residential mortgages) where the first-lien loan was 90 days or more past due, (ii) government guaranteed loans where the guarantee may not result in collection of substantially all contractual principal and interest and (iii) certain loans with borrowers in or discharged from bankruptcy. In the first quarter of 2013, nonperforming loans increased by $426 million and net     34 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q      charge-offs increased by $134 million as a result of completing the alignment of the aforementioned policies. Additionally, overall delinquencies decreased $395 million due to loans now being reported as either nonperforming or, in the case of loans accounted for under the fair value option, nonaccruing or having been charged off. Certain consumer nonperforming loans were charged-off to the respective collateral value less costs to sell, and any associated allowance at the time of charge-off was reduced to zero. Therefore, the charge-off activity resulted in a reduction to the allowance. As the interagency guidance was adopted, incremental provision for credit losses was recorded if the related loan charge-off exceeded the associated allowance. Subsequent declines in collateral value for these loans will result in additional charge-offs to maintain recorded investment at collateral value less costs to sell.  At March 31, 2014, TDRs included in nonperforming loans were $1.4 billion, or 48%, of total nonperforming loans compared to $1.5 billion, or 49%, of total nonperforming loans as of December 31, 2013. Within consumer nonperforming loans, residential real estate TDRs comprise 57% of total residential real estate nonperforming loans at March 31, 2014, down from 59% at December 31, 2013. Home equity TDRs comprise 51% of home equity nonperforming loans at March 31, 2014, down from 54% at December 31, 2013. TDRs generally remain in nonperforming status until a borrower has made at least six consecutive months of payments under the modified terms or ultimate resolution occurs. Loans where borrowers have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to PNC are not returned to accrual status.  At March 31, 2014, our largest nonperforming asset was $35 million in the Real Estate, Rental and Leasing Industry and our average nonperforming loans associated with commercial lending were under $1 million. All of the ten largest outstanding nonperforming assets are from the commercial lending portfolio and represent 17% and 5% of total commercial lending nonperforming loans and total nonperforming assets, respectively, as of March 31, 2014.

(d) Pursuant to alignment with interagency supervisory guidance on practices for loans and lines of credit related to consumer lending in the first quarter of 2013, nonperforming home equity loans increased $214 million, nonperforming residential mortgage loans increased $187 million and nonperforming other consumer loans increased $25 million. Charge-offs were taken on these loans where the fair value less costs to sell the collateral was less than the recorded investment of the loan and were $134 million.

As of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, 48% and 44%, respectively, of our OREO and foreclosed assets were comprised of 1-4 family residential properties. The lower level of OREO and foreclosed assets was driven mainly by continued elevated sales activity offset slightly by an increase in foreclosures.

(b) Charge-offs and valuation adjustments include $134 million of charge-offs added in the first quarter of 2013 due to the alignment with interagency supervisory guidance discussed in footnote (a) above.  The table above presents nonperforming asset activity during the first three months of 2014 and 2013, respectively. Nonperforming assets decreased $153 million from $3.5 billion at December 31, 2013, as a result of improvements in both consumer and commercial lending. Consumer lending nonperforming loans decreased $84 million, commercial real estate nonperforming loans declined $38 million and commercial nonperforming loans decreased $20 million. Approximately 88% of total nonperforming loans are secured by collateral which would be expected to reduce credit losses   and require less reserve in the event of default, and 33% of commercial lending nonperforming loans are contractually current as to both principal and interest obligations. As of March 31, 2014, commercial lending nonperforming loans are carried at approximately 67% of their unpaid principal balance, due to charge-offs recorded to date, before consideration of the ALLL. See Note 4 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for additional information on these loans.  Purchased impaired loans are considered performing, even if contractually past due (or if we do not expect to receive payment in full based on the original contractual terms), as we are currently accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans. The accretable yield represents the excess of the expected cash flows on the loans at the measurement date over the carrying value. Generally decreases, other than interest rate decreases for variable rate notes, in the net present value of expected cash flows of individual commercial or pooled purchased impaired loans would result in an impairment charge to the provision for loan losses in the period in which the change is deemed probable. Generally increases in the net present value of expected cash flows of purchased impaired loans would first result in a recovery of previously recorded allowance for loan losses, to the extent applicable, and then an increase to accretable yield for the remaining life of the purchased impaired loans. Total nonperforming loans and assets in the tables above are significantly lower than they would have been due to this accounting treatment for purchased impaired loans. This treatment also results in a lower ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans and a higher ratio of ALLL to nonperforming loans. See Note 5 Purchased Loans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for additional information on these loans.  LOAN DELINQUENCIES  We regularly monitor the level of loan delinquencies and believe these levels may be a key indicator of loan portfolio asset quality. Measurement of delinquency status is based on the contractual terms of each loan. Loans that are 30 days or more past due in terms of payment are considered delinquent. Loan delinquencies exclude loans held for sale and purchased impaired loans, but include government insured or guaranteed loans and loans accounted for under the fair value option.  Total early stage loan delinquencies (accruing loans past due 30 to 89 days) decreased from $1.0 billion at December 31, 2013 to $0.9 billion at March 31, 2014. The reduction in both Consumer and Commercial lending early stage delinquencies resulted from improving credit quality. See Note 1 Accounting Policies in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report for additional information regarding our nonperforming loan and nonaccrual policies.     36 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q    Accruing loans past due 90 days or more are referred to as late stage delinquencies. These loans are not included in nonperforming loans and continue to accrue interest because they are well secured by collateral, and/or are in the process of collection, are managed in homogenous portfolios with specified charge-off timeframes adhering to regulatory guidelines, or are certain government insured or guaranteed loans. These loans decreased $.2 billion, or 12%, from $1.5 billion at December 31, 2013, to $1.3 billion at March 31, 2014, mainly due to a decline in government insured residential real estate loans of $.1 billion, the majority of which we took possession of and conveyed the real estate, or are in the process of conveyance and claim resolution. The following tables display the delinquency status of our loans at March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. Additional information regarding accruing loans past due is included in Note 4 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report.

On a regular basis our Special Asset Committee closely monitors loans, primarily commercial loans, that are not included in the nonperforming or accruing past due categories and for which we are uncertain about the borrower’s ability to comply with existing repayment terms over the next six months. These loans totaled $.2 billion at both March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.  HOME EQUITY LOAN PORTFOLIO  Our home equity loan portfolio totaled $35.9 billion as of March 31, 2014, or 18% of the total loan portfolio. Of that total, $21.3 billion, or 59%, was outstanding under primarily variable-rate home equity lines of credit and $14.6 billion, or 41%, consisted of closed-end home equity installment loans. Approximately 3% of the home equity portfolio was on nonperforming status as of March 31, 2014.  As of March 31, 2014, we are in an originated first lien position for approximately 49% of the total portfolio and, where originated as a second lien, we currently hold or service the first lien position for approximately an additional 2% of the portfolio. Historically, we have originated and sold first lien residential real estate mortgages, which resulted in a low percentage of home equity loans where we hold the first lien mortgage position. The remaining 49% of the portfolio was secured by second liens where we do not hold the first lien position. The credit performance of the majority of the home equity portfolio where we are in, hold or service the first lien position, is superior to the portion of the portfolio where we hold the second lien position but do not hold the first lien.  Lien position information is generally based upon original LTV at the time of origination. However, after origination PNC is not typically notified when a senior lien position that is not held by PNC is satisfied. Therefore, information about the current lien status of junior lien loans is less readily available in cases where PNC does not also hold the senior lien. Additionally, PNC is not typically notified when a junior lien position is added after origination of a PNC first lien. This   updated information for both junior and senior liens must be obtained from external sources, and therefore, PNC has contracted with an industry leading third-party service provider to obtain updated loan, lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and private sources.  We track borrower performance monthly, including obtaining original LTVs, updated FICO scores at least quarterly, updated LTVs semi-annually, and other credit metrics at least quarterly, including the historical performance of any mortgage loans regardless of lien position that we do or do not hold. This information is used for internal reporting and risk management. For internal reporting and risk management we also segment the population into pools based on product type (e.g., home equity loans, brokered home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, brokered home equity lines of credit). As part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring, we segment the home equity portfolio based upon the delinquency, modification status and bankruptcy status of these loans, as well as the delinquency, modification status and bankruptcy status of any mortgage loan with the same borrower (regardless of whether it is a first lien senior to our second lien).  In establishing our ALLL for non-impaired loans, we utilize a delinquency roll-rate methodology for pools of loans. In accordance with accounting principles, under this methodology, we establish our allowance based upon incurred losses and not lifetime expected losses. We also consider the incremental expected losses when home equity lines of credit transition from interest-only products to principal and interest products in establishing our ALLL. The roll-rate methodology estimates transition/roll of loan balances from one delinquency state (e.g., 30-59 days past due) to another delinquency state (e.g., 60-89 days past due) and ultimately to charge-off. The roll through to charge-off is based on PNC’s actual loss experience for each type of pool. Since a pool may consist of first and second liens, the charge-off amounts for the pool are proportionate to the composition of first and     38 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q      second liens in the pool. Our experience has been that the ratio of first to second lien loans has been consistent over time and is appropriately represented in our pools used for roll-rate calculations.  Generally, our variable-rate home equity lines of credit have either a seven or ten year draw period, followed by a 20-year amortization term. During the draw period, we have home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay interest only and home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay principal and interest. We view home equity lines of credit where borrowers are paying principal and interest under the draw period as less risky than those where the borrowers are paying interest only, as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments. The risk associated with our home equity lines of credit end of period draw dates is considered in establishing our ALLL. Based upon outstanding balances at March 31, 2014, the following table presents the periods when home equity lines of credit draw periods are scheduled to end.  Table 37: Home Equity Lines of Credit – Draw Period End Dates                In millions   Interest OnlyProduct     Principal andInterest Product     Remainder of 2014   $ 1,394     $ 337     2015     1,781       608     2016     1,479       474     2017     2,656       643     2018     1,168       873     2019 and thereafter     3,846       4,676     Total (a) (b)   $ 12,324     $ 7,611      (a) Includes all home equity lines of credit that mature in the remainder of 2014 or later, including those with borrowers where we have terminated borrowing privileges.    (b) Includes approximately $141 million, $187 million, $52 million, $62 million, $45 million and $561 million of home equity lines of credit with balloon payments, including those where we have terminated borrowing privileges, with draw periods scheduled to end in the remainder of 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019 and thereafter, respectively.  Based upon outstanding balances, and excluding purchased impaired loans, at March 31, 2014, for home equity lines of credit for which the borrower can no longer draw (e.g., draw period has ended or borrowing privileges have been terminated), approximately 3.37% were 30-89 days past due and approximately 5.61% were 90 days or more past due. Generally, when a borrower becomes 60 days past due, we terminate borrowing privileges and those privileges are not subsequently reinstated. At that point, we continue our collection/recovery processes, which may include a loss mitigation loan modification resulting in a loan that is classified as a TDR.  See Note 4 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report for additional information.  LOAN MODIFICATIONS AND TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS  CONSUMER LOAN MODIFICATIONS  We modify loans under government and PNC-developed programs based upon our commitment to help eligible homeowners and borrowers avoid foreclosure, where appropriate. Initially, a borrower is evaluated for a modification under a government program. If a borrower does not qualify under a government program, the borrower is then evaluated under a PNC program. Our programs utilize both temporary and permanent modifications and typically reduce the interest rate, extend the term and/or defer principal. Temporary and permanent modifications under programs involving a change to loan terms are generally classified as TDRs. Further, certain payment plans and trial payment arrangements which do not include a contractual change to loan terms may be classified as TDRs. Additional detail on TDRs is discussed below as well as in Note 4 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report.  A temporary modification, with a term between 3 and 24 months, involves a change in original loan terms for a period of time and reverts to a calculated exit rate for the remaining term of the loan as of a specific date. A permanent modification, with a term greater than 24 months, is a modification in which the terms of the original loan are changed. Permanent modifications primarily include the government-created Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) or PNC-developed HAMP-like modification programs.  For home equity lines of credit, we will enter into a temporary modification when the borrower has indicated a temporary hardship and a willingness to bring current the delinquent loan balance. Examples of this situation often include delinquency due to illness or death in the family or loss of employment. Permanent modifications are entered into when it is confirmed that the borrower does not possess the income necessary to continue making loan payments at the current amount, but our expectation is that payments at lower amounts can be made.  We also monitor the success rates and delinquency status of our loan modification programs to assess their effectiveness in serving our customers’ needs while mitigating credit losses. Table 38 provides the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified consumer real estate related loans and Table 39 provides the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified loans that were 60 days or more past due as of six months, nine months, twelve months and fifteen months after the modification date.

The data in this table represents loan modifications completed during the quarters ending September 30, 2012 through September 30, 2013 and represents a vintage look at all quarterly accounts and the number of those modified accounts (for each quarterly vintage) 60 days or more delinquent at six, nine, twelve, and fifteen months after modification. Account totals include active and inactive accounts that were delinquent when they achieved inactive status. Accounts that are no longer 60 days or more delinquent, or were re-modified since prior period, are removed from re-default status in the period they are cured or re-modified.    (b) Vintage refers to the quarter in which the modification occurred.    (c) Reflects March 31, 2014 unpaid principal balances of the re-defaulted accounts for the Third Quarter 2013 Vintage at Six Months, for the Second Quarter 2013 Vintage at Nine Months, for the First Quarter 2013 Vintage at Twelve Months, and for the Fourth Quarter 2012 and prior Vintages at Fifteen Months.    In addition to temporary loan modifications, we may make available to a borrower a payment plan or a HAMP trial payment period. Under a payment plan or a HAMP trial payment period, there is no change to the loan’s contractual terms so the borrower remains legally responsible for payment of the loan under its original terms.  Payment plans may include extensions, re-ages and/or forbearance plans. All payment plans bring an account current once certain requirements are achieved and are primarily intended to demonstrate a borrower’s renewed willingness and ability to re-pay. Due to the short term nature of the payment plan, there is a minimal impact to the ALLL.  Under a HAMP trial payment period, we establish an alternate payment, generally at an amount less than the contractual payment amount, for the borrower during this short time period. This allows a borrower to demonstrate successful payment performance before permanently restructuring the loan into a HAMP modification. Subsequent to successful borrower performance under the trial payment period, we will capitalize the original contractual amount past due and restructure the loan’s contractual terms, along with bringing the restructured account to current. As the borrower is often already delinquent at the time of participation in the HAMP trial payment period, there is not a significant increase in the ALLL. If the trial payment period is unsuccessful, the loan will be evaluated for further action based upon our existing policies.  Residential conforming and certain residential construction loans have been permanently modified under HAMP or, if they do not qualify for a HAMP modification, under PNC-developed programs, which in some cases may operate similarly to HAMP. These programs first require a reduction of the interest rate followed by an extension of term and, if appropriate, deferral of principal payments. As of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, 6,262 accounts with a balance of $.9 billion and 5,834 accounts with a balance of $.9 billion, respectively, of residential real estate loans had been modified under HAMP and were still outstanding on our balance sheet.  We do not re-modify a defaulted modified loan except for subsequent significant life events, as defined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). A modified loan   continues to be classified as a TDR for the remainder of its term regardless of subsequent payment performance.  COMMERCIAL LOAN MODIFICATIONS AND PAYMENT PLANS  Modifications of terms for commercial loans are based on individual facts and circumstances. Commercial loan modifications may involve reduction of the interest rate, extension of the term of the loan and/or forgiveness of principal. Modified commercial loans are usually already nonperforming prior to modification. We evaluate these modifications for TDR classification based upon whether we granted a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Additional detail on TDRs is discussed below as well as in Note 4 Asset Quality in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements of this Report.  We have established certain commercial loan modification and payment programs for small business loans, Small Business Administration loans, and investment real estate loans. As of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, $44 million and $47 million, respectively, in loan balances were covered under these modification and payment plan programs. Of these loan balances, $15 million and $16 million have been determined to be TDRs as of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.  TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS  A TDR is a loan whose terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. TDRs result from our loss mitigation activities and include rate reductions, principal forgiveness, postponement/reduction of scheduled amortization and extensions, which are intended to minimize economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of collateral. Additionally, TDRs also result from borrowers that have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to PNC. For the three months ended March 31, 2014, $.3 billion of loans held for sale, loans accounted for under the fair value option and pooled purchased impaired loans, as well as certain consumer government insured or guaranteed loans, were excluded from the TDR population. The comparable amount for the three months ended March 31, 2013 was $.7 billion.

Loans where borrowers have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to PNC are not returned to accrual status.  Total TDRs decreased $26 million, or 1%, during the first three months of 2014. Nonperforming TDRs totaled $1.4 billion, which represents approximately 48% of total nonperforming loans.  TDRs that are performing, including credit card loans, are excluded from nonperforming loans. Generally, these loans have been returned to performing status as the borrowers have been performing under the restructured terms for at least six consecutive months. These TDRs increased $80 million, or 7%, during 2014 to $1.3 billion as of March 31, 2014. This increase reflects the further seasoning and performance of the TDRs. Loans where borrowers have been discharged from personal liability through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not formally reaffirmed their loan obligations to PNC are not returned to accrual status.

ALLOWANCES FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES AND UNFUNDED LOAN COMMITMENTS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT  We recorded $186 million in net charge-offs for the first three months of 2014, compared to $456 million in the first three months of 2013. Commercial lending net charge-offs decreased from $121 million in the first three months of 2013 to $31 million in the first three months of 2014. Consumer lending net charge-offs decreased from $335 million, which included $134 million due to the impact of alignment with interagency supervisory guidance, in the first three months of 2013 to $155 million in the first three months of 2014.

This treatment also results in a lower ratio of net charge-offs to average loans. See Note 5 Purchased Loans   in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for additional information on net charge-offs related to these loans.     42 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q     We maintain an ALLL to absorb losses from the loan and lease portfolio and determine this allowance based on quarterly assessments of the estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolio. We maintain the ALLL at a level that we believe to be appropriate to absorb estimated probable credit losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The reserve calculation and determination process is dependent on the use of key assumptions. Key reserve assumptions and estimation processes react to and are influenced by observed changes in loan and lease portfolio performance experience, the financial strength of the borrower, and economic conditions. Key reserve assumptions are periodically updated.  We establish specific allowances for loans considered impaired using methods prescribed by GAAP. All impaired loans are subject to individual analysis, except leases and large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans which may include, but are not limited to, credit card, residential mortgage and consumer installment loans. Specific allowances for individual loans (including commercial and consumer TDRs) are determined based on an analysis of the present value of expected future cash flows from the loans discounted at their effective interest rate, observable market price or the fair value of the underlying collateral.  Reserves allocated to non-impaired commercial loan classes are based on PD and LGD credit risk ratings.  Our commercial pool reserve methodology is sensitive to changes in key risk parameters such as PD and LGD. The results of these parameters are then applied to the loan balance and unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit to determine the amount of the respective reserves. Our PDs and LGDs are primarily determined using internal commercial loan loss data. This internal data is supplemented with third-party data and management judgment, as deemed necessary. We continue to evaluate and enhance our use of internal commercial loss data and will periodically update our PDs and LGDs, as well as consider third-party data, regulatory guidance and management judgment. In general, a given change in any of the major risk parameters will have a corresponding change in the pool reserve allocations for non-impaired commercial loans.  The majority of the commercial portfolio is secured by collateral, including loans to asset-based lending customers that continue to show demonstrably lower LGD. Further, the large investment grade or equivalent portion of the loan portfolio has performed well and has not been subject to significant deterioration. Additionally, guarantees on loans greater than $1 million and owner guarantees for small business loans do not significantly impact our ALLL.  Allocations to non-impaired consumer loan classes are based upon a roll-rate model which uses statistical relationships, calculated from historical data that estimate the movement of loan outstandings through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge-off.  A portion of the ALLL is related to qualitative and measurement factors. These factors may include, but are not limited to, the following:      •    Industry concentrations and conditions,      •    Recent credit quality trends,      •    Recent loss experience in particular portfolios,      •    Recent macro-economic factors,      •    Model imprecision,      •    Changes in lending policies and procedures,      •    Timing of available information, including the performance of first lien positions, and      •    Limitations of available historical data.  Purchased impaired loans are initially recorded at fair value and applicable accounting guidance prohibits the carry over or creation of valuation allowances at acquisition. Because the initial fair values of these loans already reflect a credit component, additional reserves are established when performance is expected to be worse than our expectations as of the acquisition date. At March 31, 2014, we had established reserves of $.9 billion for purchased impaired loans. In addition, loans (purchased impaired and non-impaired) acquired after January 1, 2009 were recorded at fair value. No allowance for loan losses was carried over and no allowance was created at the date of acquisition. See Note 5 Purchased Loans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for additional information.  In addition to the ALLL, we maintain an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. We report this allowance as a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We maintain the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit at a level we believe is appropriate to absorb estimated probable losses on these unfunded credit facilities. We determine this amount using estimates of the probability of the ultimate funding and losses related to those credit exposures. Other than the estimation of the probability of funding, this methodology is very similar to the one we use for determining our ALLL.  We refer you to Note 4 Asset Quality and Note 6 Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for further information on certain key asset quality indicators that we use to evaluate our portfolio and establish the allowances.

The provision for credit losses totaled $94 million for the first three months of 2014 compared to $236 million for the first three months of 2013. The primary driver of the decrease to the provision was improved overall credit quality, including improved commercial loan risk factors, lower consumer loan delinquencies, and the increasing value of residential real estate, which resulted in greater expected cash flows for our purchased impaired loans. For the first three months of 2014, the provision for commercial lending credit losses decreased by $37 million, or 67%, from the first three months of 2013. The provision for consumer lending credit losses decreased $105 million, or 58%, from the first three months of 2013.  At March 31, 2014, total ALLL to total nonperforming loans was 120%. The comparable amount for December 31, 2013 was 117%. These ratios are 76% and 72%, respectively, when excluding the $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, of ALLL at March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 allocated to consumer loans and lines of credit not secured by residential real estate and purchased impaired loans. We have excluded consumer loans and lines of credit not secured by real estate as they are charged off after 120 to 180 days past due and not placed on nonperforming status. Additionally, we have excluded purchased impaired loans as they are considered performing regardless of their delinquency status as interest is accreted based on our estimate of expected cash flows and additional allowance is recorded when these cash flows are below recorded investment. See Table 31 within this Credit Risk Management section for additional information.  The ALLL balance increases or decreases across periods in relation to fluctuating risk factors, including asset quality trends, charge-offs and changes in aggregate portfolio balances. During the first three months of 2014, improving asset quality trends, including, but not limited to, delinquency status and improving economic conditions, realization of previously estimated losses through charge-offs and overall portfolio growth, combined to result in the ALLL balance declining $.1 billion, or 2% to $3.5 billion as of March 31, 2014 compared to December 31, 2013.  See Note 6 Allowances for Loan and Lease Losses and Unfunded Loan Commitments and Letters of Credit and Note 5 Purchased Loans in the Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Report regarding changes in the ALLL and in the allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit.  LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT  Liquidity risk has two fundamental components. The first is potential loss assuming we were unable to meet our funding requirements at a reasonable cost. The second is the potential inability to operate our businesses because adequate contingent liquidity is not available in a stressed environment. We manage liquidity risk at the consolidated company level (bank, parent company, and nonbank subsidiaries combined) to help ensure that we can obtain cost-effective funding to meet current and future obligations under both normal “business as usual” and stressful circumstances, and to help ensure that we maintain an appropriate level of contingent liquidity.  Management monitors liquidity through a series of early warning indicators that may indicate a potential market, or PNC-specific, liquidity stress event. In addition, management performs a set of liquidity stress tests over multiple time horizons with varying levels of severity and maintains a contingency funding plan to address a potential stress event. In the most severe liquidity stress simulation, we assume that PNC’s liquidity position is under pressure, while the market in general is under systemic pressure. The simulation considers, among other things, the impact of restricted access to both secured and unsecured external sources of funding, accelerated run-off of customer deposits, valuation pressure on assets and heavy demand to fund contingent obligations. Risk limits are established within our Enterprise Capital and Liquidity Management Policy. Management’s Asset and Liability Committee and the Board of Directors’ Risk Committee regularly review compliance with the established limits.  Parent company liquidity guidelines are designed to help ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet our parent company obligations over the succeeding 24-month period. Risk limits for parent company liquidity are established within our Enterprise Capital and Liquidity Management Policy.     44 The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q      Management’s Asset and Liability Committee and the Board of Directors’ Risk Committee regularly review compliance with the established limits.  BANK LEVEL LIQUIDITY – USES  At the bank level, primary contractual obligations include funding loan commitments, satisfying deposit withdrawal requests and maturities and debt service related to bank borrowings. As of March 31, 2014, there were approximately $9.6 billion of bank borrowings with contractual maturities of less than one year. We also maintain adequate bank liquidity to meet future potential loan demand and provide for other business needs, as necessary. See the Bank Level Liquidity – Sources section below.  BANK LEVEL LIQUIDITY – SOURCES  Our largest source of bank liquidity on a consolidated basis is the deposit base that comes from our retail and commercial businesses. Total deposits increased to $222.4 billion at March 31, 2014 from $220.9 billion at December 31, 2013, primarily driven by growth in transactions deposits. Assets determined by PNC to be liquid (liquid assets) and unused borrowing capacity from a number of sources are also available to maintain our liquidity position. Borrowed funds come from a diverse mix of short and long-term funding sources.  At March 31, 2014, our liquid assets consisted of short-term investments (Federal funds sold, resale agreements, trading securities and interest-earning deposits with banks) totaling $18.4 billion and securities available for sale totaling $47.5 billion. Of our total liquid assets of $65.9 billion, we had $17.3 billion pledged as collateral for borrowings, trust, and other commitments. The level of liquid assets fluctuates over time based on many factors, including market conditions, loan and deposit growth and balance sheet management activities.  In addition to the customer deposit base, which has historically provided the single largest source of relatively stable and low-cost funding, the bank also obtains liquidity through the issuance of traditional forms of funding including long-term debt (senior notes and subordinated debt and FHLB advances) and short-term borrowings (Federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, commercial paper issuances and other short-term borrowings).  On January 16, 2014, PNC Bank, N.A. established a new bank note program under which it may from time to time offer up to $25 billion aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding of its unsecured senior and subordinated notes due more than nine months from their date of issue (in the case of senior notes) and due five years or more from their date of issue (in the case of subordinated notes). The $25 billion of notes authorized to be issued and outstanding at any one time includes notes issued by PNC Bank, N.A. prior to January 16, 2014 under the 2004 bank note program and those notes PNC Bank, N.A. has acquired through the acquisition of other   banks, in each case for so long as such notes remain outstanding. The terms of the new program do not affect any of the bank notes issued prior to January 16, 2014. At March 31, 2014, PNC Bank, N.A. had $14.2 billion of bank notes outstanding including the following issued during 2014:      •    $750 million of senior notes with a maturity date of January 28, 2019. Interest is payable semi-annually, at a fixed rate of 2.200% on January 28 and July 28 of each year, beginning on July 28, 2014,      •    $1.0 billion of senior notes with a maturity date of January 27, 2017. Interest is payable semi-annually, at a fixed rate of 1.125% on January 27 and July 27 of each year, beginning on July 27, 2014, and      •    $1.0 billion of senior extendible floating rate bank notes issued to an affiliate with an initial maturity date of April 15, 2015, subject to the holder’s monthly option to extend, and a final maturity date of April 15, 2016. Interest is payable at the 3-month LIBOR rate, reset quarterly, plus a spread of .235%, which spread is subject to four potential one basis point increases in the event of certain extensions of maturity by the holder. Interest is payable on January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2014.  Total senior and subordinated debt of PNC Bank, N.A. increased to $15.5 billion at March 31, 2014 from $14.6 billion at December 31, 2013 primarily due to $2.8 billion in new borrowing less $1.9 billion in calls and maturities.  PNC Bank, N.A. is a member of the FHLB-Pittsburgh and, as such, has access to advances from FHLB-Pittsburgh secured generally by residential mortgage loans, other mortgage-related loans and commercial mortgage-backed securities. At March 31, 2014, our unused secured borrowing capacity was $12.3 billion with FHLB-Pittsburgh. Total FHLB borrowings increased to $13.9 billion at March 31, 2014 from $12.9 billion at December 31, 2013 due to $4.0 billion of new issuances offset by $3.0 billion in calls and maturities. The FHLB-Pittsburgh also periodically provides standby letters of credit on behalf of PNC Bank, N.A. to secure certain public deposits. PNC Bank, N.A. began using standby letters of credit issued by the FHLB-Pittsburgh in response to anticipated short-term regulatory standards. If the FHLB-Pittsburgh is required to make payment for a beneficiary’s draw, the payment amount is converted into a collateralized advance to PNC Bank, N.A. At both March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, standby letters of credit issued on our behalf by the FHLB-Pittsburgh totaled $6.2 billion.  PNC Bank, N.A. has the ability to offer up to $10.0 billion of its commercial paper to provide additional liquidity. As of March 31, 2014, there was $4.9 billion outstanding under this program. During the fourth quarter of 2013, PNC finalized the wind down of Market Street Funding LLC (“Market Street”), a multi-seller asset-backed commercial paper conduit administered by PNC Bank, N.A. As part of the wind down     The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. – Form 10-Q 45      process, the commitments and outstanding loans of Market Street were assigned to PNC Bank, N.A., which will fund these commitments and loans by utilizing its diversified funding sources. In conjunction with the assignment of commitments and loans, the associated liquidity facilities were terminated along with the program-level credit enhancement provided to Market Street. The wind down did not have a material impact to PNC’s financial condition or results of operation.  PNC Bank, N.A. can also borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s (Federal Reserve Bank) discount window to meet short-term liquidity requirements. The Federal Reserve Bank, however, is not viewed as the primary means of funding our routine business activities, but rather as a potential source of liquidity in a stressed environment or during a market disruption. These potential borrowings are secured by commercial loans. At March 31, 2014, our unused secured borrowing capacity was $20.2 billion with the Federal Reserve Bank.  PARENT COMPANY LIQUIDITY – USES  The parent company’s contractual obligations consist primarily of debt service related to parent company borrowings and funding non-bank affiliates. As of March 31, 2014, there were approximately $2.3 billion of parent company borrowings with maturities of less than one year.  Additionally, the parent company maintains adequate liquidity to fund discretionary activities such as paying dividends to PNC shareholders, share repurchases, and acquisitions. See the Parent Company Liquidity – Sources section below.  See Capital and Liquidity Actions in the Executive Summary section of this Financial Review for information on our 2014 capital plan that was accepted by the Federal Reserve, which included certain share repurchases under PNC’s existing common stock repurchase authorization and the dividend increase described below.  On April 3, 2014, consistent with our 2014 capital plan, our Board of Directors approved an increase to PNC’s quarterly common stock dividend from 44 cents per common share to 48 cents per common share. For the second quarter of 2014, the increased dividend was payable to shareholders of record at the close of business on April 15, 2014 and was paid on May 5, 2014.  See the Supervision and Regulation section of Item 1 Business in our 2013 Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Federal Reserve’s CCAR process and the factors the Federal Reserve takes into consideration in evaluating capital plans, as well as for information on new qualitative and quantitative liquidity risk management standards proposed by the U.S. banking agencies.  During 2014, the parent company used cash for the following:      •    On March 28, 2014, we used $1.0 billion of parent company cash to purchase senior extendible floating rate bank notes issued by PNC Bank, N.A., and      •    In March 2014, PNC repurchased $50 million of common shares to mitigate the financial impact of employee benefit plan transactions, as described in more detail in Item 2 Unregistered Sales Of Equity Securities And Use of Proceeds
