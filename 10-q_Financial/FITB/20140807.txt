Risk Factors (Item 1A)  The following is an addition to the risk factors as previously disclosed in the Registrant’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013:  Changes in retail distribution strategies and consumer behavior may adversely impact Fifth Third’s investments in its bank premises and equipment and other assets and may lead to increased expenditures to change its retail distribution channel  Fifth Third has significant investments in bank premises and equipment for its branch network including its 1,309 full service banking centers, 95 parcels of land held for the development of future banking centers, as well as its retail work force and other branch banking assets. Advances in technology such as e-commerce, telephone, internet and mobile banking, and in-branch self-service technologies including automatic teller machines and other equipment, as well as changing customer preferences for these other methods of accessing Fifth Third’s products and services, could decrease the value of Fifth Third’s branch network or other retail distribution assets and may cause it to change its retail distribution strategy, close and/or sell certain branches or parcels of land held for development and restructure or reduce its remaining branches and work force. These actions could lead to losses on these assets or could adversely impact the carrying value of any long-lived assets and may lead to increased expenditures to renovate and reconfigure remaining branches or to otherwise reform its retail distribution channel. In the second quarter of 2014, Fifth Third recorded a $17 million impairment loss for branches and land upon which it no longer expects to build branches and may incur additional adjustments, expenses or losses in the future on other parcels of land or on existing banking centers or other branch banking assets.
