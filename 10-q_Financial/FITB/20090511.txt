Risk Factors (Item 1A)  The following are changes or additions to the risk factors as previously disclosed in the Registrant’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008.  The Bancorp is required to increase its common equity capital based upon the results of the Federal Reserve’s assessment of the Bancorp’s capital under the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program.  As described below under Part II, “Other Information (Item 5),” pursuant to Treasury’s Capital Assistance Program (the “CAP”), the Bancorp, along with the other domestic bank holding companies with assets of more than $100 billion at December 31, 2008, was subject to a forward-looking stress test called the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (the “SCAP”).  The SCAP results indicated that under the more adverse scenario, the Bancorp would need to improve its Tier 1 common equity by an increase of $1.1 billion. Institutions subject to the SCAP that require additional capital, or that need to improve the quality of their capital, must agree to augment their capital. The Bancorp has six months to raise the capital from private sources.  The Bancorp is considering all of its available options to meet these capital requirements. Such options include, but are not limited to, exchanging or repurchasing certain securities issued by the Bancorp or its affiliates, redeeming all or a portion of the preferred stock issued to Treasury in December, 2008 pursuant to the Capital Purchase Program and issuing CAP preferred stock to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, issuing additional equity, or the potential sale of certain non-strategic assets, including available for sale securities held in a gain position, or any combination of these options.  The issuance of capital required under the SCAP may include terms unfavorable to existing shareholders.  If the Bancorp is unable to meet the capital obligations required by the SCAP through private sources, it will issue mandatorily convertible preferred stock and warrants for common stock to Treasury, subject to potential shareholder approval if the amount of common stock issued upon exercise of the CAP preferred stock or exercise of the warrant would equal or exceed 20 percent or more of the common stock outstanding. The announced terms of the CAP preferred stock include features that may be unfavorable to the Bancorp’s existing shareholders. Pursuant to the terms of the CAP, so long as Treasury owns either CAP shares or common stock issued under the CAP, the issuing institution may not declare or pay dividends greater than $0.01 per share per quarter without Treasury’s consent. In addition, the participant must submit a plan for how they intend to use the capital to support lending. These plans will be made public upon completion of the capital investment. The participants must also submit ongoing monthly reports to the Treasury that break out lending by category and show how many new loans they provided and how many ABS and mortgage-backed securities they purchased, with a description of the lending environment in the markets they serve. The reports, which will be made public, must include a comparison to an estimate of what lending activity would have been without government capital assistance. Participating institutions will be subject to rules, regulations and Treasury guidance with respect to executive compensation, transparency, accountability and monitoring, as published and in effect at the time of the investment closing. Refer to Part II, “Other Information (Item 5)” for additional information related to the CAP.  The actions the Bancorp may take to increase its common equity capital may be significantly dilutive to existing shareholders.  Based on its SCAP results, the Bancorp needs to improve its Tier 1 common equity by an increase of $1.1 billion. The Bancorp is considering all of its available options to meet this requirement. Such options include, but are not limited to, exchanging or repurchasing certain securities issued by the Bancorp or its affiliates, redeeming all or a portion of the preferred stock issued to Treasury in December, 2008 pursuant to the Capital Purchase Program and issuing CAP preferred stock, issuing additional equity, or the potential sale of certain non-strategic assets, including available for sale securities held in a gain position, or any combination of these options. The issuance of capital under the CAP or under alternative private sources could significantly dilute current shareholders’ ownership interests. If the Bancorp issues CAP preferred stock in the amount of $1.1 billion, based on the exercise price of the CAP preferred stock of $3.22, the Bancorp would issue approximately 342 million shares of common stock upon conversion of the CAP preferred stock which represents approximately 59% of the Bancorp’s shares of common stock outstanding at March 31, 2009. Depending on the manner and terms of raising capital from private sources, a similar dilutive effect could result even if the Bancorp would not participate in the CAP at all.    75    Table of Contents The Bancorp entered into a definitive agreement to sell an interest in its processing business and may not be able to generate gains on sale or related increase in shareholders’ equity commensurate with desirable levels. Moreover, the loss of income from the sale of the interest could have an adverse effect on the Bancorp’s earnings and future growth.  On March 30, 2009, the Bancorp and Advent International (Advent) announced that they entered into a master investment agreement pursuant to which Advent will purchase a majority interest in the Bancorp’s processing business. The Bancorp will retain a 49% interest in the processing business. The joint venture involves the Bancorp Processing Solutions’ merchant acquiring and financial institutions processing businesses (the “Processing Business”). The Bancorp will retain its credit card issuing business.  The transaction is currently expected to close in the second quarter of 2009 and is subject to regulatory approval. The Bancorp is subject to market forces that may make completion of the sale unsuccessful or may hinder the ability to do so within a desirable time frame. If the Bancorp is able to complete the sale, it may not be able to fully achieve its strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies. The Bancorp may have difficulty separating the operations of the Processing Business and achieve lower than expected gains related to the sale of the business. In addition, the Bancorp may suffer the loss of income from the sold portion of the Processing Business and such loss of income could have an adverse effect on its future earnings and growth.  If the Bancorp is not able to complete the sale of its Processing Business to Advent, the Bancorp will need to replace the anticipated capital benefit expected from the sale and such alternative capital will likely be on less desirable terms than capital from the sale of the Processing Business.  The Bancorp’ sale of its Processing Business to Advent is expected to contribute significantly to its capital levels by increasing the Bancorp’s Tier 1 common equity by an estimated $1.6 billion.  The results of the SCAP included the anticipated capital benefit of the transaction with Advent. Therefore, if the transaction with Advent does not close or does not close in the desired timeframe, the Bancorp must find an alternative source of capital to achieve the estimated common equity capital benefit of $1.6 billion from the transaction. Such alternative sources of capital will likely have a more dilutive effect on existing shareholders.  In addition, if the Bancorp is unable to complete the sale of its Processing Business to Advent, the price of the Bancorp’s common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the deal will close.  Legislative or regulatory compliance, changes or actions or significant litigation, could adversely impact the Bancorp or the businesses in which the Bancorp is engaged.  The Bancorp is subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of its operations and limit the businesses in which the Bancorp may engage. These laws and regulations may change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers, depositors and the deposit insurance funds. The impact of any changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies may negatively impact the Bancorp or its ability to increase the value of its business. Additionally, actions by regulatory agencies or significant litigation against the Bancorp could cause it to devote significant time and resources to defending itself and may lead to penalties that materially affect the Bancorp and its shareholders. Future changes in the laws, including tax laws, or, as a participant in the Capital Purchase Program under EESA, the rules and regulations promulgated under EESA or ARRA, or regulations or their interpretations or enforcement may also be materially adverse to the Bancorp and its shareholders or may require the Bancorp to expend significant time and resources to comply with such requirements.  The Bancorp’s business, financial condition and results of operations are highly regulated and could be adversely affected by new or changed regulations and by the manner in which such regulations are applied by regulatory authorities.  Current economic conditions, particularly in the financial markets, have resulted in government regulatory agencies placing increased focus on and scrutiny of the financial services industry. The U.S. Government has intervened on an unprecedented scale, responding to what has been commonly referred to as the financial crisis. In addition to participating in Treasury’s CPP and CAP, the U.S. Government has taken steps that include enhancing the liquidity support available to financial institutions, establishing a commercial paper funding facility, temporarily guaranteeing money market funds and certain types of debt issuances, and increasing insured deposits. These programs subject the Bancorp and other financial institutions who have participated in these programs to additional restrictions, oversight and/or costs that may have an impact on the Bancorp’s business, financial condition, results of operations or the price of its common stock.  Compliance with such regulation and scrutiny may significantly increase the Bancorp’s costs, impede the efficiency of its internal business processes, require it to increase its regulatory capital and limit its ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. The Bancorp also will be required to pay significantly higher FDIC premiums because market developments have significantly depleted the insurance fund of the FDIC and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits. The increased costs associated with anticipated regulatory and political scrutiny could adversely impact the Bancorp’s results of operations.  New proposals for legislation continue to be introduced in the U.S. Congress that could further substantially increase regulation of the financial services industry. Federal and state regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their regulations and/or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. The Bancorp cannot predict whether any pending or future legislation will be adopted or the substance and impact of any such new legislation on the Bancorp. Additional regulation could affect the Bancorp in a substantial way and could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.    76    Table of Contents The Bancorp and/or the holders of its securities could be adversely affected by unfavorable ratings from rating agencies.  The Bancorp’s ability to access the capital markets is important to its overall funding profile. This access is affected by the ratings assigned by rating agencies to the Bancorp, certain of its affiliates and particular classes of securities they issue. The interest rates that the Bancorp pays on its securities are also influenced by, among other things, the credit ratings that it, its affiliates and/or its securities receive from recognized rating agencies. A downgrade to the Bancorp’s, or its affiliates’, credit rating could affect its ability to access the capital markets, increase its borrowing costs and negatively impact its profitability. A ratings downgrade to the Bancorp, its affiliates or their securities could also create obligations or liabilities to the Bancorp under the terms of its outstanding securities that could increase the Bancorp’s costs or otherwise have a negative effect on the Bancorp’s results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, a downgrade of the credit rating of any particular security issued by the Bancorp or its affiliates could negatively affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities and the prices at which any such securities may be sold. On April 14, 2009, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the Bancorp’s issuer rating to “Baa1” from “A2” and downgraded the long term debt rating and deposit ratings for the Bancorp’s Ohio and Michigan bank subsidiaries to “A2” from “A1.”  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds (Item 2)  Refer to the “Capital Management” section within Management’s Discussion and Analysis in Part I, Item 3 for information regarding purchases of equity securities by the Bancorp during the first quarter of 2009.  Defaults Upon Senior Securities (Item 3)  None.  Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders (Item 4)  On April 21, 2009, the Bancorp held its Annual Meeting of Shareholders for which the Board of Directors solicited proxies. At the Annual Meeting, the shareholders voted on the following proposals stated in the Proxy Statement dated March 10, 2009, which is incorporated by reference herein.  The proposals voted on and approved or disapproved by the shareholders at the Annual Meeting were as follows:        1.

Other Information (Item 5)  Market Developments and Economic Conditions.  In recent periods, United States and global markets have experienced severe disruption and volatility, and general economic conditions have declined significantly. Adverse developments in credit quality, asset values and revenue opportunities throughout the financial services industry, as well as general uncertainty regarding the economic, industry and regulatory environment, have had a marked negative impact on the industry. These developments and conditions have also negatively impacted the financial position and results of operations of the Bancorp.  The United States and the governments of other countries have taken steps to try to stabilize the financial system, including investing in financial institutions, and have also been working to design and implement programs to improve general economic conditions. Notwithstanding the actions of the United States and other governments, there can be no assurances that these efforts will be successful in restoring industry, economic or market conditions and that they will not result in adverse unintended consequences. Factors that could continue to pressure financial services companies, including the Bancorp, are numerous and include (1) continued or worsening credit quality, (2) continued or worsening disruption and volatility in financial markets, (3) limitations resulting from or imposed in connection with governmental actions intended to stabilize or provide additional regulation of the financial system and (4) recessionary conditions that are deeper or last longer than currently anticipated, whether nationally or within all or a portion of the Bancorp’s geographic footprint.  Supervisory Capital Assessment Program  On February 10, 2009, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) announced a new financial stability plan (the “Financial Stability Plan”), which builds upon existing programs and earmarks the second $350 billion of unused funds originally authorized under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA). Pursuant to the Financial Stability Plan’s new Capital Assistance Program (the “CAP”), the Bancorp, along with the other domestic bank holding companies with assets of more than $100 billion at December 31, 2008, was subject to a forward-looking stress test called the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (the “SCAP”). The SCAP exam evaluated the projected level and quality of each institution’s capital during specified economic scenarios through the end of 2010, which included a baseline scenario, reflecting a consensus estimate of private-sector forecasters, and a more adverse scenario, reflecting an economic situation more severe than is generally anticipated. The process and methodologies used by the federal banking supervisory agencies under the SCAP are described in a white paper released by the Federal Reserve on April 24, 2009 and available on its website at www.federalreserve.gov.  The U.S. financial and regulatory authorities publicly announced the results of the SCAP examinations for the 19 domestic bank holding companies subject to the exam on May 7, 2009. Also on May 7, 2009, the Bancorp publicly announced specific information related to its SCAP results. The SCAP results indicated that under the more adverse scenario, the Bancorp would need to improve its Tier 1 common equity by an increase of $1.1 billion.  Institutions subject to the SCAP that require additional capital, or that need to improve the quality of their capital, must agree to augment their capital. The Bancorp has six months to raise the capital from private sources or take an investment from the Treasury under CAP in mandatorily convertible preferred stock (CAP shares). The Bancorp currently believes that there are a number of other options available to it that could generate substantial amounts of Tier 1 common equity, summarized below, which may reduce or even eliminate any capital required to be issued under the CAP program. If the Bancorp does not satisfy all of the SCAP capital requirements through private sources, it anticipates issuing CAP shares within six months, subject to potential shareholder approval if the amount of common stock issued upon exercise of the CAP shares or exercise of the warrants would equal or exceed 20 percent or more of the common stock outstanding.  The options the Bancorp anticipates evaluating include the potential sale of certain non-strategic assets, including available for sale securities held in a gain position. The Bancorp will also evaluate transactions involving the issuance of cash, common stock or other securities in exchange for outstanding securities of the Bancorp or its affiliates. The determination of whether to pursue such     78    Table of Contents  transactions will be made based upon market conditions, the price of the securities issued or redeemed, the amount of such securities that may be redeemed for a price acceptable to the Bancorp and to the holders of such securities, and other factors including the cost and dilution of such actions compared with the cost and dilution associated with the issuance of CAP shares and the terms associated with participation in the program.  Most forms of Tier 1 common-qualifying capital that the Bancorp may generate, including through the issuance of the CAP shares, would generate additional Tier 1 capital as well. As the Bancorp expects that its Tier 1 ratio would be substantially in excess of the “well-capitalized” minimum of 6 percent, as well as in excess of its target range of 8 to 9 percent, even without the inclusion of any new Tier 1 common-qualifying capital (including CAP shares), and even under the more adverse scenario, it would expect to use the proceeds to repay a portion of the preferred stock issued to Treasury on December 31, 2008 under the Capital Purchase Program. This repurchase would be subject to approval by the Bancorp’s primary Federal banking agency.  A CAP participant will be permitted to issue CAP shares to Treasury in any amount between one percent and two percent of its risk-weighted assets, plus any additional amount used to redeem Capital Purchase Program shares. Approval from the institution’s primary federal regulator is required for amounts in excess of this limit and any participant receiving additional amounts will be deemed as needing “exceptional assistance” and may be subject to additional terms and conditions. The CAP shares may be converted by the issuer to common shares with the approval of the participant’s primary federal banking agency. If the participant does not convert the CAP shares, the CAP terms require conversion automatically take place seven years after issuance. The CAP shares will be convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to 90% of the average closing price for the common stock for the 20 trading day period ending February 9, 2009, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments and will bear cumulative dividends of 9%, payable quarterly, until converted or redeemed. If, however, certain shareholder approvals, discussed below, are required but not received within six months from issuance, the CAP shares will have a dividend rate of 20% until such shareholder approval is received. If the Bancorp issues CAP shares, the conversion price will be $3.22 per share.  So long as Treasury owns either CAP shares or common stock issued under the CAP, the issuing institution may not declare or pay dividends greater than $0.01 per share per quarter without Treasury’s consent. In addition, the participant must submit a plan for how they intend to use the capital to support lending. These plans will be made public upon completion of the capital investment. The participants must also submit ongoing monthly reports to the Treasury that break out lending by category and show how many new loans they provided and how many ABS and mortgage-backed securities they purchased, with a description of the lending environment in the markets they serve. The reports, which will be made public, must include a comparison to an estimate of what lending activity would have been without government capital assistance. Participating institutions will be subject to rules, regulations and Treasury guidance with respect to executive compensation, transparency, accountability and monitoring, as published and in effect at the time of the investment closing.  Like the preferred shares issued to Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program, the CAP shares will not have voting rights other than class voting rights on (i) any authorization or issuance of shares ranking senior to the senior preferred shares, (ii) any amendment to the rights of senior preferred shares, or (iii) any merger, exchange or similar transaction which would adversely affect the rights of the senior preferred shares. In addition, if dividends are not paid in full for six dividend periods, Treasury will have the right to elect two directors (which right will terminate when dividends have been paid for four consecutive dividend periods). Upon conversion of the CAP shares, Treasury will have the voting rights associated with the common stock.  As part of its purchase of CAP shares, Treasury will receive a warrant to purchase the participating institution’s common stock, with an aggregate market value, based on the CAP conversion price, equal to 20 percent of the amount of the Treasury’s investment in the CAP shares. The initial exercise price on the warrants will be the CAP share conversion price, subject to adjustment if shareholder approvals described below are required and are not received. Treasury has indicated that it would not exercise voting rights with respect to any common stock received upon exercise of warrants.  If the institution does not have sufficient authorized common stock to reserve for conversion and/or must receive shareholder approval to issue common stock upon conversion of the CAP shares or exercise of the warrants, it must call a shareholder meeting and receive the permission necessary to convert the CAP shares or exercise the warrants. If the institution does not receive such shareholder approval, the conversion price and the warrant exercise price will each be decreased by 15% of the original conversion price and warrant exercise price, respectively, on each six month anniversary of the issue date of the CAP shares, subject to a maximum reduction of 45% of the original conversion price and warrant exercise price.  The Bancorp would potentially require shareholder approval to issue common stock upon conversion of the CAP shares or exercise of the warrants if the amount of common stock issuable under the CAP shares and exercise of the warrant would equal or exceed 20 percent or more of the common stock outstanding.    79    Table of Contents Exhibits (Item 6)
