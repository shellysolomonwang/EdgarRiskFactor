Risk Factors (Item 1A)  The following is an addition to the risk factors as previously disclosed in the Registrant’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009.  The Bancorp’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by new or changed laws and regulations and by the manner in which such laws and regulations are applied by regulatory authorities.  As of the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, a major piece of proposed legislation, the Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010, is currently being debated in Congress. In its current form, this legislation could have a significant impact on the Bancorp’s operations, the way in which it does business, its cost of doing business, its credit ratings and the requirements with which the Bancorp must comply. This legislation is currently in flux. The Bancorp has no way of knowing whether this legislation will become law or the final requirements of any such law, and if the legislation does become law, the actual impact it will have on the Bancorp.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds (Item 2)  Refer to the “Capital Management” section within Management’s Discussion and Analysis in Part I, Item 3 for information regarding purchases of equity securities by the Bancorp during the first quarter of 2010.
