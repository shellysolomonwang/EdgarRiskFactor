Risk Factors (Item 1A)  There have been no material changes made during the third quarter of 2016 to any of the risk factors as previously disclosed in the Bancorp’s most recent annual report and subsequent periodic reports as filed with the SEC.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds (Item 2)  Refer to the “Capital Management” section within Management’s Discussion and Analysis in Part I, Item 2 for additional information regarding purchases and sales of equity securities by the Bancorp during the third quarter of 2016.  Shares Issued Under Certain Employee Benefit Plans  During the third quarter of 2016, the Bancorp determined that a number of shares of Fifth Third Bancorp common stock offered under our 401(k) Plan were previously inadvertently omitted from inclusion on the corresponding S-8 registration statements, that a number of securities granted under Fifth Third’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) and incentive compensation plans were granted without appropriate prospectus delivery, and that deferred compensation obligations owed in respect of the Fifth Third Bancorp Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan may have been required to be registered. As a result, the Bancorp estimates that (i) approximately 1,997,737 unregistered shares were sold through the 401(k) Plan during the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, including approximately 273,338 shares sold during the third quarter of 2016; (ii) approximately 625,367 shares were purchased through the ESPP during the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, including approximately 150,475 shares purchased during the third quarter of 2016; (iii) approximately 5,530,829 restricted shares and 6,365,069 stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) were awarded under our incentive compensation plans during the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, including approximately 36,631 and 0, respectively, awarded during the third quarter of 2016; (iv) approximately 48,230 options and 3,235,555 SARs were exercised during the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, at a weighted average option exercise price (or, in the case of SARs, mean grant date price per share) of $13.85, including approximately 5,002 options and 1,455,052 SARs exercised during the third quarter of 2016; and (v) approximately $7,986,589 in aggregate deferrals were made under the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation Plan during the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, including approximately $1,039,476 in deferrals during the third quarter of 2016. The Bancorp expects to file the required Forms S-8 and make a voluntary rescission offer to eligible plan participants during the fourth quarter of 2016 in order to remediate the registration and prospectus delivery defects. The Bancorp has also corrected the prospectus delivery defect in the intervening period subsequent to the third quarter of 2016. Based on the market price of Fifth Third Bancorp’s common stock in October 2016, the Bancorp does not expect that the exercise of any applicable rescission rights will have a material impact on its results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.  Defaults Upon Senior Securities (Item 3)  None.  Mine Safety Disclosures (Item 4)  Not applicable.  Other Information (Item 5)  None.   Exhibits (Item 6)
