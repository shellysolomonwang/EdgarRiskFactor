Item 1A.    Risk Factors       The following should be read in conjunction with and supplements and amends the factors that may affect the Company’s business or operations described under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, of the 2008 Annual Report, and the “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of the Company’s Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2009 and June 30, 2009.     Actions of the U.S. Government, Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Other Governmental and Regulatory Bodies for the Purpose of Stabilizing and Revitalizing the Financial Markets and Protecting Investors and Consumers May Not Achieve the Intended Effect or Could Adversely Affect MetLife’s Competitive Position     In response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions, on October 3, 2008, President Bush signed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (“EESA”) into law. Pursuant to EESA, the U.S. Treasury has the authority to, among other things, purchase up to $700 billion of mortgage-backed and other securities (including newly issued preferred shares and subordinated debt) from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets. The U.S. federal government, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering taking other actions to address the financial crisis. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has been making funds available to commercial and financial companies under a number of programs, including the Commercial Paper Funding Facility. The U.S. Treasury has established programs based in part on EESA and in part on the separate authority of the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC, to foster purchases from and by banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions of certain kinds of assets for which valuations have been low and markets weak.     251    Table of Contents    There can be no assurance as to what impact such actions will have on the financial markets, whether on the level of volatility, the level of lending by financial institutions, the prices buyers are willing to pay for financial assets or otherwise. Our business, financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected to the extent that credit availability and prices for financial assets remain at low levels. Furthermore, Congress has considered, and likely will continue to consider, legislative proposals that could impact the value of mortgage loans, such as legislation that would permit bankruptcy courts to reduce the principal balance of mortgage loans owed by bankrupt borrowers. If such legislation is enacted, it could cause loss of principal on certain of our nonagency prime residential mortgage backed security holdings and could cause a ratings downgrade in such holdings which, in turn, would cause an increase in unrealized losses on such securities and increase the risk-based capital that we must hold to support such securities. See “Risk Factors— We Are Exposed to Significant Financial and Capital Markets Risk Which May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity, and Our Net Investment Income Can Vary from Period to Period” in the 2008 Annual Report. In addition, the U.S. federal government (including the FDIC) and private lenders have begun programs to reduce the monthly payment obligations of mortgagors and/or reduce the principal payable on residential mortgages. As a result, we may need to maintain or increase our engagement in similar activities in order to comply with program requirements and to remain competitive. The choices made by the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC in their distribution of amounts available under EESA and any of the proposed new asset purchase programs could have the effect of supporting some aspects of the financial services industry more than others. See “Risk Factors— Competitive Factors May Adversely Affect Our Market Share and Profitability” in the 2008 Annual Report. We cannot predict whether the funds made available by the U.S. federal government and its agencies will be enough to further stabilize and revive the financial markets or, if additional amounts are necessary, whether Congress will be willing to make the necessary appropriations, what the public’s sentiment would be towards any such appropriations, or what additional requirements or conditions might be imposed on the use of any such additional funds.     MetLife, Inc. and some or all of its affiliates may be eligible to sell assets under one or more of the programs established by the U.S. federal government and its agencies, and some of their assets may be among those that are eligible for sale under the programs. MetLife, Inc. and some of its affiliates may also be eligible to invest in vehicles established to purchase troubled assets from other financial institutions under these programs, and to borrow funds under other programs to purchase specified types of asset-backed securities. Furthermore, as a bank holding company, MetLife, Inc. has formally been eligible to participate in the capital infusion program established by the U.S. Treasury under EESA, pursuant to which the U.S. Treasury purchases preferred shares of banking institutions or their holding companies and acquires warrants for their common shares. Participation in these programs may subject us to restrictions on the compensation that we can offer or pay to certain executive employees, including incentives or performance-based compensation. These restrictions could hinder or prevent us from attracting and retaining management and other employees with the talent and experience to manage and conduct our business effectively and deducting certain compensation paid to executive employees in excess of specified amounts. We may also be subject to requirements and restrictions on our business if we participate in other programs established in whole or in part under EESA. In April 2009, MetLife announced that it has elected not to participate in the Capital Purchase Program, a voluntary capital infusion program established by the U.S. Treasury under EESA. In May 2009, MetLife also announced that it had been informed by the Federal Reserve Board that it had completed the U.S. Treasury’s Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (sometimes referred to as the “stress test”) and that, based on the assessment’s economic scenarios and methodology, MetLife has adequate capital to sustain a further deterioration in the economy. Some of our competitors have received funding under one of the federal government’s capital infusion programs, which could adversely affect our competitive position.     As part of its efforts to stabilize and revitalize the financial system and the economy, the Obama Administration has also proposed making changes in capital and liquidity requirements for bank holding companies and banks. The Administration has also proposed establishing special regulatory and insolvency regimes, including even higher capital and liquidity standards, for financial institutions that are deemed to be systemically significant. It has also proposed imposing new conditions on the writing and trading of certain standardized and non-standardized derivatives and has submitted a bill to Congress that would establish a new governmental agency that would supervise and regulate institutions that provide certain financial products and services to consumers. Although the consumer financial services to which this legislation would apply might      252    Table of Contents    exclude certain insurance business, the new agency would have authority to regulate the services provided by MetLife Bank. Federal pre-emption of state consumer protection laws applicable to banking services may be eliminated, which would increase the regulatory and compliance burden on MetLife Bank and could adversely affect its business and results of operations. In addition, the creation of an additional supervisor with authority over MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries, the likelihood of additional regulations, and the other changes listed in this paragraph could require changes to MetLife’s operations. Whether such changes would affect our competitiveness in comparison to other institutions is uncertain, since it is possible that at least some of our competitors will be similarly affected. Competitive effects are possible, however, if MetLife, Inc. were determined to be systemically significant and were subjected to higher capital and liquidity requirements as a result. It is unclear at present whether systemically significant institutions will be helped or hurt competitively if such additional requirements are imposed.     Proposals by the Administration, Congress, the Federal Reserve Board and the SEC to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect investors by imposing a consistent “fiduciary” standard on both broker-dealers and investment advisers, and to more closely regulate various types of compensation arrangements for employees of financial companies, could, if enacted and implemented, or imposed as part of the bank holding company supervisory process, have a material adverse effect on our ability to distribute our variable insurance products, as well as other securities products.     A Decline in Equity Markets or an Increase in Volatility in Equity Markets May Adversely Affect Our Profitability and Our Financial Condition     Significant downturns and volatility in equity markets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in several principal ways.     Equity market downturns and volatility may discourage purchases of separate account products, such as variable annuities and variable life insurance that have underlying mutual funds with returns linked to the performance of the equity markets, and may cause some of our existing customers to withdraw cash values or reduce investments in those products.     In addition, downturns and volatility in equity markets can have a material adverse effect on the revenues and returns from our savings and investment products and services. Because these products and services depend on fees related primarily to the value of assets under management, a decline in the equity markets could reduce our revenues by reducing the value of the investment assets we manage. The retail annuity business in particular is highly sensitive to equity markets, and a sustained weakness in the equity markets will decrease revenues and earnings in variable annuity products.     We also provide certain guarantees within some of our products that protect policyholders against significant downturns in the equity markets. For example, we offer variable annuity products with guaranteed features, such as death benefits, withdrawal benefits, and minimum accumulation and income benefits. In volatile or declining equity market conditions, we may need to increase liabilities for future policy benefits and policyholder account balances, negatively affecting our net income.     A decline in equity markets also may reduce the market value of the assets supporting our pension and postretirement benefit plan obligations, changing the funded status of such plans and adversely affect our results of operations.     Lastly, we invest a portion of our invested assets in leveraged buy-out funds, hedge funds and other private equity funds and the value of such investments may be impacted by downturns or volatility in equity markets.     Defaults, Downgrades or Other Events Impairing the Value of Our Fixed Maturity Securities Portfolio May Reduce Our Earnings     We are subject to the risk that the issuers, or guarantors, of fixed maturity securities we own may default on principal and interest payments they owe us. We are also subject to the risk that the underlying collateral within loan-backed securities, including mortgage-backed securities, may default on principal and interest payments causing an adverse change in cash flows paid to our investment. Fixed maturity securities represent a significant portion of our investment portfolio. The occurrence of a major economic downturn (such as the current downturn in      253    Table of Contents    the economy), acts of corporate malfeasance, widening risk spreads, or other events that adversely affect the issuers, guarantors or underlying collateral of these securities could cause the value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio and our earnings to decline and the default rate of the fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio to increase. A ratings downgrade affecting issuers or guarantors of particular securities, or similar trends that could worsen the credit quality of issuers, such as the corporate issuers of securities in our investment portfolio, could also have a similar effect. With economic uncertainty, credit quality of issuers or guarantors could be adversely affected. Similarly, a ratings downgrade affecting an asset-backed security we hold could indicate the credit quality of that security has deteriorated and could increase the capital we must hold to support that security to maintain our risk-based capital levels. Any event reducing the value of these securities other than on a temporary basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Levels of write down or impairment are impacted by our assessment of intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell, fixed maturity securities and the intent and ability to hold equity securities which have declined in value until recovery. If we determine to reposition or realign portions of the portfolio so as not to hold certain equity securities, or intend to sell or determine that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell, certain fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position prior to recovery, then we will incur an other than temporary impairment charge in the period that the decision was made not to hold the equity security to recovery, or to sell, or the determination was made it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the fixed maturity security.
