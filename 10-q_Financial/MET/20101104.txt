Item 1A.    Risk Factors       The following should be read in conjunction with and supplements and amends the factors that may affect the Company’s business or operations described under “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A, of the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2010 (the “June 2010 10-Q”).     Risks Related to Our Business     The Alico Business is similar to our business in many respects, and the Acquisition increases our exposure to many of the risks described below.     Our Insurance and Banking Businesses Are Heavily Regulated, and Changes in Regulation May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth     Our insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of insurance and other laws and regulations. See “Business — Regulation — Insurance Regulation” in the 2009 Annual Report. State insurance laws regulate most aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled and the states in which they are licensed. Our non-U.S. insurance operations are principally regulated by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled and operate.     State laws in the United States grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things:              •   licensing companies and agents to transact business;         •   calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements;         •   mandating certain insurance benefits;         •   regulating certain premium rates;         •   reviewing and approving policy forms;         •   regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements;         •   regulating advertising;         •   protecting privacy;         •   establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards;         •   fixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts;         •   approving changes in control of insurance companies;         •   restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates; and         •   regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments.       213    Table of Contents      State insurance guaranty associations have the right to assess insurance companies doing business in their state for funds to help pay the obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. Because the amount and timing of an assessment is beyond our control, the liabilities that we have currently established for these potential liabilities may not be adequate. See “Business — Regulation — Insurance Regulation — Guaranty Associations and Similar Arrangements” in the 2009 Annual Report.     State insurance regulators and the NAIC regularly reexamine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the insurer and, thus, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.     The NAIC and several states’ legislatures have considered the need for regulations and/or laws to address agent or broker practices that have been the focus of investigations of broker compensation in the State of New York and in other jurisdictions. The NAIC adopted a Compensation Disclosure Amendment to its Producers Licensing Model Act which, if adopted by the states, would require disclosure by agents or brokers to customers that insurers will compensate such agents or brokers for the placement of insurance and documented acknowledgement of this arrangement in cases where the customer also compensates the agent or broker. Several states have enacted laws similar to the NAIC amendment. Others have enacted laws or proposed disclosure regulations which, under differing circumstances, require disclosure of specific compensation earned by a producer on the sale of an insurance or annuity product. We cannot predict how many states may promulgate the NAIC amendment or alternative regulations or the extent to which these regulations may have a material adverse impact on our business.     Currently, the U.S. federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance. However, Dodd-Frank allows federal regulators to compel state insurance regulators to liquidate an insolvent insurer under some circumstances if the state regulators have not acted within a specific period. It also establishes some federal authority with respect to reinsurance and surplus lines insurance and gives the new Federal Insurance Office the authority to negotiate international insurance agreements for the United States. In addition, federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies. These areas include financial services regulation, securities regulation, pension regulation, health care regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation. In addition, various forms of direct and indirect federal regulation of insurance have been proposed from time to time, including proposals for the establishment of an optional federal charter for insurance companies. As part of a comprehensive reform of financial services regulation, Dodd-Frank creates an office within the federal government to collect information about the insurance industry, recommend prudential standards, and represent the United States in dealings with foreign insurance regulators. Other aspects of our insurance operations could also be affected by Dodd-Frank. For example, Dodd-Frank imposes new restrictions on the ability of affiliates of insured depository institutions (such as MetLife Bank) to engage in proprietary trading or sponsor or invest in hedge funds or private equity funds. See “— President Obama Recently Signed a Bill Providing for Comprehensive Reform of Financial Services Regulation in the United States, Various Aspects of Which Could Impact Our Business Operations, Capital Requirements and Profitability and Limit Our Growth” in the June 2010 10-Q.     As a federally chartered national association, MetLife Bank is subject to a wide variety of banking laws, regulations and guidelines. Federal banking laws regulate most aspects of the business of MetLife Bank, but certain state laws may apply as well. MetLife Bank is principally regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC.     Federal banking laws and regulations address various aspects of MetLife Bank’s business and operations with respect to, among other things:              •   chartering to carry on business as a bank;         •   the permissibility of certain activities;         •   maintaining minimum capital ratios;         •   capital management in relation to the bank’s assets;         •   dividend payments;       214    Table of Contents               •   safety and soundness standards;         •   loan loss and other related liabilities;         •   liquidity;         •   financial reporting and disclosure standards;         •   counterparty credit concentration;         •   restrictions on related party and affiliate transactions;         •   lending limits (and, in addition, Dodd-Frank includes the credit exposures arising from securities lending by MetLife Bank within lending limits otherwise applicable to loans);         •   payment of interest;         •   unfair or deceptive acts or practices;         •   privacy; and         •   bank holding company and bank change of control.       In addition, Dodd-Frank establishes a new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection that supervises and regulates institutions providing certain financial products and services to consumers. Although the consumer financial services to which this legislation applies exclude certain insurance business, the new Bureau has authority to regulate consumer services provided by MetLife Bank and non-insurance consumer services provided elsewhere throughout MetLife. Federal pre-emption of state consumer protection laws applicable to banking services has been significantly restricted under Dodd-Frank, which will increase the regulatory and compliance burden on MetLife Bank and could adversely affect its business and results of operations. Dodd-Frank also includes provisions on mortgage lending, anti-predatory lending and other regulatory and supervisory provisions that could impact the business and operations of MetLife Bank.     Furthermore, bank regulatory agencies have issued proposed interagency guidance for funding and liquidity risk management that would apply to MetLife, Inc. as a bank holding company. The recently announced Basel III standards adopted by the central banks of the world’s major economies will require banks and bank holding companies to hold greater amounts of capital, to comply with requirements for short-term liquidity and to reduce reliance on short-term funding sources. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends — Financial and Economic Environment.” It is not clear how these new requirements will compare to the enhanced prudential standards that may apply to us under Dodd-Frank, as described under “— President Obama Recently Signed a Bill Providing for Comprehensive Reform of Financial Services Regulation in the United States, Various Aspects of Which Could Impact Our Business Operations, Capital Requirements and Profitability and Limit Our Growth” in the June 2010 10-Q.     In addition, the ability of MetLife Bank and MetLife, Inc. to pay dividends could be reduced by any additional capital requirements that might be imposed as a result of the enactment of Dodd-Frank and/or the endorsement and adoption by the United States of Basel III.     The FDIC has the right to assess FDIC-insured banks for funds to help pay the obligations of insolvent banks to depositors. Because the amount and timing of an assessment is beyond our control, the liabilities that we have currently established for these potential liabilities may not be adequate. Dodd-Frank also codifies the requirement that a bank holding company, such as MetLife, Inc., must serve as a source of strength for its bank subsidiary.     In addition, Dodd-Frank will result in increased assessment for banks with assets of $10 billion or more, which includes MetLife Bank. Federal and state banking regulators regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to banks and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the bank and, thus, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of MetLife Bank.     Our international operations are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they operate, which in many ways is similar to that of the state regulation outlined above. This regulation may impact many of our customers and      215    Table of Contents    independent sales intermediaries. Changes in the regulations that affect their operations also may affect our business relationships with them and their ability to purchase or distribute our products. Accordingly, these changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See “— Our International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks, Including Exposure to Local and Regional Economic Conditions, that Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our Profitability” in the June 2010 10-Q.     Furthermore, the increase in our foreign activities as a result of the acquisition of the Alico Business may also subject us to increased supervision by the Federal Reserve Board, since the size of a bank holding company’s foreign activities is taken as an indication of the holding company’s complexity. It may also have an effect on the manner in which MetLife, Inc. is required to calculate its risk-based capital.     Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance and other expenses of doing business, thus having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.     From time to time, regulators raise issues during examinations or audits of MetLife, Inc.’s subsidiaries that could, if determined adversely, have a material impact on us. We cannot predict whether or when regulatory actions may be taken that could adversely affect our operations. In addition, the interpretations of regulations by regulators may change and statutes may be enacted with retroactive impact, particularly in areas such as accounting or statutory reserve requirements.     We are also subject to other regulations and may in the future become subject to additional regulations. See “Business — Regulation” in the 2009 Annual Report.     Changes in Market Interest Rates May Significantly Affect Our Profitability     Some of our products, principally traditional whole life insurance, fixed annuities and guaranteed interest contracts, expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce our investment margin or “spread,” or the difference between the amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts in our general account and the rate of return we are able to earn on general account investments intended to support obligations under the contracts. Our spread is a key component of our net income.     As interest rates decrease or remain at low levels, we may be forced to reinvest proceeds from investments that have matured or have been prepaid or sold at lower yields, reducing our investment margin. Moreover, borrowers may prepay or redeem the fixed income securities, commercial or agricultural mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities in our investment portfolio with greater frequency in order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbates this risk. Lowering interest crediting rates can help offset decreases in investment margins on some products. However, our ability to lower these rates could be limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. As a result, our spread could decrease or potentially become negative. Our expectation for future spreads is an important component in the amortization of DAC and VOBA, and significantly lower spreads may cause us to accelerate amortization, thereby reducing net income in the affected reporting period. In addition, during periods of declining interest rates, life insurance and annuity products may be relatively more attractive investments to consumers, resulting in increased premium payments on products with flexible premium features, repayment of policy loans and increased persistency, or a higher percentage of insurance policies remaining in force from year to year, during a period when our new investments carry lower returns. A decline in market interest rates could also reduce our return on investments that do not support particular policy obligations. Accordingly, declining interest rates may materially affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows and significantly reduce our profitability. We recognize that a low interest rate environment will adversely affect our earnings, but we do not believe any such impact will be material in 2010 or 2011.     The sufficiency of our life insurance statutory reserves in Taiwan is highly sensitive to interest rates and other related assumptions. This is due to the sustained low interest rate environment in Taiwan coupled with long-term interest rate guarantees of approximately 6% embedded in the life and health contracts sold prior to 2003 and the lack of availability of long-duration investments in the Taiwanese capital markets to match such long-duration liabilities. The key assumptions include current Taiwan government bond yield rates increasing from current levels      216    Table of Contents    of 1.6% to 2.6% over the next ten years, a modest increase in lapse rates, mortality and morbidity levels remaining consistent with recent experience, and U.S. dollar-denominated investments making up 35% of total assets backing life insurance statutory reserves. Current reserve adequacy analysis shows that provisions are adequate; however, adverse changes in key assumptions for interest rates, lapse experience and mortality and morbidity levels could lead to a need to strengthen reserves.     Increases in market interest rates could also negatively affect our profitability. In periods of rapidly increasing interest rates, we may not be able to replace, in a timely manner, the investments in MetLife’s general account with higher yielding investments needed to fund the higher crediting rates necessary to keep interest sensitive products competitive. We, therefore, may have to accept a lower spread and, thus, lower profitability or face a decline in sales and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. In addition, policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals may tend to increase as policyholders seek investments with higher perceived returns as interest rates rise. This process may result in cash outflows requiring that we sell investments at a time when the prices of those investments are adversely affected by the increase in market interest rates, which may result in realized investment losses. Unanticipated withdrawals and terminations may cause us to accelerate the amortization of DAC and VOBA, which reduces net income. An increase in market interest rates could also have a material adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio, for example, by decreasing the estimated fair values of the fixed income securities that comprise a substantial portion of our investment portfolio. Lastly, an increase in interest rates could result in decreased fee income associated with a decline in the value of variable annuity account balances invested in fixed income funds.     A Downgrade or a Potential Downgrade in Our Financial Strength or Credit Ratings Could Result in a Loss of Business and Materially Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations     Financial strength ratings, which various NRSRO publish as indicators of an insurance company’s ability to meet contractholder and policyholder obligations, are important to maintaining public confidence in our products, our ability to market our products and our competitive position.     Downgrades in our financial strength ratings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways, including:              •   reducing new sales of insurance products, annuities and other investment products;         •   adversely affecting our relationships with our sales force and independent sales intermediaries;         •   materially increasing the number or amount of policy surrenders and withdrawals by contractholders and policyholders;         •   requiring us to reduce prices for many of our products and services to remain competitive; and         •   adversely affecting our ability to obtain reinsurance at reasonable prices or at all.       In addition to the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries, various NRSROs also publish credit ratings for MetLife, Inc. and several of its subsidiaries. Credit ratings are indicators of a debt issuer’s ability to meet the terms of debt obligations in a timely manner and are important factors in our overall funding profile and ability to access certain types of liquidity. Downgrades in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in many ways, including adversely limiting our access to capital markets, potentially increasing the cost of debt, and requiring us to post collateral. For example, with respect to derivative transactions with credit ratings downgrade triggers, a one-notch downgrade would have increased our derivative collateral requirements by $82 million at September 30, 2010. Also, $417 million of liabilities associated with funding agreements and other capital market products were subject to credit ratings downgrade triggers that permit early termination subject to a notice period of 90 days.     In view of the difficulties experienced during 2008 and 2009 by many financial institutions, including our competitors in the insurance industry, we believe it is possible that the NRSROs will continue to heighten the level of scrutiny that they apply to such institutions, will continue to increase the frequency and scope of their credit reviews, will continue to request additional information from the companies that they rate, and may adjust upward the capital and other requirements employed in the NRSRO models for maintenance of certain ratings levels. Rating      217    Table of Contents    agencies use an “outlook statement” of “positive,” “stable,” “negative” or “developing” to indicate a medium- or long-term trend in credit fundamentals which, if continued, may lead to a ratings change. A rating may have a “stable” outlook to indicate that the rating is not expected to change; however, a “stable” rating does not preclude a rating agency from changing a rating at any time, without notice. Certain rating agencies assign rating modifiers such as “CreditWatch” or “Under Review” to indicate their opinion regarding the potential direction of a rating. These ratings modifiers are generally assigned in connection with certain events such as potential mergers and acquisitions, or material changes in a company’s results, in order for the rating agencies to perform their analyses to fully determine the rating implications of the event. Certain rating agencies have recently implemented rating actions, including downgrades, outlook changes and modifiers, for MetLife, Inc.’s and certain of its subsidiaries’ insurer financial strength and credit ratings.     Based on the announcement in February 2010 that MetLife was in discussions to acquire ALICO, in February 2010, S&P and A.M. Best placed the ratings of MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries on “CreditWatch with negative implications” and “under review with negative implications,” respectively. Also in connection with the announcement, in March 2010, Moody’s changed the ratings outlook of MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries from “stable” to “negative” outlook. Upon completion of the public financing transactions related to the Acquisition, in August 2010, S&P affirmed the ratings of MetLife, Inc. and subsidiaries with a “negative” outlook, and removed them from “CreditWatch.” On November 1, 2010, upon closing of the Acquisition, S&P changed the rating outlook of ALICO to “positive” from “negative” and affirmed its financial strength rating; the ratings of MetLife, Inc. and its other subsidiaries were unaffected by this ratings action. Also on November 1, 2010, Fitch Ratings upgraded by one notch (and changed the rating outlook from “Rating Watch Positive” to “stable”) the financial strength rating of ALICO and affirmed all existing ratings for MetLife, Inc. and its other subsidiaries. On November 4, 2010, A.M. Best upgraded by one notch the financial strength rating of ALICO and changed the rating outlook from “under review with positive implications” to “negative”. A.M. Best also changed the outlook for MetLife, Inc. and certain of its other subsidiaries to “negative” from “under review with negative implications.”     On July 1, 2010, Moody’s published revised guidance called “Revisions to Moody’s Hybrid Tool Kit” (the “Guidance”) for assigning equity credit to so-called hybrid securities, i.e., securities with both debt and equity characteristics (“Hybrids”). Moody’s evaluates Hybrids using certain specified criteria and then places each such security into a “basket,” with a specific percentage of debt and equity being associated with each basket, which is then used to adjust full sets of financial statements for purposes of, among other things, calculating the issuing company’s financial leverage. Under the Guidance, Hybrids are one element that Moody’s considers within the context of an issuer’s overall credit profile. As of November 1, 2010, we have approximately $11.2 billion of Hybrids outstanding, which includes approximately $6.4 billion of debt securities and $4.8 billion of preferred stock. Application of the Guidance has resulted in Moody’s significantly reducing the amount of equity credit it assigns to these securities, including the equity units issued to ALICO Holdings in connection with the Acquisition. We do not expect at this time, as a result of the Guidance, that a reduction in Moody’s equity treatment of our Hybrids, including the equity units, would result in any material negative impact on MetLife, Inc.’s credit rating or the financial strength ratings of its insurance company subsidiaries. However, if we decided to increase our adjusted capital as a result of the application of the Guidance, we may seek to (i) issue additional common equity or higher equity content Hybrids satisfying the Guidance’s revised rating criteria, and/or (ii) redeem, repurchase or restructure existing Hybrids. Any sale of additional common equity would have a dilutive effect on our common stockholders.     We cannot predict what actions rating agencies may take, or what actions we may take in response to the actions of rating agencies, which could adversely affect our business. As with other companies in the financial services industry, our ratings could be downgraded at any time and without any notice by any NRSRO.     An Inability to Access Our Credit Facilities Could Result in a Reduction in Our Liquidity and Lead to Downgrades in Our Credit and Financial Strength Ratings     In October 2010, we entered into two senior unsecured credit facilities: a three-year $3 billion facility and a 364-day $1 billion facility. We also have other facilities which we enter into in the ordinary course of business. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and      218    Table of Contents    Capital Resources — The Company — Liquidity and Capital Sources — Credit and Committed Facilities” and Note 15 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.     We rely on our credit facilities as a potential source of liquidity. The availability of these facilities could be critical to our credit and financial strength ratings and our ability to meet our obligations as they come due in a market when alternative sources of credit are tight. The credit facilities contain certain administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We must comply with covenants under our credit facilities, including a requirement to maintain a specified minimum consolidated net worth.     Our right to make borrowings under these facilities is subject to the fulfillment of certain important conditions, including our compliance with all covenants, and our ability to borrow under these facilities is also subject to the continued willingness and ability of the lenders that are parties to the facilities to provide funds. Our failure to comply with the covenants in the credit facilities or fulfill the conditions to borrowings, or the failure of lenders to fund their lending commitments (whether due to insolvency, illiquidity or other reasons) in the amounts provided for under the terms of the facilities, would restrict our ability to access these credit facilities when needed and, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.           Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
