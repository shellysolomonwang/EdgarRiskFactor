Item 1A.  Risk Factors   The following, together with the information under “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of MetLife, Inc.’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2012, which is incorporated herein by reference, should be read in conjunction with, and supplements and amends, the factors that may affect the Company’s business or operations described under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, of the 2011 Annual Report.  Concerns Over U.S. Fiscal Policy and the “Fiscal Cliff” in the U.S., as well as Rating Agency Downgrades of U.S. Treasury Securities, Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Financial markets have recently been affected by concerns over U.S. fiscal policy, including the uncertainty regarding the “fiscal cliff” composed of tax increases and automatic spending cuts that will become effective at the end of 2012 unless steps are taken to delay or offset them, as well as the need to again raise the U.S. federal government’s debt ceiling by the end of 2012 and reduce the federal deficit. These issues could, on their own, or combined with the slowing of the global economy generally, send the U.S. into a new recession, have severe repercussions to the U.S. and global credit and financial markets, further exacerbate concerns over sovereign debt of other countries and disrupt economic activity in the U.S. and elsewhere. All of these factors could affect our ability to meet liquidity needs and obtain capital. In addition, a recession in the U.S. could adversely impact the demand for our products, negatively impact earnings, adversely affect the performance of our investments or result in impairments and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “Risk Factors — Difficult Conditions in the Global Capital Markets and the Economy Generally May Materially Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations and These Conditions May Not Improve in the Near Future” included in the 2011 Annual Report.  In August 2011, Standard & Poor’s Rating Services downgraded the AAA rating on U.S. Treasury securities to AA+ with a negative outlook, while Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) affirmed the Aaa rating on U.S. Treasury securities, but with a negative outlook. In October 2011, Moody’s affirmed its August 2011 ratings, but revised its negative outlook to stable. In November 2011, Fitch Ratings affirmed its AAA rating on U.S. Treasury securities but changed its U.S. credit rating outlook to negative from stable, citing the failure of a special Congressional committee to agree on certain deficit reduction measures. Further rating agency downgrades of U.S. Treasury securities are possible.  As a result of downgrades of U.S. Treasury securities, the market value of some of our investments may decrease, and our capital adequacy could be adversely affected, which could require us to raise additional capital during a period of distress in financial markets, potentially at a higher cost. Further downgrades, together with uncertainty regarding the fiscal cliff, would significantly exacerbate the risks we face and any resulting adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including those described under “Risk Factors — Difficult Conditions in the Global Capital Markets and the Economy Generally May Materially Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations and These Conditions May Not Improve in the Near Future,” “Risk Factors — Adverse Capital and Credit Market Conditions May Significantly Affect Our Ability to Meet Liquidity Needs, Access to Capital and Cost of Capital,” “Risk Factors — Our Participation in a Securities Lending Program Subjects Us to Potential Liquidity and Other Risks” and “Risk Factors — The Determination of the Amount of Allowances and Impairments Taken on Our Investments is Subjective and Could Materially Impact Our Results of Operations or Financial Position” included in the 2011 Annual Report. We cannot predict whether or when these adverse consequences may occur, what other unforeseen consequences may result, or the extent, severity and duration of the impact of such consequences on our business, results of operations and financial condition.    227    Table of Contents Our Insurance, Brokerage and Banking Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth  Insurance Regulation — U.S. Our insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of insurance and other laws and regulations. See “Business — U.S. Regulation — Insurance Regulation” included in the 2011 Annual Report and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations – Industry Trends – Regulatory Developments.” State insurance laws regulate most aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance regulators of the states in which they are domiciled and the states in which they are licensed.  State laws in the U.S. grant insurance regulatory and other state authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things:        •    licensing companies and agents to transact business;        •    calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements;        •    mandating certain insurance benefits;        •    regulating certain premium rates;        •    reviewing and approving policy forms;        •    regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements, and identifying and paying to the states benefits and other property that is not claimed by the owners;        •    regulating advertising;        •    protecting privacy;        •    establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards;        •    fixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts;        •    approving changes in control of insurance companies;        •    restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates; and        •    regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments.  State insurance guaranty associations have the right to assess insurance companies doing business in their state for funds to help pay the obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. Because the amount and timing of an assessment is beyond our control, the liabilities that we have currently established for these potential liabilities may not be adequate. See “Business — U.S. Regulation — Insurance Regulation — Guaranty Associations and Similar Arrangements” included in the 2011 Annual Report.  State insurance regulators and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, that are made for the benefit of the consumer sometimes lead to additional expense for the insurer and, thus, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In July 2012, our New York domestic insurers received, as part of an industry-wide inquiry, a request from the Department of Financial Services to provide information regarding their use of affiliated captives or off-shore entities to reinsure insurance risks. Like many life insurance companies, MetLife utilizes captive reinsurers in order to comply with certain reserve requirements related to universal life and term life insurance policies. The financing arrangements with the captives support non-economic reserves, representing    228    Table of Contents  reserves required by regulation but above our estimate of needed reserves. If the Department of Financial Services or other state insurance regulators determine to restrict the use of such captives for purposes of funding reserve requirements related to universal life and term life insurance policies, it could impair MetLife’s ability to write such products or require MetLife to increase prices on such products unless alternate reserve funding solutions are found.  U.S. Federal Regulation Affecting Insurance. Currently, the U.S. federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance. However, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”) allows federal regulators to compel state insurance regulators to liquidate an insolvent insurer under some circumstances if the state regulators have not acted within a specific period. The Federal Reserve Board has also proposed that it be given authority to compel insurance companies to take prompt corrective action in certain circumstances if they are part of a large bank holding company or of a company that has been designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) as a non-bank SIFI. It also establishes the Federal Insurance Office within the Department of the Treasury, which has the authority to participate in the negotiations of international insurance agreements with foreign regulators for the U.S., as well as to collect information about the insurance industry and recommend prudential standards. While not having a general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, the director of this office will perform various functions with respect to insurance, including serving as a non-voting member of the FSOC and making recommendations to the FSOC regarding insurers to be designated for more stringent regulation. The director is also required to submit a report to Congress regarding how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the United States, including by increasing national uniformity through either a federal charter or effective action by the states.  Federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies. These areas include financial services regulation, securities regulation, derivatives regulation, mortgage regulation, pension regulation, health care regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation. In addition, various forms of direct and indirect federal regulation of insurance have been proposed from time to time, including proposals for the establishment of an optional federal charter for insurance companies. Other aspects of our insurance operations could also be affected by Dodd-Frank. For example, effective July 21, 2012, Dodd-Frank imposes prohibitions on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) -insured depository institutions (such as MetLife Bank) and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading or sponsoring or investing in hedge funds or private equity funds (commonly known as the Volcker Rule). If and when MetLife Bank’s FDIC insurance is terminated, MetLife, Inc. and its affiliates will not be subject to the bans on proprietary trading and fund activities under the Volcker Rule. However, because the Volcker Rule nevertheless imposes additional capital requirements and quantitative limits on such trading and activities by a non-bank SIFI, MetLife, Inc. and its affiliates could be subject to such requirements and limits were they to be designated non-bank SIFIs. Regulations defining and governing such requirements and limits on non-bank SIFIs have not been proposed. Commencing from the date of designation, a non-bank SIFI will have a two-year period, subject to further extension by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Federal Reserve Board, (collectively, the “Federal Reserve”), to conform to any such requirements and limits. Subject to safety and soundness determinations as part of rulemaking that could require additional capital requirements and quantitative limits, Dodd-Frank provides that the exemptions under the Volcker Rule also are available to exempt any additional capital requirements and quantitative limits on non-bank SIFIs. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends — Regulatory Developments — Regulatory Developments Affecting Investment Activities and Derivatives, including the Volcker Rule,” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends — Regulatory Developments — Regulatory Developments Relating to Non-Bank SIFIs and G-SIIs,” as well as “Business — U.S. Regulation — Dodd-Frank and Other Legislative and Regulatory Developments — Volcker Rule” included in the 2011 Annual Report.  Banking and Bank Holding Company Regulation. As a federally chartered national banking association, MetLife Bank is subject to a wide variety of banking laws, regulations and guidelines. Federal banking and    229    Table of Contents  consumer financial protection laws regulate most aspects of the business of MetLife Bank, but certain state laws may apply as well. MetLife Bank is principally regulated by the OCC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), and secondarily by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC.        •    Federal banking laws and regulations address various aspects of MetLife Bank’s business and operations with respect to, among other things:        •    chartering to carry on business as a bank;        •    the permissibility of certain activities;        •    maintaining minimum capital ratios;        •    capital management in relation to the bank’s assets;        •    dividend payments and repurchases of securities, including common stock;        •    safety and soundness standards;        •    loan loss and other related liabilities;        •    liquidity;        •    financial reporting and disclosure standards;        •    counterparty credit concentration;        •    restrictions on related party and affiliate transactions;        •    lending limits (and, in addition, Dodd-Frank includes the credit exposures arising from securities lending by MetLife Bank within lending limits otherwise applicable to loans);        •    payment of interest;        •    unfair or deceptive acts or practices;        •    mortgage servicing practices;        •    privacy; and        •    relationships with MetLife, Inc. in its capacity as a bank holding company and potentially with other investors in connection with a change in control of MetLife Bank.  Federal banking regulators regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to banks and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the bank and, thus, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of MetLife Bank.  Since 2008, MetLife Bank has been engaged in the forward and reverse residential mortgage origination and servicing business. In January 2012, MetLife, Inc. announced that it was exiting the business of originating forward residential mortgages and, in April 2012, announced it was exiting the businesses of originating and servicing reverse residential mortgages and that it and MetLife Bank entered into a definitive agreement to sell MetLife Bank’s reverse mortgage servicing portfolio. On June 29, 2012, the Company sold the majority of MetLife Bank’s reverse mortgage servicing rights and related assets and liabilities. See Note 2 to the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  State and federal regulatory and law enforcement authorities have initiated various inquiries, investigations or examinations of alleged irregularities in the foreclosure practices of the residential mortgage servicing industry.    230    Table of Contents  Mortgage servicing practices have also been the subject of Congressional attention. Authorities have publicly stated that the scope of the investigations extends beyond foreclosure documentation practices to include mortgage loan origination, modification and loss mitigation practices. See “— The Resolution of Several Issues Affecting the Financial Services Industry Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Reported Results or on Our Relations with Current and Potential Customers” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Industry Trends – Mortgage and Foreclosure-Related Exposures.”  In addition, Dodd-Frank established the CFPB, which supervises and regulates institutions providing certain financial products and services to consumers. Although the consumer financial services to which this legislation applies exclude insurance business of the kind in which we engage, the CFPB has authority to regulate consumer services provided by MetLife Bank and non-insurance consumer services provided elsewhere throughout MetLife. See “Business — U.S. Regulation — Dodd-Frank and Other Legislative and Regulatory Developments — Consumer Protection Laws” included in the 2011 Annual Report. We cannot predict how regulation by the CFPB might affect our business.  In June 2012, the OCC, Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC published three notices of proposed rulemaking (the “Bank Capital NPRs”) that would revise and replace the agencies’ current capital rules with rules consistent with (i) the final rules for increased capital and liquidity requirements for bank holding companies, such as MetLife, Inc., published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”) in December 2010 (“Basel III”), as well as the applicable sections of Dodd-Frank, (ii) a series of revisions adopted by the Basel Committee to the market risk capital requirements for exposures in a banking organization’s trading book in 2005, 2009 and 2010 (collectively, “Basel II.5”), and (iii) the market risk capital requirements as initially published by the Basel Committee in June 2004 (“Basel II”). See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Industry Trends – Regulatory Developments.” It is possible that even more stringent capital and liquidity requirements could be imposed on us if, in the future, MetLife, Inc. is designated by the FSOC as a non-bank SIFI.  In December 2011, the Federal Reserve Board issued a notice of proposed rulemaking related to enhanced prudential standards required by Dodd-Frank (“Regulation YY”). Regulation YY would apply to bank holding companies with assets of $50 billion or more and non-bank SIFIs. The ability of MetLife Bank and MetLife, Inc., as a bank holding company, to pay dividends, repurchase common stock or other securities or engage in other transactions that could affect its capital or need for capital could be reduced by any additional capital requirements that might be imposed as a result of the enactment of Dodd-Frank, Regulation YY and/or the adoption of the Bank Capital NPRs and other regulatory initiatives if MetLife, Inc. is unable to de-register as a bank holding company before the requirements become effective. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends,” as well as “Business — U.S. Regulation” and “Business — International Regulation” included in the 2011 Annual Report. The Basel Committee has also published rules requiring a capital surcharge for globally systemically important banks, which are to be phased in for U.S. banks beginning in 2016 and will become fully effective in 2019 if they are endorsed and adopted by the U.S. banking regulators. These rules were not included in the Bank Capital NPRs.  The Federal Reserve’s capital plans rule requires all bank holding companies with assets of more than $50 billion, including MetLife, Inc., to submit annual capital plans which include projections of the company’s capital levels under baseline and stress scenarios over a nine-quarter period. The Federal Reserve will approve or object to a company’s proposed capital actions, such as dividends and stock repurchases, based on the results of those capital plans and the Federal Reserve’s assessment of the robustness of the company’s capital planning processes. In addition, in recent years, the Federal Reserve has conducted the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”), an assessment of the internal capital planning processes, capital adequacy and proposed capital distributions of large bank holding companies, including MetLife, Inc. In January 2012, we submitted to the Federal Reserve a comprehensive capital plan, as mandated by the capital plans rule, and additional information required by the 2012 CCAR. The capital plan projected MetLife’s capital levels to the end of 2013 under baseline and stress scenarios, including a stress scenario developed and provided by the Federal Reserve as part of the 2012 CCAR. In March 2012, the Federal Reserve, based on its assessment, objected to the incremental    231    Table of Contents  capital actions described in MetLife’s capital distribution plan, which included a proposed stock repurchase and dividend increase. In June 2012, the Federal Reserve Board granted MetLife, Inc. an extension of time until September 30, 2012 to resubmit its capital plan under the capital plans rule. If MetLife, Inc. remains a bank holding company, or if it is designated a non-bank systemically important financial institution and is required to submit capital plans to the Federal Reserve in the future, there can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve will approve its future capital plans. Capital planning requirements could have the effect, in practice, of increasing the amounts of capital held by companies subject to the requirements, including MetLife, which could affect their competitive position.  Under Dodd-Frank, all bank holding companies that have elected to be treated as financial holding companies, such as MetLife, Inc., are required to be “well capitalized” and “well managed” as defined by the Federal Reserve, on a consolidated basis, and not just at their depository institution(s), a higher standard than was applicable to financial holding companies before Dodd-Frank. If MetLife, Inc. or MetLife Bank is unable to meet these standards, we could be subject to activity restrictions, including restrictions on mergers and acquisitions, ultimately be required to divest certain operations and be restricted in our ability to pay dividends, repurchase common stock or other securities, or engage in transactions that could affect our capital or need for capital. See “Business — U.S. Regulation — Dodd-Frank and Other Legislative and Regulatory Developments” included in the 2011 Annual Report and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Industry Trends – Regulatory Developments – Regulatory Developments Applicable to Bank Holding Companies.”  In December 2011, MetLife Bank and MetLife, Inc. entered into a definitive agreement to sell most of the depository business of MetLife Bank to GE Capital Bank. The transaction is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals from the FDIC and to the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. The Utah Department of Financial Institutions has approved the transaction and the OCC has granted approval of a change in the composition of all or substantially all of MetLife Bank’s assets in connection with the transaction. GE Capital Bank has filed an application with the FDIC seeking approval of the assumption of the deposits to be transferred to it, and MetLife Bank has filed an application with the FDIC to terminate MetLife Bank’s FDIC deposit insurance contingent upon certification that MetLife Bank has no remaining deposits (which is dependent on the assumption by GE Capital Bank of the deposits to be transferred to it). The parties have each responded to questions on their applications from the staff of the FDIC, and GE Capital Bank is in the process of responding to recent additional requests from the FDIC. The parties are awaiting action by the FDIC on their applications. Additionally, in January 2012, MetLife, Inc. announced it was exiting the business of originating forward residential mortgages and, in April 2012, announced it was exiting the businesses of originating and servicing reverse residential mortgages and that it and MetLife Bank entered into a definitive agreement to sell MetLife Bank’s reverse mortgage servicing portfolio. On June 29, 2012, the Company sold the majority of MetLife Bank’s reverse mortgage servicing rights and related assets and liabilities. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Once MetLife Bank has completely exited its depository business, MetLife, Inc. plans to terminate MetLife Bank’s FDIC insurance, putting MetLife, Inc. in a position to be able to deregister as a bank holding company. Upon completion of the foregoing, MetLife, Inc. will no longer be regulated as a bank holding company or subject to enhanced supervision and prudential standards as a bank holding company with assets of $50 billion or more. However, if, in the future, the FSOC designates MetLife, Inc. as a non-bank SIFI, we would once again be subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve and enhanced supervision and prudential standards, such as Regulation YY.  In April 2012, the FSOC adopted final rules setting forth the process it will follow and the criteria it will use to assess whether a non-bank financial company should be subject to enhanced supervision by the Federal Reserve as a non-bank SIFI. The FSOC will follow a three-stage process. In Stage 1, a set of uniform quantitative metrics will be applied to a broad group of non-bank financial companies in order to identify non-bank financial companies for further evaluation. If MetLife, Inc. meets the total consolidated assets threshold and at least one of the other five quantitative thresholds used in the first stage, the FSOC will continue with two stages of further analysis using additional sources of data and qualitative and quantitative factors. MetLife, Inc. is currently a bank    232    Table of Contents  holding company and, as a result, it is not subject to designation as a non-bank SIFI. However, if MetLife, Inc. succeeds in deregistering as a bank holding company, it could be considered for designation as a non-bank SIFI. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends — Regulatory Developments — Regulatory Developments Relating to Non-Bank SIFIs and G-SIIs,” as well as “Business — U.S. Regulation — Financial Holding Company Regulation” included in the 2011 Annual Report.  The FDIC has the right to assess FDIC-insured banks for funds to help pay the obligations of insolvent banks to depositors. Because the amount and timing of an assessment is beyond our control, the liabilities that we have currently established for these potential liabilities may not be adequate. In addition, Dodd-Frank will result in increased assessments for banks with assets of $10 billion or more, which includes MetLife Bank. In addition, large bank holding companies and non-bank SIFIs can be assessed under Dodd-Frank for any uncovered costs arising in connection with the resolution of a systemically important financial company and, under a proposal of the U.S. Treasury published on January 3, 2012, will be assessed to cover the expenses of the Office of Financial Research, an agency established by Dodd-Frank to improve the quality of financial data available to policymakers and facilitate more robust and sophisticated analysis of the financial system. See “— Dodd-Frank Provides for the Resolution or Liquidation of Certain Types of Financial Institutions, Including Bank Holding Companies Like MetLife, Inc.”  Regulation of Brokers and Dealers. Dodd-Frank also authorizes the SEC to establish a standard of conduct applicable to brokers and dealers when providing personalized investment advice to retail and other customers. This standard of conduct would be to act in the best interest of the customer without regard to the financial or other interest of the broker or dealer providing the advice. See “Business — U.S. Regulation — Securities, Broker-Dealer and Investment Adviser Regulation” and “Risk Factors — Changes in U.S. Federal and State Securities Laws and Regulations, and State Insurance Regulations Regarding Suitability of Annuity Product Sales, May Affect Our Operations and Our Profitability” included in the 2011 Annual Report.  International Regulation. Our international insurance operations are principally regulated by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are located or operate. See “Business — International Regulation” included in the 2011 Annual Report, as well as “— Our International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks, Including Exposure to Local and Regional Economic Conditions, That Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our Profitability.” A significant portion of our revenues is generated through operations in foreign jurisdictions, including many countries in early stages of economic and political development. Our international operations may be materially adversely affected by the actions and decisions of foreign authorities and regulators, such as through nationalization or expropriation of assets, the imposition of limits on foreign ownership of local companies, changes in laws (including tax laws and regulations), their application or interpretation, political instability, dividend limitations, price controls, changes in applicable currency, currency exchange controls or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which they operate or converting local currencies we hold to U.S. dollars or other currencies. This may also impact many of our customers and independent sales intermediaries. Changes in the regulations that affect their operations also may affect our business relationships with them and their ability to purchase or distribute our products. Accordingly, these changes and actions may negatively affect our business in these jurisdictions.  We are also subject to the evolving Solvency II insurance regulatory directive for each of our insurance operations throughout the European Economic Area. As requirements are finalized by the regulators, capital requirements might be impacted in a number of jurisdictions. In addition, our legal entity structure throughout Europe may impact our capital requirements, risk management infrastructure and reporting by country.  In May 2012, as part of the global initiative to identify global systemically important financial institutions, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”) published a proposed assessment methodology for designating global systemically important insurers (“G-SIIs”). Any insurers identified by the IAIS as G-SIIs would be subject to additional policy measures. These policy measures will be subject to a subsequent IAIS consultation paper to be released later in 2012, but the IAIS has indicated that they could include higher capital    233    Table of Contents  requirements, enhanced supervision (including more detailed and frequent reporting and removal of barriers to orderly resolution of the G-SII), as well as additional measures to improve the degree of self-sufficiency of a G-SII’s different business segments (including separate legal structures for traditional insurance and non-traditional or non-insurance activities, and restrictions on intercompany subsidies). The IAIS expects to publish the first list of G-SIIs in November 2013. If MetLife, Inc. were identified as a G-SII, its competitive position relative to other life insurers that were not so designated could be adversely affected. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Industry Trends – Regulatory Developments – Regulatory Developments Relating to Non-Bank SIFIs and G-SIIs.”  We expect the scope and extent of regulation outside of the U.S., as well as regulatory oversight, generally to continue to increase. The authority of our international operations to conduct business is subject to licensing requirements, permits and approvals, and these authorizations are subject to modification and revocation. The regulatory environment in the countries in which we operate and changes in laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See “— Our International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks, Including Exposure to Local and Regional Economic Conditions, That Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our Profitability,” as well as “Business — International Regulation” included in the 2011 Annual Report.  Summary. From time to time, regulators raise issues during examinations or audits of MetLife, Inc.’s regulated subsidiaries that could, if determined adversely, have a material impact on us. We cannot predict whether or when regulatory actions may be taken that could adversely affect our operations. In addition, the interpretations of regulations by regulators may change and statutes may be enacted with retroactive impact, particularly in areas such as accounting or statutory reserve requirements. We are also subject to other regulations and may in the future become subject to additional regulations. See “Business — U.S. Regulation” and “Business — International Regulation” included in the 2011 Annual Report.  Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance and other expenses of doing business, thus having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  Dodd-Frank Provides for the Resolution or Liquidation of Certain Types of Financial Institutions, Including Bank Holding Companies Like MetLife, Inc.  Under the provisions of Dodd-Frank relating to the resolution or liquidation of certain types of financial institutions, including bank holding companies and non-bank SIFIs, if MetLife, Inc. remains a bank holding company or is designated a non-bank SIFI and if it were to become insolvent or were in danger of defaulting on its obligations, it could be compelled to undergo liquidation with the FDIC as receiver. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends — Regulatory Developments — Regulatory Developments Applicable to Bank Holding Companies.” For this new regime to be applicable, a number of determinations would have to be made, including that a default by MetLife, Inc. would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United States. In these circumstances, if the FDIC were to be appointed as the receiver for MetLife, Inc., liquidation would occur under the provisions of the new liquidation authority, and not under the Bankruptcy Code. Under the new liquidation authority, unsecured creditors and shareholders are intended to bear the failed institution’s losses, and the FDIC’s purpose under the liquidation regime is to mitigate the systemic risks the institution’s failure poses, which is different from the purpose of a bankruptcy trustee under the Bankruptcy Code. The final rule on orderly liquidation authority makes the priority of payments for unsecured creditors in such a liquidation substantially consistent with the Bankruptcy Code, and provides that contractual subordination agreements will be respected. These provisions could also affect our position as a creditor of other financial institutions that may be liquidated by the FDIC under these provisions of Dodd-Frank. Dodd-Frank also provides for the assessment of bank holding companies with assets of $50 billion or more, non-bank systematically important financial companies supervised by the Federal Reserve, and other financial companies with assets of $50 billion or more to cover the costs of liquidating any financial company subject to the new liquidation authority. If a financial company is liquidated under this authority, we could be assessed for a portion of the costs of the liquidation. See “— Our Insurance,    234    Table of Contents  Brokerage and Banking Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth.” Although it is not possible to assess the full impact of the liquidation authority at this time, it could increase the funding costs of large bank holding companies or financial companies that might be viewed as systemically significant, such as MetLife, Inc. It could also lead to an increase in secured financings, rather than unsecured financings.  Our International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks, Including Exposure to Local and Regional Economic Conditions, That Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our Profitability  Our international operations are exposed to increased political, legal, financial, operational and other risks. Our international operations may be materially adversely affected by the actions and decisions of foreign authorities and regulators, such as through nationalization or expropriation of assets, the imposition of limits on foreign ownership of local companies, changes in laws (including tax laws and regulations), their application or interpretation, political instability, dividend limitations, price controls, changes in applicable currency, currency exchange controls or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which they operate or converting local currencies we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies, as well as other adverse actions by foreign governmental authorities and regulators, such as the retroactive application of new requirements to sales made prior to their introduction. Such actions may negatively affect our business in these jurisdictions and could indirectly affect our business in other jurisdictions as well. Some of our foreign insurance operations are, and are likely to continue to be, in emerging markets where these risks are heightened. See “Business — International Regulation” and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” included in the 2011 Annual Report, as well as “— Our Insurance, Brokerage and Banking Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth.” In addition, we rely on local sales forces in these countries and may encounter labor problems resulting from workers’ associations and trade unions in some countries. In several countries, including China and India, we operate with local business partners with the resulting risk of managing partner relationships to the business objectives. If our business model is not successful in a particular country, we may lose all or most of our investment in building and training the sales force in that country.  We are expanding our international operations in certain markets where we operate and in selected new markets. This may require considerable management time, as well as start-up expenses for market development before any significant revenues and earnings are generated. Operations in new foreign markets may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable, and expansion in existing markets may be affected by local economic and market conditions. Therefore, as we expand internationally, we may not achieve expected operating margins and our results of operations may be negatively impacted.  In addition, in recent years, the operating environment in Argentina has been very challenging. In Argentina, we were formerly principally engaged in the pension business. In December 2008, the Argentine government nationalized the Social Security System and moved pension fund assets into the government-run system, effectively eliminating the private pension companies in Argentina. As a result, we have experienced and will continue to experience reductions in the operation’s revenues and cash flows. In February 2011, the Argentine Superintendent of Insurance (“SSN”) enacted a resolution effectively prohibiting cross-border reinsurance operations. In October 2011, the SSN enacted a resolution which affects our ability to invest and diversify abroad – as of December 31, 2011, all investments and funds must be located in Argentina. Further governmental or legal actions related to our operations in Argentina could negatively impact our operations in Argentina and result in future losses. See Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2011 Annual Report.  We also have operations in the Middle East where the legal and political systems and regulatory frameworks are subject to instability and disruptions. Lack of legal certainty and stability in the region exposes our operations to increased risk of disruption and to adverse or unpredictable actions by regulators and may make it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts, which may negatively impact our business in this region.    235    Table of Contents We have market presence in over 50 different countries and increased exposure to risks posed by local and regional economic conditions. Europe has recently experienced a deep recession and may be beginning another recession. A recession in Europe could adversely impact the demand for our products, negatively impact earnings, adversely affect the performance of our investments or result in impairments and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “Risk Factors – Difficult Conditions in the Global Capital Markets and the Economy Generally May Materially Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations and These Conditions May Not Improve in the Near Future” included in the 2011 Annual Report. Countries such as Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland have been particularly affected by the recession, resulting in increased national debts and depressed economic activity. We have significant operations and investments in these countries which could be adversely affected by economic developments such as higher taxes, growing inflation, decreasing government spending, rising unemployment and currency instability. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Investments — Current Environment.”  We face increased exposure to the Japanese markets as a result of our considerable presence there. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Investments — Current Environment.” The Japanese economy continues to be weak. Disruptions to the Japanese economy are possible and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Any weakening of the yen against the U.S. dollar would adversely affect the estimated fair value of our yen-denominated investments, our investments in Japanese subsidiaries and our net income from operations in Japan. See “Risk Factors — Fluctuations in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Could Negatively Affect Our Profitability” included in the 2011 Annual Report. Changes in market interest rates may also have an adverse effect on our investments and operations in Japan. See “— Changes in Market Interest Rates May Significantly Affect Our Profitability.”  The Resolution of Several Issues Affecting the Financial Services Industry Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Reported Results or on Our Relations with Current and Potential Customers  We will continue to be subject to legal and regulatory actions in the ordinary course of our business, both in the U.S. and internationally. This could result in a challenge of business sold in the past under previously acceptable market practices at the time. Regulators are increasingly interested in the approach that product providers use to select third-party distributors and to monitor the appropriateness of sales made by them. In some cases, product providers can be held responsible for the deficiencies of third-party distributors. In addition, regulators are auditing compliance by life insurers with state unclaimed property laws. See “— Litigation and Regulatory Investigations Are Increasingly Common in Our Businesses and May Result in Significant Financial Losses and/or Harm to Our Reputation.”  As a result of publicity relating to widespread perceptions of industry abuses, there have been numerous regulatory inquiries and proposals for legislative and regulatory reforms.  On April 13, 2011, the OCC entered into consent decrees with several banks, including MetLife Bank. The consent decrees require an independent review of foreclosure practices and set forth new residential mortgage servicing standards, including a requirement for a designated point of contact for a borrower during the loss mitigation process. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board entered into consent decrees with the affiliated bank holding companies of these banks, including MetLife, Inc., to enhance the supervision of the mortgage servicing activities of their banking subsidiaries. On August 6, 2012, the Federal Reserve Board issued an Order of Assessment of a Civil Monetary Penalty Issued Upon Consent against MetLife, Inc. that will impose a penalty of up to $3,200,000 for the deficiencies in servicing of residential mortgage loans and processing foreclosures at MetLife Bank that were the subject of the 2011 consent decree. MetLife Bank also had a meeting with the Department of Justice regarding mortgage servicing and foreclosure practices. It is possible that various state or federal regulatory and law enforcement authorities may seek monetary penalties from MetLife Bank relating to foreclosure practices. MetLife Bank has also responded to a subpoena issued by the Department of Financial Services regarding hazard insurance and flood insurance that MetLife Bank obtains to protect the lienholder’s    236    Table of Contents  interest when the borrower’s insurance has lapsed. In April and May 2012, MetLife Bank received two subpoenas issued by the Office of Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development regarding FHA insured loans. In June 2012, MetLife Bank received a Civil Investigative Demand that the U.S. Department of Justice issued as part of a False Claims Act investigation of allegations that MetLife Bank had improperly originated and/or underwritten loans insured by the FHA.  These consent decrees, as well as the inquiries or investigations referred to above, could adversely affect our reputation or result in material fines, penalties, equitable remedies or other enforcement actions, and result in significant legal costs in responding to governmental investigations or other litigation. We cannot predict the outcome of any such actions or reviews. In addition, the changes to the mortgage servicing business required by the consent decrees and the resolution of any other inquiries or investigations may affect the profitability of such business. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends — Mortgage and Foreclosure-Related Exposures.”  The MetLife Bank Events may not relieve MetLife from complying with the consent decrees, or protect it from the inquiries and investigations relating to residential mortgage servicing and foreclosure activities, or any fines, penalties, equitable remedies or enforcement actions that may result, the costs of responding to any such governmental investigations, or other litigation.  Changes in Market Interest Rates May Significantly Affect Our Profitability  Some of our products, principally traditional whole life insurance, fixed annuities and guaranteed interest contracts, expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce our investment margin or “spread,” or the difference between the amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts in our general account and the rate of return we are able to earn on general account investments intended to support obligations under the contracts. Our spread is a key component of our net income.  As interest rates decrease or remain at low levels, we may be forced to reinvest proceeds from investments that have matured or have been prepaid or sold at lower yields, reducing our investment margin. Moreover, borrowers may prepay or redeem the fixed income securities, commercial or agricultural mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities in our investment portfolio with greater frequency in order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbates this risk. Lowering interest crediting rates can help offset decreases in investment margins on some products. However, our ability to lower these rates could be limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. As a result, our spread could decrease or potentially become negative. Our expectation for future spreads is an important component in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (“DAC”) and value of business acquired (“VOBA”), and significantly lower spreads may cause us to accelerate amortization, thereby reducing net income in the affected reporting period. In addition, during periods of declining interest rates, life insurance and annuity products may be relatively more attractive investments to consumers, resulting in increased premium payments on products with flexible premium features, repayment of policy loans and increased persistency, or a higher percentage of insurance policies remaining in force from year to year, during a period when our new investments carry lower returns. A decline in market interest rates could also reduce our return on investments that do not support particular policy obligations. During periods of sustained lower interest rates, policy liabilities may not be sufficient to meet future policy obligations and may need to be strengthened. Accordingly, declining and sustained lower interest rates may materially affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows and significantly reduce our profitability. In June 2012, the Federal Reserve Board reiterated its plans to keep interest rates low until at least through late 2014, in order to revive the slow recovery from stressed economic conditions. It also extended to the end of 2012 “Operation Twist.” Central banks around the world, including the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Australia, the Central Bank of Brazil and the Central Bank of China, followed the recent actions of the Federal Reserve Board to lower interest rates. The collective effort globally to lower interest rates was in response to concerns about Europe’s sovereign debt crisis and slowing global economic growth. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Investments – Current Environment.” For a discussion of the impact of the    237    Table of Contents  low interest environment on us, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Industry Trends – Financial and Economic Environment – Impact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment” and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Industry Trends – Financial and Economic Environment – Mitigating Actions.”  Increases in market interest rates could also negatively affect our profitability. In periods of rapidly increasing interest rates, we may not be able to replace, in a timely manner, the investments in our general account with higher yielding investments needed to fund the higher crediting rates necessary to keep interest sensitive products competitive. We, therefore, may have to accept a lower spread and, thus, lower profitability or face a decline in sales and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. In addition, policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals may tend to increase as policyholders seek investments with higher perceived returns as interest rates rise. This process may result in cash outflows requiring that we sell investments at a time when the prices of those investments are adversely affected by the increase in market interest rates, which may result in realized investment losses. Unanticipated withdrawals and terminations may cause us to accelerate the amortization of DAC and VOBA, which reduces net income and may also cause us to accelerate negative VOBA, which increases net income. An increase in market interest rates could also have a material adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio, for example, by decreasing the estimated fair values of the fixed income securities that comprise a substantial portion of our investment portfolio. Finally, an increase in interest rates could result in decreased fee income associated with a decline in the value of variable annuity account balances invested in fixed income funds.  Litigation and Regulatory Investigations Are Increasingly Common in Our Businesses and May Result in Significant Financial Losses and/or Harm to Our Reputation  We face a significant risk of litigation and regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating our businesses, including the risk of class action lawsuits. Our pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings specific to us and others generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which we operate. In connection with our insurance operations, plaintiffs’ lawyers may bring or are bringing class actions and individual suits alleging, among other things, issues relating to sales or underwriting practices, claims payments and procedures, product design, disclosure, administration, denial or delay of benefits and breaches of fiduciary or other duties to customers. Plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may seek very large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages. Modern pleading practice in the U.S. and other countries permits considerable variation in the assertion of money damages or other relief. This variability in pleadings, together with our actual experience in litigating or resolving through settlement numerous claims over an extended period of time, demonstrates to management that the monetary relief which may be specified in a lawsuit or claim bears little relevance to its merits or disposition value. See Note 11 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  Due to the vagaries of litigation, the outcome of a litigation matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular points in time may normally be difficult to ascertain. Uncertainties can include how fact finders will evaluate documentary evidence and the credibility and effectiveness of witness testimony, and how trial and appellate courts will apply the law in the context of the pleadings or evidence presented, whether by motion practice, or at trial or on appeal. Disposition valuations are also subject to the uncertainty of how opposing parties and their counsel will themselves view the relevant evidence and applicable law.  We establish liabilities for litigation and regulatory loss contingencies when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities have been established for a number of matters noted in Note 11 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. It is possible that some of the matters could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures or establish accruals in amounts that could not be estimated at June 30, 2012.  Over the past several years, we have faced numerous claims, including class action lawsuits, alleging improper marketing or sales of individual life insurance policies, annuities, mutual funds or other products.    238    Table of Contents In addition, MLIC is and has been a defendant in a large number of lawsuits seeking both actual and punitive damages for personal injuries resulting from exposure to asbestos. These lawsuits principally have focused on allegations with respect to certain research, publication and other activities of one or more of MLIC’s employees during the period from the 1920’s through approximately the 1950’s and alleged that MLIC learned or should have learned of certain health risks posed by asbestos and, among other things, improperly publicized or failed to disclose those health risks. Additional litigation relating to these matters may be commenced in the future. The ability of MLIC to estimate its ultimate asbestos exposure is subject to considerable uncertainty, and the conditions impacting its liability can be dynamic and subject to change. The availability of reliable data is limited and it is difficult to predict the numerous variables that can affect liability estimates, including the number of future claims, the cost to resolve claims, the disease mix and severity of disease in pending and future claims, the impact of the number of new claims filed in a particular jurisdiction and variations in the law in the jurisdictions in which claims are filed, the possible impact of tort reform efforts, the willingness of courts to allow plaintiffs to pursue claims against MLIC when exposure to asbestos took place after the dangers of asbestos exposure were well known, and the impact of any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts. The number of asbestos cases that may be brought, the aggregate amount of any liability that MLIC may incur, and the total amount paid in settlements in any given year are uncertain and may vary significantly from year to year.  The ability to make estimates regarding ultimate asbestos exposure declines significantly as the estimates relate to years further in the future. In our judgment, there is a future point after which losses cease to be probable and reasonably estimable. It is reasonably possible that our total exposure to asbestos claims may be materially greater than the asbestos liability currently accrued and that future charges to income may be necessary. The potential future charges could be material in the particular quarterly or annual periods in which they are recorded.  We are also subject to various regulatory inquiries, such as information requests, subpoenas and books and record examinations, from state and federal regulators and other authorities. A substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, even if we ultimately prevail in the litigation, regulatory action or investigation, we could suffer significant reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our ability to attract new customers, retain our current customers and recruit and retain employees. Regulatory inquiries and litigation may cause volatility in the price of stocks of companies in our industry.  In April 2012, we reached agreements with representatives of the U.S. jurisdictions that were conducting audits of MetLife, Inc. and certain of its affiliates for compliance with unclaimed property laws, and with state insurance regulators directly involved in a multistate targeted market conduct examination relating to claim-payment practices and compliance with unclaimed property laws. The effectiveness of each agreement was conditioned upon the approval of a specified number of jurisdictions. In each case, the threshold for effectiveness has been reached. Pursuant to the agreements, we will, among other things, take specified action to identify liabilities under life insurance, annuity, and retained asset contracts, to adopt specified procedures for seeking to contact and pay owners of the identified liabilities, and, to the extent that we are unable to locate such owners, to escheat these amounts with interest at a specified rate to the appropriate states. Additionally, we have agreed to accelerate the final date of certain industrial life policies and to escheat unclaimed benefits of such policies. Pursuant to the agreement to resolve the market conduct examination, the Company made a $40 million multi-state examination payment to be allocated among the settling states. In the third quarter of 2011, we incurred a $117 million after tax charge to increase reserves in connection with our use of the U.S. Social Security Administration’s Death Master File and similar databases to identify potential life insurance claims that had not been presented to us. In the first quarter of 2012, we recorded a $52 million after tax charge for the multi-state examination payment and the expected acceleration of benefit payments to policyholders under the settlements. At least one other jurisdiction is pursuing a similar market conduct exam. It is possible that other jurisdictions may pursue similar exams or audits and that such exams or audits may result in additional payments to beneficiaries, additional escheatment of funds deemed abandoned under state laws, administrative penalties, interest, and/or further changes to our procedures.    239    Table of Contents We cannot give assurance that current claims, litigation, unasserted claims probable of assertion, investigations and other proceedings against us will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. It is also possible that related or unrelated claims, litigation, unasserted claims probable of assertion, investigations and proceedings may be commenced in the future, and we could become subject to further investigations and have lawsuits filed or enforcement actions initiated against us. The number of countries in which we currently operate has greatly expanded as a result of the Acquisition and, consequently, we may be subject to additional investigations and lawsuits in such jurisdictions. Increased regulatory scrutiny and any resulting investigations or proceedings in any of the countries where we operate could result in new legal actions and precedents and industry-wide regulations that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
