Item 1A. Risk FactorsThe following should be read in conjunction with, and supplements and amends, the factors that may affect the Company’s business or operations described under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, of the 2016 Annual Report, as amended or supplemented by the information under “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A, of MetLife, Inc.’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 (the “First Quarter 2017 Report”) and MetLife, Inc.’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 (the “Second Quarter 2017 Report”). Other than as described in this Item 1A, there have been no other material changes to our risk factors from the risk factors previously disclosed in the 2016 Annual Report as amended or supplemented by such information in the First Quarter 2017 Report and the Second Quarter 2017 Report.Risks Related to Our BusinessThe following updates and replaces the similar paragraphs of the risk factors entitled “An Inability to Access Our Credit Facility Could Result in a Reduction in Our Liquidity and Lead to Downgrades in Our Credit and Financial Strength Ratings” and “Differences Between Actual Claims Experience and Underwriting and Reserving Assumptions May Adversely Affect Our Financial Results” included in the 2016 Annual Report.An Inability to Access Our Credit Facility Could Result in a Reduction in Our Liquidity and Lead to Downgrades in Our Credit and Financial Strength Ratings We rely on our unsecured credit facility maintained by MetLife, Inc. and MetLife Funding, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc. (the “Credit Facility”), as a potential source of liquidity. The availability of this Credit Facility, which was $4.0 billion at June 30, 2017 but which decreased to $3.0 billion upon the completion of the Separation, could be critical to our credit and financial strength ratings and our ability to meet our obligations as they come due in a market when alternative sources of credit are tight. The Credit Facility contains certain administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants, including a requirement to maintain a specified minimum consolidated net worth. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Company — Liquidity and Capital Sources — Global Funding Sources — Credit and Committed Facilities” and Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2016 Annual Report.***190Table of ContentsDifferences Between Actual Claims Experience and Underwriting and Reserving Assumptions May Adversely Affect Our Financial Results***Due to the nature of the underlying risks and the uncertainty associated with the determination of liabilities for future policy benefits and claims, we cannot determine precisely the amounts which we will ultimately pay to settle our liabilities. Such amounts may vary from the estimated amounts, particularly when those payments may not occur until well into the future. We evaluate our liabilities periodically based on accounting requirements, which change from time to time, the assumptions used to establish the liabilities, as well as our actual experience. Reserve estimates in some instances are affected by our operating practices and procedures that are used, among other things, to support our assumptions with respect to the Company’s obligations to its policyholders and contractholders. To the extent that these practices and procedures do not accurately produce the data to support our assumptions our reserves may require adjustment. If the liabilities originally established for future benefit payments prove inadequate, we must increase them and/or reduce associated DAC and/or VOBA. Such adjustments could affect earnings negatively and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Policyholder Liabilities,” as well as “Business — Policyholder Liabilities” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Policyholder Liabilities” included in the 2016 Annual Report. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Consolidated Results — Three Months Ended September 30, 2017 Compared with the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 — Actuarial Assumption Review,” as well as “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates — Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Value of Business Acquired” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates — Derivatives” included in the 2016 Annual Report for further information regarding the manner in which policyholder behavior and other events may differ from our assumptions and, thereby affect our financial results.Capital-Related RisksThe following updates and replaces the similar paragraphs of the risk factor entitled “Legal and Regulatory Restrictions and Uncertainty and Restrictions Under the Terms of Certain of Our Securities May Prevent Us from Repurchasing Our Stock and Paying Dividends at the Level We Wish” included in the 2016 Annual Report.Legal and Regulatory Restrictions and Uncertainty and Restrictions Under the Terms of Certain of Our Securities May Prevent Us from Repurchasing Our Stock and Paying Dividends at the Level We Wish ***Trigger Events for the Restrictions on the Payment of Dividends on Our Preferred Stock and Restrictions on the Payment of Interest on Our Junior Subordinated DebenturesIn addition, the preferred stock and the junior subordinated debentures contain provisions that would automatically suspend the payment of preferred stock dividends and interest on junior subordinated debentures if MetLife, Inc. fails to meet certain tests (“Trigger Events”). In such cases, and subject to the terms of the instruments, MetLife, Inc. could make payments up to the amount of net proceeds from sales of (i) common stock during the 90 days preceding the dividend declaration date or (ii) common stock or certain kinds of warrants to purchase common stock generally during the 180 days prior to the interest payment date (the “New Equity Proceeds”). If the New Equity Proceeds were insufficient to make such payments, the “dividend stopper” provisions would come into effect and we would be unable to repurchase or pay dividends on our common stock.A “Trigger Event” would occur if:•the risk-based capital ratio of MetLife’s largest U.S. insurance subsidiaries in the aggregate (as defined in the applicable instrument) were to be less than 175% of the company action level based on the subsidiaries’ prior year annual financial statements filed (generally around March 1) with state insurance commissioners; or•at the end of a quarter (“Final Quarter End Test Date”), consolidated GAAP net income for the four-quarter period ending two quarters before such quarter-end (the “Preliminary Quarter End Test Date”) is zero or a negative amount and the consolidated GAAP stockholders’ equity, minus AOCI (the “adjusted stockholders’ equity amount”), as of the Final Quarter End Test Date and the Preliminary Quarter End Test Date, declined by 10% or more from (A) its level 10 quarters before the Final Quarter End Test Date (the “Benchmark Quarter End Test Date”), for Benchmark Quarter End Test Dates after August 4, 2017 (the date of the Separation), or (B) $49,282,000,000, the consolidated GAAP stockholders’ equity, minus AOCI as of June 30, 2017 as reported on a pro forma basis reflecting the Separation in MetLife’s Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 9, 2017, for Benchmark Quarter End Test Dates prior to August 4, 2017. 191Table of ContentsThe Trigger Event would continue until there is no longer a Trigger Event at the specified time, and the adjusted stockholders’ equity amount is no longer 10% or more below its level at each Benchmark Quarter End Test Date that is associated with a “Trigger Event.”Item 2.
