Item 1A.    Risk Factors       The following should be read in conjunction with and supplements and amends the factors that may affect the Company’s business or operations described under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, of the 2009 Annual Report.     Actions of the U.S. Government, Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Other Governmental and Regulatory Bodies for the Purpose of Stabilizing and Revitalizing the Financial Markets and Protecting Investors and Consumers May Not Achieve the Intended Effect or Could Adversely Affect MetLife’s Competitive Position     In response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions, on October 3, 2008, President Bush signed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (“EESA”) into law. Pursuant to EESA, the U.S. Treasury has the authority to, among other things, purchase up to $700 billion of mortgage-backed and other securities (including newly issued preferred shares and subordinated debt) from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets. The U.S. federal government, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken other actions to address the financial crisis. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York made funds available to commercial and financial companies under a number of programs, including the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, which expired in early 2010. The U.S. Treasury has established programs based in part on EESA and in part on the separate authority of the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC, to foster purchases from and by banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions of certain kinds of assets for which valuations have been low and markets weak. Some of the programs established by governmental and regulatory bodies have recently been discontinued or will be in the near term. The discontinuance of these programs may roughly coincide with a change in monetary policy by the Federal Reserve Board. We cannot predict what impact, if any, this could have on our business, results of operations and financial condition.     Although such actions appear to have provided some stability to the financial markets, our business, financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected to the extent that credit availability and prices for financial assets revert to their low levels of late 2008 and early 2009 or do not continue to improve. Furthermore, Congress has considered, and may consider in the future, legislative proposals that could impact the estimated fair value of mortgage loans, such as legislation that would permit bankruptcy courts to rewrite the terms of a mortgage contract, including reducing the principal balance of mortgage loans owed by bankrupt borrowers, or legislation that requires loan modifications. If such legislation is enacted, it could cause loss of principal on certain of our non-agency prime residential mortgage-backed security (“RMBS”) holdings and could cause a ratings downgrade in such holdings which, in turn, would cause an increase in unrealized losses on such securities and increase the risk-based capital that we must hold to support such securities. See “Risk Factors — We Are Exposed to Significant Financial and Capital Markets Risk Which May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity, and Our Net Investment Income Can Vary from Period to Period” in the 2009 Annual Report. In addition, the U.S. federal government (including the FDIC) and private lenders have begun programs to reduce the monthly payment obligations of mortgagors and/or      171    Table of Contents    reduce the principal payable on residential mortgage loans. As a result of such programs or of any legislation requiring loan modifications, we may need to maintain or increase our engagement in similar activities in order to comply with program or statutory requirements and to remain competitive. We cannot predict whether the funds made available by the U.S. federal government and its agencies will be enough to continue stabilizing or to further revive the financial markets or, if additional amounts are necessary, whether Congress will be willing to make the necessary appropriations, what the public’s sentiment would be towards any such appropriations, or what additional requirements or conditions might be imposed on the use of any such additional funds.     The Obama Administration has proposed, and Congress may consider, the imposition of a fee or fees on financial firms with more than $50 billion in consolidated assets, and on certain other financial firms of systemic significance, for the purpose of recovering the cost of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (“TARP”) established under EESA, which the Congressional Budget Office currently estimates will be over $110 billion. As a bank holding company with more than $50 billion of consolidated assets, MetLife would be subject to any such fee. The Obama Administration, the House and the Senate have also made various proposals to create a fund to pay for the costs of winding up bank holding companies and certain other systemically important financial firms that may fail in the future. Any such fund would be funded through assessments on certain financial firms. Full details of the proposed fees and assessments, the companies that may be subject to them, and the exact manner in which they would be assessed are not yet available, so we cannot estimate their cumulative financial impact on us, if any. However, it is possible that the proposed fees and assessments could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.     The choices made by the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC in their distribution of amounts available under EESA and any future asset purchase programs, as well as any decisions made regarding the imposition of additional regulation on large financial institutions may have, over time, the effect of supporting some aspects of the financial services industry more than others. Some of our competitors have received, or may in the future receive, benefits under one or more of the federal government’s programs. This could adversely affect our competitive position. See “Risk Factors — Competitive Factors May Adversely Affect Our Market Share and Profitability” in the 2009 Annual Report. In addition, the adoption of proposals that would restrict the investment activities of financial institutions affiliated with insured depository institutions, such as proposals to prohibit investments in private equity funds, could affect our ability to make investments that provide returns over the long periods of time many of our products require.     See also “— Proposals to Regulate Compensation, if Implemented, Could Hinder or Prevent Us From Attracting and Retaining Management and Other Employees with the Talent and Experience to Manage and Conduct Our Business Effectively” and “Risk Factors — Our Insurance and Banking Businesses Are Heavily Regulated, and Changes in Regulation May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth” in the 2009 Annual Report.     Changes in Market Interest Rates May Significantly Affect Our Profitability     Some of our products, principally traditional whole life insurance, fixed annuities and guaranteed interest contracts, expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce our “spread,” or the difference between the amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts in our general account and the rate of return we are able to earn on general account investments intended to support obligations under the contracts. Our spread is a key component of our net income.     As interest rates decrease or remain at low levels, we may be forced to reinvest proceeds from investments that have matured or have been prepaid or sold at lower yields, reducing our investment margin. Moreover, borrowers may prepay or redeem the fixed income securities, commercial or agricultural mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities in our investment portfolio with greater frequency in order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbates this risk. Lowering interest crediting rates can help offset decreases in investment margins on some products. However, our ability to lower these rates could be limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. As a result, our spread could decrease or potentially become negative. Our expectation for future spreads is an important component in the amortization of DAC and VOBA, and significantly lower spreads may cause us to accelerate amortization, thereby reducing net income in the affected reporting period. In addition, during periods of declining interest rates, life insurance and annuity products may be relatively more attractive investments to consumers, resulting in increased      172    Table of Contents    premium payments on products with flexible premium features, repayment of policy loans and increased persistency, or a higher percentage of insurance policies remaining in force from year to year, during a period when our new investments carry lower returns. A decline in market interest rates could also reduce our return on investments that do not support particular policy obligations. Accordingly, declining interest rates may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows and significantly reduce our profitability.     The sufficiency of our life insurance statutory reserves in Taiwan is highly sensitive to interest rates and other related assumptions. This is due to the sustained low interest rate environment in Taiwan coupled with long-term interest rate guarantees of approximately 6% embedded in the life and health contracts sold prior to 2003 and the lack of availability of long-duration investments in the Taiwanese capital markets to match such long-duration liabilities. The key assumptions include current Taiwan government bond yield rates increasing from current levels of 1.8% to 3.0% over the next ten years, a modest increase in lapse rates, mortality and morbidity levels remaining consistent with recent experience, and U.S. dollar-denominated investments making up 35% of total assets backing life insurance statutory reserves. Current statutory reserve adequacy analysis shows that provisions are adequate; however, adverse changes in key assumptions for interest rates, lapse experience and mortality and morbidity levels could lead to a need to strengthen reserves. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.     Increases in market interest rates could also negatively affect our profitability. In periods of rapidly increasing interest rates, we may not be able to replace, in a timely manner, the investments in MetLife’s general account with higher yielding investments needed to fund the higher crediting rates necessary to keep interest sensitive products competitive. We, therefore, may have to accept a lower spread and, thus, lower profitability or face a decline in sales and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. In addition, policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals may tend to increase as policyholders seek investments with higher perceived returns as interest rates rise. This process may result in cash outflows requiring that we sell investments at a time when the prices of those investments are adversely affected by the increase in market interest rates, which may result in realized investment losses. Unanticipated withdrawals and terminations may cause us to accelerate the amortization of DAC and VOBA, which would increase our current expenses and reduce net income. An increase in market interest rates could also have a material adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio, for example, by decreasing the estimated fair values of the fixed income securities that comprise a substantial portion of our investment portfolio. Lastly, an increase in interest rates could result in decreased fee income associated with a decline in the value of variable annuity account balances invested in fixed income funds.     We Face Unforeseen Liabilities or Asset Impairments or Rating Actions Arising from Possible Acquisitions and Dispositions of Businesses or Difficulties Integrating Such Businesses     We have engaged in dispositions and acquisitions of businesses in the past, and expect to continue to do so in the future. On March 7, 2010, we entered into an agreement to acquire Alico. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Overview” and Note 2 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. There could be unforeseen liabilities or asset impairments, including goodwill impairments, that arise in connection with the businesses that we may sell or the businesses that we may acquire in the future. In addition, there may be liabilities or asset impairments that we fail, or are unable, to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on each business that we have acquired or may acquire. Furthermore, the use of our own funds as consideration in any acquisition would consume capital resources that would no longer be available for other corporate purposes. We also may not be able to raise sufficient funds to consummate an acquisition if, for example, we are unable to sell our securities or close related bridge credit facilities. Moreover, as a result of uncertainty and risks associated with potential acquisitions and dispositions of businesses, rating agencies may take certain actions with respect to the ratings assigned to MetLife, Inc. and/or its subsidiaries. See “Business — Company Ratings — Rating Actions” in the 2009 Annual Report and “— An Inability to Access Our Credit Facilities Could Result in a Reduction in Our Liquidity and Lead to Downgrades in Our Credit and Financial Strength Ratings.”     Our ability to achieve certain benefits we anticipate from any acquisitions of businesses will depend in large part upon our ability to successfully integrate such businesses in an efficient and effective manner. We may not be able to integrate such businesses smoothly or successfully, and the process may take longer than expected. The integration of operations may require the dedication of significant management resources, which may distract      173    Table of Contents    management’s attention from day-to-day business. If we are unable to successfully integrate the operations of such acquired businesses, we may be unable to realize the benefits we expect to achieve as a result of such acquisitions and our business and results of operations may be less than expected.     Fluctuations in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates and Foreign Securities Markets Could Negatively Affect Our Profitability     We are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar resulting from our holdings of non-U.S. dollar denominated investments, investments in foreign subsidiaries and net income from foreign operations and issuance of non-U.S. dollar denominated instruments, including guaranteed interest contracts and funding agreements. These risks relate to potential decreases in estimated fair value and income resulting from a strengthening or weakening in foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar. In general, the weakening of foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar will adversely affect the estimated fair value of our non-U.S. dollar denominated investments, our investments in foreign subsidiaries, and our net income from foreign operations. Although we use foreign currency swaps and forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risk, we cannot provide assurance that these methods will be effective or that our counterparties will perform their obligations. See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”     From time to time, various emerging market countries have experienced severe economic and financial disruptions, including significant devaluations of their currencies. Our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk is exacerbated by our investments in certain emerging markets.     Our pending acquisition of Alico will increase our exposure to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar and increase our exposure to emerging markets.     We have matched substantially all of our foreign currency liabilities in our foreign subsidiaries with investments denominated in their respective foreign currency, which limits the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuation on local operating results; however, fluctuations in such rates affect the translation of these results into our U.S. dollar basis consolidated financial statements. Although we take certain actions to address this risk, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation could materially adversely affect our reported results due to unhedged positions or the failure of hedges to effectively offset the impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation. See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”     Our International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks that Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our Profitability     Our international operations face political, legal, operational and other risks that we do not face in our domestic operations. We face the risk of discriminatory regulation, nationalization or expropriation of assets, price controls and exchange controls or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which they operate or converting local currencies we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies. Some of our foreign insurance operations are, and are likely to continue to be, in emerging markets where these risks are heightened. See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” In addition, we rely on local sales forces in these countries and may encounter labor problems resulting from workers’ associations and trade unions in some countries. In Japan, China and India we operate with local business partners with the resulting risk of managing partner relationships to the business objectives. If our business model is not successful in a particular country, we may lose all or most of our investment in building and training the sales force in that country. Our pending acquisition of Alico will increase our exposure to these risks. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Overview” and Note 2 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.     We are currently planning to expand our international operations in certain markets where we operate and in selected new markets. This may require considerable management time, as well as start-up expenses for market development before any significant revenues and earnings are generated. Operations in new foreign markets may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable, and expansion in existing markets may be affected by local economic and market conditions. Therefore, as we expand internationally, we may not achieve expected operating margins and our results of operations may be negatively impacted.     174    Table of Contents    In recent years, the operating environment in Argentina has been very challenging. In Argentina, we were formerly principally engaged in the pension business. In December 2008, the Argentine government nationalized private pensions and seized the pension funds’ investments, eliminating the private pensions business in Argentina. As a result, we have experienced and will continue to experience reductions in the operation’s revenues and cash flows. The Argentine government now controls all assets which previously were managed by our Argentine pension operations. Further governmental or legal actions related to our operations in Argentina could negatively impact our operations in Argentina and result in future losses.     See also “— Changes in Market Interest Rates May Significantly Affect Our Profitability” regarding the impact of low interest rates on our Taiwanese operations.     An Inability to Access Our Credit Facilities Could Result in a Reduction in Our Liquidity and Lead to Downgrades in Our Credit and Financial Strength Ratings     We have a $2.85 billion five-year revolving credit facility that matures in June 2012, as well as other facilities which we enter into in the ordinary course of business. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Holding Company — Liquidity and Capital Sources — Credit and Committed Facilities” and Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2009 Annual Report. In addition, concurrently with our entry into the agreement to acquire Alico, we signed a commitment letter (amended and restated on March 16, 2010) with various financial institutions for a senior credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $5.0 billion. The senior credit facility will be used to finance any portion of the cash component of the purchase price of the Alico transaction that is not financed with sales of our securities. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Overview” and Note 2 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.     We rely on our credit facilities as a potential source of liquidity. The availability of these facilities could be critical to our credit and financial strength ratings and our ability to meet our obligations as they come due in a market when alternative sources of credit are tight. The credit facilities contain certain administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We must comply with covenants under our credit facilities (including the $2.85 billion five-year revolving credit facility), including a requirement to maintain a specified minimum consolidated net worth.     Our right to make borrowings under these facilities is subject to the fulfillment of certain important conditions, including our compliance with all covenants, and our ability to borrow under these facilities is also subject to the continued willingness and ability of the lenders that are parties to the facilities to provide funds. Our failure to comply with the covenants in the credit facilities or fulfill the conditions to borrowings, or the failure of lenders to fund their lending commitments (whether due to insolvency, illiquidity or other reasons) in the amounts provided for under the terms of the facilities, would restrict our ability to access these credit facilities when needed and, consequently, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.     Our Investments are Reflected Within the Consolidated Financial Statements Utilizing Different Accounting Bases and Accordingly We May Have Recognized Differences, Which May Be Significant, Between Cost and Estimated Fair Value in our Consolidated Financial Statements     Our principal investments are in fixed maturity and equity securities, trading securities, short-term investments, mortgage loans, policy loans, real estate, real estate joint ventures and other limited partnership interests and other invested assets. The carrying value of such investments is as follows:              •   Fixed maturity and equity securities are classified as available-for-sale, except for trading securities, and are reported at their estimated fair value. Unrealized investment gains and losses on these securities are recorded as a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of policyholder related amounts and deferred income taxes.         •   Trading securities are recorded at estimated fair value with subsequent changes in estimated fair value recognized in net investment income.       175    Table of Contents               •   Short-term investments include investments with remaining maturities of one year or less, but greater than three months, at the time of acquisition. Short-term investments that meet the definition of a security are stated at estimated fair value, and short-term investments that do not meet the definition of a security are stated at amortized cost, which approximates estimated fair value.         •   The carrying value of mortgage loans is stated at original cost net of repayments, amortization of premiums, accretion of discounts and valuation allowances, except for residential mortgage loans held-for-sale accounted for under the fair value option which are carried at estimated fair value, as determined on a recurring basis, and certain commercial and residential mortgage loans carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value, as determined on a nonrecurring basis.         •   Policy loans are stated at unpaid principal balances.         •   Real estate held-for-investment, including related improvements, is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.         •   Real estate joint ventures and other limited partnership interests in which we have more than a minor equity interest or more than a minor influence over the joint ventures or partnership’s operations, but where we do not have a controlling interest and are not the primary beneficiary, are carried using the equity method of accounting. We use the cost method of accounting for investments in real estate joint ventures and other limited partnership interests in which we have a minor equity investment and virtually no influence over the joint ventures or the partnership’s operations.         •   Other invested assets consist principally of freestanding derivatives with positive estimated fair values and leveraged leases. Freestanding derivatives are carried at estimated fair value with changes in estimated fair value reflected in income for both non-qualifying derivatives and derivatives in fair value hedging relationships. Changes in estimated fair value of derivatives in cash flow or in net investments in foreign operations hedging relationships are reflected as a separate component of other comprehensive income (loss). Leveraged leases are recorded net of non-recourse debt.       Investments not carried at estimated fair value in our consolidated financial statements — principally, mortgage loans held-for-investment, policy loans, real estate, real estate joint ventures, other limited partnerships and leveraged leases — may have estimated fair values which are substantially higher or lower than the carrying value reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Each of these asset classes is regularly evaluated for impairment under the accounting guidance appropriate to the respective asset class.     Proposals to Regulate Compensation, if Implemented, Could Hinder or Prevent Us From Attracting and Retaining Management and Other Employees with the Talent and Experience to Manage and Conduct Our Business Effectively     Congress is considering the possibility of regulating the compensation that financial institutions may provide to their executive officers and other employees. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC have proposed guidelines on incentive compensation that, if adopted, may apply to or impact MetLife as a bank holding company. These restrictions could hinder or prevent us from attracting and retaining management and other employees with the talent and experience to manage and conduct our business effectively. They could also limit our tax deductions for certain compensation paid to executive employees in excess of specified amounts. We may also be subject to requirements and restrictions on our business if we participate in some of the programs established in whole or in part under EESA.     Although American International Group, Inc. (“AIG”), the parent company of Alico, has received assurances from the TARP Special Master for Executive Compensation that neither we nor Alico will be subject to compensation-related requirements and restrictions under programs established in whole or in part under EESA, there can be no assurance that the acquisition of Alico will not lead to greater public or governmental scrutiny, regulation, or restrictions on our compensation practices as a result of our acquisition of Alico and expansion into new markets outside the United States, whether in connection with AIG’s having received U.S. government funding or as a result of other factors.     176    Table of Contents    State Laws, Federal Laws, Our Certificate of Incorporation and Our By-Laws May Delay, Deter or Prevent Takeovers and Business Combinations that Stockholders Might Consider in Their Best Interests     State laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders might consider in their best interests. For instance, they may prevent stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of MetLife, Inc.’s common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of MetLife, Inc.’s common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.     Any person seeking to acquire a controlling interest in us would face various regulatory obstacles which may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders of MetLife, Inc. might consider in their best interests. First, the insurance laws and regulations of the various states in which MetLife, Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries are organized may delay or impede a business combination involving us. State insurance laws prohibit an entity from acquiring control of an insurance company without the prior approval of the domestic insurance regulator. Under most states’ statutes, an entity is presumed to have control of an insurance company if it owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting stock of that insurance company or its parent company. We are also subject to banking regulations, and may in the future become subject to additional regulations. The Obama Administration and Congress have made various proposals that could restrict or impede consolidation, mergers and acquisitions by systemically significant firms and/or bank holding companies. In addition, the Investment Company Act would require approval by the contract owners of our variable contracts in order to effectuate a change of control of any affiliated investment adviser to a mutual fund underlying our variable contracts. Finally, FINRA approval would be necessary for a change of control of any FINRA registered broker-dealer that is a direct or indirect subsidiary of MetLife, Inc.     In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may affect the ability of an “interested stockholder” to engage in certain business combinations, including mergers, consolidations or acquisitions of additional shares, for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder becomes an “interested stockholder.” An “interested stockholder” is defined to include persons owning, directly or indirectly, 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation.     MetLife, Inc.’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws also contain provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders might consider in their best interests. These provisions may adversely affect prevailing market prices for MetLife, Inc.’s common stock and include: classification of MetLife, Inc.’s Board of Directors into three classes; a prohibition on the calling of special meetings by stockholders; advance notice procedures for the nomination of candidates to the Board of Directors and stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings; and supermajority voting requirements for the amendment of certain provisions of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws.     Legislative and Regulatory Activity in Health Care and Other Employee Benefits Could Increase the Costs or Administrative Burdens of Providing Benefits to Our Employees or Hinder or Prevent Us From Attracting and Retaining Employees, or Affect our Profitability As a Provider of Life Insurance, Annuities, and Non-Medical Health Insurance Benefit Products.     The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed into law on March 23, 2010, and The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, signed into law on March 30, 2010 (together, the “Health Care Act”), may lead to fundamental changes in the way that employers, including us, provide health care benefits, other benefits, and other forms of compensation to their employees and former employees. Among other changes, and subject to various effective dates, the Health Care Act generally restricts certain limits on benefits, mandates coverage for certain kinds of care, extends the required coverage of dependent children through age 26, eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions or limitations, requires cost reporting and, in some cases, requires premium rebates to participants under certain circumstances, limits coverage waiting periods, establishes several penalties on employers who fail to offer sufficient coverage to their full-time employees, and requires employers under certain circumstances to provide employees with vouchers to purchase their own health care coverage. The Health Care Act also provides for increased taxation of “high cost” coverage, restricts the tax deductibility of certain compensation paid by health care and some other insurers, reduces the tax deductibility of retiree health care costs      177    Table of Contents    to the extent of any retiree prescription drug benefit subsidy provided to the employer by the federal government, increases Medicare payroll taxes on certain high earners, and establishes health insurance “exchanges” for individual purchase of health insurance.     The impact of the Health Care Act on us as an employer and on the benefit plans we sponsor for employees or retirees and their dependents, whether those benefits remain competitive or effective in meeting their business objectives, and our costs to provide such benefits and our tax liabilities in connection with benefits or compensation, cannot be predicted. Furthermore, we cannot predict the impact of choices that will be made by various regulators, including the United States Treasury and Internal Revenue Service, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and state regulators, to promulgate regulations or guidance, or to make determinations under or related to the Health Care Act. Either the Health Care Act or any of these regulatory actions could adversely affect our ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented associates. They could also result in increased or unpredictable costs to provide employee benefits, and could harm our competitive position if we are subject to fees, penalties, tax provisions or other limitations in the Health Care Act and our competitors are not.     The Health Care Act also imposes requirements on us as a provider of life insurance, annuities, and non-medical health insurance benefit products, subject to various effective dates. It also imposes requirements on the purchasers of certain of these products. We cannot predict the impact of the Act or of regulations, guidance or determinations made by various regulators, on the various products that we offer. Either the Health Care Act or any of these regulatory actions could adversely affect our ability to offer certain of these products in the same manner as we do today. They could also result in increased or unpredictable costs to provide certain products, and could harm our competitive position if the Health Care Act has a disparate impact on our products compared to products offered by our competitors.           Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
