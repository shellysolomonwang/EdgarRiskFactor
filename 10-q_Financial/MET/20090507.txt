Item 1A.    Risk Factors       The following should be read in conjunction with and supplements and amends the factors that may affect the Company’s business or operations described under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, of the 2008 Annual Report.     There Can be No Assurance that Actions of the U.S. Government, Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Other Governmental and Regulatory Bodies for the Purpose of Stabilizing the Financial Markets Will Achieve the Intended Effect     In response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions, on October 3, 2008, President Bush signed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (“EESA”) into law. Pursuant to EESA, the U.S. Treasury has the authority to, among other things, purchase up to $700 billion of mortgage-backed and other securities (including newly issued preferred shares and subordinated debt) from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets. The Federal Government, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering taking other actions to address the financial crisis. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has been making funds available to commercial and financial companies under a number of programs, including the Commercial Paper Funding Facility. The U.S. Treasury has published outlines of programs based in part on EESA and in part on the separate authority of the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC, that could lead to purchases from banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions of certain kinds of assets for which valuations have been low and markets weak. Legislation is pending in Congress that will allow bankruptcy judges in certain bankruptcy proceedings to alter the terms of certain mortgages, including reducing the principal amount of the loan.     There can be no assurance as to what impact such actions will have on the financial markets, whether on the level of volatility, the level of lending by financial institutions, the prices buyers are willing to pay for financial assets or otherwise. Continued volatility, low levels of credit availability and low prices for financial assets materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock. Furthermore, if the mortgage-related legislation is passed, it could cause loss of principal on certain of our nonagency prime residential mortgage backed security holdings and could cause a ratings downgrade in such holdings which, in turn, would cause an increase in unrealized losses on such securities. See “Risk Factors — We Are Exposed to Significant Financial and Capital Markets Risk Which May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity, and Our Net Investment Income Can Vary from Period to Period” in the 2008 Annual Report. In addition, the Federal Government (including the FDIC) and private lenders have begun programs to reduce the monthly payment obligations of mortgagors and/or reduce the principal payable on residential mortgages. As a result, we may need to engage in similar activities in order to remain competitive. The choices made by the U.S. Treasury in its distribution of amounts available under EESA and under the proposed new asset purchase programs could have the effect of supporting some parts of the financial system more than others. See “Risk Factors — Competitive Factors May Adversely Affect Our Market Share and Profitability” in the 2008 Annual Report. We cannot predict whether the $700 billion of funds to be made available pursuant to EESA will be enough to stabilize the financial markets or, if additional amounts are necessary, whether Congress will be willing to make the necessary appropriations, what the public’s sentiment would be towards any such appropriations, or what additional requirements or conditions might be imposed on the use of any such additional funds.    219    Table of Contents   MetLife, Inc. and some or all of its affiliates may be eligible to sell assets under one or more of the programs established in whole or in part under EESA, and some of their assets may be among those that are eligible for purchase under the programs. MetLife, Inc. and some of its affiliates may also be eligible to invest in vehicles established to purchase troubled assets from other financial institutions under these programs, and to borrow funds under other programs to purchase specified types of asset-backed securities. Furthermore, as a bank holding company, MetLife, Inc. could be selected to participate in a capital infusion program established by the U.S. Treasury under EESA, pursuant to which the U.S. Treasury purchases preferred shares of banking institutions or their holding companies and acquires warrants for their common shares. If we participate in a capital infusion program or if we sell assets pursuant to EESA, we may become subject to requirements and restrictions on our business, including restrictions on the compensation that we can offer or pay to certain employees, including incentives or performance-based compensation. These restrictions could hinder or prevent us from attracting and retaining management and other employees with the talent and experience to manage and conduct our business effectively. Limits on our ability to deduct certain compensation paid to certain employees could also be imposed. We may also be subject to requirements and restrictions on our business if we participate in other programs established in whole or in part under EESA. Issuing preferred shares and warrants could also dilute the ownership interests of stockholders or affect our ability to raise capital in other transactions. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Extraordinary Market Conditions” in the 2008 Annual Report. In April 2009, we announced that we have elected not to participate in the Capital Purchase Program, a voluntary capital infusion program established by the U.S. Treasury under EESA. We also announced that we are one of the 19 bank holding companies participating in the U.S. Treasury’s capital planning exercise conducted under the Capital Assistance Program, another capital infusion program established by the U.S. Treasury. If some of our competitors receive funding under the Capital Purchase Program or another capital infusion program, our competitive position could be adversely affected.     The Impairment of Other Financial Institutions Could Adversely Affect Us     We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, hedge funds and other investment funds and other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty. In addition, with respect to secured transactions, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due to us. We also have exposure to these financial institutions in the form of unsecured debt instruments, non-redeemable and redeemable preferred securities, derivative transactions and equity investments. Further, potential action by governments and regulatory bodies in response to the financial crisis affecting the global banking system and financial markets, such as investment, nationalization, conservatorship, receivership and other intervention, whether under existing legal authority or any new authority that may be created, could negatively impact these instruments, securities, transactions and investments. There can be no assurance that any such losses or impairments to the carrying value of these assets would not materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.     Catastrophes May Adversely Impact Liabilities for Policyholder Claims and Reinsurance Availability     Our life insurance operations are exposed to the risk of catastrophic mortality, such as a pandemic or other event that causes a large number of deaths. Significant influenza pandemics have occurred three times in the last century, but neither the likelihood, timing, nor the severity of a future pandemic can be predicted. A significant pandemic could have a major impact on the global economy or the economies of particular countries or regions, including travel, trade, tourism, the health system, food supply, consumption, overall economic output and, eventually, on the financial markets, and could deepen the U.S. and global recession. In addition, a pandemic that affected our employees or the employees of our distributors or of other companies with which we do business could disrupt our business operations. The effectiveness of external parties, including governmental and non-governmental organizations, in combating the spread and severity of such a pandemic could have a material impact on the losses experienced by us. In our group insurance operations, a localized event that affects the workplace of one or more of our group insurance customers could cause a significant loss due to mortality or    220    Table of Contents   morbidity claims. These events could cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations in any period and, depending on their severity, could also materially and adversely affect our financial condition.     Our Auto & Home business has experienced, and will likely in the future experience, catastrophe losses that may have a material adverse impact on the business, results of operations and financial condition of the Auto & Home segment. Although Auto & Home makes every effort to manage our exposure to catastrophic risks through volatility management and reinsurance programs, these efforts do not eliminate all risk. Catastrophes can be caused by various events, including pandemics, hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, tornadoes, explosions, severe winter weather (including snow, freezing water, ice storms and blizzards), fires and man-made events such as terrorist attacks. Historically, substantially all of our catastrophe-related claims have related to homeowners coverages. However, catastrophes may also affect other Auto & Home coverages. Due to their nature, we cannot predict the incidence, timing and severity of catastrophes. In addition, changing climate conditions, primarily rising global temperatures, may be increasing, or may in the future increase, the frequency and severity of natural catastrophes such as hurricanes.     Hurricanes and earthquakes are of particular note for our homeowners coverages. Areas of major hurricane exposure include coastal sections of the northeastern United States (including lower New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts), the Gulf Coast (including Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas) and Florida. We also have some earthquake exposure, primarily along the New Madrid fault line in the central United States and in the Pacific Northwest.     The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event. Most catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas; however, pandemics, hurricanes, earthquakes and man-made catastrophes may produce significant damage in larger areas, especially those that are heavily populated. Claims resulting from natural or man-made catastrophic events could cause substantial volatility in our financial results for any fiscal quarter or year and could materially reduce our profitability or harm our financial condition. Also, catastrophic events could harm the financial condition of our reinsurers and thereby increase the probability of default on reinsurance recoveries. Our ability to write new business could also be affected. It is possible that increases in the value, caused by the effects of inflation or other factors, and geographic concentration of insured property, could increase the severity of claims from catastrophic events in the future.     Most of the jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business require life and property and casualty insurers doing business within the jurisdiction to participate in guaranty associations, which are organized to pay contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by impaired, insolvent or failed insurers. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired, insolvent or failed insurer is engaged. In addition, certain states have government owned or controlled organizations providing life and property and casualty insurance to their citizens. The activities of such organizations could also place additional stress on the adequacy of guaranty fund assessments. Many of these organizations also have the power to levy assessments similar to those of the guaranty associations described above. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. See “Business — Regulation — Insurance Regulation — Guaranty Associations and Similar Arrangements” in the 2008 Annual Report.     While in the past five years, the aggregate assessments levied against MetLife have not been material, it is possible that a large catastrophic event could render such guaranty funds inadequate and we may be called upon to contribute additional amounts, which may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations in a particular period. We have established liabilities for guaranty fund assessments that we consider adequate for assessments with respect to insurers that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings, but additional liabilities may be necessary. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Insolvency Assessments” in the 2008 Annual Report     Consistent with industry practice and accounting standards, we establish liabilities for claims arising from a catastrophe only after assessing the probable losses arising from the event. We cannot be certain that the liabilities we have established will be adequate to cover actual claim liabilities. From time to time, states have passed    221    Table of Contents   legislation that has the effect of limiting the ability of insurers to manage risk, such as legislation restricting an insurer’s ability to withdraw from catastrophe-prone areas. While we attempt to limit our exposure to acceptable levels, subject to restrictions imposed by insurance regulatory authorities, a catastrophic event or multiple catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.     Our ability to manage this risk and the profitability of our property and casualty and life insurance businesses depends in part on our ability to obtain catastrophe reinsurance, which may not be available at commercially acceptable rates in the future. See “Risk Factors — Reinsurance May Not Be Available, Affordable or Adequate to Protect Us Against Losses” in our 2008 Annual Report.     Our Insurance Businesses Are Heavily Regulated, and Changes in Regulation May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth     Our insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of insurance and other laws and regulations. See “Business — Regulation — Insurance Regulation” in the 2008 Annual Report. State insurance laws regulate most aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled and the states in which they are licensed. Our non-U.S. insurance operations are principally regulated by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled and operate.     State laws in the United States grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things:              •   licensing companies and agents to transact business;         •   calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements;         •   mandating certain insurance benefits;         •   regulating certain premium rates;         •   reviewing and approving policy forms;         •   regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements;         •   regulating advertising;         •   protecting privacy;         •   establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards;         •   fixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts;         •   approving changes in control of insurance companies;         •   restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates; and         •   regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments.       State insurance guaranty associations have the right to assess insurance companies doing business in their state for funds to help pay the obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. Because the amount and timing of an assessment is beyond our control, the liabilities that we have currently established for these potential liabilities may not be adequate. See “Business — Regulation — Insurance Regulation — Guaranty Associations and Similar Arrangements” in the 2008 Annual Report.     State insurance regulators and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the insurer and, thus, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.     The NAIC and several states’ legislatures have considered the need for regulations and/or laws to address agent or broker practices that have been the focus of investigations of broker compensation in the State of New York and in other jurisdictions. The NAIC adopted a Compensation Disclosure Amendment to its Producers Licensing    222    Table of Contents   Model Act which, if adopted by the states, would require disclosure by agents or brokers to customers that insurers will compensate such agents or brokers for the placement of insurance and documented acknowledgement of this arrangement in cases where the customer also compensates the agent or broker. Several states have enacted laws similar to the NAIC amendment. We cannot predict how many states may promulgate the NAIC amendment or alternative regulations or the extent to which these regulations may have a material adverse impact on our business.     Currently, the U.S. federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance. However, federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies. These areas include financial services regulation, securities regulation, pension regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation. In addition, various forms of direct federal regulation of insurance have been proposed, including proposals for the establishment of an optional federal charter for insurance companies. In view of recent events involving certain financial institutions and the financial markets, it is possible that the U.S. federal government will heighten its oversight of insurers and/or insurance holding companies such as us, including possibly through a federal system of insurance regulation, new powers for the regulation of systemic risk to the financial system and the resolution of systemically significant financial companies and/or that the oversight responsibilities and mandates of existing or newly created regulatory bodies could change. We cannot predict whether these or other proposals will be adopted, or what impact, if any, such proposals or, if enacted, such laws, could have on our business, financial condition or results of operations or on our dealings with other financial institutions.     Our international operations are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they operate, which in many ways is similar to that of the state regulation outlined above. Many of our customers and independent sales intermediaries also operate in regulated environments. Changes in the regulations that affect their operations also may affect our business relationships with them and their ability to purchase or distribute our products. Accordingly, these changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See “Risk Factors — Our International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks that Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our Profitability” in the 2008 Annual Report.     Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance and other expenses of doing business, thus having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.     From time to time, regulators raise issues during examinations or audits of MetLife, Inc.’s subsidiaries that could, if determined adversely, have a material impact on us. We cannot predict whether or when regulatory actions may be taken that could adversely affect our operations. In addition, the interpretations of regulations by regulators may change and statutes may be enacted with retroactive impact, particularly in areas such as accounting or statutory reserve requirements.     We are also subject to other regulations, including banking regulations, and may in the future become subject to additional regulations.
