Item 1A. Risk Factors, for further information.103Table of ContentsU.S. Tax ReformOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law H.R.1, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“U.S. Tax Reform”). U.S. Tax Reform includes numerous changes in tax law, including a permanent reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, which took effect for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2018, a participation exemption system which generally eliminates U.S. federal income tax on dividends received from foreign subsidiaries, and a number of other revenue raisers. Given the complexities of U.S. Tax Reform, amounts recorded may change, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions made by the Company, additional guidance that may be issued and actions that the Company may take. The Company continues to anticipate its 2018 effective tax rate to be in the range of 18% to 20%. See Notes 1 and 13 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of U.S. Tax Reform and the impact to the Company in the third quarter of 2018. Separation of Brighthouse On August 4, 2017, MetLife, Inc. completed the separation of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Brighthouse”) through a distribution of 96,776,670 shares of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. common stock to the MetLife, Inc. common shareholders (the “Separation”). MetLife, Inc. retained the remaining ownership interest of 22,996,436 shares, or 19.2%, of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. common stock outstanding. The Separation resulted in the elimination of the Brighthouse Financial segment. The results of Brighthouse are reflected in the Company’s interim condensed consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations and, therefore, are presented as income (loss) from discontinued operations on the interim condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The reporting of discontinued operations had no impact on total consolidated net income (loss) for any of the periods presented. In June 2018, the Company sold fair value option (“FVO”) Brighthouse Financial, Inc. common stock (“FVO Brighthouse Common Stock”) in exchange for $944 million aggregate principal amount of MetLife, Inc. senior notes, which MetLife, Inc. canceled. At September 30, 2018, the Company no longer held any shares of Brighthouse Financial, Inc. for its own account; however, certain insurance company separate accounts managed by the Company held shares of Brighthouse Financial, Inc.See Notes 3 and 9 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.104Table of ContentsCurrent Period HighlightsDuring the three months ended September 30, 2018, overall sales decreased compared to the prior period despite increases in many of our businesses. In our U.S. segment, our Retirement and Income Solutions (“RIS”) business experienced lower sales of stable value products and pension risk transfers, as well as a decrease in funding agreement issuances, while sales from our Group Benefits and Property & Casualty businesses improved. In Japan, sales of foreign currency-denominated annuity products, as well as accident & health products, increased. Our Asia segment also benefited from a group case sale in Australia and higher sales from emerging markets, mainly in China. In addition, positive net flows drove an increase in our investment portfolio and investment yields improved, however, interest credited rates were higher. Results declined due to the impact of our annual actuarial assumption review in both periods. The favorable change in net investment gains (losses) reflected the prior period loss on our retained investment in Brighthouse Financial, Inc. recognized in connection with the Separation. Changes in long-term interest rates drove an unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses). Our results for the prior period included a loss from the operations of Brighthouse that are reflected in discontinued operations.The following represents segment level results and percentage contributions to total segment level adjusted earnings available to common shareholders for the three months ended September 30, 2018:__________________ (1)Excludes Corporate & Other adjusted loss available to common shareholders of $237 million. (2)Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, adjusted earnings is our GAAP measure of segment performance. For additional information see Note 2 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 105Table of ContentsThree Months Ended September 30, 2018 Compared with the Three Months Ended September 30, 2017Consolidated Results -

MetLife is currently evaluating the impact of Hurricane Michael on its Property & Casualty business reported in the U.S. segment, and estimates a potential loss of approximately $10 million to $13 million ($8 million to $10 million, net of income tax), which has not yet been recorded as of September 30, 2018.In September 2018, Hurricane Florence made landfall in North Carolina and South Carolina causing loss of lives and extensive property damage. As of September 30, 2018, MetLife’s Property & Casualty business recognized a loss from Hurricane Florence of $15 million ($12 million, net of income tax).Additional storm-related losses may be recorded in future periods as claims are received from insureds.Argentina Highly Inflationary The inflation levels in Argentina have been elevated for several years. In the first half of 2018, Argentina’s reported inflation rates began to increase dramatically and the Argentine central bank significantly increased interest rates in an effort to combat inflation. Based on Argentina’s reported inflation rates and trends, as of July 1, 2018, we designated Argentina as a highly inflationary economy for accounting purposes. In the third quarter of 2018, the change to highly inflationary accounting did not have a material impact on the Company’s interim condensed consolidated financial statements. Industry Trends The following information on industry trends should be read in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends” in Part II, Item 7, of the 2017 Annual Report.The changing global financial and economic environment that affects our industry also continues to affect us.Financial and Economic EnvironmentOur business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. Stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in global capital markets, particular markets, or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large investment portfolio and our insurance liabilities and derivatives are sensitive to changing market factors. See “Risk Factors — Economic Environment and Capital Markets-Related Risks — We Are Exposed to Significant Global Financial and Capital Markets Risks Which May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity, and May Cause Our Net Investment Income to Vary from Period to Period” and “Risk Factors — Economic Environment and Capital Markets-Related Risks — Difficult Conditions in the Global Capital Markets and the Economy Generally May Materially Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations” in the 2017 Annual Report. 109Table of ContentsWe have market presence in numerous countries and, therefore, our business operations are exposed to risks posed by local and regional economic conditions. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — Our International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks, Including Exposure to Local and Regional Economic Conditions, That Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our Profitability” and “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — Fluctuations in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Could Negatively Affect Our Profitability” in the 2017 Annual Report. See “— Executive Summary — Other Key Information — Argentina Highly Inflationary” for further information regarding the impact of Argentina’s highly inflationary economy on the Company’s interim condensed consolidated financial statements. We are closely monitoring political and economic conditions that might contribute to global market volatility and impact our business operations, investment portfolio and derivatives. For example, events following the U.K.’s referendum on June 23, 2016 and the uncertainties, including foreign currency exchange risks, associated with its pending withdrawal from the European Union (“EU”), have contributed to market volatility, both in the U.S. and beyond. These factors could contribute to weakening Gross Domestic Product growth, primarily in the U.K. and, to a lesser degree, in continental Europe. The magnitude and longevity of the potential negative economic impacts would depend on the detailed agreements reached by the U.K. and the EU as a result of the negotiations regarding future trade and other arrangements. See “— Investments — Current Environment — Selected Country Investments.” We are also monitoring the imposition of tariffs or other barriers to international trade, changes to international trade agreements, and their potential impacts on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “Risk Factors — Economic Environment and Capital Markets-Related Risks — Difficult Conditions in the Global Capital Markets and the Economy Generally May Materially Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations” and “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — Our International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks, Including Exposure to Local and Regional Economic Conditions, That Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our Profitability” in the 2017 Annual Report. Central banks around the world are using monetary policy to address regional economic conditions. For example, in the United States, citing a strengthening economy, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve Board”) has continued along its stated path of balance sheet tapering and the Federal Reserve Board’s Federal Open Market Committee has continued to increase the federal funds rate, most recently in September 2018. While the European Central Bank has continued to expand its balance sheet via quantitative easing, it is doing so at a slower pace and is expected to end quantitative easing by the end of 2018. In Japan, however, the Japanese government and the Bank of Japan are maintaining stimulus measures in order to boost inflation expectations and achieve sustainable economic growth in Japan. Such measures include the imposition of a negative rate on commercial bank deposits, continued government bond purchases and tax reform, including the lowering of the Japanese corporate tax rate and the delay until 2019 of an increase in the consumption tax to 10%. Going forward, Japan’s structural and demographic challenges may continue to limit its potential growth unless reforms that boost productivity are put into place. Japan’s high public sector debt levels are mitigated by low refinancing risks. Further actions by central banks in the future may affect interest rates and risk markets in the U.S., Europe, Japan and other developed and emerging economies, and may ultimately result in market volatility. We cannot predict with certainty the effect of these actions or the impact on our business operations, investment portfolio or derivatives. See “— Investments — Current Environment.”Impact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate EnvironmentDuring sustained periods of low interest rates, we may have to invest insurance cash flows and reinvest the cash flows we received as interest or return of principal on our investments in lower yielding instruments. Moreover, borrowers may prepay or redeem the fixed income securities, mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities in our investment portfolio with greater frequency in order to borrow at lower market rates. Therefore, some of our products expose us to the risk that a reduction in interest rates will reduce the difference between the amounts that we are required to credit on contracts in our general account and the rate of return we are able to earn on investments intended to support obligations under these contracts. This difference between interest earned and interest credited, or margin, is a key metric for the management of, and reporting for, many of our businesses.Our expectations regarding future margins are an important component impacting the amortization of certain intangible assets such as DAC and value of business acquired (“VOBA”). Significantly lower margins may cause us to accelerate the amortization, thereby reducing net income in the affected reporting period. Additionally, lower margins may also impact the recoverability of intangible assets such as goodwill, require the establishment of additional liabilities or trigger loss recognition events on certain policyholder liabilities. We review this long-term margin assumption, along with other assumptions, as part of our annual actuarial assumption review. See “— Results of Operations — Consolidated Results — Three Months Ended September 30, 2018 Compared with the Three Months Ended September 30, 2017 — Actuarial Assumption Review and Certain Other Insurance Adjustments” for further information.110Table of ContentsSome of our separate account products, including variable annuities, have certain minimum guarantee benefits. Declining interest rates increase the reserves we need to set up to protect the guarantee benefits, thereby reducing net income in the affected reporting period.In formulating economic assumptions for its insurance contract assumptions, the Company uses projections that it makes regarding interest rates. Included in these assumptions is the projection that the 10-year Treasury rate will rise to 4.25% by 2027. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends — Impact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment — Low Interest Rate Scenario” included in the 2017 Annual Report for further information.Competitive PressuresThe life insurance industry remains highly competitive. Product development is focused on differentiation leading to more intense competition with respect to product features and services. Several of the industry’s products can be quite homogeneous and subject to intense price competition. Cost reduction efforts are a priority for industry players, with benefits resulting in price adjustments to favor customers and reinvestment capacity. Larger companies have the ability to invest in brand equity, product development, technology optimization, risk management, and innovation, which are among the fundamentals for sustained profitable growth in the life insurance industry. Insurers are focused on their core businesses, specifically in markets where they can achieve scale. Insurers are increasingly seeking alternative sources of revenue; there is a focus on monetization of assets, fee-based services, and opportunities to offer comprehensive solutions, which include providing value-added services along with traditional products. Financial strength and flexibility and technology modernization are prerequisites for sustainable growth in the life insurance industry. Larger market participants tend to have the capacity to invest in analytics, distribution, and information technology and have the capability to engage with the new digital entrants. There is a shift in distribution from proprietary to third party models in mature markets, due to the lower cost structure. Evolving customer expectations are having a significant impact on the competitive environment as insurers strive to offer the superior customer service demanded by an increasingly sophisticated industry client base. We believe that the continued volatility of the financial markets and its impact on the capital position of many competitors will continue to strain the competitive environment. Legislative and other changes affecting the regulatory environment can also affect the competitive environment within the life insurance industry and within the broader financial services industry. See “— Industry Trends — Regulatory Developments,” as well as “Business — Regulation” in the 2017 Annual Report, as amended or supplemented in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends — Regulatory Developments.” We believe that the aforementioned factors have highlighted financial strength, technology efficiency, and organizational agility as the most significant differentiators and, as a result, we believe the Company is well positioned to compete in this environment.Regulatory DevelopmentsThe following discussion on regulatory developments should be read in conjunction with “Business — Regulation” in the 2017 Annual Report, as amended or supplemented in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends — Regulatory Developments.”In the United States, our life insurance companies are regulated primarily at the state level by state insurance regulators, with some products and services also subject to federal regulation. In addition, MetLife, Inc. and its U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation under the insurance holding company laws of various U.S. jurisdictions. Furthermore, some of MetLife’s operations, products and services are subject to consumer protection laws, securities, broker-dealer and investment adviser regulations, environmental and unclaimed property laws and regulations, and to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. See “— U.S. Regulation” below, as well as “Business — Regulation — U.S. Regulation,” “Risk Factors — Regulatory and Legal Risks — Our Insurance, Pensions and Brokerage Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth,” “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — Our Statutory Life Insurance Reserve Financings May Be Subject to Cost Increases and New Financings May Be Subject to Limited Market Capacity,” and “Risk Factors — Regulatory and Legal Risks — Changes in U.S. Federal, State Securities and State Insurance Laws and Regulations May Affect Our Operations and Our Profitability” included in the 2017 Annual Report, as amended or supplemented in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends — Regulatory Developments” and similarly named sections under the caption “Risk Factors.”111Table of ContentsOur international insurance operations are principally regulated by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are located or operate. In addition, our investment and pension companies outside of the U.S. are subject to oversight by the relevant securities, pension and other authorities of the jurisdictions in which the companies operate. Our non-U.S. insurance businesses are also subject to current and developing solvency regimes which impose various capital and other requirements. Additionally, we may be subject in the future to enhanced capital standards, supervision and additional requirements of other international and global regulatory initiatives. See “— International Regulation” below, as well as “Business — Regulation — International Regulation” and “Risk Factors — Regulatory and Legal Risks — Our Insurance, Pensions and Brokerage Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth,” included in the 2017 Annual Report, as amended or supplemented in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends — Regulatory Developments” and similarly named sections under the caption “Risk Factors.”U.S. Regulation Insurance RegulationNAICIn 2015, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) commenced an initiative to study variable annuity solvency regulations, with the goal of curtailing the use of variable annuity captives. In connection with this initiative, the NAIC engaged a third-party consultant to develop recommendations regarding reserve and capital requirements. Following several public exposures of the consultant’s recommendations, the NAIC recently adopted a new variable annuity framework, which is designed to reduce the level and volatility of the non-economic aspect of reserve and risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements for variable annuity products. The NAIC will now prepare technical language in various NAIC manuals and guidelines that is necessary to implement the new framework. We cannot predict the impact of this framework on our business until such technical requirements of the framework are completed, and we cannot predict whether the New York Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) or other state insurance regulators will adopt standards different from the NAIC framework. Surplus and Capital; Risk-Based CapitalThe NYDFS issued its annual “Special Considerations” letter (“SCL”) to New York licensed insurers on November 2, 2018, including to one of our primary insurance subsidiaries, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. The SCL includes certain provisions that require us, among other things, to use certain assumptions and perform certain tests as part of year-end asset adequacy testing. While we are currently evaluating the SCL’s potential impact, we do not anticipate the SCL will affect our ratio of free cash flow to adjusted earnings guidance.For developments that could affect our ratio of free cash flow to adjusted earnings results, see “Risk Factors” included in the 2017 Annual Report, as amended or supplemented in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. 112Table of ContentsInternational RegulationOn October 28, 2018, Chilean President Piñera announced a new pension reform proposal to be submitted to Congress. The proposal would increase employer mandatory contributions and affirms private pension fund administration. We are not able to predict with certainty whether such proposal will be adopted and cannot currently identify all of the risks or opportunities, if any, that may be posed to our business in Chile.Other International and Global Regulatory InitiativesThe International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”), an association of insurance supervisors and regulators and a member of the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”), an international entity established to coordinate, develop and promote regulatory, supervisory and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability, is participating in the FSB’s initiative to identify and manage systemic risk globally. Beginning in 2013, the FSB annually designated certain insurers as globally systemically important insurers (“G-SIIs”) using an assessment methodology developed and implemented by the IAIS. In November 2016, MetLife, Inc. and eight other firms were designated as G-SIIs; in November 2017, the FSB announced it would not publish a new list of G-SIIs pending further consideration in late 2018. The FSB also recommended that the IAIS continue development of an activities-based approach (“ABA”) to assessing and managing potential systemic risk in the insurance sector and in July 2018 the IAIS announced their intention to publicly consult on a holistic systemic risk framework at the end of the year. As described, this would be a three pillar framework that follows many recommendations for appropriate ABA implementation. The fate of the entity-based methodology for G-SII designation with an emphasis on size remains uncertain. In 2018, the IAIS collected data and performed an assessment that excluded phase IV meetings with firms recommended for G-SII designation. We expect outcomes for 2018 to be made public during November 2018. Current standards remain as drafted for entity-based designation and call for additional requirements for G-SIIs, which include higher loss absorbency (“HLA”) requirements, and more intensive supervision, among other requirements. In February 2017, the IAIS confirmed that the risk-based global insurance capital standard (“ICS”) will replace basic capital requirements as the basis for a revised HLA and that work on revisions is deferred until adoption of the ICS by the IAIS in 2019. HLA implementation is to be delayed until 2022 for the 2020 group of G-SIIs. In November 2017, the IAIS announced an agreement regarding further development and implementation of the ICS, and the impact on timing of further development and implementation of HLA requirements is unclear.All IAIS proposals would need to be implemented at the consolidated group level by legislation or regulation in each applicable jurisdiction. As MetLife, Inc. is no longer a U.S. non-bank systemically important financial institution and none of its regulators have proposed implementing the G-SII or other capital requirements, the impact on MetLife, Inc. of such global proposals is uncertain.Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported on the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The most critical estimates include those used in determining:(i)liabilities for future policy benefits and the accounting for reinsurance;(ii)capitalization and amortization of DAC and the establishment and amortization of VOBA;(iii)estimated fair values of investments in the absence of quoted market values;(iv)investment impairments;(v)estimated fair values of freestanding derivatives and the recognition and estimated fair value of embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation;(vi)measurement of goodwill and related impairment;(vii)measurement of employee benefit plan liabilities;(viii)measurement of income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets; and(ix)liabilities for litigation and regulatory matters.113Table of ContentsIn addition, the application of acquisition accounting requires the use of estimation techniques in determining the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed — the most significant of which relate to the aforementioned critical accounting estimates. In applying these policies and estimates, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to our business and operations. Actual results could differ from these estimates.The above critical accounting estimates are described in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates” and Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2017 Annual Report.Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test.For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that goodwill to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. In such instances, the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill that would be determined in a business acquisition. The key inputs, judgments and assumptions necessary in determining estimated fair value of the reporting units include projected operating earnings, current book value, the level of economic capital required to support the mix of business, long-term growth rates, comparative market multiples, the account value of in-force business, projections of new and renewed business, as well as margins on such business, the level of interest rates, credit spreads, equity market levels, and the discount rate that we believe is appropriate for the respective reporting unit. In the third quarter of 2018, the Company tested the MetLife Holdings life reporting unit for impairment using the actuarial based embedded value fair valuation approach. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by approximately 25% and, therefore, the reporting unit was not impaired. If we had assumed that the discount rate was 100 basis points higher than the discount rate used, the estimated fair value of the MetLife Holdings life reporting unit would have been higher than the carrying value by approximately 5%. The MetLife Holdings life reporting unit consists of operations relating to products and businesses no longer actively marketed by the Company. As of September 30, 2018, the amount of goodwill allocated to the MetLife Holdings life reporting unit was $887 million.The Company also performed its annual goodwill impairment tests of all other reporting units during the third quarter of 2018 using a qualitative assessment and/or quantitative assessments under the market multiple and discounted cash flow valuation approaches based on best available data as of June 30, 2018 and concluded that the estimated fair values of all such reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values and, therefore, goodwill was not impaired.We apply significant judgment when determining the estimated fair value of our reporting units and when assessing the relationship of market capitalization to the aggregate estimated fair value of our reporting units. The valuation methodologies utilized are subject to key judgments and assumptions that are sensitive to change. Estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and represent only management’s reasonable expectation regarding future developments. These estimates and the judgments and assumptions upon which the estimates are based will, in all likelihood, differ in some respects from actual future results. Declines in the estimated fair value of our reporting units could result in goodwill impairments in future periods which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial position. Economic CapitalEconomic capital is an internally developed risk capital model, the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. The economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in our business.Our economic capital model, coupled with considerations of local capital requirements, aligns segment allocated equity with emerging standards and consistent risk principles. The model applies statistics-based risk evaluation principles to the material risks to which the Company is exposed. These consistent risk principles include calibrating required economic capital shock factors to a specific confidence level and time horizon while applying an industry standard method for the inclusion of diversification benefits among risk types. Economic capital-based risk estimation is an evolving science and industry best practices have emerged and continue to evolve. Areas of evolving industry best practices include stochastic liability valuation techniques, alternative methodologies for the calculation of diversification benefits, and the quantification of appropriate shock levels. MetLife’s management is responsible for the ongoing production and enhancement of the economic capital model and reviews its approach periodically to ensure that it remains consistent with emerging industry practice standards.114Table of ContentsSegment net investment income is credited or charged based on the level of allocated equity; however, changes in allocated equity do not impact our consolidated net investment income, income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax, or adjusted earnings. Net investment income is based upon the actual results of each segment’s specifically identifiable investment portfolios adjusted for allocated equity. Other costs are allocated to each of the segments based upon: (i) a review of the nature of such costs; (ii) time studies analyzing the amount of employee compensation costs incurred by each segment; and (iii) cost estimates included in the Company’s product pricing.Acquisitions and DispositionsSeparation of BrighthouseFor information regarding the Company’s 2018 sale of the FVO Brighthouse Common Stock, see Notes 3 and 9 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with the Separation and in the normal course of business, MetLife and Brighthouse entered into a number of transactions that are still ongoing. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. These ongoing agreements also include:Investment Management The Company entered into investment management services agreements with Brighthouse. Each agreement has an initial term of 18 months after the date of Separation, after which period either party to the agreement is permitted to terminate upon notice to the other party. During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2018, the Company recognized $30 million and $91 million, respectively, in other revenues for services provided under such investment management services agreements. After the Separation, during both the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2017, the Company recognized $18 million in other revenues for services provided under the agreements. Committed Facility MetLife Reinsurance Company of Vermont and MetLife, Inc. have a $2.9 billion committed facility which is used as collateral for certain reinsurance liabilities. At September 30, 2018, Brighthouse was a beneficiary of $2.4 billion of letters of credit issued under this facility and, in consideration, Brighthouse reimburses MetLife, Inc. for a portion of the letter of credit fees. Disposition of MetLife Afore, S.A. de C.V.See Note 3 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company’s 2018 disposition of MetLife Afore, S.A. de C.V., its pension fund management business in Mexico.115Table of ContentsResults of OperationsConsolidated ResultsBusiness Overview. Overall sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018 decreased compared to the prior period despite increases in many of our businesses. An overall decrease in sales from our U.S. segment was driven by lower sales of stable value products and pension risk transfers, as well as a decrease in funding agreement issuances in our RIS business, partially offset by increases in sales from our Group Benefits and Property & Casualty businesses. In Asia, sales improved due to growth in foreign currency-denominated annuity products, as well as accident & health products in Japan, a large group case sale in Australia and higher sales from emerging markets, mainly in China. Total sales for Latin America increased as a result of higher sales of individual accident & health products in Chile and group accident & health products in Mexico, partially offset by lower sales of retirement products in Mexico and Brazil. The closing of the wealth management product to new business in the U.K. in the third quarter of 2017, as well as declines in sales of employee benefits and life insurance products in the Gulf region resulted in lower sales for EMEA. Revenues in our MetLife Holdings segment decreased as a result of the discontinuance of the marketing of life and annuity products in early 2017.

We manage our investment portfolio using disciplined asset/liability management (“ALM”) principles, focusing on cash flow and duration to support our current and future liabilities. Our intent is to match the timing and amount of liability cash outflows with invested assets that have cash inflows of comparable timing and amount, while optimizing risk-adjusted net investment income and risk-adjusted total return. Our investment portfolio is heavily weighted toward fixed income investments, with over 80% of our portfolio invested in fixed maturity securities available-for-sale (“AFS”) and mortgage loans. These securities and loans have varying maturities and other characteristics which cause them to be generally well suited for matching the cash flow and duration of insurance liabilities. In addition, our general account investment portfolio includes, within contractholder-directed equity securities and fair value option securities (collectively, “Unit-linked and FVO Securities”), contractholder-directed equity securities supporting unit-linked variable annuity type liabilities (“Unit-linked investments”), which do not qualify as separate account assets. The returns on these Unit-linked investments, which can vary significantly from period to period, include changes in estimated fair value subsequent to purchase, inure to contractholders and are offset in earnings by a corresponding change in policyholder account balances through interest credited to policyholder account balances.We purchase investments to support our insurance liabilities and not to generate net investment gains and losses. However, net investment gains and losses are incurred and can change significantly from period to period due to changes in external influences, including changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and equity markets; counterparty specific factors such as financial performance, credit rating and collateral valuation; and internal factors such as portfolio rebalancing. Changes in these factors from period to period can significantly impact the levels of both impairments and realized gains and losses on investments sold.We also use derivatives as an integral part of our management of the investment portfolio and insurance liabilities to hedge certain risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, credit spreads and equity market levels. We use freestanding interest rate, equity, credit and currency derivatives to hedge certain invested assets and insurance liabilities. A small portion of these hedges are designated and qualify as accounting hedges, which reduce volatility in earnings. For those hedges not designated as accounting hedges, changes in market factors lead to the recognition of fair value changes in net derivative gains (losses) generally without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged, which creates volatility in earnings. During 2017, we restructured certain derivative hedges to decrease volatility from nonqualified interest rate derivatives and to help meet prospective dividend and free cash flow objectives under varying interest rate scenarios. As part of this restructuring, we replaced certain nonqualified derivatives with derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment. In addition, we also entered into replication transactions using interest rate swaps, which are accounted for at amortized cost under statutory guidelines and are nonqualified derivatives under GAAP. We actively evaluate market risk hedging needs and strategies to ensure our free cash flow and capital objectives are met under a range of market conditions. Certain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits contain embedded derivatives that are measured at estimated fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract, with changes in estimated fair value recorded in net derivative gains (losses). We use freestanding derivatives to hedge the market risks inherent in these variable annuity guarantees. Ongoing refinement of the strategy may be required to adapt to changing NAIC rules, which may become effective as early as January 1, 2019. The restructured hedge strategy is classified as a macro hedge program, included in the non-VA program derivatives section of the table below, to protect our overall statutory capital from significant adverse economic conditions. The valuation of these embedded derivatives includes a nonperformance risk adjustment, which is unhedged, and can be a significant driver of net derivative gains (losses) and volatility in earnings, but does not have an economic impact on us.117Table of ContentsNet Derivative Gains (Losses). The variable annuity embedded derivatives and associated freestanding derivative hedges are collectively referred to as “VA program derivatives.” All other derivatives that are economic hedges of certain invested assets and insurance liabilities are referred to as “non-VA program derivatives.” The table below presents the impact on net derivative gains (losses) from non-VA program derivatives and VA program derivatives: Three Months Ended September 30, 2018 2017 (In millions)Non-VA program derivatives   Interest rate$(270) $(38)Foreign currency exchange rate(44) (125)Credit81 52Equity(74) 10Non-VA embedded derivatives(20) (3)Total non-VA program derivatives(327) (104)VA program derivatives   Market risks in embedded derivatives368 322Nonperformance risk adjustment on embedded derivatives(20) (21)Other risks in embedded derivatives(161) 3Total embedded derivatives187 304Freestanding derivatives hedging embedded derivatives(238) (323)Total VA program derivatives(51) (19)Net derivative gains (losses)$(378) $(123)The unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on non-VA program derivatives was $223 million ($176 million, net of income tax). This was primarily due to long-term interest rates increasing more in the current period versus the prior period, unfavorably impacting received fixed interest rate swaps and interest rate total return swaps. In addition, equity markets increased more in the current period than in the prior period, negatively impacting equity options. These decreases were partially offset by the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to other key currencies in the current period versus weakening in the prior period, favorably impacting foreign currency swaps that primarily hedge foreign currency-denominated bonds. Because certain of these hedging strategies are not designated or do not qualify as accounting hedges, the changes in the estimated fair value of these freestanding derivatives are recognized in net derivative gains (losses) without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged. The unfavorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on VA program derivatives was $32 million ($25 million, net of income tax).This was due to an unfavorable change of $164 million ($130 million, net of income tax) in other risks in embedded derivatives, partially offset by a favorable change of $131 million ($103 million, net of income tax) in market risks in embedded derivatives net of the impact of freestanding derivatives hedging those risks. Other risks relate primarily to the impact of policyholder behavior and other non-market risks that generally cannot be hedged.The aforementioned $164 million ($130 million, net of income tax) unfavorable change in other risks in embedded derivatives reflects: •Actuarial assumption updates associated with variable annuity guarantees assumed from our former operating joint venture in Japan, and •A combination of other factors, which include fees being deducted from accounts, changes in the benefit base, premiums, lapses, withdrawals and deaths.The aforementioned $131 million ($103 million, net of income tax) favorable change reflects an $85 million ($67 million, net of income tax) favorable change in freestanding derivatives hedging market risks in embedded derivatives and a $46 million ($36 million, net of income tax) favorable change in market risks in embedded derivatives.118Table of ContentsThe primary changes in market factors are summarized as follows:•Key equity index levels increased in the current period, contributing to current period losses on our freestanding derivatives and current period gains on our embedded derivatives. The current period impact was less pronounced than the prior period, despite equity markets increasing more in the current period than in the prior period. This is due to the freestanding and embedded options becoming less sensitive to changes in equity index levels as these positions become further out of the money. For example, the S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”) 500 Index increased 7% in the current period and increased 4% in the prior period.•Long-term U.S. interest rates increased in the current period and decreased in the prior period, contributing to a favorable change in our embedded derivatives. Our freestanding interest rate derivatives were favorably impacted by the restructuring of the VA hedging strategy. For example, the 30-year U.S. swap rate increased 20 basis points in the current period and decreased 1 basis point in the prior period.Net Investment Gains (Losses). The favorable change in net investment gains (losses) of $723 million ($571 million, net of income tax) primarily reflects a prior period mark-to-market loss on our retained investment in Brighthouse Financial, Inc. recognized in connection with the Separation, partially offset by lower gains on sales of fixed maturity securities AFS and lower gains on sales of real estate joint ventures in the current period. Actuarial Assumption Review and Certain Other Insurance Adjustments. Results for the current period include a $358 million ($272 million, net of income tax) charge associated with our annual review of actuarial assumptions related to reserves and DAC, of which a $131 million loss ($94 million, net of income tax) was recognized in net derivative gains (losses). Of the $358 million charge, $20 million ($20 million, net of income tax) was related to DAC and $338 million ($252 million, net of income tax) was associated with reserves. The portion of the $358 million charge that is included in adjusted earnings is $53 million ($42 million, net of income tax).The $131 million loss recognized in net derivative gains (losses) associated with our annual review of actuarial assumptions was included within the other risks in embedded derivatives caption in the table above.As a result of our annual review of actuarial assumptions, changes were made to economic, biometric, policyholder behavior, and operational assumptions. The most significant impacts were in the Asia and MetLife Holdings segments related to Japan variable annuities and the projection of closed block results, respectively, and are summarized as follows:•Economic assumption updates resulted in net favorable changes of reserves and DAC of $38 million ($29 million, net of income tax).•Changes to biometric assumptions resulted in net favorable changes of reserves and DAC of $55 million ($44 million, net of income tax).•Changes in policyholder behavior assumptions resulted in a net charge of $321 million ($241 million, net of income tax).•Changes in operational assumptions, most notably related to closed block projections, resulted in a net charge of $130 million ($104 million, net of income tax).Results for the prior period include a $72 million ($48 million, net of prior period income tax) gain associated with our annual review of actuarial assumptions related to reserves and DAC, of which a $21 million ($14 million, net of prior period income tax) gain was recognized in net derivative gains (losses). Of the $72 million gain, a $131 million ($87 million, net of prior period income tax) gain was associated with DAC, and a loss of $59 million ($39 million, net of prior period income tax) was related to reserves. The portion of the $72 million gain that is included in adjusted earnings is $135 million ($89 million, net of prior period income tax).Certain other insurance adjustments recorded in the current period include a $79 million ($63 million, net of income tax) charge due to a current period increase in our IBNR life reserves, reflecting enhancements to our processes related to potential claims in our MetLife Holdings segment, and a favorable net insurance adjustment of $47 million ($37 million, net of income tax) resulting from reserve and DAC modeling improvements in our individual disability insurance business in our U.S. segment. These adjustments are included in adjusted earnings.Divested Businesses. Income (loss) before provision for income tax related to the divested businesses, excluding net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), increased $297 million ($272 million, net of income tax) to a loss of $23 million ($18 million, net of income tax) in the current period from a loss of $320 million ($290 million, net of income tax) in the prior period. Included in this increase was an increase in total revenues of $55 million, before income tax, and a decrease in total expenses of $242 million, before income tax. Divested businesses primarily include activity related to the Separation. 119Table of ContentsDiscontinued Operations. Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income tax, increased $968 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 from a loss of $968 million, net of income tax, for the comparable prior period. Income (loss) from discontinued operations reflects the results of our former Brighthouse Financial segment. For further information, see Notes 3 and 9 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.Taxes. Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was $164 million, or 15% of income (loss) from continuing operations before provision for income tax, compared with an income tax benefit of $398 million, or 82% of income (loss) from continuing operations before provision for income tax, for the three months ended September 30, 2017. The Company’s effective tax rates differ from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% typically due to non-taxable investment income, tax credits for investments in low income housing, and foreign earnings taxed at different rates than the U.S. statutory rate. Our prior period results include tax-related benefits of $554 million related to the Separation and $4 million from the finalization of certain tax audits, partially offset by a net tax charge of $180 million. This charge was the result of the repatriation of approximately $3.0 billion of cash following the post-Separation review of our capital needs, partially offset by a tax benefit associated with dividends from our non-U.S. operations. The changes from U.S. Tax Reform resulted in a net increase in earnings of $47 million for the third quarter of 2018 compared to the prior period, which includes a $32 million, net of income tax, reduction of net investment income in the current period related to tax credit partnership investments.Adjusted Earnings. As more fully described in “— Non-GAAP and Other Financial Disclosures,” we use adjusted earnings, which does not equate to income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax, as determined in accordance with GAAP, to analyze our performance, evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. We believe that the presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings available to common shareholders, as we measure it for management purposes, enhances the understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Adjusted earnings and other financial measures based on adjusted earnings allow analysis of our performance relative to our business plan and facilitate comparisons to industry results. Adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings available to common shareholders should not be viewed as substitutes for net income (loss) and net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders, respectively. Adjusted earnings available to common shareholders increased $261 million, net of income tax, to $1.4 billion, net of income tax, for the three months ended September 30, 2018 from $1.1 billion, net of income tax, for the three months ended September 30, 2017.120Table of ContentsNine Months Ended September 30, 2018 Compared with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, net income (loss) increased $1.4 billion from the prior period, primarily driven by favorable changes in income (loss) from discontinued operations, adjusted earnings, net derivative gains (losses) and results from our divested businesses, partially offset by a prior period tax-related benefit related to the Separation.Net Derivative Gains (Losses). The table below presents the impact on net derivative gains (losses) from non-VA program derivatives and VA program derivatives: Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 2017 (In millions)Non-VA program derivatives   Interest rate$(369) $(20)Foreign currency exchange rate245 (273)Credit48 152Equity(75) (1)Non-VA embedded derivatives4 (100)Total non-VA program derivatives(147) (242)VA program derivatives   Market risks in embedded derivatives620 880Nonperformance risk adjustment on embedded derivatives(25) (162)Other risks in embedded derivatives(244) (69)Total embedded derivatives351 649Freestanding derivatives hedging embedded derivatives(292) (942)Total VA program derivatives59 (293)Net derivative gains (losses)$(88) $(535)The favorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on non-VA program derivatives was $95 million ($75 million, net of income tax). This was primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening relative to other key currencies in the current period versus weakening in the prior period, favorably impacting foreign currency swaps that primarily hedge foreign currency-denominated bonds. There was also a change in the value of the underlying assets favorably impacting non-VA embedded derivatives related to funds withheld on a certain reinsurance agreement. These increases were partially offset by: (i) long-term interest rates increasing in the current period versus decreasing in the prior period, unfavorably impacting receive fixed interest rate swaps and interest rate total return swaps; (ii) credit spreads narrowing less in the current period than in the prior period, unfavorably impacting written credit default swaps used in replications; and (iii) equity markets increasing in the current period unfavorably impacting new equity options acquired as part of the Company’s macro hedge program. Because certain of these hedging strategies are not designated or do not qualify as accounting hedges, the changes in the estimated fair value of these freestanding derivatives are recognized in net derivative gains (losses) without an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings for the item being hedged.The favorable change in net derivative gains (losses) on VA program derivatives was $352 million ($278 million, net of income tax). This was due to a favorable change of $390 million ($308 million, net of income tax) in market risks in embedded derivatives, net of the impact of freestanding derivatives hedging those risks, and a favorable change of $137 million ($108 million, net of income tax) in the nonperformance risk adjustment on embedded derivatives, partially offset by an unfavorable change of $175 million, ($138 million, net of income tax) in other risks in embedded derivatives. Other risks relate primarily to the impact of policyholder behavior and other non-market risks that generally cannot be hedged. The aforementioned $390 million ($308 million, net of income tax) favorable change reflects a $650 million ($513 million, net of income tax) favorable change in freestanding derivatives hedging market risks in embedded derivatives partially offset by a $260 million ($205 million, net of income tax) unfavorable change in market risks in embedded derivatives.121Table of ContentsThe primary changes in market factors are summarized as follows:•Key equity index levels increased less in the current period versus the prior period, contributing to a favorable change in our freestanding derivatives and an unfavorable change in our embedded derivatives. For example, the S&P 500 Index increased 9% in the current period and increased 13% in the prior period.•Long-term U.S. interest rates increased in the current period and decreased in the prior period, contributing to a favorable change in our embedded derivatives and an unfavorable change in our freestanding derivatives. For example, the 10-year U.S. swap rate increased 72 basis points in the current period and decreased 5 basis points in the prior period.•Changes in foreign currency exchange rates contributed to a favorable change in our freestanding derivatives and an unfavorable change in our embedded derivatives related to the assumed variable annuity guarantees from our former operating joint venture in Japan. For example, the Japanese yen strengthened against the euro by 2% in the current period and weakened by 8% in the prior period.The aforementioned $175 million ($138 million, net of income tax) unfavorable change in other risks in embedded derivatives reflects:•Actuarial assumption updates associated with variable annuity guarantees assumed from our former operating joint venture in Japan,•Updates to actuarial policyholder behavior assumptions within the valuation model, and•A combination of other factors, which include fees being deducted from accounts, changes in the benefit base, premiums, lapses, withdrawals and deaths.The aforementioned $137 million ($108 million, net of income tax) favorable change in the nonperformance risk adjustment on embedded derivatives resulted from a favorable change of $112 million, before income tax, related to changes in our own credit spread, in addition to a favorable change of $25 million, before income tax, as a result of model changes and changes in capital market inputs, such as long-term interest rates and key equity index levels, on variable annuity guarantees.When equity index levels decrease in isolation, the variable annuity guarantees become more valuable to policyholders, which results in an increase in the undiscounted embedded derivative liability. Discounting this unfavorable change by the risk adjusted rate yields a smaller loss than by discounting at the risk-free rate, thus creating a gain from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk.When the risk-free interest rate decreases in isolation, discounting the embedded derivative liability produces a higher valuation of the liability than if the risk-free interest rate had remained constant. Discounting this unfavorable change by the risk adjusted rate yields a smaller loss than by discounting at the risk-free interest rate, thus creating a gain from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk.When our own credit spread increases in isolation, discounting the embedded derivative liability produces a lower valuation of the liability than if our own credit spread had remained constant. As a result, a gain is created from including an adjustment for nonperformance risk. For each of these primary market drivers, the opposite effect occurs when they move in the opposite direction.Net Investment Gains (Losses). The unfavorable change in net investment gains (losses) of $29 million ($23 million, net of income tax) primarily reflects losses on sales of fixed maturity securities AFS in the current period compared to gains in the prior period and lower gains on sales of real estate joint ventures, partially offset by lower mark-to-market losses on our retained investment in Brighthouse. In the current period, we incurred a loss representing both the change in estimated fair value of FVO Brighthouse Common Stock we held through date of disposal and the loss upon disposal in June 2018. In the prior period, we recognized a mark-to-market loss on our retained investment in Brighthouse Financial, Inc. in connection with the Separation.Actuarial Assumption Review and Certain Other Insurance Adjustments. For the results of our 2018 and 2017 annual assumption reviews and information regarding certain other insurance adjustments, see “— Three Months Ended September 30, 2018 Compared with the Three Months Ended September 30, 2017 — Actuarial Assumption Review and Certain Other Insurance Adjustments.”Divested Businesses. Income (loss) before provision for income tax related to the divested businesses, excluding net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), increased $706 million ($429 million, net of income tax) to a loss of $108 million ($85 million, net of income tax) in the current period from a loss of $814 million ($514 million, net of income tax) in the prior period. Included in this increase was an increase in total revenues of $570 million, before income tax, and a decrease in total expenses of $136 million, before income tax. Divested businesses primarily include activity related to the Separation. 122Table of ContentsDiscontinued Operations. Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income tax, increased $986 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 from a loss of $986 million, net of income tax, for the comparable prior period. Income (loss) from discontinued operations reflects the results of our former Brighthouse Financial segment. For further information, see Notes 3 and 9 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.Taxes. Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $770 million, or 20% of income (loss) from continuing operations before provision for income tax, compared with an income tax benefit of $116 million, or 5% of income (loss) from continuing operations before provision for income tax, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The Company’s effective tax rates differ from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% typically due to non-taxable investment income, tax credits for investments in low income housing, and foreign earnings taxed at different rates than the U.S. statutory rate. Our current period results include tax charges of $69 million related to the non-deductible loss incurred on the mark-to-market and disposition of FVO Brighthouse Common Stock, $17 million related to a tax adjustment in Chile and $5 million in Colombia to establish a deferred tax liability due to a change in tax status, partially offset by tax benefits of $36 million related to a non-cash transfer of assets from a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary to its U.S. parent and $7 million related to the settlement of an audit. Our prior period results include tax-related benefits of $554 million related to the Separation and $27 million from the finalization of certain tax audits, partially offset by a net tax charge of $180 million. This charge was the result of the repatriation of approximately $3.0 billion of cash following the post-Separation review of our capital needs, partially offset by a tax benefit associated with dividends from our non-U.S. operations. Our prior period results also included a tax benefit of $9 million related to the settlement of an audit in Argentina. The changes from U.S. Tax Reform resulted in a net increase in earnings of $21 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the prior period, which includes a $32 million, net of income tax, reduction of net investment income in the current period related to tax credit partnership investments.Adjusted Earnings. Adjusted earnings available to common shareholders increased $568 million, net of income tax, to $4.1 billion, net of income tax, for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 from $3.6 billion, net of

2017Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.Overview. The primary drivers of the increase in adjusted earnings were higher net investment income due to a larger asset base and higher investment yields, a prior period tax charge, the favorable impact of U.S. Tax Reform and favorable underwriting, partially offset by higher interest credited expenses and the unfavorable impact of our annual actuarial assumption review.Foreign Currency. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a $22 million negative impact on adjusted earnings for the third quarter of 2018 compared to the prior period. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency fluctuations can result in significant variances in the financial statement line items.U.S. Tax Reform. The changes from U.S. Tax Reform resulted in a net increase in adjusted earnings of $70 million for the third quarter of 2018 compared to the prior period, which includes a $32 million, net of income tax, reduction of net investment income in the current period related to tax credit partnership investments.Business Growth. We benefited from positive net flows from many of our businesses, which increased our invested asset base. Growth in the investment portfolios of our U.S., Asia, and Latin America segments resulted in higher net investment income. However, this was partially offset by a corresponding increase in interest credited expense on certain insurance-related liabilities. In our U.S. segment, an increase in average premium per policy in our auto business, partially offset by a decrease in exposures, improved adjusted earnings. Higher asset-based fees, primarily from our Asia and EMEA segments, was partially offset by lower fees in our MetLife Holdings segment. Business growth also drove an increase in commissions and other variable expenses, which were offset by higher DAC capitalization. The combined impact of the items affecting our business growth resulted in a $32 million increase in adjusted earnings.Market Factors. Market factors, including interest rate levels, variability in equity market returns, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on net investment income in our non-U.S. segments and changes in inflation rates on our inflation-indexed investments, investment yields increased. Investment yields were positively impacted by higher yields on fixed income securities, derivative income and prepayment fees. These increases were partially offset by lower returns on private equities, driven by a decrease in certain partnership distributions. The increase in investment yields was partially offset by the impact of higher average interest credited rates, as well as an increase in the crediting rate on certain long-duration insurance contracts, which drove an increase in interest credited expenses, primarily in our U.S. segment. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $109 million increase in adjusted earnings.Underwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments. Favorable underwriting resulted in a $47 million increase in adjusted earnings, primarily as a result of lower catastrophe losses, as well as favorable morbidity in our U.S. and MetLife Holdings segments. This was partially offset by unfavorable claims experience in our EMEA and Asia segments, as well as higher non-catastrophe claim costs. Unfavorable mortality in our MetLife Holdings segment was mostly offset by favorable mortality in our U.S. and Latin America segments. The impact in both periods of our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a decrease of $149 million in adjusted earnings, primarily due to less favorable assumption changes in our MetLife Holdings and Asia segments. Refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities, which were recorded in both periods across the majority of our segments, resulted in a $21 million decrease in adjusted earnings, most notably in our MetLife Holdings and U.S. segments. Expenses and Taxes. A $12 million decrease in expenses was primarily due to lower Separation-related and employee-related expenses, largely offset by an increase in costs associated with enterprise-wide initiatives, primarily due to a current period increase in expenses associated with our unit cost initiative. Our effective tax rates differ from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% typically due to nontaxable investment income, tax credits for investments in low income housing and foreign earnings taxed at different rates than the U.S. statutory rate. Higher utilization of tax preferenced items increased adjusted earnings by $20 million compared to the prior period. Our prior period results include a net tax charge of $180 million related to the repatriation of approximately $3.0 billion of cash following the post-Separation review of our capital needs, partially offset by a tax benefit associated with dividends from our non-U.S. operations and a tax-related benefit of $4 million from the finalization of certain tax audits.Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 Compared with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017 Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.128Table of ContentsOverview. The primary drivers of the increase in adjusted earnings were higher net investment income due to a larger asset base and higher investment yields, the favorable impact of U.S. Tax Reform, a prior period tax charge and favorable underwriting, partially offset by higher interest credited expenses and the unfavorable impact of our annual actuarial assumption review.Foreign Currency. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had a $16 million positive impact on adjusted earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the prior period. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency fluctuations can result in significant variances in the financial statement line items.U.S. Tax Reform. The changes from U.S. Tax Reform resulted in a net increase in adjusted earnings of $235 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the prior period, which includes a $32 million, net of income tax, reduction of net investment income in the current period related to tax credit partnership investments.Business Growth. We benefited from positive net flows from many of our businesses, which increased our invested asset base. Growth in the investment portfolios of our U.S., Asia, and Latin America segments resulted in higher net investment income. However, this was partially offset by a corresponding increase in interest credited expense on certain insurance-related liabilities. In our U.S. segment, an increase in average premium per policy in our auto business, partially offset by a decrease in exposures, improved adjusted earnings. Business growth also drove an increase in commissions and other variable expenses, which were partially offset by higher DAC capitalization. The combined impact of the items affecting our business growth resulted in a $79 million increase in adjusted earnings.Market Factors. Market factors, including interest rate levels, variability in equity market returns, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on net investment income in our non-U.S. segments and changes in inflation rates on our inflation-indexed investments, investment yields increased slightly. Investment yields were positively affected by higher yields on fixed income securities, returns on real estate investments, income on derivatives and prepayment fees. These increases were largely offset by lower returns on private equities, driven by a decrease in certain partnership distributions, lower returns on hedge funds and lower returns on fair value option securities (“FVO Securities”). The slight improvement in yield was more than offset by the impact of higher average interest credited rates, which drove an increase in interest credited expense, primarily in our U.S. segment. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in an $18 million increase in adjusted earnings.Underwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments. Favorable underwriting resulted in a $145 million increase in adjusted earnings primarily as a result of lower catastrophe losses, as well as favorable morbidity in our U.S. and MetLife Holdings segments, partially offset by unfavorable claims experience in our EMEA and Asia segments. In addition, favorable mortality in our Latin America and U.S. segments was partially offset by unfavorable mortality in our MetLife Holdings segment. The impact in both periods of our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a decrease of $149 million in adjusted earnings, primarily due to less favorable assumption changes in our MetLife Holdings and Asia segments. Refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities, which were recorded in both periods across the majority of our segments, resulted in a $14 million increase in adjusted earnings, most notably in our MetLife Holdings and U.S. segments. Expenses and Taxes. A $61 million decrease in expenses resulted from declines in Separation-related expenses and employee-related costs, as well as expenses incurred in the prior period related to the guaranty fund assessment for Penn Treaty, partially offset by higher costs associated with enterprise-wide initiatives, driven by a current period increase in expenses associated with our unit cost initiative and higher litigation expenses. Our effective tax rates differ from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% typically due to nontaxable investment income, tax credits for investments in low income housing and foreign earnings taxed at different rates than the U.S. statutory rate. Lower utilization of tax preferenced items decreased adjusted earnings by $26 million compared to the prior period. Our current period results include tax benefits of $36 million related to a non-cash transfer of assets from a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary to its U.S. parent and $7 million related to the settlement of an audit, partially offset by tax charges of $17 million related to a tax adjustment in Chile and a $5 million tax charge in Colombia to establish a deferred tax liability due to a change in tax status. Our prior period results include a net tax-related benefit of $27 million from the finalization of certain tax audits, as well as a net tax charge of $180 million related to the repatriation of approximately $3.0 billion of cash following the post-Separation review of our capital needs, partially offset by a tax benefit associated with dividends from our non-U.S. operations. Our prior period results also include a tax benefit of $9 million related to the settlement of an audit in Argentina.129Table of ContentsSegment Results and Corporate & OtherU.S.Business Overview. Sales decreased from the prior period, primarily in our RIS business, with lower sales of stable value products and pension risk transfers, coupled with a decrease in funding agreement issuances. Changes in premiums for the RIS business were almost entirely offset by the related changes in policyholder benefits and claims. Sales increased in the Group Benefits business compared to the prior period, as sales in both our core insurance products and voluntary products improved. The increase in premiums, fees and other revenues from the impact of prior year sales was partially offset by the loss of a large dental contract in the second quarter of 2017. In our Property & Casualty business, sales increased over the prior period. The number of exposures decreased from the prior period, reflecting management actions to improve the quality of the business.

The changes from U.S. Tax Reform resulted in an increase in adjusted earnings of $112 million for the third quarter of 2018 compared to the prior period.Business Growth. Net investment income improved as a result of higher average invested assets due to the cumulative impact of increased premiums, primarily due to pension risk transfer sales in the second quarter of 2018, partially offset by a decrease in net flows from funding agreements. However, consistent with the growth in average invested assets from increased premiums, interest credited expense on long-duration contracts increased. An increase in average premium per policy in our auto business, partially offset by the decrease in exposures, improved adjusted earnings. Higher volume-related, direct and premium tax expenses were partially offset by lower pension and post-retirement expenses. This net increase in expenses, coupled with the increase due to the 2018 reinstatement of the annual health insurer fee under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”), was more than offset by a corresponding increase in premiums, fees and other revenues. The combined impact of the items affecting our business growth increased adjusted earnings by $28 million.130Table of ContentsMarket Factors. Market factors, including interest rate levels, variability in equity market returns and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Investment yields increased, primarily due to higher yields on fixed income securities and mortgage loans, coupled with an increase in derivative income, partially offset by lower returns on private equities, as a result of a decrease in certain partnership distributions. The increase in investment yields was mostly offset by the impact of higher average interest credited rates, which drove an increase in interest credited expense, coupled with the increase in the crediting rate on certain long-duration insurance contracts. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a slight increase in adjusted earnings.Underwriting and Other Insurance Adjustments. In our Property & Casualty business, catastrophe-related losses decreased $30 million in the current period due, in part, to lower hurricane-related claims. Non-catastrophe claim costs increased $10 million as a result of higher auto severities, partially offset by a decrease in homeowner severities. Losses from our commercial business increased $7 million. As a result of overall lower claim activity, loss adjustment expenses decreased, increasing adjusted earnings by $6 million. Favorable claims experience in our Group Benefits business resulted in a $27 million increase in adjusted earnings. This was primarily driven by favorable renewal results in our disability business, as well as lower incidence and severity, coupled with growth and favorable claims experience in our accident & health business, partially offset by less favorable claims experience in our dental and vision businesses. Mortality results were flat in the current period, as favorable claims experience in our universal life business was offset by less favorable mortality in our term life and accidental death & dismemberment businesses. Favorable mortality in our specialized life insurance and pension risk transfer businesses increased adjusted earnings by $6 million. Refinements to certain insurance and other liabilities, which were recorded in both periods, resulted in a $65 million increase in adjusted earnings. Such refinements include a current period favorable net insurance adjustment of $37 million resulting from reserve and DAC modeling improvements in our individual disability insurance business.Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 Compared with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017 Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.U.S. Tax Reform. The changes from U.S. Tax Reform resulted in an increase in adjusted earnings of $314 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the prior period.Business Growth. Net investment income improved as a result of higher average invested assets due to the impact of increased premiums and deposits, primarily due to pension risk transfer sales, partially offset by a decrease in net flows from funding agreements. However, consistent with the growth in average invested assets from increased premiums, interest credited expense on long-duration contracts increased. An increase in average premium per policy in our auto business, partially offset by the decrease in exposures, improved adjusted earnings. Higher volume-related, direct and premium tax expenses were partially offset by lower pension and post retirement expenses. This net increase in expenses, coupled with the increase due to the current period reinstatement of the annual health insurer fee under the PPACA, were more than offset by a corresponding increase in premiums, fees and other revenues. The combined impact of the items affecting our business growth increased adjusted earnings by $121 million.Market Factors. Market factors, including interest rate levels, variability in equity market returns and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Investment yields increased, primarily due to higher yields on fixed income securities and mortgage loans, coupled with higher returns on real estate investments, partially offset by lower returns on private equities, as a result of a decrease in certain partnership distributions. The net increase in investment yields was more than offset by the impact of higher average interest credited rates, which drove an increase in interest credited expense; however, this was partially offset by an increase in adjusted earnings due to a decrease in the crediting rate on certain long-duration insurance contracts. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $63 million decrease in adjusted earnings.131Table of ContentsUnderwriting and Other Insurance Adjustments. In our Property & Casualty business, catastrophe-related losses decreased $88 million in the current period. Losses from our commercial business increased $16 million. Non-catastrophe claim costs increased $7 million, as a result of higher auto and homeowner severities, partially offset by lower auto and homeowner frequencies. As a result of overall lower claim activity, loss adjustment expenses decreased, increasing adjusted earnings by $12 million. Favorable claims experience in our Group Benefits business resulted in a $70 million increase in adjusted earnings. This was primarily driven by favorable renewal results in our disability business, as well as lower claim incidence and severity, coupled with growth and favorable claims experience in our accident & health business, partially offset by less favorable claims experience in our dental and vision businesses. Less favorable mortality results in the current period, mainly due to less favorable claim experience in our term life business, were mostly offset by favorable mortality in our accidental death & dismemberment and universal life businesses, which resulted in a $5 million decrease in adjusted earnings. Favorable mortality in our specialized life insurance, structured settlement and pension risk transfer businesses increased adjusted earnings by $37 million. Refinements to certain insurance and other liabilities, which were recorded in both periods, resulted in a $55 million increase in adjusted earnings. Such refinements include a current period favorable insurance adjustment resulting from reserve and DAC modeling improvements in our individual disability insurance business.AsiaBusiness Overview. Sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018 increased compared to the prior period, primarily driven by growth in foreign currency-denominated annuity products, as well as accident & health product sales, in Japan. Sales in the current period also benefited from a group case sale in Australia, as well as continued growth in emerging markets, mainly in China, partially offset by lower sales in Korea due to the continued impact of regulatory changes.

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased adjusted earnings by $4 million for the third quarter of 2018 compared to the prior period, primarily due to the weakening of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency fluctuations can result in significant variances in the financial statement line items.U.S. Tax Reform. The changes from U.S. Tax Reform resulted in an increase in adjusted earnings of $9 million for the third quarter of 2018 compared to the prior period. 132Table of ContentsBusiness Growth. Asia’s premiums, fees and other revenues decreased slightly from the prior period mainly due to a change in product mix from premium-based products to fee-based products, primarily from Yen life products to foreign currency-denominated life products and accident & health products in Japan. The decrease in premiums from Yen life products was partially offset by a related decline in policyholder benefits. Positive net flows in Japan and Korea resulted in higher average invested assets, which improved net investment income. The combined impact of the items discussed above improved adjusted earnings by $29 million. Market Factors. Market factors, including interest rate levels and variability in equity market returns, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Investment results were favorably impacted by higher returns on real estate investments, as well as higher yields on fixed income securities due to the favorable impact of increased sales of life and annuity products in Japan, which drove an increase in higher-yielding U.S. dollar-denominated fixed income securities. This increase in yields in Japan was partially offset by lower yields on fixed income securities in Korea. Investment yields were negatively impacted by lower earnings from our operating joint ventures, primarily in China, and higher investment expenses. The combined impact of the items affecting our business growth increased adjusted earnings by $6 million.Underwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments. Higher claims in Japan decreased adjusted earnings by $12 million. The impact in both periods of our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a decrease of $63 million in adjusted earnings. Refinements to certain insurance and other liabilities, which were recorded in both periods, resulted in a $14 million decrease in adjusted earnings. Our results for the current period include a favorable liability refinement of $4 million in Japan.Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 Compared with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017 Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.Foreign Currency. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased adjusted earnings by $11 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the prior period, primarily due to the strengthening of the Japanese yen and Korean won against the U.S. dollar. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency fluctuations can result in significant variances in the financial statement line items.U.S. Tax Reform. The changes from U.S. Tax Reform resulted in an increase in adjusted earnings of $34 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the prior period. Business Growth. Asia’s premiums, fees and other revenues decreased slightly from the prior period mainly due to a change in product mix from premium-based products to fee-based products, primarily from Yen life products to foreign currency-denominated life products and accident & health products in Japan. The decrease in premiums from Yen life products was partially offset by a related decline in policyholder benefits. Positive net flows in Japan and Korea resulted in higher average invested assets, which improved net investment income. The combined impact of the items affecting our business growth improved adjusted earnings by $77 million.Market Factors. Market factors, including interest rate levels and variability in equity market returns, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Investment results were favorably impacted by higher returns on real estate investments, derivative income, and yields on mortgage loans. In addition, higher earnings from our operating joint venture in China improved net investment income. Increased sales of life and annuity products in Japan drove an increase in higher-yielding U.S. dollar-denominated fixed income securities. This increase in yields in Japan was partially offset by lower yields on fixed income securities in Korea. Investment yields were negatively impacted by increased investment expenses and lower returns on hedge funds. The combined impact of the items discussed above increased adjusted earnings by $44 million.Underwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments. Higher lapses and claims in Japan decreased adjusted earnings by $33 million. The impact in both periods of our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a decrease of $63 million in adjusted earnings. Refinements to certain insurance and other liabilities, which were recorded in both periods, resulted in a slight decrease in adjusted earnings. Our results for the current period include favorable liability refinements of $24 million in Japan, partially offset by an unfavorable liability refinement of $10 million in Bangladesh. Our prior period results include a favorable refinement of $12 million related to reinsurance receivables in Australia.Expenses. Higher expenses, primarily driven by higher employee-related and project costs, as well as an increase in corporate overhead costs, reduced adjusted earnings by $24 million. 133Table of ContentsLatin AmericaBusiness Overview. Sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018 increased compared to the prior period, driven by higher sales of individual accident & health products in Chile and group accident & health products in Mexico, partially offset by lower sales of retirement products in Mexico and Brazil.

Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of foreign currency fluctuations. Foreign currency fluctuations can result in significant variances in the financial statement line items.U.S. Tax Reform. The changes from U.S. Tax Reform resulted in a decrease in adjusted earnings of $10 million for the third quarter of 2018 compared to the prior period. Business Growth. Latin America experienced growth across several lines of business primarily within Mexico and Chile. This growth resulted in increased premiums and policy fee income, which was largely offset by related changes in policyholder benefits. Positive net flows, primarily from Chile and Argentina, resulted in an increase in average invested assets and generated higher net investment income. This was partially offset by an increase in interest credited expense on certain insurance liabilities. Business growth also drove an increase in commissions, which was offset by higher DAC capitalization. The combined impact of the items affecting our business growth resulted in a $10 million increase in adjusted earnings.Market Factors. Market factors, including interest rate levels and variability in equity market returns, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Changes in market factors resulted in a $19 million increase in adjusted earnings primarily due to an increase in investment yields and a slight decrease in interest credited expense. The increase in investment yields was primarily driven by higher yields from fixed income securities in Mexico and Chile, which were partially offset by lower returns from FVO Securities in Argentina and Chile.134Table of ContentsUnderwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments. Favorable underwriting resulted in a $14 million increase to adjusted earnings primarily driven by lower claims experience in Mexico. The impact in both periods of our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a $13 million increase to adjusted earnings. In addition, refinements to certain insurance liabilities and other adjustments in both periods, primarily in Chile and Mexico, resulted in a $23 million decrease to adjusted earnings.Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 Compared with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017 Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.Foreign Currency. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased adjusted earnings by $3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the prior period mainly due to the weakening of the Mexican and Argentine pesos against the U.S. dollar.

The combined impact of the items affecting our business growth resulted in a slight decrease in adjusted earnings.Market Factors. Market factors, including interest rate levels and variability in equity market returns, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Changes in market factors resulted in an $8 million decrease in adjusted earnings primarily due to lower investment yields. The decrease in investment yields was primarily driven by lower returns from FVO Securities in Chile, partially offset by higher yields from fixed income securities in Mexico and higher derivative income in Chile. A slight decrease in interest credited expense partially offset the decline in adjusted earnings.Underwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments. Favorable underwriting resulted in a $56 million increase to adjusted earnings primarily driven by lower claims experience in Mexico. The impact in both periods of our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a $13 million increase to adjusted earnings. In addition, refinements to certain insurance liabilities and other adjustments in both periods, primarily in Brazil, Mexico and Chile, resulted in a $22 million decrease to adjusted earnings.Expenses and Taxes. A $12 million decrease in expenses was primarily the result of a current period reduction of a litigation reserve in Argentina. Our results for the current period include a $17 million tax charge related to a tax adjustment in Chile and a $5 million tax charge in Colombia to establish a deferred tax liability due to a change in tax status. The prior period includes a tax benefit of $9 million related to the settlement of an audit. Other tax-related items in both periods, primarily due to the changes in the valuation of the peso in Argentina, resulted in a $12 million increase in adjusted earnings.135Table of ContentsEMEABusiness Overview. Sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018 decreased compared to the prior period primarily due to the closure of the U.K. wealth management product to new business in the third quarter of 2017 and a decline in sales of employee benefits and life insurance products in the Gulf region.

The changes from U.S. Tax Reform resulted in a slight increase in adjusted earnings for the third quarter of 2018 compared to the prior period.Business Growth. Growth from our accident & health and credit life businesses in Turkey and across several European markets resulted in a $5 million increase in adjusted earnings.Underwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments. Less favorable underwriting, primarily in our accident & health business in Greece, as well as unfavorable underwriting in our life insurance business in the Czech Republic and Iberia decreased adjusted earnings by $13 million. The impact in both periods of our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a decrease in adjusted earnings of $15 million. In addition, adjusted earnings increased by $2 million due to refinements recorded in the prior period in our employee benefits business in the U.K. and, in the current period, in our life insurance business in the Gulf region.Expenses. Adjusted earnings increased by $9 million due to lower costs associated with enterprise-wide initiatives, notably the closing of the wealth management product to new business in the U.K. in the third quarter of 2017, along with declines in various other expenses.

Market factors, including interest rate levels and variability in equity market returns, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. A slight decrease in net investment income was driven by lower investment yields on fixed income securities. Underwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review and Other Insurance Adjustments. Less favorable underwriting, primarily in our accident & health business in Greece, as well as unfavorable underwriting in the Gulf region, our employee benefits business in the U.K., and in our life insurance business in France, decreased adjusted earnings by $34 million. The impact in both periods of our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a decrease in adjusted earnings of $15 million. In addition, adjusted earnings decreased by $2 million due to refinements recorded in the prior period in our employee benefits business in the U.K. and the Gulf region and, in the current period, in our life insurance business in the Gulf region. Expenses. Adjusted earnings increased by $51 million due to lower costs associated with enterprise-wide initiatives, notably the closing of the wealth management product to new business in the U.K. in the third quarter of 2017, declines in various other expenses and the release of provisions arising from finalization of historic corporate tax filings.Other. A decrease in our invested asset base, primarily due to dividend payments, negatively impacted net investment income resulting in an $8 million decrease in adjusted earnings.137Table of ContentsMetLife HoldingsBusiness Overview. The discontinuance of the marketing of life and annuity products in this segment in early 2017 resulted in lower revenues. This will continue to result in a declining DAC asset over time, and we anticipate an average decline in premiums, fees and other revenues of approximately 5% per year from expected business run-off. A significant portion of our adjusted earnings is driven by separate account balances. Most directly, these balances determine asset-based fee income but they also impact DAC amortization and asset-based commissions. Separate account balances are driven by deposits, movements in the market, surrenders, withdrawals, benefit payments, transfers and policy charges. Separate account balances decreased due to negative net flows, as benefits, surrenders and withdrawals exceeded deposits and equity performance. Although we have discontinued selling our long-term care product, we continue to collect premiums and administer the existing block of business, which contributed to asset growth in the segment, and we expect the related reserves to grow as this block matures.

The changes from U.S. Tax Reform resulted in an increase in adjusted earnings of $68 million for the third quarter of 2018 compared to the prior period. Business Growth. Lower net investment income, resulting from a reduced invested asset base, primarily in fixed income securities, decreased adjusted earnings. The reduced asset base is primarily the result of negative net flows in our deferred annuities and life businesses. This decline was partially offset by invested asset growth in our long-term care business. A decrease in universal life deposits in our life business, as well as the negative net flows in our annuities business, resulted in lower fee income, decreasing adjusted earnings. The combined impact of the items affecting our business growth, partially offset by lower DAC amortization, resulted in a $55 million decrease in adjusted earnings.Market Factors. Market factors, including interest rate levels, variability in equity market returns, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Investment yields increased primarily due to higher prepayment fees and yields on fixed income securities, lower investment expenses, as well as higher returns on real estate investments and private equities, partially offset by a decline in yields on mortgage loans. The changes in market factors discussed above resulted in a $29 million increase in adjusted earnings.138Table of ContentsUnderwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review, and Other Insurance Adjustments. Favorable underwriting results, primarily due to the impact of favorable rate actions in our long-term care business, partially offset by unfavorable mortality in our life businesses and mortality losses on life-contingent annuities, resulted in a $5 million increase in adjusted earnings. The impact in both periods of our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a decrease of $84 million in adjusted earnings. Changes in operational assumptions, including updates to closed block projections, maintenance and other expenses, were less favorable in the current period. Refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities that were recorded in both periods resulted in a $51 million decrease in adjusted earnings. This includes a current period charge due to an increase in our IBNR life reserves, reflecting enhancements to our processes related to potential claims, as well as a favorable prior period reserve adjustment resulting from modeling improvements in our life business. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by a current period benefit resulting from modeling improvements in our life business, as well as the impact of a prior period charge resulting from modeling improvements in our long-term care business.Expenses. Adjusted earnings increased by $54 million as a result of lower expenses, primarily due to declines in Separation-related expenses, as well as lower employee-related costs.Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 Compared with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017 Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.U.S. Tax Reform.

Lower net investment income, resulting from a reduced invested asset base, primarily in fixed income securities, decreased adjusted earnings. The reduced invested asset base is primarily the result of negative net flows in our deferred annuities and life businesses. This decline was partially offset by invested asset growth in our long-term care business. The negative net flows in our annuities business and a decrease in universal life deposits resulted in lower fee income and lower interest credited expense. The continued maturing of the existing long-term care block of business resulted in higher interest credited expense. The combined impact of the items affecting our business growth, partially offset by lower DAC amortization, resulted in a $160 million decrease in adjusted earnings.Market Factors. Market factors, including interest rate levels, variability in equity market returns, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, continued to impact our results; however, certain impacts were mitigated by derivatives used to hedge these risks. Investment yields increased primarily due to higher returns on real estate investments, lower investment expenses, increased prepayment fees and higher fixed income securities yields, partially offset by lower returns on private equities and a decline in mortgage loan yields. In our deferred annuity business, higher equity returns drove an increase in average separate account balances, which resulted in higher asset-based fee income. The changes in market factors discussed above, partially offset by slightly higher DAC amortization, resulted in a $16 million increase in adjusted earnings.Underwriting, Actuarial Assumption Review, and Other Insurance Adjustments. Unfavorable mortality in our life businesses, partially offset by favorable underwriting, primarily due to the impact of favorable rate actions in our long-term care business, and mortality gains on life-contingent annuities, resulted in an $18 million decrease in adjusted earnings. The impact in both periods of our annual actuarial assumption review resulted in a decrease of $84 million in adjusted earnings. Changes in operational assumptions, including updates to closed block projections, maintenance and other expenses, were less favorable in the current period. Refinements to DAC and certain insurance-related liabilities that were recorded in both periods resulted in a $16 million decrease in adjusted earnings. This includes the following current period refinements: (i) a charge due to an increase in our IBNR life reserves, reflecting enhancements to our processes related to potential claims; (ii) a favorable reserve adjustment relating to certain variable annuity guarantees assumed from a former joint venture in Japan; and (iii) a benefit resulting from modeling improvements in our life business. This also includes the following prior period refinements: (i) a favorable DAC adjustment related to certain assumed participating whole life business; (ii) two separate favorable reserve adjustments resulting from modeling improvements in our life business; (iii) an unfavorable adjustment related to the recapture and novation of, as well as adjustments to, assumed and ceded agreements covering certain variable annuity business; (iv) an unfavorable net impact from a life reinsurance recapture; and (v) an unfavorable reserve adjustment resulting from modeling improvements in our long-term care business. Expenses. Adjusted earnings increased by $112 million as a result of lower expenses, primarily due to declines in Separation-related expenses, as well as lower employee-related costs.139Table of ContentsCorporate & Other Three MonthsEndedSeptember 30, Nine MonthsEndedSeptember 30, 2018 2017 2018 2017 (In millions)Adjusted revenues       Premiums$(33) $13 $(14) $59Net investment income58 26 157 107Other revenues86 65 246 185Total adjusted revenues111 104 389 351Adjusted expenses       Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends(38) 7 (38) 33Interest credited to policyholder account balances— — — 1Capitalization of DAC(2) (2) (7) (6)Amortization of DAC and VOBA2 3 5 5Interest expense on debt246 279 798 833Other expenses314 237 805 614Total adjusted expenses522 524 1,563 1,480Provision for income tax expense (benefit)(206) (90) (599) (630)Adjusted earnings(205) (330) (575) (499)Less: Preferred stock dividends32 6 84 58Adjusted earnings available to common shareholders$(237) $(336) $(659) $(557)The table below presents adjusted earnings available to common shareholders by source:  Three MonthsEndedSeptember 30, Nine MonthsEndedSeptember 30, 2018 2017 2018 2017 (In millions)Other business activities$13 $5 $31 $19Other net investment income107 49 214 193Interest expense on debt(256) (300) (831) (901)Corporate initiatives and projects(132) (45) (268) (197)Other(101) (128) (278) (246)Provision for income tax (expense) benefit and other tax-related items164 89 557 633Preferred stock dividends(32) (6) (84) (58)Adjusted earnings available to common shareholders$(237) $(336) $(659) $(557)Three Months Ended September 30, 2018 Compared with the Three Months Ended September 30, 2017 Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of income tax.U.S. Tax Reform.

Other Net Investment Income. Higher returns on real estate joint ventures and private equities were partially offset by lower returns on the remainder of the portfolio, resulting in an increase of $46 million in other net investment income.140Table of ContentsInterest Expense on Debt. Interest expense on debt decreased by $35 million, primarily due to: (i) the exchange of senior notes for FVO Brighthouse Common Stock; (ii) the redemption of senior notes for cash; (iii) the maturity of senior notes during the current period; (iv) lower interest rates on certain intercompany senior notes redenominated to Japanese yen; and (v) the maturity of $1.0 billion of senior notes in December 2017. The assets supporting the redenominated senior notes are owned by our business segments.Corporate Initiatives and Projects. Expenses associated with corporate initiatives and projects increased by $69 million, primarily due to higher expenses related to our unit cost initiative.Provision for Income Tax (Expense) Benefit and Other Tax-Related Items. In addition to the impact of U.S. Tax Reform, Corporate & Other’s effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% typically due to benefits from the impact of certain permanent tax-preferenced items, including non-taxable investment income, tax credits for investments in low income housing and foreign earnings taxed at different rates than the U.S. statutory rate. In the prior period, the Company recognized a $180 million net tax charge related to the repatriation of approximately $3.0 billion of cash following the post-Separation review of our capital needs, partially offset by a tax benefit associated with dividends from our non-U.S. operations. The prior period also included a $4 million net tax-related benefit from the finalization of certain tax audits. In addition, increased utilization of tax preferenced items increased adjusted earnings by $20 million from the prior period.Other. Adjusted earnings increased $21 million, primarily as a result of a $24 million decrease in employee-related expenses, as well as declines in various other expenses, partially offset by a $13 million increase in expenses for interest on tax positions.Preferred Stock Dividends.

The prior period also included a $27 million net tax-related benefit from the finalization of certain tax audits. In the current period, the Company also recognized tax benefits of $36 million related to a non-cash transfer of assets from a wholly-owned U.K. investment subsidiary to its U.S. parent and $5 million related to the settlement of an audit, as well as a $17 million tax charge for decreased utilization of tax-preferenced items. Other. Adjusted earnings decreased $25 million, primarily as a result of a $38 million increase in litigation accruals, a $28 million increase in certain corporate-related expenses and a $20 million increase in expenses for interest on tax positions, partially offset by $21 million of expenses incurred in the prior period and taxed at the prior period rate related to the guaranty fund assessment for Penn Treaty and a $37 million decrease in employee-related expenses.Preferred Stock Dividends. Preferred stock dividends increased $26 million as a result of the issuance of Series D and Series E preferred stock in the current period.141Table of ContentsInvestmentsInvestment RisksOur primary investment objective is to optimize, net of income tax, risk-adjusted net investment income and risk-adjusted total return while ensuring that assets and liabilities are managed on a cash flow and duration basis. The Investments Department, led by the Chief Investment Officer, manages investment risks through the Investments Risk Committee using a risk control framework comprised of policies, procedures, limits and tolerances. The Investments Risk Committee reviews and monitors the management of investment risks through this risk control framework. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Investments — Investment Risks” included in the 2017 Annual Report for an explanation of investment risks and our risk control framework.Current EnvironmentThe global economy and markets continue to be affected by stress and volatility, which has adversely affected the financial services sector, in particular, and global capital markets. Political and economic instability has contributed to global market volatility which may have an impact on our investments. As a global insurance company, we continue to be impacted by the changing global financial and economic environment, as well as the monetary policy of central banks around the world. Measures taken by central banks, including with respect to the level of interest rates, may have an impact on the pricing levels of risk-bearing investments and may adversely impact our business operations, investment portfolio and derivatives. The current environment continues to impact our net investment income, net investment gains (losses), net derivative gains (losses), level of unrealized gains (losses) within the various asset classes in our investment portfolio, and our level of investment in lower yielding cash equivalents, short-term investments and government securities. See “— Industry Trends — Financial and Economic Environment,” as well as “Risk Factors — Economic Environment and Capital Markets-Related Risks — We Are Exposed to Significant Global Financial and Capital Markets Risks Which May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity, and May Cause Our Net Investment Income to Vary from Period to Period” included in the 2017 Annual Report.European InvestmentsWe maintain general account investments in Europe to support our insurance operations and related policyholder liabilities in these countries and certain of our non-European operations invest in Europe for diversification. In Europe, we have proactively mitigated risk in both direct and indirect exposures by investing in a diversified portfolio of high quality investments with a focus on the higher-rated countries, including the U.K., France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden and Switzerland. The sovereign debt of these countries continues to maintain investment grade credit ratings from all major rating agencies. Our European fixed maturity securities AFS and perpetual hybrid securities classified as non-redeemable preferred stock are invested in a diversified portfolio of primarily non-financial services securities. At September 30, 2018, our exposure to such securities in Europe totaled $37.8 billion, at estimated fair value, of which $8.7 billion was in sovereign fixed maturity securities AFS. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Investments — Current Environment — European Investments” included in the 2017 Annual Report for further information.Selected Country InvestmentsWe have country-specific exposure to volatility, as we maintain general account investments in the U.K., South Korea and Mexico to support our insurance operations and related policyholder liabilities in these countries. We also have exposure to volatility in these selected countries through our global portfolio diversification. Our exposure to sovereign fixed maturity securities AFS and total fixed maturity securities AFS of the U.K., South Korea and Mexico totaled $9.6 billion and $25.3 billion, at estimated fair value, respectively, at September 30, 2018. We manage direct and indirect investment exposure in the selected countries through fundamental credit analysis and we continually monitor and adjust our level of investment exposure. We do not expect any adverse impact to our general account investments in these countries will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.142Table of ContentsInvestment Portfolio ResultsThe following yield table presents our investment portfolio results for the periods indicated. We calculate yields using net investment income, as reported on an adjusted basis. Net investment income, as reported on an adjusted basis, includes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This yield table presentation is consistent with how we measure our investment performance for management purposes, and we believe it enhances understanding of our investment portfolio results. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of net investment income under GAAP to net investment income, as reported on an adjusted basis.

Upon acquisition, we classify perpetual securities that have attributes of both debt and equity as fixed maturity securities AFS if the securities have an interest rate step-up feature which, when combined with other qualitative factors, indicates that the securities have more debt-like characteristics; while those with more equity-like characteristics are classified as equity securities. Many of such securities, commonly referred to as “perpetual hybrid securities,” have been issued by non-U.S. financial institutions that are accorded the highest two capital treatment categories by their respective regulatory bodies (i.e. core capital, or “Tier 1 capital” and perpetual deferrable securities, or “Upper Tier 2 capital”).Redeemable preferred stock with a stated maturity is included within fixed maturity securities AFS. These securities, which are commonly referred to as “capital securities,” primarily have cumulative interest deferral features and are primarily issued by U.S. financial institutions.In connection with our investment management business, we manage a broad array of securities, limited partnership interests and liquid investments on behalf of unaffiliated/third party clients. Assets managed for these clients, by sector, primarily fixed maturity securities AFS, at estimated fair value, were as follows: investment grade corporates, including publicly-traded and privately-placed corporates, privately-placed infrastructure, state and political subdivision, emerging market and bank syndication loans, $69.5 billion and $66.6 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively; structured finance securities, including residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”), commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) and asset-backed securities (“ABS”) (collectively, “Structured Securities”), $17.6 billion and $15.8 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively; U.S. government and agency securities, $17.5 billion and $21.7 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively; foreign government securities, including emerging market, $1.4 billion and $2.1 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively; below investment grade corporate securities, including privately-placed corporates, privately-placed infrastructure, emerging market, high yield and bank syndication loans, $7.2 billion and $7.7 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively; equity securities, $0.4 billion and $0.3 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively; other limited partnership interests, $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively; and short-term investments and cash equivalents, $2.1 billion and $3.0 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.144Table of ContentsAlso in connection with our investment management business, we manage index investment portfolios that track the return of industry fixed income and equity market indices such as the Bloomberg Barclay’s U.S. Aggregate Bond Index and S&P 500® Index. These index investment portfolio assets had an estimated fair value of $28.2 billion and $28.5 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Index investment portfolios included within separate account assets in our interim condensed consolidated financial statements were $14.7 billion and $14.9 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The index investment portfolios we manage on behalf of our unaffiliated/third party clients were $13.5 billion and $13.6 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, and are not included in our interim condensed consolidated financial statements. The index investment portfolios we manage on behalf of our unaffiliated/third party clients, by sector, including fixed maturity securities AFS, at estimated fair value, were as follows: investment grade corporate securities, including publicly-traded corporates, $734 million and $794 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively; structured finance securities, $786 million and $828 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively; U.S. government and agency securities, $1.1 billion at both September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017; equity securities, $10.4 billion at both September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017; and short-term investments and cash equivalents, $495 million and $517 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Investments — Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities AFS — Valuation of Securities” included in the 2017 Annual Report for further information on the processes used to value securities and the related controls.Fair Value of Fixed Maturity Securities AFS and Equity SecuritiesFixed maturity securities AFS and equity securities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding fair value pricing sources are as follows: September 30, 2018 Fixed MaturitySecurities AFS  EquitySecurities (Dollars in millions) Level 1         Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets$25,246 8.3% $941 63.6%Level 2         Independent pricing sources261,916 85.9  60 4.1 Internal matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques2,989 1.0  35 2.4 Significant other observable inputs264,905 86.9  95 6.5 Level 3         Independent pricing sources10,422 3.4  332 22.4 Internal matrix pricing or discounted cash flow techniques3,840 1.3  107 7.2 Independent broker quotations427 0.1  4 0.3 Significant unobservable inputs14,689 4.8  443 29.9 Total estimated fair value$304,840 100.0% $1,479 100.0%See Note 8 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the fixed maturity securities AFS and equity securities fair value hierarchy.145Table of ContentsThe composition of fair value pricing sources for and significant changes in Level 3 securities at September 30, 2018 are as follows:•The majority of the Level 3 fixed maturity securities AFS and equity securities were concentrated in three sectors: U.S. corporate securities, foreign corporate securities and RMBS.•Level 3 fixed maturity securities AFS are priced principally through market standard valuation methodologies, independent pricing services and, to a much lesser extent, independent non-binding broker quotations using inputs that are not market observable or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 fixed maturity securities AFS consist of less liquid securities with very limited trading activity or where less price transparency exists around the inputs to the valuation methodologies. Level 3 fixed maturity securities AFS include: sub-prime RMBS; certain below investment grade private U.S. and foreign corporate securities; less liquid investment grade U.S. and foreign corporate securities and less liquid ABS and foreign government securities.•During the three months ended September 30, 2018, Level 3 fixed maturity securities AFS decreased by $773 million, or 5%. The decrease was driven by transfers out of Level 3 in excess of transfers into Level 3, partially offset by purchases in excess of sales. •During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, Level 3 fixed maturity securities AFS decreased by $1.6 billion, or 10%. The decrease was driven by transfers out of Level 3 in excess of transfers into Level 3, partially offset by purchases in excess of sales. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a rollforward of the fair value measurements for fixed maturity securities AFS and equity securities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs; transfers into and/or out of Level 3; and further information about the valuation approaches and inputs by level by major classes of invested assets that affect the amounts reported above.

Our sub-prime RMBS portfolio consists predominantly of securities that were purchased after 2012 at significant discounts to par value and discounts to the expected principal recovery value of these securities. The vast majority of these securities are investment grade under the NAIC designations (e.g., NAIC 1 and NAIC 2).

The increase was primarily due to $9 million of OTTI losses on Argentine foreign government securities due to the weakening Argentine peso.Future ImpairmentsFuture OTTI on fixed maturity securities AFS will depend primarily on economic fundamentals, issuer performance (including changes in the present value of future cash flows expected to be collected), and changes in credit ratings, collateral valuation, interest rates and credit spreads. If economic fundamentals deteriorate or if there are adverse changes in the above factors, OTTI may be incurred in upcoming periods.Contractholder-Directed Equity Securities and Fair Value Option SecuritiesThe estimated fair value of Unit-linked and FVO Securities was $13.5 billion and $16.7 billion, or 3.0% and 3.7% of cash and invested assets, at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Unit-linked and FVO Securities are primarily comprised of Unit-linked investments. See Notes 6 and 8 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of our Unit-linked and FVO Securities portfolio, the Unit-linked and FVO Securities fair value hierarchy and a rollforward of the fair value measurements for Unit-linked and FVO Securities measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs.Securities LendingWe participate in a securities lending program whereby securities are loaned to third parties, primarily brokerage firms and commercial banks. We obtain collateral, usually cash, in an amount generally equal to 102% of the estimated fair value of the securities loaned, which is obtained at the inception of a loan and maintained at a level greater than or equal to 100% for the duration of the loan. We monitor the estimated fair value of the securities loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained as necessary throughout the duration of the loan. Securities loaned under such transactions may be sold or re-pledged by the transferee. We are liable to return to our counterparties the cash collateral under our control. Security collateral received from counterparties may not be sold or re-pledged, unless the counterparty is in default, and is not reflected on the consolidated financial statements. These transactions are treated as financing arrangements and the associated cash collateral liability is recorded at the amount of the cash received.See “— Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Company — Liquidity and Capital Uses — Securities Lending” and Note 6 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our securities lending program.Repurchase AgreementsThe Company participates in short-term repurchase agreements with unaffiliated financial institutions. Under these agreements, the Company lends fixed maturity securities AFS and receives cash as collateral in an amount generally equal to 98% of the estimated fair value of the securities loaned at the inception of the transaction. The associated liability is recorded at the amount of cash received. The Company monitors the estimated fair value of the collateral and the securities loaned throughout the duration of the transaction and additional collateral is obtained as necessary. Securities loaned under such transactions may be sold or re-pledged by the transferee.See Note 6 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our repurchase agreements.FHLB of Boston Advance Agreements A subsidiary of the Company participates in short-term advance agreements with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (“FHLB of Boston”). Under these agreements, the Company pledges fixed maturity securities AFS and receives cash. The associated liability is recorded at the amount of cash received. The FHLB of Boston has minimum collateral requirements which vary depending on the type of collateral pledged. Securities pledged under such transactions may not be sold or re-pledged by the transferee.See Note 6 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our FHLB of Boston advance agreement transactions.151Table of ContentsMortgage LoansOur mortgage loans are principally collateralized by commercial, agricultural and residential properties.

The carrying value of all mortgage loans, net of valuation allowance was 16.0% and 15.0% of cash and invested assets at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.We diversify our mortgage loan portfolios by both geographic region and property type to reduce the risk of concentration. Of our commercial and agricultural mortgage loan portfolios, 83% are collateralized by properties located in the United States, with the remaining 17% collateralized by properties located outside the United States, which includes 6% collateralized by properties located in the U.K., at September 30, 2018. The carrying values of our commercial and agricultural mortgage loans collateralized by properties located in California, New York and Texas were 19%, 11% and 7%, respectively, of total commercial and agricultural mortgage loans at September 30, 2018. Additionally, we manage risk when originating commercial and agricultural mortgage loans by generally lending up to 75% of the estimated fair value of the underlying real estate collateral.We manage our residential mortgage loan portfolio in a similar manner to reduce risk of concentration, with 91% collateralized by properties located in the United States and the remaining 9% collateralized by properties located outside the United States at September 30, 2018. The carrying values of our residential mortgage loans collateralized by properties located in California, Florida, and New York were 31%, 9%, and 6%, respectively, of total residential mortgage loans at September 30, 2018. In connection with our investment management business, we manage commercial, agricultural and residential mortgage loans on behalf of unaffiliated/third party clients. These commercial, agricultural and residential mortgage loans had an estimated fair value of $16.6 billion and $14.7 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. As these assets are managed on behalf of, and owned by, our unaffiliated/third party clients, they are not included in our interim condensed consolidated financial statements.152Table of ContentsCommercial Mortgage Loans by Geographic Region and Property Type.

We monitor our mortgage loan investments on an ongoing basis, including a review of loans that are current, past due, restructured and under foreclosure. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for tables that present mortgage loans by credit quality indicator, past due and nonaccrual mortgage loans, as well as impaired mortgage loans. See “— Real Estate and Real Estate Joint Ventures” for real estate acquired through foreclosure.We review our commercial mortgage loans on an ongoing basis. These reviews may include an analysis of the property financial statements and rent roll, lease rollover analysis, property inspections, market analysis, estimated valuations of the underlying collateral, loan-to-value ratios, debt service coverage ratios and tenant creditworthiness. The monitoring process focuses on higher risk loans, which include those that are classified as restructured, delinquent or in foreclosure, as well as loans with higher loan-to-value ratios and lower debt service coverage ratios. The monitoring process for agricultural mortgage loans is generally similar, with a focus on higher risk loans, such as loans with higher loan-to-value ratios, including reviews on a geographic and sector basis. We review our residential mortgage loans on an ongoing basis. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2017 Annual Report for information on our evaluation of residential mortgage loans and related valuation allowance methodology.153Table of ContentsLoan-to-value ratios and debt service coverage ratios are common measures in the assessment of the quality of commercial mortgage loans. Loan-to-value ratios are a common measure in the assessment of the quality of agricultural mortgage loans. Loan-to-value ratios compare the amount of the loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral. A loan-to-value ratio greater than 100% indicates that the loan amount is greater than the collateral value. A loan-to-value ratio of less than 100% indicates an excess of collateral value over the loan amount. Generally, the higher the loan-to-value ratio, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss. The debt service coverage ratio compares a property’s net operating income to amounts needed to service the principal and interest due under the loan. Generally, the lower the debt service coverage ratio, the higher the risk of experiencing a credit loss. For our commercial mortgage loans, our average loan-to-value ratio was 54% at both September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, and our average debt service coverage ratio was 2.6.x and 2.7x for September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The debt service coverage ratio, as well as the values utilized in calculating the ratio, is updated annually, on a rolling basis, with a portion of the portfolio updated each quarter. In addition, the loan-to-value ratio is routinely updated for all but the lowest risk loans as part of our ongoing review of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio. For our agricultural mortgage loans, our average loan-to-value ratio was 45% and 44% at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The values utilized in calculating the agricultural mortgage loan loan-to-value ratio are developed in connection with the ongoing review of the agricultural loan portfolio and are routinely updated.Mortgage Loan Valuation Allowances. Our valuation allowances are established both on a loan specific basis for those loans considered impaired where a property specific or market specific risk has been identified that could likely result in a future loss, as well as for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics where a property specific or market specific risk has not been identified, but for which we expect to incur a loss. Accordingly, a valuation allowance is provided to absorb these estimated probable credit losses.The determination of the amount of valuation allowances is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with our loan portfolios. Such evaluations and assessments are based upon several factors, including our experience for loan losses, defaults and loss severity, and loss expectations for loans with similar risk characteristics. These evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available, which can cause the valuation allowances to increase or decrease over time as such evaluations are revised. Negative credit migration, including an actual or expected increase in the level of problem loans, will result in an increase in the valuation allowance. Positive credit migration, including an actual or expected decrease in the level of problem loans, will result in a decrease in the valuation allowance.See Note 6 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information about how valuation allowances are established and monitored, and activity in and balances of the valuation allowance, as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.Real Estate and Real Estate Joint VenturesReal estate and real estate joint ventures is comprised of wholly-owned real estate and joint ventures with interests in single property income-producing real estate and, to a lesser extent, joint ventures with interests in multi-property projects with varying strategies ranging from the development of properties to the operation of income-producing properties, as well as a run-off portfolio of real estate private equity funds. We diversify our real estate investments by both geographic region and property type to reduce risk of concentration. The carrying values of real estate and real estate joint ventures were $10.0 billion and $9.6 billion, or 2.2% and 2.1% of cash and invested assets, at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The estimated fair value of our real estate investments was $15.8 billion and $14.9 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The total gross market value of such real estate investments was $20.0 billion and $19.1 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Gross market value is the total fair value of these investments regardless of encumbering debt.In connection with our investment management business, we manage commercial real estate investments on behalf of unaffiliated/third party clients. These commercial real estate investments had an estimated fair value of $6.3 billion and $5.2 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The total gross market value of these commercial real estate investments was $8.1 billion and $6.7 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. As these assets are managed on behalf of, and owned by, our unaffiliated/third party clients, they are not included in our interim condensed consolidated financial statements.154Table of ContentsOther Limited Partnership InterestsOther limited partnership interests are comprised of private equity funds and hedge funds. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the carrying value of other limited partnership interests was $6.4 billion and $5.7 billion, or 1.4% and 1.3% of cash and invested assets, which included $659 million and $643 million of hedge funds, respectively. Cash distributions on these investments are generated from investment gains, operating income from the underlying investments of the funds and liquidation of the underlying investments of the funds. We estimate that the underlying investments of the funds will be liquidated over the next two to 10 years.Other Invested AssetsThe following table presents the carrying value of our other invested assets by type at: September 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 CarryingValue % ofTotal CarryingValue % ofTotal (Dollars in millions)Freestanding derivatives with positive estimated fair values$7,288 44.6% $8,551 49.5%Tax credit and renewable energy partnerships2,528 15.5 3,167 18.3Direct financing leases1,314 8.0 1,323 7.7Annuities funding structured settlement claims (1)1,281 7.8 1,284 7.4Leveraged leases, net of non-recourse debt1,126 6.9 1,278 7.4Federal Home Loan Bank common stock (2)793 4.9 — —Operating joint ventures613 3.8 539 3.1Funds withheld300 1.8 298 1.7Other1,093 6.7 823 4.8Total$16,336 100.0% $17,263 100.0%        Percentage of cash and invested assets3.6%   3.8%  __________________ (1)See Note 3 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

We use a variety of strategies to manage these risks, including the use of derivatives. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for: •A comprehensive description of the nature of our derivatives, including the strategies for which derivatives are used in managing various risks.•Information about the gross notional amount, estimated fair value, and primary underlying risk exposure of our derivatives by type of hedge designation, excluding embedded derivatives held at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.•The statement of operations effects of derivatives in net investments in foreign operations, cash flow, fair value, or nonqualifying hedge relationships for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk — Management of Market Risk Exposures — Hedging Activities” included in the 2017 Annual Report for more information about our use of derivatives by major hedge program.Fair Value HierarchySee Note 8 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding fair value hierarchy.The valuation of Level 3 derivatives involves the use of significant unobservable inputs and generally requires a higher degree of management judgment or estimation than the valuations of Level 1 and Level 2 derivatives. Although Level 3 inputs are unobservable, management believes they are consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such instruments and are considered appropriate given the circumstances. The use of different inputs or methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair value of Level 3 derivatives and could materially affect net income.Derivatives categorized as Level 3 at September 30, 2018 include: interest rate forwards with maturities which extend beyond the observable portion of the yield curve; interest rate total return swaps with unobservable repurchase rates; foreign currency swaps and forwards with certain unobservable inputs, including the unobservable portion of the yield curve; credit default swaps priced using unobservable credit spreads, or that are priced through independent broker quotations; equity variance swaps with unobservable volatility inputs; and equity index options with unobservable correlation inputs. At September 30, 2018, less than 1% of the estimated fair value of our derivatives was priced through independent broker quotations.See Note 8 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a rollforward of the fair value measurements for derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs.The gain (loss) on Level 3 derivatives primarily relates to interest rate total return swaps with unobservable repurchase rates, certain purchased equity index options that are valued using models dependent on an unobservable market correlation input, equity variance swaps that are valued using an unobservable equity variance spread, interest rate forwards with maturities which extend beyond the observable portion of the yield curve, and foreign currency swaps and forwards that are valued using unobservable inputs, including the unobservable portion of the swap yield curves. The gain (loss) on Level 3 derivatives also reflects observable inputs, including equity index levels, equity volatility and the swap yield curves. We validate the reasonableness of these inputs by valuing the positions using internal models and comparing the results to counterparty valuations.156Table of ContentsThe gain (loss) on Level 3 derivatives, percentage of gain (loss) attributable to observable and unobservable inputs, and the primary drivers of observable gain (loss) are summarized as follows:  Three MonthsEndedSeptember 30, 2018 Nine MonthsEndedSeptember 30, 2018Gain (loss) recognized in net income (loss)  ($70) ($151)Percentage of gain (loss) attributable to observable inputs 69% 83%Primary drivers of observable gain (loss) Increases in interest rates on interest rate total return swaps and, to a lesser extent, increases in certain equity index levels on equity derivatives. Increases in interest rates on interest rate total return swaps and, to a lesser extent, increases in certain equity index levels on equity derivatives.Percentage of gain (loss) attributable to unobservable inputs 31% 17%See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates — Derivatives” included in the 2017 Annual Report for further information on the estimates and assumptions that affect derivatives.Credit RiskSee Note 7 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information about how we manage credit risk related to derivatives and for the estimated fair value of our net derivative assets and net derivative liabilities after the application of master netting agreements and collateral.Our policy is not to offset the fair value amounts recognized for derivatives executed with the same counterparty under the same master netting agreement. This policy applies to the recognition of derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets, and does not affect our legal right of offset.Credit DerivativesThe following table presents the gross notional amount and estimated fair value of credit default swaps at:  September 30, 2018 December 31, 2017Credit Default Swaps GrossNotionalAmount Estimated Fair Value GrossNotionalAmount Estimated Fair Value  (In millions)Purchased $1,986 $(15) $2,020 $(36)Written 11,507 221 11,375 271Total $13,493 $206 $13,395 $235157Table of ContentsThe following table presents the gross gains, gross losses and net gains (losses) recognized in net derivative gains (losses) for credit default swaps as follows:  Three MonthsEndedSeptember 30, Nine MonthsEndedSeptember 30,  2018 2017 2018 2017Credit Default Swaps GrossGains  GrossLosses  NetGains(Losses) GrossGains GrossLosses NetGains(Losses) GrossGains GrossLosses NetGains(Losses) GrossGains GrossLosses NetGains(Losses)  (In millions)Purchased (1) $— $(9) $(9) $2 $(4) $(2) $13 $(11) $2 $5 $(22) $(17)Written (1) 70 — 70 39 (4) 35 32 (41) (9) 118 (7) 111Total $70 $(9) $61 $41 $(8) $33 $45 $(52) $(7) $123 $(29) $94__________________(1)Gains (losses) do not include earned income (expense) on credit default swaps.The favorable change in net gains (losses) on purchased credit default swaps of $19 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was due to certain credit spreads on credit default swaps hedging certain bonds widening in the current period as compared to narrowing in the prior period. The unfavorable change in net gains (losses) on written credit default swaps of ($120) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was due to certain credit spreads on certain credit default swaps used as replications narrowing less on average in the current period as compared to the prior period.The maximum amount at risk related to our written credit default swaps is equal to the corresponding gross notional amount. In a replication transaction, we pair an asset on our balance sheet with a written credit default swap to synthetically replicate a corporate bond, a core asset holding of life insurance companies. Replications are entered into in accordance with the guidelines approved by state insurance regulators and the NAIC and are an important tool in managing the overall corporate credit risk within the Company. In order to match our long-dated insurance liabilities, we seek to buy long-dated corporate bonds. In some instances, these may not be readily available in the market, or they may be issued by corporations to which we already have significant corporate credit exposure. For example, by purchasing Treasury bonds (or other high-quality assets) and associating them with written credit default swaps on the desired corporate credit name, we can replicate the desired bond exposures and meet our ALM needs. In addition, given the shorter tenor of the credit default swaps (generally five-year tenors) versus a long dated corporate bond, we have more flexibility in managing our credit exposures.Embedded Derivatives See Note 8 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information about embedded derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis and their corresponding fair value hierarchy and a rollforward of the fair value measurements for embedded derivatives measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs.See Note 7 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the nonperformance risk adjustment included in the valuation of guaranteed minimum benefits accounted for as embedded derivatives.See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates — Derivatives” included in the 2017 Annual Report for further information on the estimates and assumptions that affect embedded derivatives.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Credit and Committed FacilitiesWe maintain an unsecured revolving credit facility and certain committed facilities with various financial institutions. See “— Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Company — Liquidity and Capital Sources — Global Funding Sources — Credit and Committed Facilities” for further descriptions of such arrangements. For the classification of expenses on such revolving credit and committed facilities and the nature of the associated liability for letters of credit issued and drawdowns on these facilities, see Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2017 Annual Report.158Table of ContentsCollateral for Securities Lending, Third-Party Custodian Administered Repurchase Programs and DerivativesWe participate in a securities lending program in the normal course of business for the purpose of enhancing the total return on our investment portfolio. Periodically, we receive non-cash collateral for securities lending from counterparties, which cannot be sold or re-pledged, and which has not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of this collateral was $0 and $19 million at estimated fair value at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and “— Investments — Securities Lending,” as well as “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — Investments — Securities Lending Program” in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2017 Annual Report for a discussion of our securities lending program, the classification of revenues and expenses, and the nature of the secured financing arrangement and associated liability. We also participate in third-party custodian administered repurchase programs for the purpose of enhancing the total return on our investment portfolio. We loan certain of our fixed maturity securities AFS to financial institutions and, in exchange, non-cash collateral is put on deposit by the financial institutions on our behalf with third-party custodians. The estimated fair value of securities loaned in connection with these transactions was $176 million and $182 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Non-cash collateral on deposit with third-party custodians on our behalf was $186 million and $194 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, which cannot be sold or re-pledged, and which has not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets.We enter into derivatives to manage various risks relating to our ongoing business operations. We have non-cash collateral from counterparties for derivatives, which can be sold or re-pledged subject to certain constraints, and which has not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. The amount of this non-cash collateral was $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. See “— Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Company — Liquidity and Capital Uses — Pledged Collateral” and Note 7 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the earned income on and the gross notional amount, estimated fair value of assets and liabilities and primary underlying risk exposure of our derivatives.Lease CommitmentsAs lessee, we have entered into various lease and sublease agreements for office space, information technology and other equipment. Our commitments under such lease agreements are included within the contractual obligations table. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Company — Contractual Obligations” and Note 20 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2017 Annual Report.GuaranteesSee “Guarantees” in Note 15 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.OtherWe enter into the following additional commitments in the normal course of business for the purpose of enhancing the total return on our investment portfolio: mortgage loan commitments and commitments to fund partnerships, bank credit facilities, bridge loans and private corporate bond investments. See “Net Investment Income” and “Net Investment Gains (Losses)” in Note 6 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the investment income, investment expense, and gains and losses from such investments. See also “— Investments — Fixed Maturity Securities AFS” and “— Investments — Mortgage Loans” for information on our investments in fixed maturity securities AFS and mortgage loans. See “— Investments — Real Estate and Real Estate Joint Ventures” and “— Investments — Other Limited Partnership Interests” for information on our partnership investments. Other than the commitments disclosed in Note 15 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, there are no other material obligations or liabilities arising from the commitments to fund mortgage loans, partnerships, bank credit facilities, bridge loans, and private corporate bond investments. Policyholder Liabilities We establish, and carry as liabilities, actuarially determined amounts that are calculated to meet policy obligations or to provide for future annuity payments. Amounts for actuarial liabilities are computed and reported on the interim condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. For more details on Policyholder Liabilities, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Summary of Critical Accounting Estimates” included in the 2017 Annual Report.159Table of ContentsDue to the nature of the underlying risks and the uncertainty associated with the determination of actuarial liabilities, we cannot precisely determine the amounts that will ultimately be paid with respect to these actuarial liabilities, and the ultimate amounts may vary from the estimated amounts, particularly when payments may not occur until well into the future.We periodically review our estimates of actuarial liabilities for future benefits and compare them with our actual experience. We revise estimates, to the extent permitted or required under GAAP, if we determine that future expected experience differs from assumptions used in the development of actuarial liabilities. We charge or credit changes in our liabilities to expenses in the period the liabilities are established or re-estimated. If the liabilities originally established for future benefit payments prove inadequate, we must increase them. Such an increase could adversely affect our earnings and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We have experienced, and will likely in the future experience, catastrophe losses and possibly acts of terrorism, as well as turbulent financial markets that may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Due to their nature, we cannot predict the incidence, timing, severity or amount of losses from catastrophes and acts of terrorism, but we make broad use of catastrophic and non-catastrophic reinsurance to manage risk from these perils. We also use hedging, reinsurance and other risk management activities to mitigate financial market volatility.Insurance regulators in many of the non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate require certain MetLife entities to prepare a sufficiency analysis of the reserves presented in the locally required regulatory financial statements, and to submit that analysis to the regulatory authorities. See “— Industry Trends — Regulatory Developments” and “Business — Regulation — U.S. Regulation — Insurance Regulation — Policy and Contract Reserve Adequacy Analysis” and “Business — Regulation — International Regulation” included in the 2017 Annual Report for further information. Future Policy BenefitsWe establish liabilities for amounts payable under insurance policies. See Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2017 Annual Report for additional information. See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends — Impact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment — Low Interest Rate Scenario” included in the 2017 Annual Report and “— Variable Annuity Guarantees.” A discussion of future policy benefits by segment (as well as Corporate & Other) follows.U.S.Amounts payable under insurance policies for this segment are comprised of group insurance and annuities, as well as property & casualty policies. For group insurance, future policyholder benefits are comprised mainly of liabilities for disabled lives under disability waiver of premium policy provisions, liabilities for survivor income benefit insurance, active life policies and premium stabilization and other contingency liabilities held under life insurance contracts. For group annuity contracts, future policyholder benefits are primarily related to payout annuities, including pension risk transfers, structured settlement annuities and institutional income annuities. There is no interest rate crediting flexibility on these liabilities. As a result, a sustained low interest rate environment could negatively impact earnings; however, we mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies, including the use of various interest rate derivative positions. The components of future policy benefits related to our property & casualty policies are liabilities for unpaid claims, estimated based upon assumptions such as rates of claim frequencies, levels of severities, inflation, judicial trends, legislative changes or regulatory decisions. Assumptions are based upon our historical experience and analysis of historical development patterns of the relationship of loss adjustment expenses to losses for each line of business, and we consider the effects of current developments, anticipated trends and risk management programs, reduced for anticipated salvage and subrogation.AsiaFuture policy benefits for this segment are held primarily for traditional life, endowment, annuity and accident & health contracts. They are also held for total return pass-through provisions included in certain universal life and savings products. They include certain liabilities for variable annuity and variable life guarantees of minimum death benefits, and longevity guarantees. Factors impacting these liabilities include sustained periods of lower yields than rates established at policy issuance, lower than expected asset reinvestment rates, market volatility, actual lapses resulting in lower than expected income, and actual mortality or morbidity resulting in higher than expected benefit payments. We mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies.160Table of ContentsLatin AmericaFuture policy benefits for this segment are held primarily for immediate annuities in Chile, Argentina and Mexico and traditional life contracts mainly in Mexico, Brazil and Colombia. There are also liabilities held for total return pass-through provisions included in certain universal life and savings products in Mexico. Factors impacting these liabilities include sustained periods of lower yields than rates established at policy issuance, lower than expected asset reinvestment rates, and mortality and lapses different than expected. We mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies.EMEAFuture policy benefits for this segment include unearned premium reserves for group life and credit insurance contracts. Future policy benefits are also held for traditional life, endowment and annuity contracts with significant mortality risk and accident & health contracts. Factors impacting these liabilities include lower than expected asset reinvestment rates, market volatility, actual lapses resulting in lower than expected income, and actual mortality or morbidity resulting in higher than expected benefit payments. We mitigate our risks by having premiums which are adjustable or cancellable in some cases, and by applying various ALM strategies.MetLife HoldingsFuture policy benefits for the life business are comprised mainly of liabilities for traditional life insurance contracts. In order to manage risk, we have often reinsured a portion of the mortality risk on life insurance policies. We routinely evaluate our reinsurance programs, which may result in increases or decreases to existing coverage. We have entered into various interest rate derivative positions to mitigate the risk that investment of premiums received and reinvestment of maturing assets over the life of the policy will be at rates below those assumed in the original pricing of these contracts. For the annuities business, future policy benefits are comprised mainly of liabilities for life-contingent income annuities and liabilities for the variable annuity guaranteed minimum benefits that are accounted for as insurance. Other future policyholder benefits are comprised mainly of liabilities for disabled lives under disability waiver of premium policy provisions, and active life policies. In addition, for our other products, future policyholder benefits related to the reinsurance of our former Japan joint venture are comprised of liabilities for the variable annuity guaranteed minimum benefits that are accounted for as insurance.Corporate & OtherFuture policy benefits primarily include liabilities for other reinsurance business. Additionally, future policy benefits include liabilities for the U.S direct business sold directly to consumers.Policyholder Account BalancesPolicyholder account balances are generally equal to the account value, which includes accrued interest credited, but excludes the impact of any applicable charge that may be incurred upon surrender. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends — Impact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment — Low Interest Rate Scenario” included in the 2017 Annual Report and “— Variable Annuity Guarantees.” See also Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2017 Annual Report for additional information. A discussion of policyholder account balances by segment follows.U.S.Policyholder account balances in this segment are comprised of funding agreements, retained asset accounts, universal life policies, the fixed account of variable life insurance policies and specialized life insurance products for benefit programs. Group BenefitsPolicyholder account balances in this business are held for retained asset accounts, universal life policies, the fixed account of variable life insurance policies and specialized life insurance products for benefit programs. Policyholder account balances are credited interest at a rate we determine, which is influenced by current market rates. A sustained low interest rate environment could adversely impact liabilities and earnings as a result of the minimum credited rate guarantees present in most of these policyholder account balances. We have various interest rate derivative positions to partially mitigate the risks associated with such a scenario.161Table of ContentsThe table below presents the breakdown of account value subject to minimum guaranteed crediting rates for Group Benefits: September 30, 2018Guaranteed Minimum Crediting RateAccountValue AccountValue atGuarantee (In millions)Greater than 0% but less than 2%$4,772 $4,649Equal to or greater than 2% but less than 4%$1,782 $1,782Equal to or greater than 4%$735 $707Retirement and Income SolutionsPolicyholder account balances in this business are primarily comprised of funding agreements. Interest crediting rates vary by type of contract, and can be fixed or variable. Variable interest crediting rates are generally tied to an external index, most commonly (1-month or 3-month) London Interbank Offered Rate. We are exposed to interest rate risks, as well as foreign currency exchange rate risk, when guaranteeing payment of interest and return of principal at the contractual maturity date. We may invest in floating rate assets or enter into receive-floating interest rate swaps, also tied to external indices, as well as interest rate caps, to mitigate the impact of changes in market interest rates. We also mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies and seek to hedge all foreign currency exchange rate risk through the use of foreign currency hedges, including cross currency swaps.The table below presents the breakdown of account value subject to minimum guaranteed crediting rates for RIS: September 30, 2018Guaranteed Minimum Crediting RateAccountValue AccountValue atGuarantee (In millions)Greater than 0% but less than 2%$139 $—Equal to or greater than 2% but less than 4%$1,106 $122Equal to or greater than 4%$4,606 $4,605AsiaPolicyholder account balances in this segment are held largely for fixed income retirement and savings plans, fixed deferred annuities, interest sensitive whole life products, universal life and, to a lesser degree, liability amounts for unit-linked-type funds that do not meet the GAAP definition of separate accounts. Also included are certain liabilities for retirement and savings products sold in certain countries in Asia that generally are sold with minimum credited rate guarantees. Liabilities for guarantees on certain variable annuities in Asia are accounted for as embedded derivatives and recorded at estimated fair value and are also included within policyholder account balances. A sustained low interest rate environment could adversely impact liabilities and earnings as a result of the minimum credited rate guarantees present in most of these policyholder account balances. We mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies and with reinsurance. Liabilities for unit-linked-type funds are impacted by changes in the fair value of the associated underlying investments, as the return on assets is generally passed directly to the policyholder.162Table of ContentsThe table below presents the breakdown of account value subject to minimum guaranteed crediting rates for Asia: September 30, 2018Guaranteed Minimum Crediting Rate AccountValue AccountValue atGuarantee (In millions)Annuities   Greater than 0% but less than 2%$24,946 $1,963Equal to or greater than 2% but less than 4%$1,221 $402Equal to or greater than 4%$1 $1Life & Other   Greater than 0% but less than 2%$9,631 $9,344Equal to or greater than 2% but less than 4%$23,696 $8,980Equal to or greater than 4%$279 $279Latin AmericaPolicyholder account balances in this segment are held largely for investment-type products and universal life products in Mexico and Chile, and deferred annuities in Brazil. Some of the deferred annuities in Brazil are unit-linked-type funds that do not meet the GAAP definition of separate accounts. The rest of the deferred annuities have minimum credited rate guarantees, which could adversely impact liabilities and earnings in a sustained low interest rate environment. Liabilities for unit-linked-type funds are impacted by changes in the fair value of the associated investments, as the return on assets is generally passed directly to the policyholder.EMEAPolicyholder account balances in this segment are held mostly for universal life, deferred annuity, pension products, and unit-linked-type funds that do not meet the GAAP definition of separate accounts. They are also held for endowment products without significant mortality risk. A sustained low interest rate environment could adversely impact liabilities and earnings as a result of the minimum credited rate guarantees present in many of these policyholder account balances. We mitigate our risks by applying various ALM strategies. Liabilities for unit-linked-type funds are impacted by changes in the fair value of the associated investments, as the return on assets is generally passed directly to the policyholder.MetLife HoldingsLife policyholder account balances are held for retained asset accounts, universal life policies, the fixed account of variable life insurance policies, and funding agreements. For annuities, policyholder account balances are held for fixed deferred annuities, the fixed account portion of variable annuities, non-life contingent income annuities, and embedded derivatives related to variable annuity guarantees. Interest is credited to the policyholder’s account at interest rates we determine which are influenced by current market rates, subject to specified minimums. A sustained low interest rate environment could adversely impact liabilities and earnings as a result of the minimum credited rate guarantees present in most of these policyholder account balances. We have various interest rate derivative positions to partially mitigate the risks associated with such a scenario. Additionally, for our other products, policyholder account balances are held for variable annuity guarantees assumed from a former operating joint venture in Japan that are accounted for as embedded derivatives.The table below presents the breakdown of account value subject to minimum guaranteed crediting rates for the MetLife Holdings segment: September 30, 2018Guaranteed Minimum Crediting RateAccountValue AccountValue atGuarantee (In millions)Greater than 0% but less than 2%$1,567 $1,475Equal to or greater than 2% but less than 4%$18,983 $16,539Equal to or greater than 4%$8,171 $5,497163Table of ContentsVariable Annuity Guarantees We issue, directly and through assumed business, certain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefits that provide the policyholder a minimum return based on their initial deposit (i.e., the benefit base) less withdrawals. In some cases, the benefit base may be increased by additional deposits, bonus amounts, accruals or optional market value resets. See Notes 1 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2017 Annual Report, as well as Note 4 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional information.Certain guarantees, including portions thereof, have insurance liabilities established that are included in future policy benefits. Guarantees accounted for in this manner include guaranteed minimum death benefits (“GMDBs”), the life-contingent portion of certain guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits (“GMWBs”), and the non-life contingent portions of both GMWBs and guaranteed minimum income benefits (“GMIBs”) that require annuitization. These liabilities are accrued over the life of the contract in proportion to actual and future expected policy assessments based on the level of guaranteed minimum benefits generated using multiple scenarios of separate account returns. The scenarios are based on best estimate assumptions consistent with those used to amortize DAC. When current estimates of future benefits exceed those previously projected or when current estimates of future assessments are lower than those previously projected, liabilities will increase, resulting in a current period charge to net income. The opposite result occurs when the current estimates of future benefits are lower than those previously projected or when current estimates of future assessments exceed those previously projected. At the end of each reporting period, we update the actual amount of business remaining in-force, which impacts expected future assessments and the projection of estimated future benefits resulting in a current period charge or increase to earnings.Certain guarantees, including portions thereof, accounted for as embedded derivatives, are recorded at estimated fair value and included in policyholder account balances. Guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives include guaranteed minimum accumulation benefits (“GMABs”), and the non-life contingent portions of both GMWBs and GMIBs that do not require annuitization. The estimated fair values of guarantees accounted for as embedded derivatives are determined based on the present value of projected future benefits minus the present value of projected future fees. The projections of future benefits and future fees require capital market and actuarial assumptions including expectations concerning policyholder behavior. A risk-neutral valuation methodology is used to project the cash flows from the guarantees under multiple capital market scenarios to determine an economic liability. The reported estimated fair value is then determined by taking the present value of these risk-free generated cash flows using a discount rate that incorporates a spread over the risk-free rate to reflect our nonperformance risk and adding a risk margin. For more information on the determination of estimated fair value, see Note 8 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.The table below presents the carrying value for guarantees at:  Future PolicyBenefits PolicyholderAccount Balances September 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 September 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 (In millions)Asia       GMDB$26 $38 $— $—GMAB— — 22 19GMWB92 92 197 182EMEA       GMDB— 1 — —GMAB— — 6 15GMWB35 42 (123) (90)MetLife Holdings       GMDB278 304 — —GMIB708 581 (232) (125)GMAB— — (1) —GMWB121 183 236 322Total$1,260 $1,241 $105 $323164Table of ContentsThe carrying amounts for guarantees included in policyholder account balances above include nonperformance risk adjustments of $106 million and $130 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. These nonperformance risk adjustments represent the impact of including a credit spread when discounting the underlying risk-neutral cash flows to determine the estimated fair values. The nonperformance risk adjustment does not have an economic impact on us as it cannot be monetized given the nature of these policyholder liabilities. The change in valuation arising from the nonperformance risk adjustment is not hedged.The carrying values of these guarantees can change significantly during periods of sizable and sustained shifts in equity market performance, equity volatility, interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. Carrying values are also impacted by our assumptions around mortality, separate account returns and policyholder behavior, including lapse rates.As discussed below, we use a combination of product design, hedging strategies, reinsurance, and other risk management actions to mitigate the risks related to these benefits. Within each type of guarantee, there is a range of product offerings reflecting the changing nature of these products over time. Changes in product features and terms are in part driven by customer demand but, more importantly, reflect our risk management practices of continuously evaluating the guaranteed benefits and their associated asset-liability matching. Recently, we have been diversifying the concentration of income benefits in the portfolio of the Company’s annuities business by focusing on withdrawal benefits, variable annuities without living benefits and index-linked annuities. The sections below provide further detail by total account value for certain of our most popular guarantees. Total account values include amounts not reported on the consolidated balance sheets from assumed business, Unit-linked investments that do not qualify for presentation as separate account assets, and amounts included in our general account. The total account values and the net amounts at risk include direct and assumed business, but exclude offsets from hedging or ceded reinsurance, if any.GMDBsWe offer a range of GMDBs to our contractholders. The table below presents GMDBs, by benefit type, at September 30, 2018: Total Account Value (1) Asia & EMEA MetLife Holdings (In millions)Return of premium or five to seven year step-up$6,887 $51,401Annual step-up— 3,482Roll-up and step-up combination— 6,132Total$6,887 $61,015__________________(1)Total account value excludes $242 million for contracts with no GMDBs. The Company’s annuity contracts with guarantees may offer more than one type of guarantee in each contract. Therefore, the amounts listed for GMDBs and for living benefit guarantees are not mutually exclusive.Based on total account value, less than 19% of our GMDBs included enhanced death benefits such as the annual step-up or roll-up and step-up combination products. We expect the above GMDB risk profile to be relatively consistent for the foreseeable future.165Table of ContentsLiving Benefit GuaranteesThe table below presents our living benefit guarantees based on total account values at September 30, 2018: Total Account Value (1) Asia & EMEA MetLife Holdings (In millions)GMIB$— $23,417GMWB - non-life contingent (2)2,101 2,885GMWB - life-contingent3,311 10,223GMAB1,076 420Total$6,488 $36,945__________________(1)Total account value excludes $24.3 billion for contracts with no living benefit guarantees. The Company’s annuity contracts with guarantees may offer more than one type of guarantee in each contract. Therefore, the amounts listed for GMDBs and for living benefit guarantee amounts are not mutually exclusive.(2)The Asia and EMEA segments include the non-life contingent portion of the GMWB total account value of $970 million with a guarantee at annuitization.In terms of total account value, GMIBs are our most significant living benefit guarantee. Our primary risk management strategy for our GMIB products is our derivatives hedging program as discussed below. Additionally, we have engaged in certain reinsurance agreements covering some of our GMIB business. As part of our overall risk management approach for living benefit guarantees, we continually monitor the reinsurance markets for the right opportunity to purchase additional coverage for our GMIB business.The table below presents our GMIB associated total account values, by their guaranteed payout basis, at September 30, 2018: Total Account Value (In millions)7-year setback, 2.5% interest rate$6,3027-year setback, 1.5% interest rate1,01410-year setback, 1.5% interest rate5,01310-year mortality projection, 10-year setback, 1.0% interest rate9,41410-year mortality projection, 10-year setback, 0.5% interest rate1,675 $23,418The annuitization interest rates on GMIBs have been decreased from 2.5% to 0.5% over time, partially in response to the low interest rate environment, accompanied by an increase in the setback period from seven years to 10 years and the introduction of a 10-year mortality projection.Additionally, 41% of the $23.4 billion of GMIB total account value has been invested in managed volatility funds as of September 30, 2018. These funds seek to manage volatility by adjusting the fund holdings within certain guidelines based on capital market movements. Such activity reduces the overall risk of the underlying funds while maintaining their growth opportunities. These risk mitigation techniques reduce or eliminate the need for us to manage the funds’ volatility through hedging or reinsurance.Our GMIB products typically have a waiting period of 10 years to be eligible for annuitization. As of September 30, 2018, only 18% of our contracts with GMIBs were eligible for annuitization. The remaining contracts are not eligible for annuitization for an average of five years.166Table of ContentsOnce eligible for annuitization, contractholders would be expected to annuitize only if their contracts were in-the-money. We calculate in-the-moneyness with respect to GMIBs consistent with net amount at risk as discussed in Note 4 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, by comparing the contractholders’ income benefits based on total account values and current annuity rates versus the guaranteed income benefits. The net amount at risk was $465 million at September 30, 2018, of which $269 million was related to GMIB guarantees. For those contracts with GMIB, the table below presents details of contracts that are in-the-money and out-of-the-money at September 30, 2018: In-the-Moneyness TotalAccount Value % of Total (In millions)In-the-money30% + $249 1% 20% to 30% 177 1% 10% to 20% 348 2% 0% to 10% 671 3%   1,445  Out-of-the-money-10% to 0% 1,462 6% -20% to -10% 2,990 13% -20% + 17,521 75%   21,973  Total GMIBs  $23,418  Derivatives Hedging Variable Annuity GuaranteesOur risk mitigating hedging strategy uses various over-the-counter and exchange traded derivatives.

We continually monitor the capital markets for opportunities to adjust our liability coverage, as appropriate. Futures are also used to dynamically adjust the daily coverage levels as markets and liability exposures fluctuate.167Table of ContentsWe remain liable for the guaranteed benefits in the event that reinsurers or derivative counterparties are unable or unwilling to pay. Certain of our reinsurance agreements and substantially all derivative positions are collateralized and derivatives positions are subject to master netting agreements, both of which significantly reduce the exposure to counterparty risk. In addition, we are subject to the risk that hedging and other risk management actions prove ineffective or that unanticipated policyholder behavior or mortality, combined with adverse market events, produces economic losses beyond the scope of the risk management techniques employed.Liquidity and Capital Resources OverviewOur business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. Stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in global capital markets, particular markets, or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large investment portfolio and our insurance liabilities and derivatives are sensitive to changing market factors. Changing conditions in the global capital markets and the economy may affect our financing costs and market interest for our debt or equity securities. For further information regarding market factors that could affect our ability to meet liquidity and capital needs, see “— Industry Trends” and “— Investments — Current Environment.”Liquidity ManagementBased upon the strength of our franchise, diversification of our businesses, strong financial fundamentals and the substantial funding sources available to us as described herein, we continue to believe we have access to ample liquidity to meet business requirements under current market conditions and reasonably possible stress scenarios. We continuously monitor and adjust our liquidity and capital plans for MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries in light of market conditions, as well as changing needs and opportunities.Short-term LiquidityWe maintain a substantial short-term liquidity position, which was $10.2 billion and $10.0 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Short-term liquidity includes cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed, including amounts received in connection with securities lending, repurchase agreements, derivatives, and secured borrowings, as well as amounts held in the closed block.Liquid AssetsAn integral part of our liquidity management includes managing our level of liquid assets, which was $205.7 billion and $209.1 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and publicly-traded securities, excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed. Assets pledged or otherwise committed include amounts received in connection with securities lending, repurchase agreements, derivatives, regulatory deposits, the collateral financing arrangement, funding agreements and secured borrowings, as well as amounts held in the closed block.Capital ManagementWe have established several senior management committees as part of our capital management process. These committees, including the Capital Management Committee and the Enterprise Risk Committee (“ERC”), regularly review actual and projected capital levels (under a variety of scenarios including stress scenarios) and our annual capital plan in accordance with our capital policy. The Capital Management Committee is comprised of members of senior management, including MetLife, Inc.’s Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), Treasurer, and Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”). The ERC is also comprised of members of senior management, including MetLife, Inc.’s CFO, CRO and Chief Investment Officer.Our Board of Directors and senior management are directly involved in the development and maintenance of our capital policy. The capital policy sets forth, among other things, minimum and target capital levels and the governance of the capital management process. All capital actions, including proposed changes to the annual capital plan, capital targets or capital policy, are reviewed by the Finance and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors prior to obtaining full Board of Directors approval. The Board of Directors approves the capital policy and the annual capital plan and authorizes capital actions, as required.See “Risk Factors — Capital-Related Risks — Legal and Regulatory Restrictions and Uncertainty and Restrictions Under the Terms of Certain of Our Securities May Prevent Us from Repurchasing Our Stock and Paying Dividends at the Level We Wish” and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2017 Annual Report for information regarding restrictions on payment of dividends and stock repurchases. See also “— The Company — Liquidity and Capital Uses — Common Stock Repurchases” for information regarding MetLife, Inc.’s common stock repurchase authorization.168Table of ContentsThe CompanyLiquidityLiquidity refers to the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet our needs. In the event of significant cash requirements beyond anticipated liquidity needs, we have various alternatives available depending on market conditions and the amount and timing of the liquidity need. These available alternatives include cash flows from operations, sales of liquid assets, global funding sources including commercial paper and various credit and committed facilities.CapitalWe manage our capital position to maintain our financial strength and credit ratings. Our capital position is supported by our ability to generate strong cash flows within our operating companies and borrow funds at competitive rates, as well as by our demonstrated ability to raise additional capital to meet operating and growth needs despite adverse market and economic conditions.Summary of the Company’s Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and CapitalOur primary sources and uses of liquidity and capital are summarized as follows: Nine MonthsEndedSeptember 30, 2018 2017 (In millions)Sources:   Operating activities, net$10,437 $10,233Changes in policyholder account balances, net4,168 5,332Changes in payables for collateral under securities loaned and other transactions, net719 2,316Long-term debt issued24 3,657Preferred stock issued, net of issuance costs1,274 —Effect of change in foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents— 382Total sources16,622 21,920Uses:   Investing activities, net10,992 17,158Long-term debt repaid1,311 60Collateral financing arrangements repaid48 2,852Distribution of Brighthouse— 2,793Financing element on certain derivative instruments and other derivative related transactions, net15 109Treasury stock acquired in connection with share repurchases2,792 2,305Dividends on preferred stock84 58Dividends on common stock1,263 1,295Other, net141 144Effect of change in foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents187 —Total uses16,833 26,774Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents$(211) $(4,854)Cash Flows from OperationsThe principal cash inflows from our insurance activities come from insurance premiums, net investment income, annuity considerations and deposit funds. The principal cash outflows are the result of various life insurance, property & casualty, annuity and pension products, operating expenses and income tax, as well as interest expense. A primary liquidity concern with respect to these cash flows is the risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal. The cash flows from discontinued operations are not separately classified, but generally arise from the same activities described above.169Table of ContentsCash Flows from InvestmentsThe principal cash inflows from our investment activities come from repayments of principal, proceeds from maturities and sales of investments and settlements of freestanding derivatives. The principal cash outflows relate to purchases of investments, issuances of policy loans and settlements of freestanding derivatives. Additional cash outflows relate to purchases of businesses. We typically have a net cash outflow from investing activities because cash inflows from insurance operations are reinvested in accordance with our ALM discipline to fund insurance liabilities. We closely monitor and manage these risks through our comprehensive investment risk management process. The primary liquidity concerns with respect to these cash flows are the risk of default by debtors and market disruption. The cash flows from discontinued operations are not separately classified, but generally arise from the same activities described above.Cash Flows from FinancingThe principal cash inflows from our financing activities come from issuances of debt and other securities, deposits of funds associated with policyholder account balances and lending of securities. The principal cash outflows come from repayments of debt and collateral financing arrangements, payments of dividends on and repurchases of MetLife, Inc.’s securities, withdrawals associated with policyholder account balances and the return of securities on loan. The primary liquidity concerns with respect to these cash flows are market disruption and the risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal. The cash flows from discontinued operations are not separately classified, but generally arise from the same activities described above.Liquidity and Capital SourcesIn addition to the general description of liquidity and capital sources in “— Summary of the Company’s Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital,” the Company’s primary sources of liquidity and capital are set forth below. See Notes 3 and 9 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding financing transactions related to the Separation.Global Funding SourcesLiquidity is provided by a variety of global funding sources, including funding agreements, credit and committed facilities and commercial paper. Capital is provided by a variety of global funding sources, including short-term and long-term debt, the collateral financing arrangement, junior subordinated debt securities, preferred securities, equity securities and equity-linked securities. The diversity of our global funding sources enhances our funding flexibility, limits dependence on any one market or source of funds and generally lowers the cost of funds. Our primary global funding sources include:Preferred StockIn June 2018, MetLife, Inc. issued 32,200 shares of 5.625% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series E (the “Series E preferred stock”) with a $0.01 par value per share and a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share, for aggregate net proceeds of $780 million.In March 2018, MetLife, Inc. issued 500,000 shares of 5.875% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series D (the “Series D preferred stock”) with a $0.01 par value per share and a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share, for aggregate net proceeds of $494 million. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Common StockDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, MetLife, Inc. issued 2,718,456 and 3,505,240 new shares of its common stock, respectively, for $97 million and $124 million, respectively, to satisfy various stock option exercises and other stock-based awards.Commercial Paper, Reported in Short-term DebtMetLife, Inc. and MetLife Funding, Inc. (“MetLife Funding”), a subsidiary of Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (“MLIC”), each have a commercial paper program that is supported by our unsecured revolving credit facility (see “— Credit and Committed Facilities”). MetLife Funding raises cash from its commercial paper program and uses the proceeds to extend loans through MetLife Credit Corp., another subsidiary of MLIC, to affiliates in order to enhance the financial flexibility and liquidity of these companies.170Table of ContentsFederal Home Loan Bank Funding Agreements, Reported in Policyholder Account BalancesCertain of our domestic insurance subsidiaries are members of a regional Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”). During the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, we issued $22.1 billion and $16.1 billion, respectively, and repaid $22.3 billion and $16.1 billion, respectively, under funding agreements with certain regional FHLBs. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, total obligations outstanding under these funding agreements were $15.1 billion and $15.3 billion, respectively. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2017 Annual Report.Federal Home Loan Bank Advance Agreements, Reported in Payables for Collateral Under Securities Loaned and Other TransactionsDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2018, we issued $2.3 billion and repaid $1.8 billion, under advance agreements with a regional FHLB. There were no such transactions during the nine months ended September 30, 2017. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, total obligations outstanding under these advance agreements were $800 million and $300 million, respectively. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.Special Purpose Entity Funding Agreements, Reported in Policyholder Account BalancesWe issue fixed and floating rate funding agreements, which are denominated in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies, to certain special purpose entities (“SPEs”) that have issued either debt securities or commercial paper for which payment of interest and principal is secured by such funding agreements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, we issued $31.8 billion and $32.8 billion, respectively, and repaid $32.8 billion and $31.3 billion, respectively, under such funding agreements. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, total obligations outstanding under these funding agreements were $33.3 billion and $34.2 billion, respectively. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2017 Annual Report.Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation Funding Agreements, Reported in Policyholder Account BalancesWe have issued funding agreements to a subsidiary of the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (“Farmer Mac”), as well as to certain SPEs that have issued debt securities for which payment of interest and principal is secured by such funding agreements, and such debt securities are also guaranteed as to payment of interest and principal by Farmer Mac. The obligations under all such funding agreements are secured by a pledge of certain eligible agricultural mortgage loans. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, we issued $900 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, and repaid $900 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, under such funding agreements. At both September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, total obligations outstanding under these funding agreements were $2.6 billion. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2017 Annual Report.Credit and Committed FacilitiesAt September 30, 2018, we maintained a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and certain committed facilities aggregating $3.3 billion. When drawn upon, these facilities bear interest at varying rates in accordance with the respective agreements.Our unsecured revolving credit facility is used for general corporate purposes, to support the borrowers’ commercial paper programs and for the issuance of letters of credit. At September 30, 2018, we had outstanding $436 million in letters of credit and no drawdowns against this facility. Remaining availability was $2.6 billion at September 30, 2018.Our committed facilities are used as collateral for certain of our reinsurance liabilities. At September 30, 2018, we had outstanding $2.8 billion in letters of credit and no drawdowns against these facilities. Remaining availability was $508 million at September 30, 2018. See “— Acquisitions and Dispositions.”See Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2017 Annual Report for further information about these facilities.We have no reason to believe that our lending counterparties will be unable to fulfill their respective contractual obligations under these facilities. As commitments under our credit and committed facilities may expire unused, these amounts do not necessarily reflect our future cash funding requirements.171Table of ContentsOutstanding Debt Under Global Funding SourcesThe following table summarizes our outstanding debt, excluding long-term debt relating to CSEs, at: September 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 (In millions)Short-term debt (1)$290 $477Long-term debt (2)$13,403 $15,680Collateral financing arrangement$1,073 $1,121Junior subordinated debt securities$3,146 $3,144__________________(1)Includes $191 million and $377 million of debt that is non-recourse to MetLife, Inc. and MLIC, subject to customary exceptions, at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Certain subsidiaries have pledged assets to secure this debt.(2)Includes $480 million and $523 million of debt that is non-recourse to MetLife, Inc. and MLIC, subject to customary exceptions, at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Certain investment subsidiaries have pledged assets to secure this debt.Debt and Facility CovenantsCertain of our debt instruments and committed facilities, as well as our unsecured revolving credit facility, contain various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants. We believe we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants at September 30, 2018.Liquidity and Capital UsesIn addition to the general description of liquidity and capital uses in “— Summary of the Company’s Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital,” the Company’s primary uses of liquidity and capital are set forth below.Common Stock RepurchasesDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, MetLife, Inc. repurchased 59,602,926 shares and 44,737,625 shares of its common stock, respectively, through open market purchases for $2.8 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. On November 1, 2017 and May 22, 2018, MetLife, Inc. announced that its Board of Directors authorized $2.0 billion and $1.5 billion of common stock repurchases, respectively. In June 2018, MetLife, Inc. completed all common stock repurchases under the November 2017 authorization. At September 30, 2018, MetLife, Inc. had $470 million of common stock repurchases remaining under the May 2018 authorization. On November 1, 2018, MetLife, Inc. announced that its Board of Directors authorized an additional $2.0 billion of common stock repurchases. Under these authorizations, MetLife, Inc. may purchase its common stock from the MetLife Policyholder Trust, in the open market (including pursuant to the terms of a pre-set trading plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”)) and in privately negotiated transactions.Common stock repurchases are dependent upon several factors, including our capital position, liquidity, financial strength and credit ratings, general market conditions, the market price of MetLife, Inc.’s common stock compared to management’s assessment of the stock’s underlying value and applicable regulatory approvals, as well as other legal and accounting factors. See “Business — Regulation,” “Risk Factors — Capital-Related Risks — Legal and Regulatory Restrictions and Uncertainty and Restrictions Under the Terms of Certain of Our Securities May Prevent Us from Repurchasing Our Stock and Paying Dividends at the Level We Wish” and Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2017 Annual Report.172Table of ContentsDividendsDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, MetLife, Inc. paid dividends on its preferred stock of $84 million and $58 million, respectively. During both the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, MetLife, Inc. paid $1.3 billion of dividends on its common stock. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the calculation and timing of these dividend payments.Dividends are paid quarterly on MetLife, Inc.’s Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A. Dividends are paid semi-annually on MetLife, Inc.’s 5.25% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series C until June 15, 2020 and, thereafter, will be paid quarterly. Dividends are paid semi-annually on MetLife, Inc.’s 5.875% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series D, in September and March until March 15, 2028 and, thereafter, will be paid quarterly. Dividends are paid quarterly on MetLife, Inc.’s 5.625% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series E.The declaration and payment of common stock dividends is subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, and will depend on MetLife, Inc.’s financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, future prospects, regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by MetLife, Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2017 Annual Report for additional information. See also Note 16 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding a common stock dividend declared subsequent to September 30, 2018.Dividend RestrictionsThe payment of dividends is also subject to restrictions under the terms of our preferred stock and junior subordinated debentures in situations where we may be experiencing financial stress. See “Risk Factors — Capital-Related Risks — Legal and Regulatory Restrictions and Uncertainty and Restrictions Under the Terms of Certain of Our Securities May Prevent Us from Repurchasing Our Stock and Paying Dividends at the Level We Wish” in the 2017 Annual Report, as amended or supplemented in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q in similarly named sections under the caption “Risk Factors,” Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2017 Annual Report and Note 10 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. If additional capital requirements are imposed on MetLife, Inc. as a global systemically important insurer (“G-SII”), its ability to pay dividends could be reduced. See “Business — Regulation — International Regulation — Other International and Global Regulatory Initiatives” in the 2017 Annual Report. Debt Repayments•During the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, following regulatory approval, MetLife Reinsurance Company of Charleston, a wholly-owned subsidiary of MetLife, Inc., repurchased and canceled $48 million and $55 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of its surplus notes, which are reported in collateral financing arrangement on the consolidated balance sheets.•In August 2018, MetLife, Inc. repaid at maturity the remaining $533 million of its 6.817% senior notes.Debt Repurchases, Redemptions and ExchangesWe may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, redemptions and/or exchanges for other securities, in open market purchases, redemptions, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Any such repurchases, redemptions or exchanges will be dependent upon several factors, including our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, general market conditions, and applicable regulatory, legal and accounting factors. Whether or not to repurchase or redeem any debt and the size and timing of any such repurchases or redemptions will be determined at our discretion.In June 2018, MetLife, Inc. sold FVO Brighthouse Common Stock in exchange for $944 million in aggregate principal amount of its senior notes. In August and June 2018, MetLife, Inc. purchased for cash $566 million and $160 million, respectively, in aggregate principal amount of its senior notes. See Notes 3 and 9 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these transactions.173Table of ContentsSupport AgreementsMetLife, Inc. and several of its subsidiaries (each, an “Obligor”) are parties to various capital support commitments and guarantees with subsidiaries. Under these arrangements, each Obligor has agreed to cause the applicable entity to meet specified capital and surplus levels or has guaranteed certain contractual obligations. We anticipate that in the event these arrangements place demands upon us, there will be sufficient liquidity and capital to enable us to meet such demands. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — MetLife, Inc. — Liquidity and Capital Uses — Support Agreements” included in the 2017 Annual Report. Insurance LiabilitiesLiabilities arising from our insurance activities primarily relate to benefit payments under various life insurance, property & casualty, annuity and group pension products, as well as payments for policy surrenders, withdrawals and loans. For annuity or deposit type products, surrender or lapse behavior differs somewhat by segment. In the MetLife Holdings segment, which includes individual annuities, lapses and surrenders tend to occur in the normal course of business. During the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, general account surrenders and withdrawals from annuity products were $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. In the RIS business within the U.S. segment, which includes pension risk transfers, bank-owned life insurance and other fixed annuity contracts, as well as funding agreements and other capital market products, most of the products offered have fixed maturities or fairly predictable surrenders or withdrawals. With regard to the RIS business products that provide customers with limited rights to accelerate payments, at September 30, 2018 there were funding agreements totaling $176 million that could be put back to the Company.Pledged CollateralWe pledge collateral to, and have collateral pledged to us by, counterparties in connection with our derivatives. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had received pledged cash collateral from counterparties of $3.5 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we had pledged cash collateral to counterparties of $459 million and $456 million, respectively. With respect to derivative contracts between two counterparties which are in a net liability position and have credit contingent provisions, a one-notch downgrade in the Company’s credit or financial strength rating, as applicable, would have required $5 million of additional collateral be provided to our counterparties as of September 30, 2018. See Note 7 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about collateral pledged to us, collateral we pledge and derivatives subject to credit contingent provisions.We pledge collateral and have had collateral pledged to us, and may be required from time to time to pledge additional collateral or be entitled to have additional collateral pledged to us, in connection with the collateral financing arrangement related to the reinsurance of closed block liabilities.We pledge collateral from time to time in connection with funding agreements and advance agreements. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2017 Annual Report and Note 6 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.Securities LendingWe participate in a securities lending program whereby securities are loaned to third parties, primarily brokerage firms and commercial banks. We obtain collateral, usually cash, from the borrower, which must be returned to the borrower when the loaned securities are returned to us. Under our securities lending program, we were liable for cash collateral under our control of $19.3 billion and $19.4 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Of these amounts, $3.1 billion and $3.8 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, were on open, meaning that the related loaned security could be returned to us on the next business day, requiring the immediate return of cash collateral we hold. The estimated fair value of the securities on loan related to the cash collateral on open at September 30, 2018 was $3.0 billion, 99% of which were U.S. government and agency securities which, if put to us, could be immediately sold to satisfy the cash requirement. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.174Table of ContentsRepurchase AgreementsWe participate in short-term repurchase agreements whereby securities are loaned to unaffiliated financial institutions. We obtain collateral, usually cash, from the borrower, which must be returned to the borrower when the loaned securities are returned to us. Under these repurchase agreements, we were liable for cash collateral under our control of $2.5 billion and $1.1 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The estimated fair value of the securities on loan at September 30, 2018 was $2.6 billion which were primarily U.S. government and agency securities which, if put to us, could be immediately sold to satisfy the cash requirement. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.LitigationPutative or certified class action litigation and other litigation, and claims and assessments against us, in addition to those discussed elsewhere herein and those otherwise provided for on the consolidated financial statements, have arisen in the course of our business, including, but not limited to, in connection with our activities as an insurer, employer, investor, investment advisor, taxpayer and, formerly, a mortgage lending bank. Further, state insurance regulatory authorities and other federal and state authorities regularly make inquiries and conduct investigations concerning our compliance with applicable insurance and other laws and regulations. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.We establish liabilities for litigation and regulatory loss contingencies when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. For material matters where a loss is believed to be reasonably possible but not probable, no accrual is made but we disclose the nature of the contingency and an aggregate estimate of the reasonably possible range of loss in excess of amounts accrued, when such an estimate can be made. It is not possible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of all pending investigations and legal proceedings. In some of the matters referred to herein, very large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages, are sought. Although in light of these considerations, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain cases could have a material adverse effect upon our financial position, based on information currently known by us, in our opinion, the outcome of such pending investigations and legal proceedings are not likely to have such an effect. However, given the large and/or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these matters and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods.Contractual ObligationsSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — The Company — Contractual Obligations” included in the 2017 Annual Report for additional information regarding the Company’s contractual obligations.MetLife, Inc.Liquidity and Capital ManagementLiquidity and capital are managed to preserve stable, reliable and cost-effective sources of cash to meet all current and future financial obligations and are provided by a variety of sources, including a portfolio of liquid assets, a diversified mix of short- and long-term funding sources from the wholesale financial markets and the ability to borrow through credit and committed facilities. Liquidity is monitored through the use of internal liquidity risk metrics, including the composition and level of the liquid asset portfolio, timing differences in short-term cash flow obligations, access to the financial markets for capital and debt transactions and exposure to contingent draws on MetLife, Inc.’s liquidity. MetLife, Inc. is an active participant in the global financial markets through which it obtains a significant amount of funding. These markets, which serve as cost-effective sources of funds, are critical components of MetLife, Inc.’s liquidity and capital management. Decisions to access these markets are based upon relative costs, prospective views of balance sheet growth and a targeted liquidity profile and capital structure. A disruption in the financial markets could limit MetLife, Inc.’s access to liquidity.MetLife, Inc.’s ability to maintain regular access to competitively priced wholesale funds is fostered by its current credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies. We view our capital ratios, credit quality, stable and diverse earnings streams, diversity of liquidity sources and our liquidity monitoring procedures as critical to retaining such credit ratings.LiquidityFor a summary of MetLife, Inc.’s liquidity, see “— The Company — Liquidity.”175Table of ContentsCapitalFor a summary of MetLife, Inc.’s capital, see “— The Company — Capital.” For further information regarding potential capital restrictions and limitations on MetLife, Inc. as a G-SII, see “— Industry Trends — Regulatory Developments — International Regulation — Other International and Global Regulatory Initiatives,” as well as “Business — Regulation — International Regulation — Other International and Global Regulatory Initiatives” included in the 2017 Annual Report. See also “— The Company — Liquidity and Capital Uses — Common Stock Repurchases” for information regarding MetLife, Inc.’s common stock repurchase authorizations.Liquid AssetsAt September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, MetLife, Inc. and other MetLife holding companies had $4.5 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively, in liquid assets. Of these amounts, $3.6 billion and $4.1 billion were held by MetLife, Inc. and $882 million and $1.6 billion were held by other MetLife holding companies at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and publicly-traded securities excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed. Assets pledged or otherwise committed include amounts received in connection with derivatives and a collateral financing arrangement.Liquid assets held in non-U.S. holding companies are generated in part through dividends from non-U.S. insurance operations. Such dividends are subject to local insurance regulatory requirements, as discussed in “— Liquidity and Capital Sources — Dividends from Subsidiaries.” The cumulative earnings of certain active non-U.S. operations have historically been reinvested indefinitely in such non-U.S. operations. Following a post-Separation review of our capital needs in the third quarter of 2017, we disclosed our intent to repatriate approximately $3.0 billion of pre-2017 earnings. See Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2017 Annual Report for information on the taxation of such cumulative earnings. The Company repatriated $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the remaining $400 million in the second quarter of 2018. As a result of U.S. Tax Reform, we expect to repatriate future foreign earnings back to the U.S. with minimal or no additional U.S. tax. See also Note 13 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — MetLife, Inc. — Liquid Assets” included in the 2017 Annual Report for additional information on the sources and uses of liquid assets, as well as sources and uses of liquid assets included in free cash flow for MetLife, Inc. and other MetLife holding companies. Liquidity and Capital SourcesIn addition to the description of liquidity and capital sources in “— The Company — Summary of the Company’s Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital” and “— The Company — Liquidity and Capital Sources,” MetLife, Inc.’s primary sources of liquidity and capital are set forth below.Dividends from SubsidiariesMetLife, Inc. relies, in part, on dividends from its subsidiaries to meet its cash requirements. MetLife, Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends imposed by the regulators of their respective domiciles. The dividend limitation for U.S. insurance subsidiaries is generally based on the surplus to policyholders at the end of the immediately preceding calendar year and statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year. Statutory accounting practices, as prescribed by insurance regulators of various states in which we conduct business, differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP. The significant differences relate to the treatment of DAC, certain deferred income tax, required investment liabilities, statutory reserve calculation assumptions, goodwill and surplus notes.176Table of ContentsThe table below sets forth the dividends permitted to be paid in 2018 by MetLife, Inc.’s primary insurance subsidiaries without insurance regulatory approval and the respective dividends paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2018:Company Paid (1)  Permitted WithoutApproval (2)  (In millions)Metropolitan Life Insurance Company $2,424(3) $3,075American Life Insurance Company $2,200(4) $—Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company $—  $125Metropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company (5) $—  $73General American Life Insurance Company (5) $—  N/A__________________(1)Reflects all amounts paid, including those requiring regulatory approval.(2)Reflects dividend amounts that may be paid during 2018 without prior regulatory approval. However, because dividend tests may be based on dividends previously paid over rolling 12-month periods, if paid before a specified date during 2018, some or all of such dividends may require regulatory approval.(3)Represents ordinary dividends of $1.7 billion and an extraordinary dividend of $705 million that was paid with regulatory approval. The extraordinary dividend was paid in cash with proceeds from the sale to an affiliate of certain property, equipment, leasehold improvements and computer software that were non-admitted by Metropolitan Life Insurance Company for statutory accounting purposes. The affiliate received a capital contribution in cash from MetLife, Inc. to fund the purchase.(4)Represents extraordinary dividends.(5)In April 2018, Metropolitan Tower Life Insurance Company (“MTL”) merged with General American Life Insurance Company. The surviving entity of the merger was MTL, which re-domesticated from Delaware to Nebraska immediately prior to the merger. Effective as of the re-domestication, MTL is subject to the dividend restrictions under Nebraska law, which are based on amounts reported in MTL’s stand-alone statutory financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. See Note 10 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.In addition to the amounts presented in the table above, during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, MetLife, Inc. received cash of $32 million, representing returns of capital from certain subsidiaries. The dividend capacity of our non-U.S. operations is subject to similar restrictions established by the local regulators. The non-U.S. regulatory regimes also commonly limit dividend payments to the parent company to a portion of the subsidiary’s prior year statutory income, as determined by the local accounting principles. The regulators of our non-U.S. operations, including Japan’s Financial Services Agency, may also limit or not permit profit repatriations or other transfers of funds to the U.S. if such transfers are deemed to be detrimental to the solvency or financial strength of the non-U.S. operations, or for other reasons. Most of our non-U.S. subsidiaries are second tier subsidiaries which are owned by various non-U.S. holding companies. The capital and rating considerations applicable to our first tier subsidiaries may also impact the dividend flow into MetLife, Inc.We proactively manage target and excess capital levels and dividend flows and forecast local capital positions as part of the financial planning cycle. The dividend capacity of certain U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries is also subject to business targets in excess of the minimum capital necessary to maintain the desired rating or level of financial strength in the relevant market.

Credit and Committed FacilitiesSee “— The Company — Liquidity and Capital Sources — Global Funding Sources — Credit and Committed Facilities” for further information regarding the unsecured revolving credit facility and these committed facilities.Our committed facilities are used as collateral for certain of the Company’s reinsurance liabilities. MetLife, Inc. is a party and/or guarantor to committed facilities of certain of its subsidiaries, which aggregated $3.3 billion at September 30, 2018.Long-term Debt OutstandingThe following table summarizes the outstanding long-term debt of MetLife, Inc. at: September 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 (In millions)Long-term debt — unaffiliated$12,365 $14,599Long-term debt — affiliated $1,890 $2,000Junior subordinated debt securities $2,455 $2,454Debt and Facility CovenantsCertain of MetLife, Inc.’s debt instruments and committed facilities, as well as its unsecured revolving credit facility, contain various administrative, reporting, legal and financial covenants.

Based on our analysis and comparison of our current and future cash inflows from the dividends we receive from subsidiaries that are permitted to be paid without prior insurance regulatory approval, our investment portfolio and other cash flows and anticipated access to the capital markets, we believe there will be sufficient liquidity and capital to enable MetLife, Inc. to make payments on debt, pay cash dividends on its common and preferred stock, contribute capital to its subsidiaries, repurchase its common stock, pay all general operating expenses and meet its cash needs.In addition to the description of liquidity and capital uses in “— The Company — Liquidity and Capital Uses,” MetLife, Inc.’s primary uses of liquidity and capital are set forth below.178Table of ContentsAffiliated Capital and Debt TransactionsDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, MetLife, Inc. invested a net amount of $716 million and $735 million, respectively, in various subsidiaries. MetLife, Inc. lends funds, as necessary, to its subsidiaries and affiliates, some of which are regulated, to meet their capital requirements.

We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the understanding of our performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of our business. The following non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as substitutes for the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP:Non-GAAP financial measures:Comparable GAAP financial measures:(i)adjusted revenues(i)revenues(ii)adjusted expenses(ii)expenses(iii)adjusted earnings(iii)income (loss) from continuing operations, net of income tax(iv)adjusted earnings available to commonshareholders(iv)net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholdersReconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable historical GAAP measures are included in the results of operations, see “— Results of Operations.” Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis because we believe it is not possible without unreasonable effort to provide other than a range of net investment gains and losses and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate significantly within or outside the range and from period to period and may have a material impact on net income. Our definitions of the various non-GAAP and other financial measures discussed in this report may differ from those used by other companies.Adjusted earnings and related measures:•adjusted earnings; and•adjusted earnings available to common shareholders.These measures are used by management to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, adjusted earnings is also our GAAP measure of segment performance. Adjusted earnings and other financial measures based on adjusted earnings are also the measures by which senior management’s and many other employees’ performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans. Adjusted earnings and other financial measures based on adjusted earnings allow analysis of our performance relative to our business plan and facilitate comparisons to industry results. 179Table of ContentsAdjusted earnings is defined as adjusted revenues less adjusted expenses, net of income tax. Adjusted loss is defined as negative adjusted earnings. Adjusted earnings available to common shareholders is defined as adjusted earnings less preferred stock dividends.Adjusted revenues and adjusted expenses The financial measures of adjusted revenues and adjusted expenses focus on our primary businesses principally by excluding the impact of market volatility, which could distort trends, and revenues and costs related to non-core products and certain entities required to be consolidated under GAAP. Also, these measures exclude results of discontinued operations under GAAP and other businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by MetLife but do not meet the discontinued operations criteria under GAAP and are referred to as divested businesses. Divested businesses also includes the net impact of transactions with exited businesses that have been eliminated in consolidation under GAAP and costs relating to businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by MetLife that do not meet the criteria to be included in results of discontinued operations under GAAP. Adjusted revenues also excludes net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses). Adjusted expenses also excludes goodwill impairments.The following additional adjustments are made to revenues, in the line items indicated, in calculating adjusted revenues:•Universal life and investment-type product policy fees excludes the amortization of unearned revenue related to net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses) and certain variable annuity GMIB fees (“GMIB fees”);•Net investment income: (i) includes earned income on derivatives and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of investments or that are used to replicate certain investments, but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, (ii) excludes post-tax adjusted earnings adjustments relating to insurance joint ventures accounted for under the equity method, (iii) excludes certain amounts related to contractholder-directed unit-linked investments, (iv) excludes certain amounts related to securitization entities that are VIEs consolidated under GAAP and (v) includes distributions of profits from certain other limited partnership interests that were previously accounted for under the cost method, but are now accounted for at estimated fair value, where the change in estimated fair value is recognized in net investment gains (losses) for GAAP; and•Other revenues is adjusted for settlements of foreign currency earnings hedges and excludes fees received in association with services provided under transition service agreements (“TSA fees”). The following additional adjustments are made to expenses, in the line items indicated, in calculating adjusted expenses:•Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends excludes: (i) changes in the policyholder dividend obligation related to net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), (ii) inflation-indexed benefit adjustments associated with contracts backed by inflation-indexed investments and amounts associated with periodic crediting rate adjustments based on the total return of a contractually referenced pool of assets and other pass through adjustments, (iii) benefits and hedging costs related to GMIBs (“GMIB costs”) and (iv) market value adjustments associated with surrenders or terminations of contracts (“Market value adjustments”);•Interest credited to policyholder account balances includes adjustments for earned income on derivatives and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of policyholder account balances but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and excludes amounts related to net investment income earned on contractholder-directed unit-linked investments;•Amortization of DAC and VOBA excludes amounts related to: (i) net investment gains (losses) and net derivative gains (losses), (ii) GMIB fees and GMIB costs and (iii) Market value adjustments;•Amortization of negative VOBA excludes amounts related to Market value adjustments;•Interest expense on debt excludes certain amounts related to securitization entities that are VIEs consolidated under GAAP; and•Other expenses excludes costs related to: (i) noncontrolling interests, (ii) implementation of new insurance regulatory requirements and (iii) acquisition, integration and other costs. Other expenses includes TSA fees. Adjusted earnings also excludes the recognition of certain contingent assets and liabilities that could not be recognized at acquisition or adjusted for during the measurement period under GAAP business combination accounting guidance. The tax impact of the adjustments mentioned above are calculated net of the U.S. or foreign statutory tax rate, which could differ from the Company’s effective tax rate. Additionally, the provision for income tax (expense) benefit also includes the impact related to the timing of certain tax credits, as well as certain tax reforms.180Table of ContentsAllocated equity:•Allocated equity is the portion of MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity that management allocates to each of its segments and sub-segments based on local capital requirements and economic capital. See “— Economic Capital.” Allocated equity excludes the impact of accumulated other comprehensive income other than foreign currency translation adjustments.The above measure represents a level of equity consistent with the view that, in the ordinary course of business, we do not plan to sell most investments for the sole purpose of realizing gains or losses. Also refer to the utilization of adjusted earnings and other financial measures based on adjusted earnings mentioned above. The following additional information is relevant to an understanding of our performance results:•The impact of changes in our foreign currency exchange rates is calculated using the average foreign currency exchange rates for the current period and is applied to each of the comparable periods (“Constant Currency Basis”).•We sometimes refer to sales activity for various products. These sales statistics do not correspond to revenues under GAAP, but are used as relevant measures of business activity. Further, sales statistics for our Latin America, Asia and EMEA segments are on a Constant Currency Basis.•Asymmetrical and non-economic accounting refers to: (i) the portion of net derivative gains (losses) on embedded derivatives attributable to the inclusion of our credit spreads in the liability valuations, (ii) hedging activity that generates net derivative gains (losses) and creates fluctuations in net income because hedge accounting cannot be achieved and the item being hedged does not a have an offsetting gain or loss recognized in earnings, (iii) inflation-indexed benefit adjustments associated with contracts backed by inflation-indexed investments and amounts associated with periodic crediting rate adjustments based on the total return of a contractually referenced pool of assets and other pass through adjustments, and (iv) impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the re-measurement of foreign denominated unhedged funding agreements and financing transactions to the U.S. dollar and the re-measurement of certain liabilities from non-functional currencies to functional currencies. We believe that excluding the impact of asymmetrical and non-economic accounting from total GAAP results enhances investor understanding of our performance by disclosing how these accounting practices affect reported GAAP results. •The Company uses a measure of free cash flow to facilitate an understanding of its ability to generate cash for reinvestment into its businesses or use in non-mandatory capital actions. The Company defines free cash flow as the sum of cash available at MetLife’s holding companies from dividends from operating subsidiaries, expenses and other net flows of the holding companies (including capital contributions to subsidiaries), and net contributions from debt to be at or below target leverage ratios. This measure of free cash flow is prior to capital actions, such as common stock dividends and repurchases, debt reduction and mergers and acquisitions. Free cash flow should not be viewed as a substitute for net cash provided by (used in) operating activities calculated in accordance with GAAP. The free cash flow ratio is typically expressed as a percentage of annual adjusted earnings available to common shareholders.Subsequent EventsSee Note 16 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.181Table of ContentsItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe regularly analyze our exposure to interest rate, equity market price and foreign currency exchange rate risks. As a result of that analysis, we have determined that the estimated fair values of certain assets and liabilities are materially exposed to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the equity markets. We have exposure to market risk through our insurance operations and investment activities. We use a variety of strategies to manage interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and equity market risk, including the use of derivatives. A description of our market risk exposures may be found under “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in Part II, Item 7A, of the 2017 Annual Report. 182Table of ContentsItem 4. Controls and ProceduresBased on the Company’s review, MetLife, Inc.’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and former CFO identified material weaknesses in the design and operation of its internal control over financial reporting. Management concluded that the Company has not maintained effective controls over (i) the administrative and accounting practices relating to certain RIS group annuity reserves and the timely communication and escalation of issues regarding those reserves throughout the Company, and (ii) the calculation of reserves relating to variable annuity guarantees issued by a former operating joint venture in Japan and reinsured by the Company and included within MetLife Holdings. Management identified errors in reserve balances in connection with these material weaknesses. For more information on these reserve adjustments, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2017 Annual Report.While the Company is making progress toward remediating these material weaknesses (as described below under “Remediation Status of Reported Material Weaknesses”), the Company had not completed its remediation as of September 30, 2018.Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresManagement, including the CEO and current CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2018. Solely because of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting reported in the 2017 Annual Report, MetLife Inc.’s CEO and current CFO concluded that, as of September 30, 2018, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.Remediation Status of Reported Material WeaknessesManagement continues to execute its plan to remediate the material weaknesses. As of September 30, 2018, management had performed the following activities:RIS Group Annuity Reserves:• The Company completed its examination and analysis of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the material weakness under the supervision of MetLife, Inc.’s Chief Risk Officer. The Company is addressing the examination findings through ongoing remediation. The Company continues to believe the remediation plan remains appropriate;•The Company continued its enhanced search practices to identify, contact, and act upon responses from “unresponsive and missing” plan annuitants; and •The Company enhanced the internal controls associated with the internal communication and escalation governance process it implemented for the 2017 Annual Report, as well as subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.MetLife Holdings Assumed Variable Annuity Guarantee Reserves: •The Company completed the examination and analysis of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the material weakness under the supervision of the Chief Auditor. The Company is addressing the examination findings through ongoing remediation. The Company continues to believe the remediation plan remains appropriate.The remediation steps outlined above will strengthen the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Management continues to test the ongoing operating effectiveness of all new and modified controls and will consider the material weaknesses remediated after the applicable controls operate effectively for a sufficient period. In addition, the Company continued to enhance the model risk management and data validation controls, policies and procedures. The Company will continue to evaluate, update and improve its internal control over financial reporting as management executes on its remediation plans.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere were no changes to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.183Table of ContentsPart II — Other InformationItem 1.
