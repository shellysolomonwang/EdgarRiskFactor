Item 1A.    Risk Factors       The following should be read in conjunction with and supplements and amends the factors that may affect the Company’s business or operations described under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, of the 2008 Annual Report, and the “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of the Company’s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2009.     Actions of the U.S. Government, Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Other Governmental and Regulatory Bodies for the Purpose of Stabilizing and Revitalizing the Financial Markets and Protecting Investors and Consumers May Not Achieve the Intended Effect or Could Adversely Affect MetLife’s Competitive Position     In response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions, on October 3, 2008, President Bush signed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (“EESA”) into law. Pursuant to EESA, the U.S. Treasury has the authority to, among other things, purchase up to $700 billion of mortgage-backed and other securities (including newly issued preferred shares and subordinated debt) from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing the financial markets. The Federal Government, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken or are considering taking other actions to address the financial crisis. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has been making funds available to commercial and financial companies under a number of programs, including the Commercial Paper Funding Facility The U.S. Treasury has established programs based in part on EESA and in part on the separate authority of the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC, to foster purchases from and by banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions of certain kinds of assets for which valuations have been low and markets weak.     There can be no assurance as to what impact such actions will have on the financial markets, whether on the level of volatility, the level of lending by financial institutions, the prices buyers are willing to pay for financial assets or otherwise. Continued low levels of credit availability and low prices for financial assets materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock. Furthermore, Congress has considered, and likely will continue to consider, legislative proposals that could    263    Table of Contents   impact the value of mortgage loans, such as legislation that would permit bankruptcy courts to reduce the principal balance of mortgage loans owed by bankrupt borrowers. If such legislation is enacted, it could cause loss of principal on certain of our nonagency prime residential mortgage backed security holdings and could cause a ratings downgrade in such holdings which, in turn, would cause an increase in unrealized losses on such securities. See “Risk Factors— We Are Exposed to Significant Financial and Capital Markets Risk Which May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations, Financial Condition and Liquidity, and Our Net Investment Income Can Vary from Period to Period” in the 2008 Annual Report. In addition, the Federal Government (including the FDIC) and private lenders have begun programs to reduce the monthly payment obligations of mortgagors and/or reduce the principal payable on residential mortgages. As a result, we may need to maintain or increase our engagement in similar activities in order to comply with program requirements and to remain competitive. The choices made by the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC in their distribution of amounts available under EESA and under the proposed new asset purchase programs could have the effect of supporting some aspects of the finance industry more than others. See “Risk Factors— Competitive Factors May Adversely Affect Our Market Share and Profitability” in the 2008 Annual Report. We cannot predict whether the $700 billion of funds made and to be made available pursuant to EESA will be enough to further stabilize and revive the financial markets or, if additional amounts are necessary, whether Congress will be willing to make the necessary appropriations, what the public’s sentiment would be towards any such appropriations, or what additional requirements or conditions might be imposed on the use of any such additional funds.     MetLife, Inc. and some or all of its affiliates may be eligible to sell assets under one or more of the programs established in whole or in part under EESA or under other programs made available by the Federal Government and its agencies, and some of their assets may be among those that are eligible for sale under the programs. MetLife, Inc. and some of its affiliates may also be eligible to invest in vehicles established to purchase troubled assets from other financial institutions under these programs, and to borrow funds under other programs to purchase specified types of asset-backed securities. Furthermore, as a bank holding company, MetLife, Inc. is formally eligible to participate in a capital infusion program established by the U.S. Treasury under EESA, pursuant to which the U.S. Treasury purchases preferred shares of banking institutions or their holding companies and acquires warrants for their common shares. Participation in one or more of various government programs would subject us to restrictions on the compensation that we can offer or pay to certain executive employees, including incentives or performance-based compensation. These restrictions could hinder or prevent us from attracting and retaining management and other employees with the talent and experience to manage and conduct our business effectively and deducting certain compensation paid to executive employees in excess of specified amounts. We may also be subject to requirements and restrictions on our business if we participate in other programs established in whole or in part under EESA. In April 2009, MetLife announced that it has elected not to participate in the Capital Purchase Program, a voluntary capital infusion program established by the U.S. Treasury under EESA. In May 2009, MetLife also announced that it had been informed by the Federal Reserve Board that it had completed the U.S. Treasury’s Supervisory Capital Assessment Program and that, based on the assessment’s economic scenarios and methodology, MetLife has adequate capital to sustain a further deterioration in the economy. Some of our competitors have received or have been selected to receive funding under the federal government’s capital infusion programs, which could adversely affect our competitive position.     As part of its efforts to stabilize and revitalize the financial system and the economy, the Obama Administration has also proposed making changes in capital and liquidity requirements for bank holding companies and banks. The Administration also proposes establishing special regulatory and insolvency regimes, including even higher capital and liquidity standards, for financial institutions that are deemed to be systemically significant. It has also proposed imposing new conditions on the writing and trading of certain standardized and non-standardized derivatives and has submitted a bill to Congress that would establish a new governmental agency that would supervise and regulate institutions that provide certain financial products and services to consumers. Although the consumer financial services to which this legislation would apply would exclude “the business of insurance” (other than mortgage insurance, title insurance and credit insurance), the creation of an additional supervisor with authority over MetLife, Inc. and its subsidiaries, the likelihood of additional regulations, and the other changes listed in this paragraph could require changes to MetLife’s operations. Whether such changes would affect our competitiveness in comparison to other institutions is uncertain, since it is possible that all of our competitors will be similarly affected. Competitive effects are possible, however, if MetLife,    264    Table of Contents   Inc. were determined to be systemically significant and is subject to higher capital and liquidity requirements as a result. It is unclear at present whether systemically significant institutions will be helped or hurt competitively if such additional requirements are imposed.     Proposals by the Administration, Congress and the SEC to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect investors by imposing a consistent “fiduciary” standard on both broker-dealers and investment advisers, and to more closely regulate compensation arrangements for sales of financial products, could, if enacted and implemented, have a material adverse effect on our ability to distribute our variable insurance products, as well as other securities products.     The Determination of the Amount of Allowances and Impairments Taken on Our Investments is Highly Subjective and Could Materially Impact Our Results of Operations or Financial Position     The determination of the amount of allowances and impairments varies by investment type and is based upon our periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class. Such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. Management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in allowances and impairments in operations as such evaluations are revised. There can be no assurance that our management has accurately assessed the level of impairments taken and allowances reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, additional impairments may need to be taken or allowances provided for in the future. Historical trends may not be indicative of future impairments or allowances.     For example, the cost of our fixed maturity and equity securities is adjusted for impairments in value deemed to be other-than-temporary that are charged to earnings and in the period in which the determination is made. The assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on management’s case-by-case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in estimated fair value. The review of our fixed maturity and equity securities for impairments includes an analysis of the total gross unrealized losses by three categories of securities: (i) securities where the estimated fair value has declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by less than 20%; (ii) securities where the estimated fair value has declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by 20% or more for less than six months; and (iii) securities where the estimated fair value has declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by 20% or more for six months or greater.     Additionally, our management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses their best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near-term recovery. Inherent in management’s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential. Considerations in the impairment evaluation process include, but are not limited to: (i) the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below cost or amortized cost; (ii) the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties; (iii) the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub-sector; (iv) the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations; (v) the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer, series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources; (vi) with respect to fixed maturity securities, whether we have the intent to sell or will more likely than not be required to sell a particular security before recovery of the decline in fair value below amortized cost, and with respect to equity securities, whether we have the ability and intent to hold a particular security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of its value to an amount at least equal to its cost or amortized cost; (vii) unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows on mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities; and (viii) other subjective factors, including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies.     Defaults, Downgrades or Other Events Impairing the Value of Our Fixed Maturity Securities Portfolio May Reduce Our Earnings     We are subject to the risk that the issuers, or guarantors, of fixed maturity securities we own may default on principal and interest payments they owe us. We are also subject to the risk that the underlying collateral within loan-backed securities, including mortgage-backed securities, may default on principal and interest payments causing an adverse change in cash flows paid to our investment. At December 31, 2008, the fixed maturity securities of $188.3 billion in our investment portfolio represented 58.4% of our total cash and invested assets. The occurrence    265    Table of Contents   of a major economic downturn (such as the current downturn in the economy), acts of corporate malfeasance, widening risk spreads, or other events that adversely affect the issuers, guarantors or underlying collateral of these securities could cause the value of our fixed maturity securities portfolio and our earnings to decline and the default rate of the fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio to increase. A ratings downgrade affecting issuers or guarantors of particular securities, or similar trends that could worsen the credit quality of issuers, such as the corporate issuers of securities in our investment portfolio, could also have a similar effect. With economic uncertainty, credit quality of issuers or guarantors could be adversely affected. Similarly, a ratings downgrade affecting a loan-backed security we hold could indicate the credit quality of that security has deteriorated. Any event reducing the value of these securities other than on a temporary basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Levels of write down or impairment are impacted by our assessment of intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell, fixed maturity securities and the intent and ability to hold equity securities which have declined in value until recovery. If we determine to reposition or realign portions of the portfolio so as not to hold certain equity securities, or intend to sell or determine that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell, certain fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position prior to recovery, then we will incur an other than temporary impairment charge in the period that the decision was made not to hold the equity security to recovery, or to sell, or the determination was made it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the fixed maturity security.     Our Insurance Businesses Are Heavily Regulated, and Changes in Regulation May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth     Our insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of insurance and other laws and regulations. See “Business — Regulation — Insurance Regulation” in the 2008 Annual Report. State insurance laws regulate most aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled and the states in which they are licensed. Our non-U.S. insurance operations are principally regulated by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled and operate.     State laws in the United States grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things:              •   licensing companies and agents to transact business;         •   calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements;         •   mandating certain insurance benefits;         •   regulating certain premium rates;         •   reviewing and approving policy forms;         •   regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements;         •   regulating advertising;         •   protecting privacy;         •   establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards;         •   fixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts;         •   approving changes in control of insurance companies;         •   restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates; and         •   regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments.       State insurance guaranty associations have the right to assess insurance companies doing business in their state for funds to help pay the obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. Because the    266    Table of Contents   amount and timing of an assessment is beyond our control, the liabilities that we have currently established for these potential liabilities may not be adequate. See “Business — Regulation — Insurance Regulation — Guaranty Associations and Similar Arrangements” in the 2008 Annual Report.     State insurance regulators and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the insurer and, thus, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.     The NAIC and several states’ legislatures have considered the need for regulations and/or laws to address agent or broker practices that have been the focus of investigations of broker compensation in the State of New York and in other jurisdictions. The NAIC adopted a Compensation Disclosure Amendment to its Producers Licensing Model Act which, if adopted by the states, would require disclosure by agents or brokers to customers that insurers will compensate such agents or brokers for the placement of insurance and documented acknowledgement of this arrangement in cases where the customer also compensates the agent or broker. Several states have enacted laws similar to the NAIC amendment. We cannot predict how many states may promulgate the NAIC amendment or alternative regulations or the extent to which these regulations may have a material adverse impact on our business.     Currently, the U.S. federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance. However, federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies. These areas include financial services regulation, securities regulation, pension regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation. In addition, various forms of direct federal regulation of insurance have been proposed, including proposals for the establishment of an optional federal charter for insurance companies and creation of an Office of National Insurance, expansion of the Federal Reserve Board’s authority to regulate financial holding companies and bank holding companies, and establishment of the Federal Reserve Board as a systemic risk regulator that would no longer be required to defer to functional regulators. In view of recent events involving certain financial institutions and the financial markets, it is possible that the U.S. federal government will heighten its oversight of insurers and/or insurance holding companies such as us, including possibly through a federal system of insurance regulation, new powers for the regulation of systemic risk to the financial system and the regulation and resolution of systemically significant financial companies (which could vary from the resolution regimes currently applicable to some subsidiaries of such companies), federal consumer protection respecting certain financial services and products and/or that the oversight responsibilities and mandates of existing or newly created regulatory bodies could change. We cannot predict whether these or other proposals will be adopted, or what impact, if any, such proposals or, if enacted, such laws, could have on our business, financial condition or results of operations or on our dealings with other financial institutions.     Our international operations are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they operate, which in many ways is similar to that of the state regulation outlined above. Many of our customers and independent sales intermediaries also operate in regulated environments. Changes in the regulations that affect their operations also may affect our business relationships with them and their ability to purchase or distribute our products. Accordingly, these changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See “Risk Factors — Our International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks that Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our Profitability” in the 2008 Annual Report.     Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance and other expenses of doing business, thus having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.     From time to time, regulators raise issues during examinations or audits of MetLife, Inc.’s subsidiaries that could, if determined adversely, have a material impact on us. We cannot predict whether or when regulatory actions may be taken that could adversely affect our operations. In addition, the interpretations of regulations by regulators may change and statutes may be enacted with retroactive impact, particularly in areas such as accounting or statutory reserve requirements.     We are also subject to other regulations, including banking regulations, and may in the future become subject to additional regulations. See “Business — Regulation” in the 2008 Annual Report.    267    Table of Contents   Changes in Tax Laws, Tax Regulations, or Interpretations of Such Laws or Regulations Could Increase Our Corporate Taxes; Changes in Tax Laws Could Make Some of Our Products Less Attractive to Consumers     Changes in tax laws, Treasury and other regulations promulgated thereunder, or interpretations of such laws or regulations could increase our corporate taxes. The Obama Administration has proposed corporate tax changes. Changes in corporate tax rates could affect the value of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Furthermore, the value of deferred tax assets could be impacted by future earnings levels.     Changes in tax laws could make some of our products less attractive to consumers. A shift away from life insurance and annuity contracts and other tax-deferred products would reduce our income from sales of these products, as well as the assets upon which we earn investment income. The Obama Administration has proposed certain changes to individual income tax rates and rules applicable to certain policies.     We cannot predict whether any tax legislation impacting corporate taxes or insurance products will be enacted, what the specific terms of any such legislation will be or whether, if at all, any legislation would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
