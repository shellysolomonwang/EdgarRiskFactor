Item 1A.  Risk Factors   The following, together with the information under “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of MetLife, Inc.’s Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2012 and June 30, 2012, which is incorporated herein by reference, should be read in conjunction with, and supplements and amends, the factors that may affect the Company’s business or operations described under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, of the 2011 Annual Report.  Our Insurance, Brokerage and Banking Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth  Insurance Regulation — U.S. Our insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of insurance and other laws and regulations. See “Business — U.S. Regulation — Insurance Regulation” included in the 2011 Annual Report and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations – Industry Trends – Regulatory Developments.” State insurance laws regulate most aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance regulators of the states in which they are domiciled and the states in which they are licensed.  State laws in the U.S. grant insurance regulatory and other state authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things:        •    licensing companies and agents to transact business;        •    calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements;        •    mandating certain insurance benefits;        •    regulating certain premium rates;        •    reviewing and approving policy forms;        •    regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements, and identifying and paying to the states benefits and other property that is not claimed by the owners;        •    regulating advertising;        •    protecting privacy;        •    establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards;        •    fixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts;        •    approving changes in control of insurance companies;        •    restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates; and        •    regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments.    237    Table of Contents State insurance guaranty associations have the right to assess insurance companies doing business in their state for funds to help pay the obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. Because the amount and timing of an assessment is beyond our control, the liabilities that we have currently established for these potential liabilities may not be adequate. See “Business — U.S. Regulation — Insurance Regulation — Guaranty Associations and Similar Arrangements” included in the 2011 Annual Report.  State insurance regulators and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, that are made for the benefit of the consumer sometimes lead to additional expense for the insurer and, thus, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In July 2012, our New York domestic insurers received, as part of an industry-wide inquiry, a request from the New York Department of Financial Services (the “Department of Financial Services”) to provide information regarding their use of affiliated captive reinsurers or off-shore entities to reinsure insurance risks. We responded to this request. The NAIC is also studying the use of captive reinsurers. Like many life insurance companies, we utilize captive reinsurers in order to comply with certain reserve requirements related to universal life and term life insurance policies. We also use captives to aggregate variable annuity risk under a single legal entity which allows us to consolidate hedging and other risk management programs. As a result, reserves and capital for this business get transferred to the captives, subject to appropriate collateral. The financing arrangements with the captive reinsurers support non-economic reserves, representing reserves required by regulation but above our estimate of needed economic reserves. If the Department of Financial Services or other state insurance regulators determine to restrict the use of such captive reinsurers for purposes of funding reserve requirements related to universal life and term life insurance policies, it could impair our ability to write such products or require us to increase prices on such products unless alternate reserve funding solutions are found.  U.S. Federal Regulation Affecting Insurance. Currently, the U.S. federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance. However, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”) allows federal regulators to compel state insurance regulators to liquidate an insolvent insurer under some circumstances if the state regulators have not acted within a specific period. The Federal Reserve Board has also proposed that it be given authority to compel insurance companies to take prompt corrective action in certain circumstances if they are part of a large bank holding company or of a company that has been designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) as a non-bank SIFI. Dodd-Frank also establishes the Federal Insurance Office within the Department of the Treasury, which has the authority to participate in the negotiations of international insurance agreements with foreign regulators for the U.S., as well as to collect information about the insurance industry and recommend prudential standards. While not having a general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, the director of this office will perform various functions with respect to insurance, including serving as a non-voting member of the FSOC and making recommendations to the FSOC regarding insurers to be designated for more stringent regulation. The director is also required to submit a report to Congress regarding how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the United States, including by increasing national uniformity through either a federal charter or effective action by the states.  Federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies. These areas include financial services regulation, securities regulation, derivatives regulation, mortgage regulation, pension regulation, health care regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation. In addition, various forms of direct and indirect federal regulation of insurance have been proposed from time to time, including proposals for the establishment of an optional federal charter for insurance companies. Other aspects of our insurance operations could also be affected by Dodd-Frank. For example, effective July 21, 2012, Dodd-Frank imposes prohibitions on Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”)-insured depository institutions (such as MetLife Bank) and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading or sponsoring or investing in hedge funds or private equity funds (commonly known as the Volcker Rule). If and when MetLife Bank’s FDIC insurance is terminated, MetLife, Inc. and its affiliates will not be subject to the bans on proprietary trading and fund activities under the Volcker Rule. However, because the Volcker Rule nevertheless imposes additional capital requirements and quantitative limits on such trading and activities by a non-bank SIFI, MetLife, Inc. and its affiliates could be subject to such requirements and limits were they to be designated    238    Table of Contents  non-bank SIFIs. Regulations defining and governing such requirements and limits on non-bank SIFIs have not been proposed. Commencing from the date of designation, a non-bank SIFI will have a two-year period, subject to further extension by the Federal Reserve Board, to conform to any such requirements and limits. Subject to safety and soundness determinations as part of rulemaking that could require additional capital requirements and quantitative limits, Dodd-Frank provides that the exemptions under the Volcker Rule also are available to exempt any additional capital requirements and quantitative limits on non-bank SIFIs. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends — Regulatory Developments — Regulatory Developments Affecting Investment Activities and Derivatives, including the Volcker Rule,” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends — Regulatory Developments — Regulatory Developments Relating to Non-Bank SIFIs and G-SIIs,” as well as “Business — U.S. Regulation — Dodd-Frank and Other Legislative and Regulatory Developments — Volcker Rule” included in the 2011 Annual Report.  Banking and Bank Holding Company Regulation. As a federally chartered national banking association, MetLife Bank is subject to a wide variety of banking laws, regulations and guidelines. Federal banking and consumer financial protection laws regulate most aspects of the business of MetLife Bank, but certain state laws may apply as well. MetLife Bank is principally regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), and secondarily by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC.  Federal banking laws and regulations address various aspects of MetLife Bank’s business and operations with respect to, among other things:        •    chartering to carry on business as a bank;        •    the permissibility of certain activities;        •    maintaining minimum capital ratios;        •    capital management in relation to the bank’s assets;        •    dividend payments and repurchases of securities, including common stock;        •    safety and soundness standards;        •    loan loss and other related liabilities;        •    liquidity;        •    financial reporting and disclosure standards;        •    counterparty credit concentration;        •    restrictions on related party and affiliate transactions;        •    lending limits (and, in addition, Dodd-Frank includes the credit exposures arising from securities lending by MetLife Bank within lending limits otherwise applicable to loans);        •    payment of interest;        •    unfair or deceptive acts or practices;        •    mortgage servicing practices;        •    privacy; and        •    relationships with MetLife, Inc. in its capacity as a bank holding company and potentially with other investors in connection with a change in control of MetLife Bank.    239    Table of Contents Federal banking regulators regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to banks and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the bank and, thus, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of MetLife Bank.  Since 2008, MetLife, through its affiliate, MetLife Bank, has been engaged in the forward and reverse residential mortgage origination and servicing business. In January 2012, MetLife, Inc. announced it was exiting the business of originating forward residential mortgage loans and, in April 2012, announced that it was exiting the businesses of originating and servicing reverse residential mortgage loans and that it and MetLife Bank entered into a definitive agreement to sell MetLife Bank’s reverse mortgage servicing portfolio. In June 2012, the Company sold the majority of MetLife Bank’s reverse mortgage servicing rights and related assets and liabilities, with the remainder sold in September 2012 pursuant to the same sales agreement. Also, in the third quarter of 2012, we began exploring the sale of MetLife Bank’s forward mortgage servicing assets and operations and, therefore, began reporting this business as divested. On November 2, 2012, MetLife, Inc. and MetLife Bank entered into a definitive agreement to sell MetLife Bank’s forward mortgage servicing portfolio to JPMorganChase Bank, N.A. The transaction is subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Upon entering into this agreement, MetLife Bank has committed to sell or has otherwise exited most of its operations. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our progress toward deregistering as a bank holding company.  State and federal regulatory and law enforcement authorities have initiated various inquiries, investigations or examinations of alleged irregularities in the foreclosure practices of the residential mortgage servicing industry. Mortgage servicing practices have also been the subject of Congressional attention. Authorities have publicly stated that the scope of the investigations extends beyond foreclosure documentation practices to include mortgage loan origination, modification and loss mitigation practices. See “Risk Factors — The Resolution of Several Issues Affecting the Financial Services Industry Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Reported Results or on Our Relations with Current and Potential Customers” included in MetLife, Inc.’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2012 (the “June 30, 2012 Form 10-Q”) and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Industry Trends – Mortgage and Foreclosure-Related Exposures.”  In addition, Dodd-Frank established the CFPB, which supervises and regulates institutions providing certain financial products and services to consumers. Although the consumer financial services to which this legislation applies exclude insurance business of the kind in which we engage, the CFPB has authority to regulate consumer services provided by MetLife Bank and non-insurance consumer services provided elsewhere throughout MetLife. See “Business — U.S. Regulation — Dodd-Frank and Other Legislative and Regulatory Developments — Consumer Protection Laws” included in the 2011 Annual Report. We cannot predict how regulation by the CFPB might affect our business.  In June 2012, the OCC, Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC published three notices of proposed rulemaking (the “Bank Capital NPRs”) that would revise and replace the agencies’ current capital rules with rules consistent with (i) the final rules for increased capital and liquidity requirements for bank holding companies, such as MetLife, Inc., published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”) in December 2010 (“Basel III”), as well as the applicable sections of Dodd-Frank, (ii) a series of revisions adopted by the Basel Committee to the market risk capital requirements for exposures in a banking organization’s trading book in 2005, 2009 and 2010 (collectively, “Basel II.5”), and (iii) the market risk capital requirements as initially published by the Basel Committee in June 2004 (“Basel II”). See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Industry Trends – Regulatory Developments.” It is possible that even more stringent capital and liquidity requirements could be imposed on us if, in the future, MetLife, Inc. is designated by the FSOC as a non-bank SIFI.  In December 2011, the Federal Reserve Board issued a notice of proposed rulemaking related to enhanced prudential standards required by Dodd-Frank (“Regulation YY”). Regulation YY would apply to bank holding companies with assets of $50 billion or more and non-bank SIFIs. Regulation YY would impose (i) enhanced risk-based capital requirements, (ii) leverage limits, (iii) liquidity requirements, (iv) single counterparty exposure limits, (v) governance requirements for risk management, (vi) stress test requirements, and (vii) special    240    Table of Contents  debt-to-equity limits for certain companies, and would establish a procedure for early remediation based on the failure to comply with these requirements. In October 2012, the Federal Reserve Board issued a final rule implementing the stress testing requirements that it had earlier proposed as part of Regulation YY. The rule will require bank holding companies with $50 billion or more of assets and non-bank SIFIs to undergo three stress tests each year: an annual supervisory stress test conducted by the Federal Reserve Board and two company-run stress tests (an annual test which coincides with the timing of the supervisory stress test, and a mid-cycle test). Companies will be required to take the results of the stress tests into consideration in their annual capital planning and resolution and recovery planning. The ability of MetLife Bank and MetLife, Inc., as a bank holding company, to pay dividends, repurchase common stock or other securities or engage in other transactions that could affect its capital or need for capital could be reduced by any additional capital requirements that might be imposed as a result of the enactment of Dodd-Frank, Regulation YY and/or the adoption of the Bank Capital NPRs, stress testing and other regulatory initiatives if MetLife, Inc. is unable to deregister as a bank holding company before the requirements become effective or if MetLife, Inc. is designated a non-bank SIFI in the future. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends,” as well as “Business — U.S. Regulation” and “Business — International Regulation” included in the 2011 Annual Report. The Basel Committee has also published rules requiring a capital surcharge for globally systemically important banks. If they are endorsed and adopted by the U.S. banking regulators, these rules will be phased in for U.S. banks beginning in 2016 and will become fully effective in 2019. These rules were not included in the Bank Capital NPRs.  The Federal Reserve’s capital plans rule requires all bank holding companies with assets of more than $50 billion, including MetLife, Inc., to submit annual capital plans which include proposed capital actions and projections of the company’s capital levels under baseline and stress scenarios over a nine-quarter period. The Federal Reserve will approve or object to a company’s proposed capital distributions, such as dividends and stock repurchases, based on the results of those capital plans and the Federal Reserve’s assessment of the robustness of the company’s capital planning processes. In addition, in recent years, the Federal Reserve has conducted the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”), an assessment of the internal capital planning processes, capital adequacy and proposed capital distributions of large bank holding companies, including MetLife, Inc. Capital planning requirements could have the effect, in practice, of increasing the amounts of capital held by companies subject to the requirements, including MetLife, which could affect their competitive position. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends — Regulatory Developments — Regulatory Developments Applicable to Bank Holding Companies” and Note 14 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the capital plan we submitted to the Federal Reserve and “— Our Ability to Pay Dividends and Repurchase Common Stock is Subject to Regulatory Restrictions and to Restrictions Under the Terms of Certain of Our Securities” for additional information on dividend restrictions.  Under Dodd-Frank, all bank holding companies that have elected to be treated as financial holding companies, such as MetLife, Inc., are required to be “well capitalized” and “well managed” as defined by the Federal Reserve, on a consolidated basis, and not just at their depository institution(s), a higher standard than was applicable to financial holding companies before Dodd-Frank. If MetLife, Inc. or MetLife Bank is unable to meet these standards, we could be subject to activity restrictions, including restrictions on mergers and acquisitions, ultimately be required to divest certain operations and be restricted in our ability to pay dividends, repurchase common stock or other securities, or engage in transactions that could affect our capital or need for capital. See “Business — U.S. Regulation — Dodd-Frank and Other Legislative and Regulatory Developments” included in the 2011 Annual Report and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends — Regulatory Developments — Regulatory Developments Applicable to Bank Holding Companies.”  In December 2011, MetLife Bank and MetLife, Inc. entered into a definitive agreement to sell most of the depository business of MetLife Bank to GE Capital Bank (formerly known as GE Capital Financial Inc.). In September 2012, this agreement was amended. Under the new structure, MetLife Bank’s depository business would be assumed by GE Capital Retail Bank, rather than by GE Capital Bank. The key terms of the agreement,    241    Table of Contents  whereby a GE Capital affiliate will acquire approximately $7 billion in MetLife Bank deposits, including certificates of deposit and money market accounts, remain unchanged. The transaction, as amended, will now be subject to approval by the OCC, the primary regulator of GE Capital Bank, and other customary closing conditions. The approval of the FDIC will no longer be required for the transaction. Upon completion of the sale, MetLife Bank would take the remaining administrative steps with the FDIC to terminate its deposit insurance and MetLife, Inc. would deregister as a bank holding company. Upon completion of the foregoing, MetLife, Inc. will no longer be regulated as a bank holding company or subject to enhanced supervision and prudential standards as a bank holding company with assets of $50 billion or more. However, if, in the future, the FSOC designates MetLife, Inc. as a non-bank SIFI, we would once again be subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve and enhanced supervision and prudential standards, such as those in the Federal Reserve’s proposed Regulation YY.  In April 2012, the FSOC adopted final rules setting forth the process it will follow and the criteria it will use to assess whether a non-bank financial company should be subject to enhanced supervision by the Federal Reserve as a non-bank SIFI. The FSOC will follow a three-stage process. In Stage 1, a set of uniform quantitative metrics will be applied to a broad group of non-bank financial companies in order to identify non-bank financial companies for further evaluation. If a non-bank financial company meets the total consolidated assets threshold and at least one of the other five quantitative thresholds used in the first stage, the FSOC will continue with two stages of further analysis using additional sources of data and qualitative and quantitative factors. MetLife, Inc. is currently a bank holding company and, as a result, it is not subject to designation as a non-bank SIFI. However, if MetLife, Inc. succeeds in deregistering as a bank holding company, it could be considered for designation as a non-bank SIFI. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends — Regulatory Developments — Regulatory Developments Relating to Non-Bank SIFIs and G-SIIs,” as well as “Business — U.S. Regulation — Financial Holding Company Regulation” included in the 2011 Annual Report.  The FDIC has the right to assess FDIC-insured banks for funds to help pay the obligations of insolvent banks to depositors. Because the amount and timing of an assessment is beyond our control, the liabilities that we have currently established for these potential liabilities may not be adequate. In addition, Dodd-Frank will result in increased assessments for banks with assets of $10 billion or more, which includes MetLife Bank. In addition, large bank holding companies and non-bank SIFIs can be assessed under Dodd-Frank for any uncovered costs arising in connection with the resolution of a systemically important financial company and, in July 2012, assessments to cover the expenses of the Office of Financial Research, an agency established by Dodd-Frank to improve the quality of financial data available to policymakers and facilitate more robust and sophisticated analysis of the financial system, were implemented. See “Risk Factors — Dodd-Frank Provides for the Resolution or Liquidation of Certain Types of Financial Institutions, Including Bank Holding Companies Like MetLife, Inc” included in the June 30, 2012 Form 10-Q.  Regulation of Brokers and Dealers. Dodd-Frank also authorizes the SEC to establish a standard of conduct applicable to brokers and dealers when providing personalized investment advice to retail and other customers. This standard of conduct would be to act in the best interest of the customer without regard to the financial or other interest of the broker or dealer providing the advice. See “Business — U.S. Regulation — Securities, Broker-Dealer and Investment Adviser Regulation” and “Risk Factors — Changes in U.S. Federal and State Securities Laws and Regulations, and State Insurance Regulations Regarding Suitability of Annuity Product Sales, May Affect Our Operations and Our Profitability” included in the 2011 Annual Report.  International Regulation. Our international insurance operations are principally regulated by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are located or operate. See “Business — International Regulation” included in the 2011 Annual Report, and “Risk Factors — Our International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks, Including Exposure to Local and Regional Economic Conditions, That Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our Profitability” included in the June 30, 2012 Form 10-Q. A significant portion of our revenues is generated through operations in foreign jurisdictions, including many countries in early stages of economic and political development. Our international operations may be materially adversely affected by the actions and decisions of foreign authorities and regulators, such as through nationalization or expropriation of assets, the imposition of limits on foreign ownership of local companies,    242    Table of Contents  changes in laws (including tax laws and regulations), their application or interpretation, political instability, dividend limitations, price controls, changes in applicable currency, currency exchange controls or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which they operate or converting local currencies we hold to U.S. dollars or other currencies. This may also impact many of our customers and independent sales intermediaries. Changes in the regulations that affect their operations also may affect our business relationships with them and their ability to purchase or distribute our products. Accordingly, these changes and actions may negatively affect our business in these jurisdictions.  We are also subject to the evolving Solvency II insurance regulatory directive for our insurance business throughout the European Economic Area. As requirements are finalized by the regulators, capital requirements might be impacted in a number of jurisdictions. In addition, our legal entity structure throughout Europe may impact our capital requirements, risk management infrastructure and reporting by country.  As part of the global initiative to identify global systemically important financial institutions, in May 2012, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”) published a proposed assessment methodology for designating G-SIIs. The proposed methodology is intended to identify those insurers whose distress or disorderly failure, because of their size, complexity and interconnectedness, would cause significant disruption to the global financial system and economic activity. The proposed methodology has three steps: (i) data collection; (ii) assessment using a quantitative indicator-based assessment (addressing five categories: size, extent of global activity, degree of interconnectedness within the financial system, amount of non-traditional and non-insurance activities and substitutability) and a more qualitative business segment assessment; and (iii) supervisory judgment and validation process, including quantitative and qualitative assessments. Based on information obtained from the IAIS, the Financial Stability Board, an international entity established to coordinate, develop and promote effective regulatory, supervisory and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability, will make final recommendations in consultation with national supervisory authorities. Comments on the proposal were submitted July 1, 2012 and, on September 21, 2012, the IAIS published a report proposing the resolution of issues raised during the comment period. The IAIS expects to publish the first list of G-SIIs in the first half of 2013, with annual updates thereafter, enabling insurers to move on and off the list, in order to incentivize insurers to reduce their systemic importance. Any insurers identified as G-SIIs would be subject to additional policy measures. These policy measures were outlined in an October 2012 IAIS consultation paper (with comments due in December 2012) and the IAIS has stated that it intends to finalize them at the same time as the first group of G-SIIs is identified. The proposed policy measures, which would need to be implemented by legislation or regulation in relevant jurisdictions, include higher capital requirements (both for non-traditional and non-insurance activities and for G-SIIs overall), enhanced supervision (including more detailed and frequent reporting, removal of barriers to orderly resolution of the G-SII and reduction of the G-SII’s systemic risk over time), as well as additional measures to improve the degree of self-sufficiency of a G-SII’s different business segments (including separate legal structures for traditional insurance and non-traditional or non-insurance activities, and restrictions on intercompany subsidies). If MetLife, Inc. were identified as a G-SII, its competitive position relative to other life insurers that were not so designated could be adversely affected. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Industry Trends – Regulatory Developments – Regulatory Developments Relating to Non-Bank SIFIs and G-SIIs.”  We expect the scope and extent of regulation outside of the U.S., as well as regulatory oversight, generally to continue to increase. The authority of our international operations to conduct business is subject to licensing requirements, permits and approvals, and these authorizations are subject to modification and revocation. The regulatory environment in the countries in which we operate and changes in laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See “Risk Factors — Our International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks, Including Exposure to Local and Regional Economic Conditions, That Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our Profitability” included in the June 30, 2012 Form 10-Q, as well as “Business — International Regulation” included in the 2011 Annual Report.  Summary. From time to time, regulators raise issues during examinations or audits of MetLife, Inc.’s regulated subsidiaries that could, if determined adversely, have a material impact on us. We cannot predict whether or    243    Table of Contents  when regulatory actions may be taken that could adversely affect our operations. In addition, the interpretations of regulations by regulators may change and statutes may be enacted with retroactive impact, particularly in areas such as accounting or statutory reserve requirements. We are also subject to other regulations and may in the future become subject to additional regulations. See “Business — U.S. Regulation” and “Business — International Regulation” included in the 2011 Annual Report.  Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance and other expenses of doing business, thus having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  Changes in Market Interest Rates May Significantly Affect Our Profitability  Some of our products, principally traditional whole life insurance, fixed annuities and guaranteed interest contracts, expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce our investment margin or “spread,” or the difference between the amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts in our general account and the rate of return we are able to earn on general account investments intended to support obligations under the contracts. Our spread is a key component of our net income.  As interest rates decrease or remain at low levels, we may be forced to reinvest proceeds from investments that have matured or have been prepaid or sold at lower yields, reducing our investment margin. Moreover, borrowers may prepay or redeem the fixed income securities, commercial or agricultural mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities in our investment portfolio with greater frequency in order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbates this risk. Lowering interest crediting rates can help offset decreases in investment margins on some products. However, our ability to lower these rates could be limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. As a result, our spread could decrease or potentially become negative. Our expectation for future spreads is an important component in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (“DAC”) and value of business acquired (“VOBA”), and significantly lower spreads may cause us to accelerate amortization, thereby reducing net income in the affected reporting period. In addition, during periods of declining interest rates, life insurance and annuity products may be relatively more attractive investments to consumers, resulting in increased premium payments on products with flexible premium features, repayment of policy loans and increased persistency, or a higher percentage of insurance policies remaining in force from year to year, during a period when our new investments carry lower returns. A decline in market interest rates could also reduce our return on investments that do not support particular policy obligations. During periods of sustained lower interest rates, policy liabilities may not be sufficient to meet future policy obligations and may need to be strengthened. Accordingly, declining and sustained lower interest rates may materially affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows and significantly reduce our profitability.  In September 2012, the Federal Reserve Board announced that it anticipates that low interest rates are likely to be warranted at least through mid 2015, in order to improve the pace of recovery from stressed economic conditions. It also announced that it will expand its holdings of longer-term securities with open-ended purchases of $40 billion each month of agency mortgage-backed securities. Finally, it reiterated its plan to continue “Operation Twist” through the end of 2012. This program, announced in September 2011 by the Federal Open Market Committee, involves the purchase of U.S. Treasury securities with remaining maturities of six to 30 years and the sale of, over the same period, an equal par value of U.S. Treasury securities with remaining maturities of approximately three years or less. By reducing the supply of longer-term securities in the market, both of these programs are intended to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates relative to levels that would otherwise prevail. The reduction in longer-term interest rates, in turn, is intended to contribute to a broad easing of financial market conditions that could provide additional stimulus to support the economic recovery.  As a global insurance company, we are also affected by the monetary policy of central banks around the world. While the major central banks are not lowering interest rates at the same pace as in prior quarters, the    244    Table of Contents  Federal Reserve Board, European Central Bank, Bank of England and Bank of Japan have all increased their use of “non-traditional” means of monetary policy via their asset purchase programs. We cannot predict with certainty the effect of these asset purchase programs on interest rates or the impact on the pricing levels of risk-bearing investments at this time. See “Risk Factors — Governmental and Regulatory Actions for the Purpose of Stabilizing and Revitalizing the Financial Markets and Protecting Investors and Consumers May Not Achieve the Intended Effect or Could Adversely Affect Our Competitive Position” included in the 2011 Annual Report and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Investments — Current Environment.” For a discussion of the impact of the low interest environment on us, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends — Financial and Economic Environment — Impact of a Sustained Low Interest Rate Environment” and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends — Financial and Economic Environment — Mitigating Actions.”  Increases in market interest rates could also negatively affect our profitability. In periods of rapidly increasing interest rates, we may not be able to replace, in a timely manner, the investments in our general account with higher yielding investments needed to fund the higher crediting rates necessary to keep interest sensitive products competitive. We, therefore, may have to accept a lower spread and, thus, lower profitability or face a decline in sales and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. In addition, policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals may tend to increase as policyholders seek investments with higher perceived returns as interest rates rise. This process may result in cash outflows requiring that we sell investments at a time when the prices of those investments are adversely affected by the increase in market interest rates, which may result in realized investment losses. Unanticipated withdrawals and terminations may cause us to accelerate the amortization of DAC and VOBA, which reduces net income and may also cause us to accelerate negative VOBA, which increases net income. An increase in market interest rates could also have a material adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio, for example, by decreasing the estimated fair values of the fixed income securities that comprise a substantial portion of our investment portfolio. Finally, an increase in interest rates could result in decreased fee income associated with a decline in the value of variable annuity account balances invested in fixed income funds.  Our Ability to Pay Dividends and Repurchase Common Stock is Subject to Regulatory Restrictions and to Restrictions Under the Terms of Certain of Our Securities  The declaration and payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board of directors, and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements, future prospects, regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends and our other insurance subsidiaries and other factors deemed relevant by the board. There is no requirement or assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends. In addition, the payment of dividends on our common stock, and our ability to repurchase our common stock, are subject to restrictions arising out of our regulation by the Federal Reserve. They are also subject to restrictions under the terms of our preferred stock and junior subordinated debentures in situations where we may be experiencing financial stress, as described below. For purposes of this discussion, “junior subordinated debentures” are deemed to include MetLife, Inc.’s Fixed-to-Floating Rate Exchangeable Surplus Trust Securities, which are exchangeable at the option of MetLife, Inc., or in the future upon the occurrence of certain events, for junior subordinated debentures, and which contain terms with the same substantive effects described in this discussion as the terms in MetLife’s junior subordinated debentures.  Regulatory Restrictions. We are subject to the Federal Reserve’s capital plans rule, which requires all bank holding companies with assets of more than $50 billion, including MetLife, Inc., to submit annual capital plans which include proposed capital actions and projections of the company’s capital levels under baseline and stress scenarios over a nine-quarter period. The Federal Reserve will approve or object to a company’s proposed capital distributions, such as dividends and stock repurchases, based on the results of those capital plans and the Federal Reserve’s assessment of the robustness of the company’s capital planning processes. In addition, in recent years, the Federal Reserve has conducted the CCAR, an assessment of the internal capital planning processes, capital adequacy and proposed capital distributions of large bank holding companies, including MetLife, Inc. The capital    245    Table of Contents  plan we submitted to the Federal Reserve in January 2012 included an anticipated repurchase of common stock and an anticipated increase to MetLife, Inc.’s annual dividend to its stockholders. The Federal Reserve objected to the capital plan in March of 2012; therefore, MetLife, Inc. is unable to repurchase its common stock or increase its aggregate annual dividend amount above $0.74 per share, or $0.8 billion based on the outstanding shares at September 30, 2012, until such time as we are no longer subject to the capital plans rule and supervision by the Federal Reserve, or we submit a capital plan that is approved by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve, pursuant to MetLife’s request, has extended the time for MetLife to resubmit its capital plan until January 5, 2013. Unless we receive an extension, we may also need to submit a capital plan for 2013 if MetLife, Inc. is still a bank holding company on January 5, 2013. If MetLife, Inc. remains a bank holding company, or if it is designated a non-bank systemically important financial institution and is required to submit capital plans to the Federal Reserve in the future, there can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve will approve its future capital plans. In addition, Federal Reserve Board policy provides that a bank holding company should pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. If it remains a bank holding company, MetLife, Inc. may not be able to pay dividends if it does not earn sufficient operating income.  “Dividend Stopper” Provisions in Our Preferred Stock and Junior Subordinated Debentures. Certain terms of our preferred stock and our junior subordinated debentures (sometimes referred to as “dividend stoppers”) may prevent us from purchasing our common stock or paying dividends on our common stock in certain circumstances. Moreover, MetLife, Inc. is a party to certain replacement capital covenants which limit its ability to eliminate these restrictions through the repayment, redemption or purchase or preferred stock or junior subordinated debentures by requiring MetLife, subject to certain limitations, to receive cash proceeds during a specified period from the sale of specified replacement securities prior to any such repayment, redemption or purchase. See Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2011 Annual Report for a description of such covenants in effect with respect to junior subordinated debentures. Under our preferred stock and junior subordinated debentures, if we have not paid the full dividends on our preferred stock for a dividend period (i.e., the period from and including a preferred stock dividend payment date to but excluding the next preferred stock dividend payment date), we may not repurchase or pay dividends on our common stock for that period. If we have not paid in full the accrued interest through the most recent interest payment date on our junior subordinated debentures, we may not repurchase or pay dividends on our common stock or other capital stock (including the preferred stock), subject to certain exceptions.  Trigger Events for the Restrictions on the Payment of Dividends on Our Preferred Stock and Restrictions on the Payment of Interest on Our Junior Subordinated Debentures. If a Trigger Event (as defined below) applies on the declaration date of a preferred stock dividend, then we may not declare dividends on the preferred stock, together with aggregate dividends declared during the related dividend period on any other stock that ranks on a parity with the preferred stock, in an amount that exceeds the net proceeds MetLife, Inc. has received from issuances of common stock during the 90 days preceding the related dividend declaration date. If a Trigger Event applies on the day that is 30 days before an interest payment date on our junior subordinated debentures, we may not pay interest on the junior subordinated debentures except to the extent of the amount of net proceeds that MetLife, Inc. has received from the sale of shares of common stock and certain kinds of warrants to purchase common stock during the 180 days prior to the interest payment date and that MetLife, Inc. designated at or before the time of such sale as available to pay interest on the junior subordinated debentures, and we would have to make commercially reasonable efforts to sell shares of common stock to provide sufficient proceeds to enable us to pay all accrued and unpaid interest on the junior subordinated debentures. A “Trigger Event” would occur if:        (i)  our Covered Insurance Subsidiaries’ (as defined below) risk-based capital ratio (calculated under the methodology prescribed by state insurance regulators) was less than 175% of the company action level for such subsidiaries, in the case of each Covered Insurance Subsidiary based on the most recent annual financial statements for the year ended prior to such dividend payment date or interest payment date for which such subsidiary has filed its annual statement with the applicable state insurance commissioners (annual statements for a year are generally required to be filed on or before March 1 of the following year);    246    Table of Contents OR        (ii)  (x) the Trailing Four Quarters Consolidated Net Income Amount (as defined below) for the period ending on the last day of the quarter that is two quarters prior to the most recently completed quarter is zero or a negative amount and (y) the Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity Amount (as defined below) as of the last day of the most recently completed quarter and as of the end of the quarter that is two quarters before the most recently completed quarter has declined by 10% or more as compared to the Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity Amount at the end of the benchmark quarter (the date that is ten quarters prior to the most recently completed quarter).  The restrictions will continue until MetLife, Inc. satisfies the two tests in clauses (i) and (ii) above for a dividend payment date or interest payment date and, in addition, in the case of a restriction arising under clause (ii) above MetLife, Inc.’s Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity Amount has increased, or has declined by less than 10%, in either case as compared to the Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity Amount at the end of the benchmark quarter for each dividend payment date or interest payment date as to which restrictions were imposed under clause (ii) above. For example, if MetLife, Inc. failed to satisfy the test in clause (ii) above for three consecutive preferred stock dividend payment dates, MetLife would be free of the limits on dividends that may be declared on the preferred shares on the fourth dividend payment date only if, as of the related dividend declaration date:        •    MetLife, Inc. satisfied the tests in each of clauses (i) and (ii) above for that fourth dividend payment date; and        •    the Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity Amount as of the last completed quarter for that dividend payment date had increased from, or was less than 10% below, its level at the end of the respective benchmark quarter for each of the prior three dividend payment dates for which dividends were restricted under clause (ii) above. In effect, the Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity Amount as of the most recently completed quarter for that dividend payment date would have to be greater than, or less than 10% below, its level as of the end of not only the tenth quarter, but also each of the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth quarters, preceding the most recently completed quarter.  For purposes of these restrictions,        •    The term “Adjusted Shareholders’ Equity Amount” means, as of any quarter end and subject to certain adjustments, the shareholders’ equity of MetLife, Inc. as reflected on its consolidated GAAP balance sheet as of such quarter end minus accumulated other comprehensive income as reflected on such consolidated balance sheet.        •    The term “Covered Insurance Subsidiaries” means our largest U.S. life insurance subsidiaries (in terms of general account admitted assets) that collectively account for 80% or more of the general account admitted assets of all of our U.S. life insurance subsidiaries. For purposes of this definition, “life insurance subsidiaries” does not include life insurance companies that are subsidiaries of other life insurance companies.        •    The term “Trailing Four Quarters Consolidated Net Income Amount” means, for any fiscal quarter and subject to certain adjustments, the sum of the consolidated GAAP net income of MetLife, Inc. for the four fiscal quarters ending as of the last day of such fiscal quarter.  Dividends on Our Preferred Stock Are Subject to Declaration by Our Board of Directors. In addition to the provisions described above that prevent us from declaring and paying dividends on our preferred stock, dividends on our preferred stock are subject to declaration each quarter by our Board of Directors. If our Board of Directors does not declare dividends on the preferred stock for any quarterly dividend period, the “dividend stopper” provisions in our preferred stock would prevent us from repurchasing or paying dividends on our common stock for that period.    247    Table of Contents Optional Deferral of Interest on the Junior Subordinated Debentures. We may also defer one or more payments of interest on our junior subordinated debentures for up to ten years at our option. If a Trigger Event occurs after an optional deferral period commences, the optional deferral is deemed suspended until such time as neither of the Trigger Event conditions applies for an interest payment date. During the first five years of an optional deferral period, we may pay deferred interest out of any source of funds. If interest on the junior subordinated debentures remains unpaid after five years of an optional deferral period, we may not pay interest on the junior subordinated debentures except (other than after the final maturity date or after an acceleration date) to the extent of the amount of net proceeds that MetLife, Inc. has received from the sale of shares of common stock and certain kinds of warrants to purchase common stock during the 180 days prior to the interest payment date, and we would have to make commercially reasonable efforts to sell shares of common stock to provide sufficient proceeds to enable us to pay all accrued and unpaid interest on the junior subordinated debentures. During any interest deferral period, the “dividend stopper” provisions in the junior subordinated debentures would prevent us from repurchasing or paying dividends on our common stock or any other capital stock (including the preferred stock).  Our Statutory Reserve Financings May Be Subject to Cost Increases and New Financings May Be Subject to Limited Market Capacity  To support statutory reserves for several products, including, but not limited to, our level premium term life and universal life with secondary guarantees and MLIC’s closed block, we currently utilize capital markets solutions for financing a portion of our statutory reserve requirements. While we have financing facilities in place for certain previously written business, certain of these facilities are subject to cost increases upon the occurrence of specified ratings downgrades of MetLife or are subject to periodic repricing. Any resulting cost increases could negatively impact our financial results.  Future capacity for these statutory reserve funding structures in the marketplace is not guaranteed. Currently, the use of captive reinsurers is being studied by the Department of Financial Services and the NAIC. See “— Our Insurance, Brokerage and Banking Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth.” If the Department of Financial Services or other state insurance regulators determine to restrict the use of captive reinsurers for purposes of funding reserve requirements or capacity in the capital markets otherwise becomes unavailable for a prolonged period of time, hindering our ability to obtain funding for these new structures, our ability to write additional business in a cost effective manner may be impacted.  Litigation and Regulatory Investigations Are Increasingly Common in Our Businesses and May Result in Significant Financial Losses and/or Harm to Our Reputation  We face a significant risk of litigation and regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating our businesses, including the risk of class action lawsuits. Our pending legal and regulatory actions include proceedings specific to us and others generally applicable to business practices in the industries in which we operate. In connection with our insurance operations, plaintiffs’ lawyers may bring or are bringing class actions and individual suits alleging, among other things, issues relating to sales or underwriting practices, claims payments and procedures, product design, disclosure, administration, denial or delay of benefits and breaches of fiduciary or other duties to customers. Plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may seek very large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive and treble damages. Modern pleading practice in the U.S. and other countries permits considerable variation in the assertion of money damages or other relief. This variability in pleadings, together with our actual experience in litigating or resolving through settlement numerous claims over an extended period of time, demonstrates to management that the monetary relief which may be specified in a lawsuit or claim bears little relevance to its merits or disposition value. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  Due to the vagaries of litigation, the outcome of a litigation matter and the amount or range of potential loss at particular points in time may normally be difficult to ascertain. Uncertainties can include how fact finders will    248    Table of Contents  evaluate documentary evidence and the credibility and effectiveness of witness testimony, and how trial and appellate courts will apply the law in the context of the pleadings or evidence presented, whether by motion practice, or at trial or on appeal. Disposition valuations are also subject to the uncertainty of how opposing parties and their counsel will themselves view the relevant evidence and applicable law.  We establish liabilities for litigation and regulatory loss contingencies when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities have been established for a number of matters noted in Note 12 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. It is possible that some of the matters could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures or establish accruals in amounts that could not be estimated at September 30, 2012.  Over the past several years, we have faced numerous claims, including class action lawsuits, alleging improper marketing or sales of individual life insurance policies, annuities, mutual funds or other products.  In addition, MLIC is and has been a defendant in a large number of lawsuits seeking both actual and punitive damages for personal injuries resulting from exposure to asbestos. These lawsuits principally have focused on allegations with respect to certain research, publication and other activities of one or more of MLIC’s employees during the period from the 1920’s through approximately the 1950’s and alleged that MLIC learned or should have learned of certain health risks posed by asbestos and, among other things, improperly publicized or failed to disclose those health risks. Additional litigation relating to these matters may be commenced in the future. The ability of MLIC to estimate its ultimate asbestos exposure is subject to considerable uncertainty, and the conditions impacting its liability can be dynamic and subject to change. The availability of reliable data is limited and it is difficult to predict the numerous variables that can affect liability estimates, including the number of future claims, the cost to resolve claims, the disease mix and severity of disease in pending and future claims, the impact of the number of new claims filed in a particular jurisdiction and variations in the law in the jurisdictions in which claims are filed, the possible impact of tort reform efforts, the willingness of courts to allow plaintiffs to pursue claims against MLIC when exposure to asbestos took place after the dangers of asbestos exposure were well known, and the impact of any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts. The number of asbestos cases that may be brought, the aggregate amount of any liability that MLIC may incur, and the total amount paid in settlements in any given year are uncertain and may vary significantly from year to year.  The ability to make estimates regarding ultimate asbestos exposure declines significantly as the estimates relate to years further in the future. In our judgment, there is a future point after which losses cease to be probable and reasonably estimable. It is reasonably possible that our total exposure to asbestos claims may be materially greater than the asbestos liability currently accrued and that future charges to income may be necessary. The potential future charges could be material in the particular quarterly or annual periods in which they are recorded.  We are also subject to various regulatory inquiries, such as information requests, subpoenas and books and record examinations, from state and federal regulators and other authorities. A substantial legal liability or a significant regulatory action against us could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, even if we ultimately prevail in the litigation, regulatory action or investigation, we could suffer significant reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our ability to attract new customers, retain our current customers and recruit and retain employees. Regulatory inquiries and litigation may cause volatility in the price of stocks of companies in our industry.  In April 2012, we reached agreements with representatives of the U.S. jurisdictions that were conducting audits of MetLife, Inc. and certain of its affiliates for compliance with unclaimed property laws, and with state insurance regulators directly involved in a multistate targeted market conduct examination relating to claim-payment practices and compliance with unclaimed property laws. The effectiveness of each agreement was conditioned upon the approval of a specified number of jurisdictions. In each case, the threshold for effectiveness has been reached. Pursuant to the agreements, we will, among other things, take specified action to identify    249    Table of Contents  liabilities under life insurance, annuity, and retained asset contracts, to adopt specified procedures for seeking to contact and pay owners of the identified liabilities, and, to the extent that we are unable to locate such owners, to escheat these amounts with interest at a specified rate to the appropriate states. Additionally, we have agreed to accelerate the final date of certain industrial life policies and to escheat unclaimed benefits of such policies. Pursuant to the agreement to resolve the market conduct examination, the Company made a $40 million multi-state examination payment to be allocated among the settling states. In the third quarter of 2011, we incurred a $117 million after tax charge to increase reserves in connection with our use of the U.S. Social Security Administration’s Death Master File and similar databases to identify potential life insurance claims that had not been presented to us. In the first quarter of 2012, we recorded a $52 million after tax charge for the multi-state examination payment and the expected acceleration of benefit payments to policyholders under the settlements. On September 20, 2012, the West Virginia Treasurer filed an action against MLIC in West Virginia state court (West Virginia ex rel, John D. Perdue v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, Circuit Court of Putnam Country, Civil Action No. 12-C-295) alleging that the Company violated the West Virginia Uniform Unclaimed Property Act, seeking to compel compliance with the Act, and seeking payment of unclaimed property, interest and penalties. At least one other jurisdiction is pursuing a similar market conduct examination concerning compliance with unclaimed property statutes. It is possible that other jurisdictions may pursue similar examinations, audits or lawsuits and that such actions may result in additional payments to beneficiaries, additional escheatment of funds deemed abandoned under state laws, administrative penalties, interest, and/or further changes to our procedures. See Note 12 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding unclaimed property inquiries and related litigation.  We cannot give assurance that current claims, litigation, unasserted claims probable of assertion, investigations and other proceedings against us will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. It is also possible that related or unrelated claims, litigation, unasserted claims probable of assertion, investigations and proceedings may be commenced in the future, and we could become subject to further investigations and have lawsuits filed or enforcement actions initiated against us. The number of countries in which we currently operate has greatly expanded as a result of the acquisition of ALICO and, consequently, we may be subject to additional investigations and lawsuits in such jurisdictions. Increased regulatory scrutiny and any resulting investigations or proceedings in any of the countries where we operate could result in new legal actions and precedents and industry-wide regulations that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.    250    Table of Contents   Item 2.
