Risk FactorsThe following should be read in conjunction with, and supplements and amends, the factors that may affect the Company’s business or operations described under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, of the 2017 Annual Report, as amended or supplemented in our subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q under Item 1A. Risk Factors. Other than as so amended or supplemented and as described in this Item 1A, there have been no other material changes to our risk factors from the risk factors previously disclosed in the 2017 Annual Report.Capital-Related RisksThe following updates and replaces the similar paragraph of the risk factor entitled “Legal and Regulatory Restrictions and Uncertainty and Restrictions Under the Terms of Certain of Our Securities May Prevent Us from Repurchasing Our Stock and Paying Dividends at the Levels We Wish” included in the 2017 Annual Report.Legal and Regulatory Restrictions and Uncertainty and Restrictions Under the Terms of Certain of Our Securities May Prevent Us from Repurchasing Our Stock and Paying Dividends at the Level We Wish***Trigger Events for the Restrictions on the Payment of Dividends on Our Preferred Stock and Restrictions on the Payment of Interest on Our Junior Subordinated DebenturesIn addition, MetLife’s Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A, and 5.25% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series C, and its junior subordinated debentures contain provisions that would suspend the payment of preferred stock dividends and interest on junior subordinated debentures if MetLife, Inc. fails to meet certain tests (“Trigger Events”). In such cases, and subject to the terms of the instruments, MetLife, Inc. could make payments up to the amount of net proceeds from sales of (i) common stock during the 90 days preceding the dividend declaration date or (ii) common stock or certain kinds of warrants to purchase common stock generally during the 180 days prior to the interest payment date (the “New Equity Proceeds”). If the New Equity Proceeds were insufficient to make such payments, the “dividend stopper” provisions would come into effect and we would be unable to repurchase or pay dividends on our common stock.Item 2.
