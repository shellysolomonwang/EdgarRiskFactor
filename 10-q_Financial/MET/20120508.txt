Item 1A. Risk Factors  The following should be read in conjunction with, and supplements and amends, the factors that may affect the Company’s business or operations described under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, of the 2011 Annual Report.  Difficult Conditions in the Global Capital Markets and the Economy Generally May Materially Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations and These Conditions May Not Improve in the Near Future  Our business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. Stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in global capital markets, particular markets, or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large investment portfolio and our insurance liabilities are sensitive to changing market factors. Global market factors, including interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, real estate markets, foreign currency exchange rates, consumer spending, business investment, government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, deflation and inflation, all affect the business and economic environment and, ultimately, the amount and profitability of our business. Disruptions in one market or asset class can also spread to other markets or asset classes. Upheavals in the financial markets can also affect our business through their effects on general levels of economic activity, employment and customer behavior. While our diversified business mix and geographically diverse business operations partially mitigate these risks, correlation across regions, countries and global market factors may reduce the benefits of diversification.  Volatile conditions have continued to characterize financial markets at times, and not all global financial markets are functioning normally. Significant market volatility, and government actions taken in response, may exacerbate some of the risks we face. During the first quarter of 2012, concerns about capital markets and the solvency of certain European Union member states, including Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain (“Europe’s perimeter region”), and of financial institutions that have significant direct or indirect exposure to debt issued by these countries, continue to create market volatility. This market volatility will continue to affect the performance of various asset classes during 2012, and perhaps longer, until there is an ultimate resolution of these sovereign debt-related concerns. Greece’s newly issued sovereign debt is currently rated C by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., CCC by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) and B- by Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”). Despite public and private support programs for Europe’s perimeter region, concerns about sovereign debt sustainability subsequently expanded to other European Union member states. As a result, in late 2011 and early 2012, several other European Union member states experienced credit ratings downgrades or had their credit ratings outlook changed to negative. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Investments — Current Environment.” The Japanese economy, to which we face substantial exposure given our operations there, was significantly negatively impacted by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Although we expect modest growth and improved economic conditions in the Japanese economy during 2012, disruptions to the Japanese economy are having, and will continue to have, negative impacts on the overall global economy, not all of which can be foreseen. Although the August 2011 downgrade by S&P of U.S. Treasury securities initially had an adverse effect on financial markets, the extent of the longer-term impact cannot be predicted. In November 2011, Fitch warned that it may in the future downgrade the U.S. credit rating unless action is taken to reduce the national debt of the U.S. It is possible that the August 2011 S&P downgrade and any future downgrades, as well as continued concerns about U.S. fiscal policy and the trajectory of the national debt of the U.S., could have severe repercussions to the U.S. and global credit and financial markets, further exacerbate concerns over sovereign debt of other countries and could disrupt economic activity in the U.S. and elsewhere. See “Risk Factors — Concerns Over U.S. Fiscal Policy and the Trajectory of the National Debt of the U.S., as well as Rating Agency Downgrades of U.S. Treasury Securities, Could Have an Adverse Effect on Our Business, Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the 2011 Annual Report and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Investments — Current Environment.”    189    Table of Contents Our revenues and net investment income are likely to remain under pressure in uncertain financial market conditions and as a result of low interest rates, and our profit margins could erode. Also, in the event of extreme prolonged market events, such as the recent global credit crisis, we could incur significant capital and/or operating losses. Even in the absence of a market downturn, we are exposed to substantial risk of loss due to market volatility.  We are a significant writer of variable insurance products and certain other products issued through separate accounts. The account values of these products decrease as a result of declining equity markets. Decreases in account values reduce fees generated by these products, cause the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (“DAC”) to accelerate and could increase the level of insurance liabilities we must carry to support such products issued with any associated guarantees.  Factors such as consumer spending, business investment, government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, deflation and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and, ultimately, the amount and profitability of our business. In an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending, the demand for our financial and insurance products could be adversely affected. Group insurance, in particular, is affected by the higher unemployment rate. In addition, we may experience an elevated incidence of claims and lapses or surrenders of policies. Our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether. Adverse changes in the economy could affect earnings negatively and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  The recent financial crisis has precipitated, and may continue to raise the possibility of, legislative, judicial, regulatory and other governmental actions. We cannot predict whether or when such actions may occur, nor can we predict what ultimate impact, if any, either such actions or any of the legislative, judicial, regulatory and other governmental actions of the last several years could have on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “— Our Insurance, Brokerage and Banking Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth” and “Risk Factors — Governmental and Regulatory Actions for the Purpose of Stabilizing and Revitalizing the Financial Markets and Protecting Investors and Consumers May Not Achieve the Intended Effect or Could Adversely Affect Our Competitive Position,” “Risk Factors — Various Aspects of Dodd-Frank Could Impact Our Business Operations, Capital Requirements and Profitability and Limit Our Growth,” and “Risk Factors — Competitive Factors May Adversely Affect Our Market Share and Profitability” in the 2011 Annual Report.  Our Insurance, Brokerage and Banking Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth  Insurance Regulation — U.S. Our insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of insurance and other laws and regulations. See “Business — U.S. Regulation — Insurance Regulation” in the 2011 Annual Report. State insurance laws regulate most aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance regulators of the states in which they are domiciled and the states in which they are licensed.  State laws in the U.S. grant insurance regulatory and other state authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things:        •    licensing companies and agents to transact business;        •    calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements;        •    mandating certain insurance benefits;        •    regulating certain premium rates;        •    reviewing and approving policy forms;    190    Table of Contents     •    regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements, and identifying and paying to the states benefits and other property that is not claimed by the owners;        •    regulating advertising;        •    protecting privacy;        •    establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards;        •    fixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts;        •    approving changes in control of insurance companies;        •    restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates; and        •    regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments.  State insurance guaranty associations have the right to assess insurance companies doing business in their state for funds to help pay the obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. Because the amount and timing of an assessment is beyond our control, the liabilities that we have currently established for these potential liabilities may not be adequate. See “Business — U.S. Regulation — Insurance Regulation — Guaranty Associations and Similar Arrangements” in the 2011 Annual Report.  State insurance regulators and the NAIC regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, that are made for the benefit of the consumer sometimes lead to additional expense for the insurer and, thus, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  U.S. Federal Regulation Affecting Insurance. Currently, the U.S. federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance. However, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”) allows federal regulators to compel state insurance regulators to liquidate an insolvent insurer under some circumstances if the state regulators have not acted within a specific period. It also establishes the Federal Insurance Office within the Department of the Treasury, which has the authority to participate in the negotiations of international insurance agreements with foreign regulators for the U.S., as well as to collect information about the insurance industry and recommend prudential standards. While not having a general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, the director of this office will perform various functions with respect to insurance, including serving as a non-voting member of the Financial Stability Oversight Counsel (“FSOC”) and making recommendations to the FSOC regarding insurers to be designated for more stringent regulation. The director is also required to submit a report to Congress regarding how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the United States, including by increasing national uniformity through either a federal charter or effective action by the states.  Federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies. These areas include financial services regulation, securities regulation, derivatives regulation, mortgage regulation, pension regulation, health care regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation. In addition, various forms of direct and indirect federal regulation of insurance have been proposed from time to time, including proposals for the establishment of an optional federal charter for insurance companies. Other aspects of our insurance operations could also be affected by Dodd-Frank. For example, effective July 2012, Dodd-Frank imposes restrictions on the ability of affiliates of insured depository institutions (such as MetLife Bank) to engage in proprietary trading or sponsor or invest in hedge funds or private equity funds. See “Business — U.S. Regulation — Dodd-Frank and Other Legislative and Regulatory Developments — Volcker Rule” in the 2011 Annual Report.    191    Table of Contents Banking and Bank Holding Company Regulation. As a federally chartered national banking association, MetLife Bank is subject to a wide variety of banking laws, regulations and guidelines. Federal banking and consumer financial protection laws regulate most aspects of the business of MetLife Bank, but certain state laws may apply as well. MetLife Bank is principally regulated by the OCC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), and secondarily by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the “FRB of NY” and, collectively with the Federal Reserve Board, the “Federal Reserve”) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”).  Federal banking laws and regulations address various aspects of MetLife Bank’s business and operations with respect to, among other things:        •    chartering to carry on business as a bank;        •    the permissibility of certain activities;        •    maintaining minimum capital ratios;        •    capital management in relation to the bank’s assets;        •    dividend payments and repurchases of securities, including common stock;        •    safety and soundness standards;        •    loan loss and other related liabilities;        •    liquidity;        •    financial reporting and disclosure standards;        •    counterparty credit concentration;        •    restrictions on related party and affiliate transactions;        •    lending limits (and, in addition, Dodd-Frank includes the credit exposures arising from securities lending by MetLife Bank within lending limits otherwise applicable to loans);        •    payment of interest;        •    unfair or deceptive acts or practices;        •    mortgage servicing practices;        •    privacy; and        •    relationships with MetLife, Inc. in its capacity as a bank holding company and potentially with other investors in connection with a change in control of MetLife Bank.  Federal banking regulators regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to banks and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the bank and, thus, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of MetLife Bank.  From 2008 until January 2012, MetLife Bank significantly increased its mortgage servicing activities by acquiring servicing portfolios. Currently, MetLife Bank services approximately 1% of the aggregate principal amount of the mortgage loans serviced in the U.S. In January 2012, MetLife, Inc. announced that it is exiting the business of originating forward residential mortgages, but will continue to service its existing forward mortgage customers. In April 2012, MetLife, Inc. announced that it is exiting the reverse mortgage origination business and that it and MetLife Bank entered into a definitive agreement to sell MetLife Bank’s reverse mortgage servicing portfolio.    192    Table of Contents State and federal regulatory and law enforcement authorities have initiated various inquiries, investigations or examinations of alleged irregularities in the foreclosure practices of the residential mortgage servicing industry. Mortgage servicing practices have also been the subject of Congressional attention. Authorities have publicly stated that the scope of the investigations extends beyond foreclosure documentation practices to include mortgage loan modification and loss mitigation practices. See “Risk Factors — The Resolution of Several Issues Affecting the Financial Services Industry Could Have a Negative Impact on Our Reported Results or on Our Relations with Current and Potential Customers” in the 2011 Annual Report.  In addition, Dodd-Frank established the CFPB that supervises and regulates institutions providing certain financial products and services to consumers. Although the consumer financial services to which this legislation applies exclude insurance business of the kind in which we engage, the CFPB has authority to regulate consumer services provided by MetLife Bank and non-insurance consumer services provided elsewhere throughout MetLife. See “Business — U.S. Regulation — Dodd-Frank and Other Legislative and Regulatory Developments — Consumer Protection Laws” in the 2011 Annual Report. We cannot predict how regulation by the CFPB might affect our business.  In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”) published its final rules for increased capital and liquidity requirements (commonly referred to as “Basel III”) for bank holding companies, such as MetLife, Inc. Assuming these requirements are endorsed and adopted by the U.S., they are to be phased in beginning January 1, 2013. It is possible that even more stringent capital and liquidity requirements could be imposed on us under Basel III and Dodd-Frank as long as MetLife, Inc. remains a bank holding company or if, in the future, it is designated by the FSOC as a non-bank financial company subject to enhanced supervision by the Federal Reserve Board (a “non-bank systemically important financial institution” or “non-bank SIFI”).  In December 2011, the Federal Reserve Board issued a notice of proposed rulemaking related to enhanced prudential standards required by Dodd-Frank (“Regulation YY”). Regulation YY would apply to bank holding companies with assets of $50 billion or more and non-bank SIFIs. The ability of MetLife Bank and MetLife, Inc. to pay dividends, repurchase common stock or other securities or engage in other transactions that could affect its capital or need for capital would be affected by any additional capital requirements that might be imposed as a result of the enactment of Dodd-Frank, Regulation YY and the endorsement and adoption by the U.S. of Basel III and other regulatory initiatives. See “Business — U.S. Regulation,” “Business — International Regulation” in the 2011 Annual Report and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends.” The Basel Committee has also published rules requiring a capital surcharge for globally systemically important banks, which are to be phased in for U.S. banks beginning in 2016 and will become fully effective in 2019 if they are endorsed and adopted by the U.S. banking regulators.  The Federal Reserve’s capital plan rule requires all bank holding companies with assets of more than $50 billion, including MetLife, Inc., to submit annual capital plans which include projections of the company’s capital levels under baseline and stress scenarios over a nine-quarter period. The Federal Reserve will approve or object to a company’s proposed capital actions, such as dividends and stock repurchases, based on the results of those capital plans and the Federal Reserve’s assessment of the robustness of the company’s capital planning processes. In addition, in recent years the Federal Reserve has conducted the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”), an assessment of the internal capital planning processes, capital adequacy and proposed capital distributions of large bank holding companies, including MetLife, Inc. In January 2012, we submitted to the Federal Reserve a comprehensive capital plan, as mandated by the capital plan rule, and additional information required by CCAR 2012. The capital plan projected MetLife’s capital levels to the end of 2013 under baseline and stress scenarios, including a stress scenario developed and provided by the Federal Reserve as part of CCAR 2012. In March 2012, the Federal Reserve, based on its assessment, objected to MetLife’s incremental capital distribution plan, which included a proposed stock repurchase and dividend increase. If MetLife remains a bank holding company, or if it is designated a non-bank systemically important financial institution and is  required to submit capital plans to the Federal Reserve in the future, there can be no assurance that the Federal    193    Table of Contents  Reserve will approve its future capital plans. Capital planning requirements could have the effect, in practice, of increasing the amounts of capital held by companies subject to the requirements, including MetLife, which could affect their competitive position.  Under Dodd-Frank, all bank holding companies that have elected to be treated as financial holding companies, such as MetLife, Inc., are required to be “well capitalized” and “well managed” as defined by the Federal Reserve, on a consolidated basis, and not just at their depository institution(s), a higher standard than was applicable to financial holding companies before Dodd-Frank. If MetLife, Inc., or MetLife Bank is unable to meet these standards, we could be subject to activity restrictions, including restrictions on mergers and acquisitions, ultimately be required to divest certain operations and be restricted in our ability to pay dividends, repurchase common stock or other securities, or engage in transactions that could affect our capital or need for capital. See “Business — U.S. Regulation — Dodd-Frank and Other Legislative and Regulatory Developments” in the 2011 Annual Report.  In December 2011, MetLife Bank and MetLife, Inc. entered into a definitive agreement to sell most of the depository business of MetLife Bank to GE Capital Financial Inc. The transaction is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals from the OCC, the FDIC and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions (the “Utah DFI”) and to the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. GE Capital Financial Inc. has filed applications with the FDIC and the Utah DFI seeking approval of the assumption of the deposits to be transferred to it, and MetLife Bank has filed applications with the OCC seeking approval to change the composition of substantially all of MetLife Bank’s assets and with the FDIC to terminate MetLife Bank’s FDIC deposit insurance contingent upon certification that MetLife Bank has no remaining deposits (which is dependent on the assumption by GE Capital Financial Inc. of the deposits to be transferred to it). The parties have responded to questions on their applications from the staff of the OCC, the FDIC and the Utah DFI, and are awaiting action by these regulators on their applications. Upon completion of MetLife Bank’s exit from its depository business and termination of its FDIC insurance and MetLife, Inc.’s deregistration as a bank holding company, we will no longer be regulated as a bank holding company or subject to enhanced supervision and prudential standards as a bank holding company with assets of $50 billion or more. However, if, in the future, the FSOC designates MetLife, Inc. as a non-bank SIFI, we would once again be subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve and enhanced supervision and prudential standards, such as Regulation YY. In April 2012, the FSOC adopted final rules setting forth the process it will follow and the criteria it will use to assess whether a non-bank financial company should be subject to enhanced supervision by the Federal Reserve as a non-bank SIFI. The FSOC will follow a three-stage process. In Stage 1, a set of uniform quantitative metrics will be applied to a broad group of non-bank financial companies in order to identify non-bank financial companies for further evaluation. If MetLife, Inc. meets the consolidated assets threshold and at least one of the other five quantitative thresholds used in the first stage, the FSOC will continue with two stages of further analysis using additional sources of data and qualitative and quantitative factors. See “Business — U.S. Regulation — Financial Holding Company Regulation” in the 2011 Annual Report and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends.”  The FDIC has the right to assess FDIC-insured banks for funds to help pay the obligations of insolvent banks to depositors. Because the amount and timing of an assessment is beyond our control, the liabilities that we have currently established for these potential liabilities may not be adequate. In addition, Dodd-Frank will result in increased assessments for banks with assets of $10 billion or more, which includes MetLife Bank. In addition, large bank holding companies and non-bank SIFIs can be assessed under Dodd-Frank for any uncovered costs arising in connection with the resolution of a systemically important financial company and, under a proposal of the U.S. Treasury published on January 3, 2012, will be assessed to cover the expenses of the Office of Financial Research, an agency established by Dodd-Frank to improve the quality of financial data available to policymakers and facilitate more robust and sophisticated analysis of the financial system.  Regulation of Brokers and Dealers. Dodd-Frank also authorizes the SEC to establish a standard of conduct applicable to brokers and dealers when providing personalized investment advice to retail and other customers. This standard of conduct would be to act in the best interest of the customer without regard to the financial or    194    Table of Contents  other interest of the broker or dealer providing the advice. See “Business — U.S. Regulation — Securities, Broker-Dealer and Investment Adviser Regulation” and “Risk Factors — Changes in U.S. Federal and State Securities Laws and Regulations, and State Insurance Regulations Regarding Suitability of Annuity Product Sales, May Affect Our Operations and Our Profitability” in the 2011 Annual Report.  International Regulation. Our international insurance operations are principally regulated by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are located or operate. See “Business — International Regulation” and “Risk Factors — Our International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks, Including Exposure to Local and Regional Economic Conditions, That Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our Profitability” in the 2011 Annual Report. A significant portion of our revenues is generated through operations in foreign jurisdictions, including many countries in early stages of economic and political development. Our international operations may be materially adversely affected by the actions and decisions of foreign authorities and regulators, such as through nationalization or expropriation of assets, the imposition of limits on foreign ownership of local companies, changes in laws (including tax laws and regulations), their application or interpretation, political instability, dividend limitations, price controls, changes in applicable currency, currency exchange controls or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which they operate or converting local currencies we hold to U.S. dollars or other currencies. This may also impact many of our customers and independent sales intermediaries. Changes in the regulations that affect their operations also may affect our business relationships with them and their ability to purchase or distribute our products. Accordingly, these changes and actions may negatively affect our business in these jurisdictions.  We are also subject to the evolving Solvency II insurance regulatory directive for each of our insurance operations throughout the European Economic Area. As requirements are finalized by the regulators, capital requirements might be impacted in a number of jurisdictions. In addition, our legal entity structure throughout Europe may impact our capital requirements, risk management infrastructure and reporting by country.  We expect the scope and extent of regulation outside of the U.S., as well as regulatory oversight, generally to continue to increase. The authority of our international operations to conduct business is subject to licensing requirements, permits and approvals, and these authorizations are subject to modification and revocation. The regulatory environment in the countries in which we operate and changes in laws could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See “Risk Factors — Our International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks, Including Exposure to Local and Regional Economic Conditions, That Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our Profitability” and “Business — International Regulation” in the 2011 Annual Report.  Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance and other expenses of doing business, thus having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  Summary. From time to time, regulators raise issues during examinations or audits of MetLife, Inc.’s regulated subsidiaries that could, if determined adversely, have a material impact on us. We cannot predict whether or when regulatory actions may be taken that could adversely affect our operations. In addition, the interpretations of regulations by regulators may change and statutes may be enacted with retroactive impact, particularly in areas such as accounting or statutory reserve requirements. We are also subject to other regulations and may in the future become subject to additional regulations. See “Business — U.S. Regulation” and “Business — International Regulation” in the 2011 Annual Report.  Changes in Market Interest Rates May Significantly Affect Our Profitability  Some of our products, principally traditional whole life insurance, fixed annuities and guaranteed interest contracts, expose us to the risk that changes in interest rates will reduce our investment margin or “spread,” or the difference between the amounts that we are required to pay under the contracts in our general account and the    195    Table of Contents  rate of return we are able to earn on general account investments intended to support obligations under the contracts. Our spread is a key component of our net income.  As interest rates decrease or remain at low levels, we may be forced to reinvest proceeds from investments that have matured or have been prepaid or sold at lower yields, reducing our investment margin. Moreover, borrowers may prepay or redeem the fixed income securities, commercial or agricultural mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities in our investment portfolio with greater frequency in order to borrow at lower market rates, which exacerbates this risk. Lowering interest crediting rates can help offset decreases in investment margins on some products. However, our ability to lower these rates could be limited by competition or contractually guaranteed minimum rates and may not match the timing or magnitude of changes in asset yields. As a result, our spread could decrease or potentially become negative. Our expectation for future spreads is an important component in the amortization of DAC and value of business acquired (“VOBA”), and significantly lower spreads may cause us to accelerate amortization, thereby reducing net income in the affected reporting period. In addition, during periods of declining interest rates, life insurance and annuity products may be relatively more attractive investments to consumers, resulting in increased premium payments on products with flexible premium features, repayment of policy loans and increased persistency, or a higher percentage of insurance policies remaining in force from year to year, during a period when our new investments carry lower returns. A decline in market interest rates could also reduce our return on investments that do not support particular policy obligations. During periods of sustained lower interest rates, policy liabilities may not be sufficient to meet future policy obligations and may need to be strengthened. Accordingly, declining and sustained lower interest rates may materially affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows and significantly reduce our profitability. In March 2012, the Federal Reserve Board reiterated its plans to keep interest rates low until at least through late 2014.  Increases in market interest rates could also negatively affect our profitability. In periods of rapidly increasing interest rates, we may not be able to replace, in a timely manner, the investments in our general account with higher yielding investments needed to fund the higher crediting rates necessary to keep interest sensitive products competitive. We, therefore, may have to accept a lower spread and, thus, lower profitability or face a decline in sales and greater loss of existing contracts and related assets. In addition, policy loans, surrenders and withdrawals may tend to increase as policyholders seek investments with higher perceived returns as interest rates rise. This process may result in cash outflows requiring that we sell investments at a time when the prices of those investments are adversely affected by the increase in market interest rates, which may result in realized investment losses. Unanticipated withdrawals and terminations may cause us to accelerate the amortization of DAC and VOBA, which reduces net income and may also cause us to accelerate negative VOBA, which increases net income. An increase in market interest rates could also have a material adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio, for example, by decreasing the estimated fair values of the fixed income securities that comprise a substantial portion of our investment portfolio. Finally, an increase in interest rates could result in decreased fee income associated with a decline in the value of variable annuity account balances invested in fixed income funds.  If Our Business Does Not Perform Well or if Actual Experience Versus Estimates Used in Valuing and Amortizing DAC, Deferred Sales Inducements (“DSI”) and VOBA Vary Significantly, We May Be Required to Accelerate the Amortization and/or Impair the DAC, DSI and VOBA Which Could Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations or Financial Condition  We incur significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business. Costs that are related directly to the successful acquisition of new and renewal insurance business are deferred as DAC. Bonus amounts credited to certain policyholders, either immediately upon receiving a deposit or as excess interest credits for a period of time, are referred to as DSI. The recovery of DAC and DSI is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business. The amount of future profit or margin is dependent principally on investment returns in excess of the amounts credited to policyholders, mortality, morbidity, persistency, interest crediting rates, dividends paid to policyholders, expenses to administer the business, creditworthiness of reinsurance counterparties and certain economic variables, such as inflation. Of these factors, we anticipate that investment    196    Table of Contents  returns are most likely to impact the rate of amortization of such costs. The aforementioned factors enter into management’s estimates of gross profits or margins, which generally are used to amortize such costs.  If the estimates of gross profits or margins were overstated, then the amortization of such costs would be accelerated in the period the actual experience is known and would result in a charge to income. Significant or sustained equity market declines could result in an acceleration of amortization of DAC and DSI related to variable annuity and variable universal life contracts, resulting in a charge to income. Such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.  VOBA represents the excess of book value over the estimated fair value of acquired insurance, annuity, and investment-type contracts in-force at the acquisition date. The estimated fair value of the acquired liabilities is based on actuarially determined projections, by each block of business, of future policy and contract charges, premiums, mortality and morbidity, separate account performance, surrenders, operating expenses, investment returns, nonperformance risk adjustment and other factors. Actual experience on the purchased business may vary from these projections. Revisions to estimates result in changes to the amounts expensed in the reporting period in which the revisions are made and could result in a charge to income. Also, as VOBA is amortized similarly to DAC and DSI, an acceleration of the amortization of VOBA would occur if the estimates of gross profits or margins were overstated. Accordingly, the amortization of such costs would be accelerated in the period in which the actual experience is known and would result in a charge to net income. Significant or sustained equity market declines could result in an acceleration of amortization of the VOBA related to variable annuity and variable universal life contracts, resulting in a charge to income. Such adjustments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.
