Item 1A.    Risk Factors       The following should be read in conjunction with, and supplements and amends, the factors that may affect the Company’s business or operations described under “Risk Factors” in Part I Item 1A of the 2010 Annual Report filed      170    Table of Contents    with the SEC and under “Risk Factors” in Item 8.01 of the Company’s Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on March 1, 2011, as disclosed below.     Difficult Conditions in the Global Capital Markets and the Economy Generally May Materially Adversely Affect Our Business and Results of Operations and These Conditions May Not Improve in the Near Future     Our business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally, both in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world. Stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in global capital markets or in particular markets or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on us, in part because we have a large investment portfolio and our insurance liabilities are sensitive to changing market factors. Disruptions in one market or asset class can also spread to other markets or asset classes. Although the disruption in the global financial markets that began in late 2007 has moderated, not all global financial markets are functioning normally, and some remain reliant upon government intervention and liquidity. Upheavals in the financial markets can also affect our business through their effects on general levels of economic activity, employment and customer behavior. Although the recent recession in the U.S. ended in June of 2009, the recovery from the recession has been below historic averages and the unemployment rate is expected to remain high for some time. Inflation had fallen over the last several years, but is now rising, and Central Banks around the world have begun tightening monetary conditions. The global recession and disruption of the financial markets has led to concerns over capital markets access and the solvency of certain European Union member states, including Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain. In the event political discord in the U.S. prevents agreement on a national debt ceiling or budget, the U.S. could default on obligations, which would further exacerbate concerns over sovereign debt of other countries. The Japanese economy, to which we face increased exposure as a result of the Acquisition, has been significantly negatively impacted by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, and the resulting serious disruption to power supplies and release of radiation from a damaged nuclear power plant in northeastern Japan. Disruptions to the Japanese economy are having and will continue to have negative impacts on the overall global economy, not all of which can be foreseen.     Our revenues and net investment income are likely to remain under pressure in such circumstances and our profit margins could erode. Also, in the event of extreme prolonged market events, such as the recent global credit crisis, we could incur significant capital and/or operating losses. Even in the absence of a market downturn, we are exposed to substantial risk of loss due to market volatility.     We are a significant writer of variable annuity products. The account values of these products decrease as a result of downturns in capital markets. Decreases in account values reduce the fees generated by our variable annuity products, cause the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs to accelerate and could increase the level of insurance liabilities we must carry to support those variable annuities issued with any associated guarantees.     Factors such as consumer spending, business investment, government spending, the volatility and strength of the capital markets, and inflation all affect the business and economic environment and, ultimately, the amount and profitability of our business. In an economic downturn characterized by higher unemployment, lower family income, lower corporate earnings, lower business investment and lower consumer spending, the demand for our financial and insurance products could be adversely affected. Group insurance, in particular, is affected by the higher unemployment rate. In addition, we may experience an elevated incidence of claims and lapses or surrenders of policies. Our policyholders may choose to defer paying insurance premiums or stop paying insurance premiums altogether. Adverse changes in the economy could affect earnings negatively and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The recent market turmoil has precipitated, and may continue to raise the possibility of, legislative, regulatory and governmental actions. We cannot predict whether or when such actions may occur, or what impact, if any, such actions could have on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “— Our Insurance, Brokerage and Banking Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth,” and “Risk Factors — Actions of the U.S. Government, Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Other Governmental and Regulatory Bodies for the Purpose of Stabilizing and Revitalizing the Financial Markets and Protecting Investors and Consumers May Not Achieve the Intended Effect or Could Adversely Affect MetLife’s Competitive Position,” “Risk Factors — Various Aspects of Dodd-Frank Could Impact Our Business Operations, Capital Requirements and Profitability and Limit Our Growth,” and “Risk Factors — Competitive Factors May Adversely Affect Our Market Share and Profitability” in the 2010 Annual Report.     171    Table of Contents    Our Insurance, Brokerage and Banking Businesses Are Highly Regulated, and Changes in Regulation and in Supervisory and Enforcement Policies May Reduce Our Profitability and Limit Our Growth     Our insurance operations are subject to a wide variety of insurance and other laws and regulations. See “Business — U.S. Regulation — Insurance Regulation” in the 2010 Annual Report. State insurance laws regulate most aspects of our U.S. insurance businesses, and our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled and the states in which they are licensed. Our non-U.S. insurance operations are principally regulated by insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or operate. See “Business — International Regulation” in the 2010 Annual Report.     State laws in the U.S. grant insurance regulatory authorities broad administrative powers with respect to, among other things:              •   licensing companies and agents to transact business;         •   calculating the value of assets to determine compliance with statutory requirements;         •   mandating certain insurance benefits;         •   regulating certain premium rates;         •   reviewing and approving policy forms;         •   regulating unfair trade and claims practices, including through the imposition of restrictions on marketing and sales practices, distribution arrangements and payment of inducements;         •   regulating advertising;         •   protecting privacy;         •   establishing statutory capital and reserve requirements and solvency standards;         •   fixing maximum interest rates on insurance policy loans and minimum rates for guaranteed crediting rates on life insurance policies and annuity contracts;         •   approving changes in control of insurance companies;         •   restricting the payment of dividends and other transactions between affiliates; and         •   regulating the types, amounts and valuation of investments.       State insurance guaranty associations have the right to assess insurance companies doing business in their state for funds to help pay the obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. Because the amount and timing of an assessment is beyond our control, the liabilities that we have currently established for these potential liabilities may not be adequate. See “Business — U.S. Regulation — Insurance Regulation — Guaranty Associations and Similar Arrangements” in the 2010 Annual Report.     State insurance regulators and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to insurance companies and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the insurer and, thus, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.     Currently, the U.S. federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance. However, Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”) allows federal regulators to compel state insurance regulators to liquidate an insolvent insurer under some circumstances if the state regulators have not acted within a specific period. It also establishes the Federal Insurance Office which has the authority to participate in the negotiations of international insurance agreements with foreign regulators for the U.S., as well as to collect information about the insurance industry and recommend prudential standards.     Federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas can significantly and adversely affect insurance companies. These areas include financial services regulation, securities regulation, pension regulation, health care regulation, privacy, tort reform legislation and taxation. In addition, various forms of direct and indirect federal regulation of insurance have been proposed from time to time, including proposals for the establishment of an optional federal charter for insurance companies. Other aspects of our insurance operations could also be affected      172    Table of Contents    by Dodd-Frank. For example, Dodd-Frank imposes new restrictions on the ability of affiliates of insured depository institutions (such as MetLife Bank) to engage in proprietary trading or sponsor or invest in hedge funds or private equity funds. See “Risk Factors — Various Aspects of Dodd-Frank Could Impact Our Business Operations, Capital Requirements and Profitability and Limit Our Growth” in the 2010 Annual Report.     As a federally chartered national association, MetLife Bank is subject to a wide variety of banking laws, regulations and guidelines. Federal banking laws regulate most aspects of the business of MetLife Bank, but certain state laws may apply as well. MetLife Bank is principally regulated by the OCC, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”).     Federal banking laws and regulations address various aspects of MetLife Bank’s business and operations with respect to, among other things:              •   chartering to carry on business as a bank;         •   the permissibility of certain activities;         •   maintaining minimum capital ratios;         •   capital management in relation to the bank’s assets;         •   dividend payments;         •   safety and soundness standards;         •   loan loss and other related liabilities;         •   liquidity;         •   financial reporting and disclosure standards;         •   counterparty credit concentration;         •   restrictions on related party and affiliate transactions;         •   lending limits (and, in addition, Dodd-Frank includes the credit exposures arising from securities lending by MetLife Bank within lending limits otherwise applicable to loans);         •   payment of interest;         •   unfair or deceptive acts or practices;         •   privacy; and         •   relationships with MetLife, Inc. in its capacity as a bank holding company and potentially with other investors in connection with a change in control of MetLife Bank.       Federal and state banking regulators regularly re-examine existing laws and regulations applicable to banks and their products. Changes in these laws and regulations, or in interpretations thereof, are often made for the benefit of the consumer at the expense of the bank and, thus, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of MetLife Bank.     Since 2008, MetLife, through MetLife Bank, has significantly increased its mortgage servicing activities by acquiring servicing portfolios. Currently, MetLife Bank services approximately 1% of the aggregate principal amount of the mortgage loans serviced in the United States.     State and federal regulatory and law enforcement authorities have initiated various inquiries, investigations or examinations of alleged irregularities in the foreclosure practices of the residential mortgage servicing industry. Mortgage servicing practices have also been the subject of Congressional attention. Authorities have publicly stated that the scope of the investigations extends beyond foreclosure documentation practices to include mortgage loan modification and loss mitigation practices.     MetLife Bank’s mortgage servicing has been the subject of recent inquiries and requests by such authorities. MetLife Bank is cooperating with the authorities’ review of this business. On April 13, 2011, the OCC entered into consent decrees with several banks, including MetLife Bank. The consent decrees require an independent review of foreclosure practices and set forth new residential mortgage servicing standards, including a requirement for a      173    Table of Contents    designated point of contact for a borrower during the loss mitigation process. In addition, the Federal Reserve entered into consent decrees with the affiliated bank holding companies of these banks, including MetLife, Inc., to enhance the supervision of the mortgage servicing activities of their banking subsidiaries. Neither of the consent decrees includes monetary penalties. In a press release, the Federal Reserve stated that it plans to announce monetary penalties with respect to the consent orders. The OCC stated in its press release that the actions do not preclude assessment of civil monetary penalties, which the OCC is holding in abeyance. It is also possible that additional state or federal authorities may pursue similar investigations or make related inquiries.     These consent decrees, inquiries or investigations could adversely affect MetLife’s reputation or result in material fines, penalties, equitable remedies or other enforcement actions, and result in significant legal costs in responding to governmental investigations or other litigation. MetLife cannot predict the outcome of any such actions or reviews. In addition, the changes to the mortgage servicing business required by the consent decrees and the resolution of any other inquiries or investigations either specifically with respect to MetLife Bank or the mortgage servicing industry in general may affect the profitability of such business. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends.”     In addition, Dodd-Frank establishes a new Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection that supervises and regulates institutions providing certain financial products and services to consumers. Although the consumer financial services to which this legislation applies exclude insurance business of the kind in which we engage, the new Bureau has authority to regulate consumer services provided by MetLife Bank and non-insurance consumer services provided elsewhere throughout MetLife. Dodd-Frank established a statutory standard for Federal pre-emption of state consumer financial protection laws, which standard will require national banks to comply with many state consumer financial protection laws that previously were considered preempted by Federal law. As a result, the regulatory and compliance burden on MetLife Bank is likely to increase and could adversely affect its business and results of operations. Dodd-Frank also includes provisions on mortgage lending, anti-predatory lending and other regulatory and supervisory provisions that could impact the business and operations of MetLife Bank.     Dodd-Frank also authorizes the SEC to establish a standard of conduct applicable to brokers and dealers when providing personalized investment advice to retail and other customers. This standard of conduct would be to act in the best interest of the customer without regard to the financial or other interest of the broker or dealer providing the advice. See “Business — U.S. Regulation — Banking Regulation” and “Risk Factors — Changes in U.S. Federal and State Securities Laws and Regulations, and State Insurance Regulations Regarding Suitability of Annuity Product Sales, May Affect Our Operations and Our Profitability” in the 2010 Annual Report.     In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published capital standards referred to as “Basel III” for banks and bank holding companies, such as MetLife, Inc. Assuming regulators in the U.S. implement Basel III, it will require banks and bank holding companies to hold greater amounts of capital, to comply with requirements for short-term liquidity and to reduce reliance on short-term funding sources. See “Business — U.S. Regulation — Financial Holding Company Regulation — Capital” in the 2010 Annual Report and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends — Financial and Economic Environment”. It is not clear how these new requirements will compare to the enhanced prudential standards that may apply to us under Dodd-Frank. See “Risk Factors — Various Aspects of Dodd-Frank Could Impact Our Business Operations, Capital Requirements and Profitability and Limit Our Growth” in the 2010 Annual Report.     As a bank holding company, MetLife, Inc. may be restricted in its ability to pay dividends or repurchase common stock or other securities by the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which will need to approve our capital plans in connection with such activities. The ability of MetLife Bank and MetLife, Inc. to pay dividends could also be restricted by any additional capital requirements that might be imposed as a result of the enactment of Dodd-Frank and/or the implementation by the U.S. banking regulators of Basel III. In addition, as required by Dodd-Frank, effective July 21, 2011 all bank holding companies that have elected to be treated as financial holding companies, such as MetLife, Inc., will be required to be “well capitalized” and “well managed” as defined by the Federal Reserve Board, on a consolidated basis and not just at their depository institution(s). This would require that, among other things, MetLife, Inc. must maintain a total risk-based capital ratio and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 10% and 6%, on a consolidated basis, respectively. If we are unable to maintain these risk-based capital ratios, we could be subject to activity restrictions, ultimately be required      174    Table of Contents    to divest certain operations and be restricted in our ability to pay dividends or repurchase common stock. As of March 31, 2011, our total risk-based capital ratio was 8.69% and our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was 8.39%. See “Risk Factors — Various Aspects of Dodd-Frank Could Impact Our Business Operations, Capital Requirements and Profitability and Limit Our Growth” in the 2010 Annual Report.     The FDIC has the right to assess FDIC-insured banks for funds to help pay the obligations of insolvent banks to depositors. Because the amount and timing of an assessment is beyond our control, the liabilities that we have currently established for these potential liabilities may not be adequate. In addition, Dodd-Frank will result in increased assessment for banks with assets of $10.0 billion or more, which includes MetLife Bank.     Our international operations are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they operate, as described further under “Business — International Regulation” in the 2010 Annual Report. A significant portion of our revenues are generated through operations in foreign jurisdictions, including many countries in early stages of economic and political development. Our international operations may be materially adversely affected by foreign authorities and regulators, such as through nationalization or expropriation of assets, the imposition of limits on foreign ownership, changes in laws or their interpretation or application, political instability, dividend limitations, price controls, currency exchange controls or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which they operate or converting local currencies we hold to U.S. dollars or other currencies, as well as adverse actions by foreign governmental authorities and regulators. This may also impact many of our customers and independent sales intermediaries. Changes in the regulations that affect their operations also may affect our business relationships with them and their ability to purchase or distribute our products. Accordingly, these changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.     Our international operations are subject to local laws and regulations, and we expect the scope and extent of regulation outside of the U.S., as well as regulatory oversight, generally to continue to increase. The authority of our international operations to conduct business is subject to licensing requirements, permits and approvals, and these authorizations are subject to modification and revocation. The regulatory environment in the countries in which we operate and changes in laws could have a material adverse effect on us and our foreign operations. See “— Our International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks, Including Exposure to Local and Regional Economic Conditions, that Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our Profitability” and “Business — International Regulation” in the 2010 Annual Report.     Furthermore, the increase in our international operations as a result of the acquisition of ALICO may also subject us to increased supervision by the Federal Reserve Board, since the size of a bank holding company’s foreign activities is taken as an indication of the holding company’s complexity. It may also have an effect on the manner in which MetLife, Inc. is required to calculate its risk-based capital.     Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is time consuming and personnel-intensive, and changes in these laws and regulations may materially increase our direct and indirect compliance and other expenses of doing business, thus having a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.     From time to time, regulators raise issues during examinations or audits of MetLife, Inc.’s regulated subsidiaries that could, if determined adversely, have a material impact on us. We cannot predict whether or when regulatory actions may be taken that could adversely affect our operations. In addition, the interpretations of regulations by regulators may change and statutes may be enacted with retroactive impact, particularly in areas such as accounting or statutory reserve requirements. We are also subject to other regulations and may in the future become subject to additional regulations. See “Business — U.S. Regulation” and “Business — International Regulation” in the 2010 Annual Report.     The Issuance of Common Equity Units in Connection with the Acquisition Will Have a Dilutive Impact on MetLife, Inc.’s Stockholders     As part of the consideration paid to AM Holdings pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, MetLife, Inc. issued common equity units to AM Holdings, which consist of $3.0 billion aggregate stated amount of MetLife, Inc.’s common equity units, which initially consist of (x) purchase contracts obligating the holder to purchase a variable number of shares of MetLife, Inc.’s common stock on each of three specified future settlement dates (expected to occur on October 10, 2012, September 11, 2013 and October 8, 2014, subject to deferral under certain circumstances) for a fixed amount per purchase contract (an aggregate of $1.0 billion on each settlement      175    Table of Contents    date) (the “Stock Purchase Contracts”) and (y) an interest in each of three series of debt securities of MetLife, Inc. On March 8, 2011, AM Holdings sold all of the common equity units in a public offering. The aggregate amount of MetLife, Inc.’s common stock issuable upon settlement of the Stock Purchase Contracts is expected to be approximately 67.8 million to 84.7 million shares. As a result, more shares of common stock will be outstanding and each existing stockholder will own a smaller percentage of our common stock then outstanding.     Our International Operations Face Political, Legal, Operational and Other Risks, Including Exposure to Local and Regional Economic Conditions, That Could Negatively Affect Those Operations or Our Profitability     Our international operations face political, legal, operational and other risks that we do not face in our domestic operations. We face the risk of discriminatory regulation, nationalization or expropriation of assets, price controls and exchange controls or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which they operate or converting local currencies we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies. Some of our foreign insurance operations are, and are likely to continue to be, in emerging markets where these risks are heightened. See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” In addition, we rely on local sales forces in these countries and may encounter labor problems resulting from workers’ associations and trade unions in some countries. In several countries, including China and India, we operate with local business partners with the resulting risk of managing partner relationships to the business objectives. If our business model is not successful in a particular country, we may lose all or most of our investment in building and training the sales force in that country.     We are expanding our international operations in certain markets where we operate and in selected new markets. This may require considerable management time, as well as start-up expenses for market development before any significant revenues and earnings are generated. Operations in new foreign markets may achieve low margins or may be unprofitable, and expansion in existing markets may be affected by local economic and market conditions. Therefore, as we expand internationally, we may not achieve expected operating margins and our results of operations may be negatively impacted.     In addition, in recent years, the operating environment in Argentina has been very challenging. In Argentina, we were formerly principally engaged in the pension business. In December 2008, the Argentine government nationalized private pensions and seized the pension funds’ investments, eliminating the private pensions business in Argentina. As a result, we have experienced and will continue to experience reductions in the operation’s revenues and cash flows. The Argentine government now controls all assets which previously were managed by our Argentine pension operations. Further governmental or legal actions related to our operations in Argentina could negatively impact our operations in Argentina and result in future losses.     We also have operations in the Middle East where the legal and political systems and regulatory frameworks are subject to instability and disruptions. Lack of legal certainty and stability in the region exposes our operations to increased risk of disruption and to adverse or unpredictable actions by regulators and may make it more difficult for us to enforce our contracts, which may negatively impact our business in this region. See also “Risk Factors — Changes in Market Interest Rates May Significantly Affect Our Profitability” in the 2010 Annual Report regarding the impact of low interest rates on our Taiwanese operations.     We have market presence in over 60 different countries and increased exposure to risks posed by local and regional economic conditions. Europe has recently experienced a deep recession and countries such as Italy, Spain, Portugal and in particular, Greece and Ireland, have been particularly affected by the recession, resulting in increased national debts and depressed economic activity. We have significant operations and investments in these countries which could be adversely affected by economic developments such as higher taxes, growing inflation, decreasing government spending, rising unemployment and currency instability.     We face increased exposure to the Japanese markets as a result of our considerable presence there. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Industry Trends”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Japan”, and Note 13 of the Notes to the Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Japanese economy has been significantly negatively impacted by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami, and the resulting serious disruption to power supplies and release of radiation from a damaged nuclear power plant in northeastern Japan. The impact of these events is uncertain and difficult to predict. Deterioration in Japan’s      176    Table of Contents    economic recovery could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Weakening of the yen against the U.S. dollar will adversely affect the estimated fair value of our yen-denominated investments, our investments in Japan subsidiaries and our net income from operations in Japan. See “Risk Factors — Fluctuations in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates Could Negatively Affect Our Profitability” in the 2010 Annual Report. Changes in market interest rates may also have an adverse effect on our investments and operations in Japan. See “Risk Factors— Changes in Market Interest Rates May Significantly Affect Our Profitability” in the 2010 Annual Report.     State Laws, Federal Laws, Our Certificate of Incorporation and Our By-Laws May Delay, Deter or Prevent Takeovers and Business Combinations that Stockholders Might Consider in Their Best Interests     State laws and our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders might consider in their best interests. For instance, they may prevent stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of MetLife, Inc.’s common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of MetLife, Inc.’s common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.     Any person seeking to acquire a controlling interest in us would face various regulatory obstacles which may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders of MetLife, Inc. might consider in their best interests. First, the insurance laws and regulations of the various states in which MetLife, Inc.’s insurance subsidiaries are organized may delay or impede a business combination involving us. State insurance laws prohibit an entity from acquiring control of an insurance company without the prior approval of the domestic insurance regulator. Under most states’ statutes, an entity is presumed to have control of an insurance company if it owns, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting stock of that insurance company or its parent company. We are also subject to banking regulations, and may in the future become subject to additional regulations. Dodd-Frank contains provisions that could restrict or impede consolidation, mergers and acquisitions by systemically significant firms and/or large bank holding companies. See “Business — U.S. Regulation — Financial Holding Company Regulation — Change of Control and Restrictions on Mergers and Acquisitions” in the 2010 Annual Report. In addition, the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, would require approval by the contract owners of our variable contracts in order to effectuate a change of control of any affiliated investment adviser to a mutual fund underlying our variable contracts. Finally, Financial Industry Regulation Authority (“FINRA”) approval would be necessary for a change of control of any FINRA registered broker-dealer that is a direct or indirect subsidiary of MetLife, Inc.     In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may affect the ability of an “interested stockholder” to engage in certain business combinations, including mergers, consolidations or acquisitions of additional shares, for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder becomes an “interested stockholder.” An “interested stockholder” is defined to include persons owning, directly or indirectly, 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of a corporation.     MetLife, Inc.’s certificate of incorporation and by-laws also contain provisions that may delay, deter or prevent a takeover attempt that stockholders might consider in their best interests. These provisions may adversely affect prevailing market prices for MetLife, Inc.’s common stock and include: a prohibition on the calling of special meetings by stockholders; advance notice procedures for the nomination of candidates to the Board of Directors and stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings; and supermajority voting requirements for the amendment of certain provisions of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws.     177    Table of Contents          Item 2.
