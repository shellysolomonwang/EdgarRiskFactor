Item 1A. Risk Factors beginning on page 210.  U.K. Bank Levy   On June 22, 2010, the U.K. government announced that it intended to introduce an annual bank levy, commencing in 2011, payable on the consolidated liabilities, subject to certain exclusions and offsets, on U.K. group companies and U.K. branches of banking groups as of the end of each accounting period. On October 21, 2010, a first draft of potential legislation was released for comment with the intention that a final substantive draft of the legislation, along with the final rates, will be published later in the year. At this time it is not possible to quantify the impact of the revised proposals since the final basis and rate of the bank levy remain uncertain.  Investment in BlackRock, Inc.   On November 3, 2010, BlackRock, Inc. (BlackRock) filed a prospectus supplement with the SEC pursuant to which we are offering for sale through an underwritten offering up to 34.5 million shares of common stock (including shares of common stock issuable upon the automatic conversion of shares of Series B Convertible Participating Preferred Stock). The underwriters of the offering may also purchase, pursuant to a 30-day option, up to an additional 6.3 million shares of BlackRock common stock issuable upon the conversion of Series B Preferred Stock to cover any over-allotments. Such offering is consistent with the Corporation’s stated strategy to reduce its investment in non-core businesses to focus on its core businesses and strengthen capital ratios.  Troubled Asset Relief Program – Related Asset Sales   As previously disclosed, in connection with the approval we received to repurchase the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) preferred stock on December 9, 2009, the Corporation agreed to increase equity by $3.0 billion through net asset sales to be approved by the Federal Reserve. The Corporation has been active in selling assets generating approximately $10 billion in gross proceeds and approximately $1.9 billion in after-tax GAAP accounting gains toward the $3.0 billion target. To the extent the asset sales are not completed by December 31, 2010, the Corporation must raise a commensurate amount of common equity. We continue to pursue several potential asset sales that may reduce the remaining amount of additional capital required. In the event that there is a shortfall, it would be met by issuing equity awards of fully vested common stock to certain associates in lieu of a portion of their 2010 year-end cash incentive awards, which would be transferable by associates as soon as administratively practicable.  96    Table of Contents  Performance Overview   Net income (loss) was ($7.3) billion and ($994) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, compared to ($1.0) billion and $6.5 billion for the same periods in 2009. After preferred stock dividends and accretion, net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders was ($7.6) billion, or ($0.77) per diluted common share, and ($2.0) billion, or ($0.21) per diluted common share, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to ($2.2) billion, or ($0.26) per diluted common share, and $3.0 billion, or $0.39 per diluted common share, for the same periods in 2009. Excluding the $10.4 billion goodwill impairment charge, net income was $3.1 billion and $9.4 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010. After preferred stock dividends and accretion, net income applicable to common shareholders, excluding the goodwill impairment charge, was $2.8 billion, or $0.27 per diluted common share, and $8.4 billion, or $0.82 per diluted common share, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010. Revenue, net of interest expense on a FTE basis increased (decreased) $617 million to $27.0 billion and ($6.8) billion to $88.7 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, representing a two percent increase and a seven percent decrease from the same periods in 2009. FTE basis, net income excluding the goodwill impairment charge, and net income applicable to common shareholders excluding the goodwill impairment charge are non-GAAP measures. For corresponding reconciliations to GAAP financial measures, see Supplemental Financial Data beginning on page 107.   Net interest income on a FTE basis increased $964 million to $12.7 billion and $3.5 billion to $40.0 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009. The increases were driven by the impact of adoption of the new consolidation guidance and improved deposit pricing, partially offset by lower commercial and consumer loan levels and lower rates on the core assets and trading book. Net interest yield on a FTE basis increased 11 basis points (bps) to 2.72 percent and 16 bps to 2.81 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009, due to the factors noted above.   Noninterest income decreased $347 million to $14.3 billion and $10.3 billion to $48.7 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009. Lower equity investment income, gains on sales of debt securities, trading account profits, and service charges partially offset by an increase in other income and a decrease in net impairment losses recognized in earnings on available-for-sale debt securities, drove the decline in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in the prior year.   The provision for credit losses decreased $6.3 billion to $5.4 billion and $15.2 billion to $23.3 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009. The provision for credit losses was $1.8 billion and $4.2 billion lower than net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, resulting from a reduction in the allowance for loan and lease losses. The reserve reductions in both periods were primarily due to improved delinquencies and collections, lower bankruptcies in the domestic credit card, consumer lending and small business portfolios and improved credit profiles in the commercial portfolios. In addition, the reserve reduction for the three months ended September 30, 2010 was also due to improvement in portfolio trends within the consumer real estate portfolios. The reserve reduction for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was partially offset by reserve additions in the consumer real estate portfolios during the first half of the year amid continued stress in the housing market, which included reserve additions for purchased credit-impaired consumer portfolios obtained through acquisitions.   Noninterest expense increased $10.9 billion to $27.2 billion and $11.9 billion to $62.2 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009. The increases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 were driven by the $10.4 billion goodwill impairment charge. Excluding the goodwill impairment charge, noninterest expense increased $510 million and $1.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2010 was driven by higher personnel costs and professional fees compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was partially offset by declines in pre-tax merger and restructuring charges compared to the prior year. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was driven by higher personnel costs due in part to the U.K. payroll tax on certain year-end incentive payments and the same reasons as described above, partially offset by higher Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) expense, including a special assessment of $724 million, in 2009.  97    Table of Contents  Segment Results   Effective January 1, 2010, management realigned the former Global Banking and Global Markets business segments into Global Commercial Banking and GBAM. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These changes did not have an impact on the previously reported consolidated results of the Corporation.

For more information on this measure and a corresponding reconciliation to a GAAP financial measure, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 107.   (2)   For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009, Global Card Services is presented on a managed basis with a corresponding offset recorded in All Other. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, Global Card Services and All Other are presented in accordance with new consolidation guidance. Accordingly, current period Global Card Services results are comparable to prior period results that are presented on a managed basis. For more information on the new consolidation guidance, see Note 8 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For more information on the reconciliation of Global Card Services and All Other, see Note 17 – Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.     Deposits net income decreased from comparable periods in the prior year due to decreases in revenue and higher noninterest expense. The revenue decline was driven by the impact of Regulation E and related overdraft policy changes. Net interest income increased as a result of disciplined pricing and a customer shift to more liquid products, partially offset by a lower residual net interest income allocation related to asset and liability management (ALM) activities. Noninterest expense increased as a higher proportion of banking center sales and service costs were aligned to Deposits from the other consumer businesses.   Global Card Services net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 increased compared to the same periods in the prior year due primarily to the $10.4 billion goodwill impairment charge. Revenue decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2010, compared to the same period in the prior year driven by lower average loans, reduced interest and fee income primarily resulting from the implementation of the CARD Act and the impact of recording a $592 million reserve related to future payment protection insurance claims in the U.K. Provision for credit losses decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2010, from the same period in the prior year driven by lower charge-offs and reserve reductions due to lower delinquencies and decreasing bankruptcies as a result of an improved economic environment. Revenue and provision for credit losses decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in the prior year for the same reasons discussed above; however, the revenue decrease was partially offset by the gain on sale of our MasterCard equity holdings during the three months ended June 30, 2010. Excluding the goodwill impairment charge, noninterest expense decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, compared to the same periods in the prior year as a higher proportion of banking center sales and service costs were aligned to Deposits from Global Card Services.   Home Loans & Insurance net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2010 decreased compared to the same period in the prior year as the provision for credit losses decreased due to lower net charge-offs and reserve reductions driven by improving portfolio trends. In addition, revenue increased as a result of higher mortgage banking income driven by improved mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) results, net of hedges, and higher production income due mainly to higher production margins. These increases were partially offset by higher representations and warranties expense. Noninterest expense was flat as lower production and insurance expenses were offset by higher costs related to the increase in default management staff and other loss mitigation activities. The net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 increased compared to the year ago period as revenue decreased as a result  98    Table of Contents  of lower mortgage banking income driven by higher representations and warranties expense combined with lower loan production volume resulting from declines in market demand for refinances and less favorable MSR results, net of hedges. The provision for credit losses decreased driven by lower reserve additions for the reasons discussed above. Noninterest expense increased for the reasons discussed above combined with higher litigation costs.   Global Commercial Banking net income increased from comparable periods in the prior year due to lower credit costs. Revenue was negatively impacted by a lower residual net interest income allocation related to ALM activities and, to a lesser extent, declines in net interest income from lower average loan balances. These were partially offset by improved loan spreads on new, renewed and amended facilities. In addition, revenue was positively impacted by strong deposit growth as clients remained very liquid. The provision for credit losses decreased driven by reserve reductions reflecting the stabilization of appraised values primarily in the homebuilder portfolio and lower net charge-offs in the commercial real estate portfolio.   GBAM net income decreased from comparable periods in the prior year due to decreased sales and trading revenue, partially offset by credit valuation gains on derivative liabilities compared to losses in the prior year and gains on legacy assets compared to losses in the prior year. Revenue was negatively impacted by lower spreads on trading-related assets and lower average loans and leases. Noninterest expense increased driven by the recognition of expense on a proportionately larger amount of prior year incentive deferrals. Provision for credit losses declined driven by lower charge-offs and reserve reductions. Net income decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to the prior year pre-tax gain related to the contribution of the merchant processing business to the joint venture.   GWIM net income increased from comparable periods in the prior year driven by lower credit costs and higher noninterest income, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Revenue increased compared to the prior year driven by higher asset management fees and the absence of support for certain cash funds, partially offset by lower brokerage income. The provision for credit losses decreased compared to the prior year driven by improvement in the commercial domestic portfolio due to improved borrower credit profiles and improvement in the consumer real estate portfolio. Noninterest expense increased from comparable periods in the prior year due primarily to higher revenue related expenses, personnel costs and support costs.   All Other reported net income for the three months ended September 30, 2010 compared to a net loss for the same period in the prior year driven primarily by a significantly lower provision for credit losses and also lower noninterest expense. The decrease in the provision for credit losses was mainly due to reserve reductions in the residential mortgage portfolio due to improving portfolio trends as compared to reserve additions in the same period in the prior year. In addition, the provision benefited from a lower reserve addition in the Countrywide purchased credit-impaired discontinued real estate portfolio compared to reserve additions due to credit deterioration in the same period in 2009. Net income decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to the pre-tax gain resulting from sales of shares in China Construction Bank (CCB).  99    Table of Contents      Financial Highlights  Net Interest Income   Net interest income on a FTE basis increased $964 million to $12.7 billion and $3.5 billion to $40.0 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009. The increase was due to the impact of adoption of new consolidation guidance which contributed $2.6 billion and $8.1 billion to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 and due to deposit pricing. The increase was partially offset by lower commercial and consumer loan levels, the sale of First Republic Bank (First Republic) and lower rates on the core assets and trading book. The net interest yield on a FTE basis increased 11 bps to 2.72 percent and 16 bps to 2.81 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009 due to the factors stated above.

The following items highlight the significant changes.       •   Card income increased $425 million for the three months ended September 30, 2010 driven by the impact of the new consolidation guidance and higher interchange income from increased consumer spending partially offset by the implementation of the CARD Act. Card income decreased $590 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 due to the provisions of the CARD Act and the absence of certain fee income resulting from the sale of our merchant processing business to a joint venture in 2009, partially offset by the impact of the new consolidation guidance and higher interchange income.        •   Service charges decreased $808 million and $928 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 largely due to the impact of Regulation E, which became effective in the third quarter of 2010 and the impact of our overdraft policy changes announced in 2009.        •   Equity investment income decreased $486 million for the three months ended September 30, 2010 driven by a decrease in Global Principal Investments revenue. Equity investment income decreased by $4.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, as the benefits of the $1.2 billion pre-tax gain on the sale of our investment in Itaú Unibanco and valuation adjustments of $1.4 billion in Global Principal Investments revenue were less than the $7.3 billion pre-tax gain related to the sale of CCB shares during the same period in 2009.        •   Trading account profits decreased $799 million and $1.7 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 due to more favorable market conditions in the prior year and a lack of liquidity in 2010 as sovereign debt fears and regulatory uncertainty    100    Table of Contents          fueled investor concerns. We recorded net credit valuation gains on derivatives of $162 million and $44 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to $382 million and $967 million for the same periods in the prior year.        •   Mortgage banking income increased $457 million for the three months ended September 30, 2010 due to higher production margins and more favorable MSR results, net of hedges, partially offset by an increase in representations and warranties expense. Mortgage banking income decreased $3.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 due to an increase in representations and warranties expense and lower production income, volume and margins. The decline in servicing income for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in the prior year was also due to less favorable MSR results, net of hedges.        •   Insurance income decreased $632 million and $589 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 due to a liability recorded related to payment protection insurance sold in the U.K.        •   Gains on sales of debt securities decreased $671 million and $2.0 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 driven by lower volumes of sales of debt securities. The decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 also included the impact of losses in the second quarter of 2010 related to portfolio restructuring activities.        •   Other income increased by $1.6 billion for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 due to increased credit valuation adjustments recorded on our structured liabilities compared to the same periods in the prior year.        •   Impairment losses recognized in earnings on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities decreased $674 million and $1.3 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 reflecting lower impairment write-downs on non-agency RMBS and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).    Provision for Credit Losses   The provision for credit losses decreased $6.3 billion to $5.4 billion and $15.2 billion to $23.3 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009. The provision for credit losses was $1.8 billion and $4.2 billion lower than net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009, resulting in a reduction in the allowance for loan and lease losses. The decreases in the provision for credit losses for both the three and nine month periods were driven by lower net charge-offs and reserve reductions due to lower bankruptcies and delinquencies in both the consumer and commercial portfolios.   The provision for credit losses related to our consumer portfolio decreased $3.7 billion to $4.8 billion and $9.2 billion to $20.2 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, compared to the same periods in 2009. The provision for credit losses related to our commercial portfolio including the provision for unfunded lending commitments decreased $2.6 billion to $594 million and $6.0 billion to $3.1 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009.   Net charge-offs totaled $7.2 billion, or 3.07 percent and $27.6 billion, or 3.84 percent of average loans and leases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared with $9.6 billion, or 4.13 percent and $25.3 billion, or 3.53 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2009.

The increases were driven by the $10.4 goodwill impairment charge. Excluding the goodwill impairment charge, noninterest expense increased $510 million and $1.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009. The increases for the three months ended September 30, 2010 were driven by higher personnel costs, higher professional and litigation costs, compared to the same period in the prior year. These increases were partially offset by declines in pre-tax merger and restructuring charges compared to the prior year. The increases for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 were driven by higher personnel costs due in part to the U.K. payroll tax on certain year-end incentive payments and the same reasons as described above, partially offset by higher FDIC expense including a special assessment of $724 million in 2009.  Income Tax Expense   Income tax expense was $1.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2010 compared to a benefit of $975 million for the same period in 2009. Income tax expense was $3.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to a benefit of $691 million for the same period in 2009. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 are not meaningful due to the impact of the non-deductible $10.4 billion goodwill impairment charge.   The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 excluding the goodwill impairment charge from pre-tax income were 30.9 percent and 25.8 percent. The increase in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, as compared to (12.0) percent for the comparable 2009 period was driven by the change in the U.K. corporate tax rate, as described below, as well as permanent tax preferences (e.g., tax-exempt income and tax credits) and the release of $473 million of a valuation allowance provided for acquired capital loss carryforward tax benefits which together offset a lower percentage of pre-tax income than similar items offset during the comparative 2009 period. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2009 was calculated on a pre-tax loss.   On July 27, 2010, the U.K. government enacted a law change reducing the corporate income tax rate by one percent effective for the 2011 U.K. tax financial year beginning on April 1, 2011. This reduction favorably affects income tax expense on future U.K. earnings, but also required us to revalue our U.K. net deferred tax assets using the lower tax rate. The U.K. corporate tax rate reduction resulted in an income tax charge of $388 million during the three months ended September 30, 2010. If future rate reductions were to be enacted as suggested in U.K. Treasury announcements and assuming no change in the deferred tax asset balance, a similar charge to income tax expense for each one percent reduction in the rate would result in each period of enactment.  102    Table of Contents     Balance Sheet Analysis                                                          Table 5     Selected Balance Sheet Data                       Average Balance         September 30   December 31   Three Months EndedSeptember 30   Nine Months EndedSeptember 30    (Dollars in millions)   2010   2009   2010   2009   2010   2009         Assets                                                   Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell   $ 271,818     $ 189,933     $ 254,820     $ 223,039     $ 261,444     $ 232,680     Trading account assets     207,695       182,206       210,529       212,488       212,985       216,462     Debt securities     322,862       311,441       328,097       263,712       317,906       268,291     Loans and leases     933,910       900,128       934,860       930,255       964,302       963,260     All other assets (1)     603,375       646,524       651,091       768,707       706,333       766,434         Total assets   $ 2,339,660     $ 2,230,232     $ 2,379,397     $ 2,398,201     $ 2,462,970     $ 2,447,127         Liabilities                                                   Deposits   $ 977,322     $ 991,611     $ 973,846     $ 989,295     $ 982,132     $ 976,182     Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase     296,605       255,185       318,368       352,083       372,311       370,389     Trading account liabilities     90,010       65,432       95,265       73,290       95,159       68,530     Commercial paper and other short-term borrowings     64,818       69,524       72,780       58,980       78,437       131,096     Long-term debt     478,858       438,521       485,588       449,974       498,794       447,038     All other liabilities     201,552       178,515       199,572       218,596       203,679       211,254         Total liabilities     2,109,165       1,998,788       2,145,419       2,142,218       2,230,512       2,204,489     Shareholders’ equity     230,495       231,444       233,978       255,983       232,458       242,638         Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity   $ 2,339,660     $ 2,230,232     $ 2,379,397     $ 2,398,201     $ 2,462,970     $ 2,447,127                   (1)   All other assets is presented net of allowance for loan and lease losses for the period-end and average balances.    Impact of Adopting New Consolidation Guidance   On January 1, 2010, the Corporation adopted new consolidation guidance resulting in the consolidation of certain former qualifying special purpose entities and VIEs that were not recorded on the Corporation’s Consolidated Balance Sheet prior to that date. The adoption of this new consolidation guidance resulted in a net incremental increase in assets of $100.4 billion, including $69.7 billion resulting from consolidation of credit card trusts and $30.7 billion from consolidation of other special purpose entities including multi-seller conduits, and a net increase of $106.7 billion in total liabilities, including $84.4 billion of long-term debt. These amounts are net of retained interests in securitizations held on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2009 and a $10.8 billion increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses, the majority of which relates to credit card receivables. The Corporation recorded a $6.2 billion charge, net of tax, to retained earnings on January 1, 2010 for the cumulative effect of the adoption of this new consolidation guidance due primarily to the increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses, and a $116 million charge to accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI). The initial recording of these assets, related allowance for loan and lease losses and liabilities on the Corporation’s Consolidated Balance Sheet had no impact at the date of adoption on consolidated results of operations. For additional detail on the impact of adopting this new consolidation guidance, refer to Note 8 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Assets   At September 30, 2010, total assets were $2.3 trillion, an increase of $109.4 billion from December 31, 2009. Changes from year end were attributable to the impact of adopting new consolidation guidance which increased loan balances, primarily in the credit card, commercial – domestic and home equity portfolios, partially offset by an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses. In addition, changes were driven by an increase in federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell driven by a favorable rate environment. Trading account assets increased as a result of the new consolidation guidance. The increase in total assets was partially offset by lower loan balances due to the sale of First Republic and due to other assets impacted by the sale of strategic investments, and the impairment of goodwill.   Average total assets decreased $18.8 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. The decrease was due to a decline in cash and cash equivalents, other assets and commercial loans and was partially offset by adopting new consolidation guidance, increases in debt securities driven by prior year reductions in the ALM portfolio, and increases in federal funds sold, securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell.  103    Table of Contents   Average total assets increased $15.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. The increase was due to adopting new consolidation guidance, increases in debt securities and in federal funds sold, securities borrowed and purchased under agreements to resell and was partially offset by lower commercial loans and other assets.  Liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity   Total liabilities increased $110.4 billion to $2.1 trillion at September 30, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009. The increase in total liabilities was attributable to the impact of adopting new consolidation guidance which increased long-term debt and short-term borrowings. In addition, liabilities increased due to higher federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase due to a favorable rate environment. Changes in trading account liabilities reflected trading activity in fixed-income securities. All other liabilities increased due in part to foreign currency exchange rates.   Average total liabilities increased $3.2 billion and $26.0 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009. The increases were due to adopting new consolidation guidance which impacted long-term debt, and increases in trading account liabilities and noninterest-bearing deposits. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other liabilities.   Shareholders’ equity decreased $949 million to $230.5 billion at September 30, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009. The decrease was driven primarily by the goodwill impairment charge of $10.4 billion and the impact of adopting new consolidation guidance as we recorded a $6.2 billion charge to retained earnings due primarily to the increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses for newly consolidated loans.   Average shareholders’ equity decreased $22.0 billion and $10.2 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, compared to the same periods in 2009 driven by the TARP repayment, the goodwill impairment charge, and the impact of adopting new consolidation guidance, partially offset by an increase in accumulated OCI due to the addition this quarter of the unrealized gain on our investment in CCB.   Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management functions, primarily involving our portfolios of highly liquid assets, that are designed to ensure the adequacy of capital while enhancing our ability to manage liquidity requirements for the Corporation and for our customers, and to position the balance sheet in accordance with the Corporation’s risk appetite. The execution of these functions requires the use of balance sheet and capital-related limits including spot, average and risk-weighted asset limits, particularly in our trading businesses. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated based on adjusted quarterly average total assets.  104    Table of Contents                                                   Table 6    Selected Quarterly

Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently.   We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses (i.e., efficiency ratio and net interest yield) on a FTE basis. Although these are non-GAAP measures, we believe managing the business with net interest income on a FTE basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.   As mentioned above, certain performance measures including the efficiency ratio and net interest yield utilize net interest income (and thus total revenue) on a FTE basis. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield evaluates how many bps we are earning over the cost of funds. During our annual planning process, we set efficiency targets for the Corporation and each line of business. We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures provide additional clarity in assessing our results. Targets vary by year and by business and are based on a variety of factors including maturity of the business, competitive environment, market factors, and other items including our risk appetite.   We also evaluate our business based on the following ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP measure. Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of common shareholders’ equity plus any Common Equivalent Securities (CES) less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTE measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of average shareholders’ equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible common equity ratio represents common shareholders’ equity plus any CES less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible equity ratio represents total shareholders’ equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents ending common shareholders’ equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity (i.e., capital). In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use ROTE as key measures to support our overall growth goals. Also, earnings and diluted earnings per common share, the efficiency ratio, return on average assets, return on average common shareholders’ equity, return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity and ROTE have been calculated excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge of $10.4 billion recorded during the third quarter of 2010. We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation.   The aforementioned performance measures and ratios are presented in Tables 6 and 7 and performance measures and ratios excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge are presented in Tables 8 and 9.  107    Table of Contents                                                   Table 8    Quarterly Supplemental Financial Data and Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures       2010 Quarters   2009 Quarters    (Dollars in millions, except per share information)   Third   Second   First   Fourth   Third         Fully taxable-equivalent basis data                                           Net interest income   $ 12,717     $ 13,197     $ 14,070     $ 11,896     $ 11,753     Total revenue, net of interest expense     26,982       29,450       32,290       25,413       26,365     Net interest yield (1)     2.72  %     2.77  %     2.93  %     2.62  %     2.61  %   Efficiency ratio     100.87       58.58       55.05       64.47       61.84         Performance ratios, excluding goodwill impairment charge (2)                                           Per common share information                                           Earnings   $ 0.27                                     Diluted earnings     0.27                                     Efficiency ratio     62.33  %                                   Return on average assets     0.52                                     Return on average common shareholders’ equity     5.06                                     Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity     9.77                                     Return on average tangible shareholders’ equity     8.54                                         Reconciliation of net interest income to net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis                                           Net interest income   $ 12,435     $ 12,900     $ 13,749     $ 11,559     $ 11,423     Fully taxable-equivalent adjustment     282       297       321       337       330         Net interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent basis   $ 12,717     $ 13,197     $ 14,070     $ 11,896     $ 11,753         Reconciliation of total revenue, net of interest expense to total revenue, net of interest expense on a fully taxable-equivalent basis                                           Total revenue, net of interest expense   $ 26,700     $ 29,153     $ 31,969     $ 25,076     $ 26,035     Fully taxable-equivalent adjustment     282       297       321       337       330         Total revenue, net of interest expense on a fully taxable-equivalent basis   $ 26,982     $ 29,450     $ 32,290     $ 25,413     $ 26,365         Reconciliation of total noninterest expense to total noninterest expense, excluding goodwill impairment charge                                           Total noninterest expense   $ 27,216     $ 17,253     $ 17,775     $ 16,385     $ 16,306     Goodwill impairment     (10,400 )     -       -       -       -         Total noninterest expense, excluding goodwill impairment charge   $ 16,816     $ 17,253     $ 17,775     $ 16,385     $ 16,306         Reconciliation of income tax expense (benefit) to income tax expense (benefit) on a fully taxable-equivalent basis                                           Income tax expense (benefit)   $ 1,387     $ 672     $ 1,207     $ (1,225 )   $ (975 )   Fully taxable-equivalent adjustment     282       297       321       337       330         Income tax expense (benefit) on a fully taxable-equivalent basis   $ 1,669     $ 969     $ 1,528     $ (888 )   $ (645 )       Reconciliation of net income (loss) to net income (loss), excluding goodwill impairment charge                                           Net income (loss)   $ (7,299 )   $ 3,123     $ 3,182     $ (194 )   $ (1,001 )   Goodwill impairment     10,400       -       -       -       -         Net income (loss), excluding goodwill impairment charge   $ 3,101     $ 3,123     $ 3,182     $ (194 )   $ (1,001 )       Reconciliation of net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders to net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders, excluding goodwill impairment charge                                           Net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders   $ (7,647 )   $ 2,783     $ 2,834     $ (5,196 )   $ (2,241 )   Goodwill impairment     10,400       -       -       -       -         Net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders, excluding goodwill impairment charge   $ 2,753     $ 2,783     $ 2,834     $ (5,196 )   $ (2,241 )                 (1)   Calculation includes fees earned on overnight deposits placed with the Federal Reserve of $107 million, $106 million and $92 million for the third, second and first quarters of 2010, and $130 million and $107 million for the fourth and third quarters of 2009, respectively.

As discussed in the GBAM business segment section beginning on page 129, we evaluate our market-based results and strategies on a total market-based revenue approach by combining net interest income and noninterest income for GBAM. In addition, the 2009 periods are presented on a managed basis which adjusted for loans that we originated and subsequently sold into credit card securitizations. Noninterest income, rather than net interest income and provision for credit losses, was recorded for securitized assets as we are compensated for servicing the securitized assets and recorded servicing income and gains or losses on securitizations, where appropriate. The 2010 periods are presented in accordance with new consolidation guidance. An analysis of core net interest income, core average earning assets and core net interest yield on earning assets, which adjusts for the impact of these two non-core items from reported net interest income on a FTE basis, is shown below. We believe the use of this non-GAAP presentation provides additional clarity in assessing our results.

(6)   Represents average securitized loans less accrued interest receivable and certain securitized bonds retained.     (7)   Calculated on an annualized basis.     n/a = not applicable     For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, core net interest income decreased $1.3 billion to $11.7 billion and $3.1 billion to $36.7 billion compared to core net interest income on a managed basis of $12.9 billion and $39.8 billion for the same periods in 2009. The decrease was driven by lower loan levels compared to managed loan levels for the same periods in 2009, and lower yields for the discretionary and credit card portfolios. These impacts were partially offset by lower rates on deposits.   For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, core average earning assets decreased $33.8 billion to $1.4 trillion and $57.8 billion to $1.4 trillion compared to core average earning assets on a managed basis of $1.4 trillion for both of the same periods in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to lower commercial loan levels and lower consumer loan levels compared to managed consumer loan levels. The impact was partially offset by increased investment securities levels for the same periods in 2009.   For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, core net interest yield decreased 28 bps to 3.39 percent and 14 bps to 3.53 percent compared to core net interest yield on a managed basis of 3.67 percent for both of the same periods in 2009 due to the factors noted above.  111    Table of Contents                                                           Table 11    Quarterly Average Balances and Interest Rates – FTE Basis       Third Quarter 2010   Second Quarter 2010               Interest                   Interest           Average   Income/   Yield/   Average   Income/   Yield/    (Dollars in millions)   Balance   Expense   Rate   Balance   Expense   Rate         Earning assets                                                   Time deposits placed and other short-term investments (1)   $ 23,233     $ 86       1.45  %   $ 30,741     $ 70       0.93  %   Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell     254,820       441       0.69       263,564       457       0.70     Trading account assets     210,529       1,692       3.20       213,927       1,853       3.47     Debt securities (2)     328,097       2,646       3.22       314,299       2,966       3.78     Loans and leases (3):                                                   Residential mortgage (4)     237,292       2,797       4.71       247,715       2,982       4.82     Home equity     143,083       1,457       4.05       148,219       1,537       4.15     Discontinued real estate     13,632       122       3.56       13,972       134       3.84     Credit card – domestic     115,251       3,113       10.72       118,738       3,121       10.54     Credit card – foreign     27,047       875       12.84       27,706       854       12.37     Direct/Indirect consumer (5)     95,692       1,130       4.68       98,549       1,233       5.02     Other consumer (6)     2,955       47       6.35       2,958       46       6.32                             Total consumer     634,952       9,541       5.98       657,857       9,907       6.03                             Commercial – domestic     192,306       2,040       4.21       195,144       2,005       4.12     Commercial real estate (7)     55,660       452       3.22       64,218       541       3.38     Commercial lease financing     21,402       255       4.78       21,271       261       4.90     Commercial – foreign     30,540       282       3.67       28,564       256       3.59                             Total commercial     299,908       3,029       4.01       309,197       3,063       3.97                             Total loans and leases     934,860       12,570       5.35       967,054       12,970       5.38                             Other earning assets     112,280       949       3.36       121,205       994       3.29                             Total earning assets (8)     1,863,819       18,384       3.93       1,910,790       19,310       4.05               Cash and cash equivalents (1)     155,784       107               209,686       106             Other assets, less allowance for loan and lease losses     359,794                       373,956                               Total assets   $ 2,379,397                     $ 2,494,432                                   (1)   Fees earned on overnight deposits placed with the Federal Reserve, which were included in the time deposits placed and other short-term investments line in prior periods, have been reclassified to cash and cash equivalents, consistent with the balance sheet presentation of these deposits. Net interest income and net interest yield in the table are calculated excluding these fees.     (2)   Yields on AFS debt securities are calculated based on fair value rather than the cost basis. The use of fair value does not have a material impact on net interest yield.     (3)   Nonperforming loans are included in the respective average loan balances. Income on these nonperforming loans is recognized on a cash basis. Purchased credit-impaired loans were written down to fair value upon acquisition and accrete interest income over the remaining life of the loan.     (4)   Includes foreign residential mortgage loans of $502 million, $506 million and $538 million in the third, second and first quarters of 2010, and $550 million and $662 million in the fourth and third quarters of 2009, respectively.     (5)   Includes foreign consumer loans of $7.7 billion, $7.7 billion and $8.1 billion in the third, second and first quarters of 2010, and $8.6 billion and $8.4 billion in the fourth and third quarters of 2009, respectively.     (6)   Includes consumer finance loans of $2.0 billion, $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion in the third, second and first quarters of 2010, and $2.3 billion and $2.4 billion in the fourth and third quarters of 2009, respectively; other foreign consumer loans of $788 million, $679 million and $664 million in the third, second and first quarters of 2010, and $689 million and $700 million in the fourth and third quarters of 2009, respectively; and consumer overdrafts of $123 million, $155 million and $132 million in the third, second and first quarters of 2010, and $192 million and $243 million in the fourth and third quarters of 2009, respectively.     (7)   Includes domestic commercial real estate loans of $53.1 billion, $61.6 billion and $65.6 billion in the third, second and first quarters of 2010, and $68.2 billion and $70.7 billion in the fourth and third quarters of 2009, respectively; and foreign commercial real estate loans of $2.5 billion, $2.6 billion and $3.0 billion in the third, second and first quarters of 2010, and $3.1 billion and $3.6 billion in the fourth and third quarters of 2009, respectively.     (8)   Interest income includes the impact of interest rate risk management contracts, which decreased interest income on the underlying assets by $643 million, $479 million and $272 million in the third, second and first quarters of 2010, and $248 million and $136 million in the fourth and third quarters of 2009, respectively. Interest expense includes the impact of interest rate risk management contracts, which decreased interest expense on the underlying liabilities by $1.0 billion, $829 million and $970 million in the third, second and first quarters of 2010, and $1.1 billion and $873 million in the fourth and third quarters of 2009, respectively.

     (1)   Fees earned on overnight deposits placed with the Federal Reserve, which were included in the time deposits placed and other short-term investments line in prior periods, have been reclassified in this table to cash and cash equivalents, consistent with the balance sheet presentation of these deposits. Net interest income and net interest yield are calculated excluding these fees.     (2)   Yields on AFS debt securities are calculated based on fair value rather than the cost basis. The use of fair value does not have a material impact on net interest yield.     (3)   Nonperforming loans are included in the respective average loan balances. Income on these nonperforming loans is recognized on a cash basis. Purchased credit-impaired loans were written down to fair value upon acquisition and accrete interest income over the remaining life of the loan.     (4)   Includes foreign residential mortgages of $515 million and $647 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009.

(7)   Includes domestic commercial real estate loans of $60.1 billion and $71.5 billion, and foreign commercial real estate loans of $2.7 billion and $2.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009.     (8)   Interest income includes the impact of interest rate risk management contracts, which decreased interest income on the underlying assets $1.4 billion and $208 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009. Interest expense includes the impact of interest rate risk management contracts, which decreased interest expense on the underlying liabilities $2.8 billion and $1.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009.

Effective January 1, 2010, we realigned the Global Corporate and Investment Banking portion of the former Global Banking segment with the former Global Markets business segment to form GBAM and to reflect Global Commercial Banking as a standalone segment. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.   We prepare and evaluate segment results using certain non-GAAP methodologies and performance measures, many of which are discussed in Supplemental Financial Data beginning on page 107. We begin by evaluating the operating results of the segments which by definition exclude merger and restructuring charges. The segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies which are utilized to determine net income. The net interest income of the business segments includes the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics.   Equity is allocated to business segments and related businesses using a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment’s credit, market, interest rate, strategic and operational risk components. The nature of these risks is discussed further beginning on page 145. The Corporation benefits from the diversification of risk across these components which is reflected as a reduction to allocated equity for each segment. The total amount of average equity reflects both risk-based capital and the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the business segments.

Deposits includes the results of consumer deposit activities which consist of a comprehensive range of products provided to consumers and small businesses. In addition, Deposits includes an allocation of ALM activities. In the U.S., we serve approximately 57 million consumer and small business relationships through a franchise that stretches coast to coast through 32 states and the District of Columbia utilizing our network of 5,900 banking centers, 18,000 ATMs, nationwide call centers and leading online and mobile banking platforms.   Our deposit products include traditional savings accounts, money market savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, and noninterest- and interest-bearing checking accounts. Deposit products provide a relatively stable source of funding and liquidity. We earn net interest spread revenue from investing this liquidity in earning assets through client-facing lending and ALM activities. The revenue is allocated to the deposit products using our funds transfer pricing process which takes into account the interest rates and maturity characteristics of the deposits. Deposits also generates fees such as account service fees, non-sufficient funds fees, overdraft charges and ATM fees.   In the fourth quarter of 2009, we implemented changes in our overdraft fee policies which have negatively impacted revenue. These changes were intended to help customers limit overdraft fees. In addition, amendments to Regulation E became effective July 1, 2010 for new customers and August 16, 2010 for existing customers. These rules partially impacted the third quarter of 2010 and will have a full impact beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010. For more information on Regulation E, see Regulatory Matters beginning on page 143.  119    Table of Contents   At September 30, 2010, our active online banking customer base was 29.3 million subscribers, an increase of approximately 100 thousand from the same period in 2009 and our active bill pay users paid $227.5 billion of bills online during the nine months ended September 30, 2010, which is in line with the year-ago period.   Deposits includes the net impact of migrating customers and their related deposit balances between GWIM and Deposits. For more information on the migration of customer balances, see GWIM beginning on page 134.  Three Months Ended September 30, 2010 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2009   Net income fell $619 million, or 76 percent, to $195 million from lower revenue and higher noninterest expense. The revenue decline was driven by the impact of Regulation E and related overdraft fee policy changes. Net interest income increased $196 million, or 11 percent, to $1.9 billion as a result of disciplined pricing and a customer shift to more liquid products, partially offset by a lower residual net interest income allocation related to ALM activities. Average deposits declined $10.4 billion from a year ago as organic growth was more than offset by the decline in higher-yielding Countrywide deposits and the transfer of certain deposits to other client-managed businesses.   Noninterest income fell $768 million, or 40 percent, to $1.1 billion. The decline in service charges is primarily due to the implementation of Regulation E and the impact of overdraft fee policy changes. The impact of Regulation E in the third quarter was a reduction in service charges of approximately $375 million pre-tax. The 2010 full-year decrease in revenue related to the implementation of Regulation E and the impact of overdraft policy changes is expected to be approximately $1.0 billion after-tax.   Noninterest expense increased $407 million, or 18 percent, to $2.7 billion as a result of an increase in distribution costs as a higher proportion of banking center sales and service efforts were aligned to Deposits from the other consumer businesses.  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2010 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2009   Net income fell $413 million, or 21 percent, to $1.6 billion as revenue declined and noninterest expense increased. Net interest income increased $859 million, or 16 percent, to $6.2 billion, while noninterest income decreased $1.0 billion, or 20 percent, to $4.1 billion. In addition, noninterest expense increased $505 million, or seven percent, to $7.7 billion. These period-over-period changes were driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. In addition, average deposits grew $9.0 billion as organic growth and the transfer of certain deposits from other client-managed businesses were offset by the expected decline in higher yielding Countrywide deposits. Noninterest expense includes FDIC charges of $675 million as compared to $997 million during the same period in 2009 which included a special FDIC assessment.  120    Table of Contents     Global Card Services                                              Three Months Ended September 30   Nine Months Ended September 30   (Dollars in millions)   2010   2009 (1)   2010   2009 (1)         Net interest income (2)   $  4,361     $  4,920     $  13,618     $  15,094     Noninterest income:                                   Card income     1,877       2,183       5,658       6,460     All other income (loss)     (527 )     147       99       405         Total noninterest income     1,350       2,330       5,757       6,865         Total revenue, net of interest expense     5,711       7,250       19,375       21,959                                         Provision for credit losses     3,177       6,823       10,507       22,699     Goodwill impairment     10,400       -       10,400       -     All other noninterest expense     1,699       1,915       5,207       5,848         Loss before income taxes     (9,565 )     (1,488 )     (6,739 )     (6,588 )   Income tax expense (benefit) (2)     306       (533 )     1,349       (2,321 )       Net loss   $  (9,871 )   $  (955 )   $  (8,088 )   $  (4,267 )                                           Net interest yield (2)     10.09 %     9.37 %     10.14 %     9.35 %   Return on average equity     n/m       n/m       n/m       n/m     Efficiency ratio (2)     n/m       26.40       80.55       26.64     Efficiency ratio, excluding goodwill impairment charge (2, 3)     29.75       26.40       26.87       26.64                                         Balance Sheet                                   Average                                   Total loans and leases   $  171,191     $  208,650     $  179,290     $  216,101     Total earning assets     171,456       208,287       179,494       215,901     Total assets     177,634       224,165       186,491       232,816     Allocated equity     35,270       40,652       39,623       40,807                                                 September 30   December 31    Period end                   2010   2009                             Total loans and leases                   $  168,845     $  196,289     Total earning assets                     169,615       196,046     Total assets                     169,813       212,668                   (1)   Prior year amounts are presented on a managed basis.

We provide credit card products to customers in the U.S., Canada, Ireland, Spain and the U.K. We offer a variety of co-branded and affinity credit and debit card products and are one of the leading issuers of credit cards through endorsed marketing in the U.S. and Europe. On February 22, 2010, the majority of the provisions in the CARD Act went into effect and negatively affected net interest income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 due to the restrictions on our ability to reprice credit cards based on risk and on card income due to restrictions imposed on certain fees. The 2010 full-year decrease in revenue is expected to be approximately $1.0 billion after-tax. For more information on the CARD Act, see Regulatory Matters beginning on page 143.   The Corporation reports its Global Card Services 2010 results in accordance with new consolidation guidance. Under this new consolidation guidance, we consolidated all credit card trusts. Accordingly, current year results are comparable to prior year results that were presented on a managed basis. For more information on managed basis, refer to Note 23 – Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K and for more information on new consolidation guidance, refer to Impact of Adopting New Consolidation Guidance on page 103 and Note 8 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  121    Table of Contents   On July 21, 2010, the Financial Reform Act was signed into law. As a result of the this legislation and final rulemaking over the next year, we estimate that debit card revenue in Global Card Services will be reduced by approximately $2.0 billion annually based on current volumes starting in the third quarter of 2011, assuming limited mitigation in this segment. This current estimate of revenue loss resulted in a $10.4 billion goodwill impairment charge in Global Card Services. The goodwill impairment analysis includes limited mitigation actions to recapture the lost revenue. We have identified other potential mitigation actions, but they are in the early stages of development and some of them may impact other segments. For additional information, refer to Note 9 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Complex Accounting Estimates on page 201.  Three Months Ended September 30, 2010 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2009   Global Card Services recorded a net loss of $9.9 billion primarily due to the $10.4 billion goodwill impairment charge. Excluding this charge, Global Card Services would have reported net income of $529 million, compared to a net loss of $955 million in the prior year. Revenue decreased $1.5 billion, or 21 percent, to $5.7 billion, driven by lower average loans, reduced interest and fee income primarily resulting from the implementation of the CARD Act and the impact of recording a $592 million reserve for payment protection insurance claims in the U.K. For more information on payment protection insurance, refer to Note 11 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   Net interest income decreased $559 million, or 11 percent, to $4.4 billion as average loans decreased $37.5 billion partially offset by lower funding costs.   Noninterest income decreased $980 million, or 42 percent, to $1.4 billion driven by the reserve related to payment protection insurance claims and lower card income of $306 million primarily due to the implementation of the CARD Act.   Provision for credit losses improved $3.6 billion driven by $3.2 billion lower net charge-offs and reserve reductions in the consumer card, consumer lending and small business portfolios. The prior year included a reserve addition due to maturing securitizations which had an unfavorable impact on the 2009 provision expense.   Noninterest expense increased $10.2 billion primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge. Excluding the impairment charge, noninterest expense decreased $216 million as a higher proportion of costs associated with banking center sales and service efforts were aligned to Deposits from Global Card Services.  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2010 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2009   Global Card Services recorded a net loss of $8.1 billion compared to a net loss of $4.3 billion as a decline in provision for credit losses was more than offset by higher noninterest expense and lower revenue. Excluding the goodwill impairment charge, Global Card Services would have reported net income of $2.3 billion compared to a net loss of $4.3 billion a year ago. Net interest income decreased $1.5 billion to $13.6 billion and noninterest income declined $1.1 billion to $5.8 billion. Provision for credit losses decreased $12.2 billion to $10.5 billion. Noninterest expense increased $9.8 billion to $15.6 billion due to the goodwill impairment charge of $10.4 billion. These period-over-period changes were driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. In addition, the decline in noninterest income was partially offset by the gain on the sale of our MasterCard equity holdings during the second quarter of 2010.  122    Table of Contents     Home Loans & Insurance                                              Three Months Ended September 30   Nine Months Ended September 30   (Dollars in millions)   2010   2009   2010   2009         Net interest income (1)   $  1,346     $  1,309     $  3,559     $  3,700     Noninterest income:                                   Mortgage banking income     1,756       1,424       4,417       7,505     Insurance income     574       594       1,725       1,728     All other income     68       86       462       179         Total noninterest income     2,398       2,104       6,604       9,412         Total revenue, net of interest expense     3,744       3,413       10,163       13,112                                         Provision for credit losses     1,302       2,897       7,292       8,995     Noninterest expense     2,979       3,049       9,125       8,540         Loss before income taxes     (537 )     (2,533 )     (6,254 )     (4,423 )   Income tax benefit (1)     (193 )     (898 )     (2,304 )     (1,567 )       Net loss   $  (344 )   $  (1,635 )   $  (3,950 )   $  (2,856 )                                           Net interest yield (1)     2.87 %     2.59 %     2.53 %     2.55 %   Efficiency ratio (1)     79.57       89.33       89.78       65.13                                         Balance Sheet                                                                       Average                                   Total loans and leases   $  127,713     $  132,599     $  130,685     $  129,910     Total earning assets     186,022       200,426       188,307       193,694     Total assets     223,133       236,086       228,765       229,212     Allocated equity     26,628       24,737       26,749       18,615                                                 September 30   December 31    Period end                   2010   2009                             Total loans and leases                   $  127,701     $  131,302     Total earning assets                     178,970       188,349     Total assets                     215,592       232,588                   (1)   FTE basis     Home Loans & Insurance generates revenue by providing an extensive line of consumer real estate products and services to customers nationwide. Home Loans & Insurance products are available to our customers through a retail network of approximately 5,900 banking centers, mortgage loan officers in 700 locations and a sales force offering our customers direct telephone and online access to our products. These products are also offered through our correspondent and wholesale loan acquisition channels. On October 5, 2010, we announced that we are exiting from the first mortgage wholesale acquisition channel to allow greater focus on our retail and correspondent channels.   Home Loans & Insurance products include fixed and adjustable rate first-lien mortgage loans for home purchase and refinancing needs, reverse mortgages, home equity lines of credit and home equity loans. First mortgage products are either sold into the secondary mortgage market to investors, while retaining MSRs and the Bank of America customer relationships, or are held on our balance sheet in All Other for ALM purposes. Home Loans & Insurance is not impacted by the Corporation’s first mortgage production retention decisions as Home Loans & Insurance is compensated for the decision on a management accounting basis with a corresponding offset recorded in All Other. Funded home equity lines of credit and home equity loans are held on our balance sheet. In addition, Home Loans & Insurance offers property, casualty, life, disability and credit insurance. In July 2010, we announced our intention to sell Balboa Insurance Group, a wholly-owned subsidiary and part of Home Loans & Insurance, which provides primarily lender-placed insurance to financial institutions and their customers, as well as homeowners, renters and life insurance to consumers.   Home Loans & Insurance includes the impact of transferring customers and their related loan balances between GWIM and Home Loans & Insurance based on client segmentation thresholds. For more information on the migration of customer balances, see GWIM  beginning on page 134.  123    Table of Contents  Three Months Ended September 30, 2010 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2009   Home Loans & Insurance recorded a net loss of $344 million compared to a net loss of $1.6 billion mainly as a result of lower provisions for credit losses and improved mortgage banking income.   Net interest income increased $37 million, or three percent, to $1.3 billion. Noninterest income increased $294 million, or 14 percent, to $2.4 billion due to an increase in mortgage banking income of $332 million. The increase in mortgage banking income was driven by higher servicing revenues due to favorable MSR results, net of hedges, and higher core production revenue driven by wider production margins. These improvements were partially offset by an increase of $417 million in representations and warranties expense. For additional information on representations and warranties, see Note 8 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Representations and Warranties beginning on page 139.   Provision for credit losses decreased $1.6 billion to $1.3 billion driven primarily by improving portfolio trends which led to lower net charge-offs and reserve reductions in 2010 compared to reserve increases in the prior year. In addition, provision for credit losses benefited from a lower reserve addition in the Countrywide purchased credit-impaired home equity portfolio.   Noninterest expense was essentially flat from a year ago as lower production and insurance expenses were offset by higher costs related to the increase in default management staff and other loss mitigation activities.  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2010 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2009   Home Loans & Insurance recorded a net loss of $4.0 billion compared to a net loss of $2.9 billion due to a decline in mortgage banking income of $3.1 billion and an increase in noninterest expense of $585 million, offset by a $1.7 billion decline in the provision for credit losses. Mortgage banking income declined as a result of lower production income driven by increased representations and warranties expense, and lower production volume driven by declines in the market demand for refinances. Also contributing to the decrease in mortgage banking income was lower servicing income due to less favorable MSR results, net of hedges. In addition, higher litigation costs impacted noninterest expense in 2010.   Provision for credit losses decreased $1.7 billion to $7.3 billion driven by lower reserve additions due to the factors noted above. In addition, provision for credit losses was adversely impacted by certain modified loans that were written-down to the underlying collateral value and additional provision expense associated with home equity VIEs that were consolidated on January 1, 2010 under new consolidation guidance.  Mortgage Banking Income   We categorize Home Loans & Insurance mortgage banking income into production and servicing income. Production income is comprised of revenue from the fair value gains and losses recognized on our interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and loans held for sale (LHFS), the related secondary market execution, and costs related to representations and warranties in the sales transactions along with other obligations incurred in the sales of mortgage loans. In addition, production income includes revenue, which is eliminated in All Other, for transfers of mortgage loans from Home Loans & Insurance to the ALM portfolio related to the Corporation’s mortgage production retention decisions.   Servicing income includes income earned in connection with these activities such as late fees and MSR valuation adjustments, net of economic hedge activities. The costs associated with our servicing activities are included in noninterest expense.   On October 18, 2010, Countrywide Home Loans Servicer LP, in its capacity as servicer on 115 private-label mortgage-backed securities (MBS) securitizations, received a letter that asserts breaches of certain servicing obligations. For additional information, see Executive Summary – Recent Events beginning on page 95.   Servicing activities include collecting cash for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers, disbursing customer draws for lines of credit and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors and escrow payments to third parties. Our home retention efforts are also part of our servicing activities, along with responding to customer inquiries and supervising foreclosures and property dispositions. In an effort to avoid foreclosure, Bank of America evaluates all workout options prior to foreclosure sale which, together with new requirements, has resulted in elongated default timelines. Our servicing agreements with certain loan investors require us to comply with usual and customary standards in the liquidation of delinquent mortgage loans. Our agreements with the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) provide for timelines to complete the liquidation of delinquent loans. In instances where we fail to meet these timelines, our agreements provide the GSEs the option to assess compensatory fees. Given the uncertainty of such an  124    Table of Contents  assessment and the factors that exist which may be deemed as uncontrollable causes of at least a portion of such delays, we have not determined that a loss is probable and cannot reasonably estimate the amount of a possible loss or range of loss. Additionally, we may face demands and claims from private-label RMBS investors concerning alleged breaches of customary servicing standards.   See Complex Accounting Estimates – Goodwill and Intangible Assets beginning on page 202 for a discussion of the goodwill impairment tests on Home Loans & Insurance.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2010 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2009   Production income of $977 million represented a decrease of $141 million as representations and warranties expense increased, partially offset by higher core production revenue. Core production revenue increased $276 million due to an increase in production margins, partially offset by a decline in production volume due mainly to a decline in market share. Representations and warranties expense increased to $872 million from $455 million due to increased estimates of defaults combined with a higher rate of repurchase or similar requests and an increase in the probability that the resolution of such requests will be a repurchase or indemnification of the investor for loss. For additional information on representations and warranties, see Note 8 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Representations and Warranties beginning on page 139.   Net servicing income increased $473 million largely due to improved MSR results, net of hedges. For additional information on MSRs and the related hedge instruments, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management on page 200.  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2010 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2009   Production income of $1.9 billion represented a decrease of $2.5 billion with $1.2 billion of the decrease due to a decline in production volume resulting from weaker market demand for refinance transactions. In addition, representations and warranties expense increased $1.3 billion compared to a year ago due to the same reasons described above as well as our continued evaluation of exposure to repurchases and similar claims, including repurchase demands from monoline insurers. For additional information on representations and warranties, see Note 8 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Representations and Warranties beginning on page 139.  125    Table of Contents   Net servicing income decreased $561 million largely due to lower MSR results, net of hedges.

(2)   Servicing of residential mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit, home equity loans and discontinued real estate mortgage loans.     First mortgage production in Home Loans & Insurance was $69.9 billion and $206.0 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to $89.5 billion and $271.0 billion in the same periods of 2009. The decrease of $19.6 billion compared to the three-month period a year ago was driven primarily by a decline in market share. The decrease of $65.0 billion compared to the nine-month period a year ago was driven by weaker market demand for refinance transactions. Home equity production was $2.0 billion and $5.6 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to $2.2 billion and $8.1 billion in the same periods of 2009. The decreases of $225 million and $2.5 billion were primarily due to more stringent underwriting guidelines for home equity lines of credit and loans as well as lower consumer demand.   At September 30, 2010, the consumer MSR balance was $12.3 billion, which represented 73 bps of the related unpaid principal balance as compared to $19.5 billion, or 113 bps of the related unpaid principal balance at December 31, 2009. The decrease in the consumer MSR balance was driven by the impact of declining mortgage rates during the third quarter, and the impact of elevated servicing costs partially offset by the addition of new MSRs recorded in connection with sales of loans. In addition, elevated servicing costs reduced expected cash flows. These factors combined resulted in the 40 bps decrease in capitalized MSRs as a percentage of loans serviced.  126    Table of Contents     Global Commercial Banking                                            Three Months Ended September 30   Nine Months Ended September 30   (Dollars in millions)   2010     2009     2010     2009           Net interest income (1)   $ 1,874     $ 2,012     $ 6,205     $ 5,972     Noninterest income:                                   Service charges     528       533       1,599       1,556     All other income     157       227       563       796         Total noninterest income     685       760       2,162       2,352         Total revenue, net of interest expense     2,559       2,772       8,367       8,324                                         Provision for credit losses     554       2,057       2,103       5,925     Noninterest expense     1,000       959       2,876       2,902         Income (loss) before income taxes     1,005       (244 )     3,388       (503 )   Income tax expense (benefit) (1)     368       (84 )     1,248       (244 )       Net income (loss)   $ 637     $ (160 )   $ 2,140     $ (259 )                                           Net interest yield (1)     2.61 %     3.05 %     3.03 %     3.25  %   Return on average equity     6.14       n/m       6.82       n/m     Efficiency ratio (1)     39.06       34.61       34.37       34.87                                         Balance Sheet                                                                       Average                                   Total loans and leases   $ 198,839     $ 225,994     $ 206,209     $ 232,426     Total earning assets (2)     284,941       261,876       273,760       245,891     Total assets (2)     315,632       292,878       304,581       277,894     Total deposits     148,534       131,548       145,857       125,333     Allocated equity     41,172       42,193       41,924       41,805                                         September 30     December 31     Period end   2010     2009             Total loans and leases   $ 195,858     $ 215,237     Total earning assets (2)     271,410       264,855     Total assets (2)     302,684       295,947     Total deposits     150,981       147,023                   (1)   FTE basis     (2)   Total earning assets and total assets include asset allocations to match liabilities (i.e., deposits).     n/m = not meaningful     Global Commercial Banking provides a wide range of lending-related products and services, integrated working capital management and treasury solutions to clients through our network of offices and client relationship teams along with various product partners.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2010 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2009   Global Commercial Banking recorded net income of $637 million compared to a net loss of $160 million, with the improvement primarily driven by lower credit costs.   Net interest income decreased $138 million, or seven percent, primarily due to a lower residual net interest income allocation related to ALM activities. Client deleveraging, which we believe has stabilized, coupled with higher levels of liquidity is reflected in Global Commercial Banking’s balance sheet and earnings. Net interest income was impacted by the $27.2 billion, or 12  127    Table of Contents  percent, decline in average loan balances, partially offset by improved loan spreads on new, renewed and amended facilities. In addition, net interest income also benefited from the growth in average deposits of $17.0 billion, or 13 percent.   Noninterest income decreased $75 million, or 10 percent, to $685 million due to a decrease in all other income of $70 million, or 31 percent, driven by the absence of a valuation adjustment recorded in the prior-year period and additional costs related to our agreement to purchase certain retail automotive loans. As clients manage through current economic conditions, we have seen usage of certain treasury services decline and increased conversion of paper to electronic services offset by lower credit utilization. The net effect of this dynamic has kept service charges flat.   The provision for credit losses was $554 million compared to $2.1 billion in the prior-year period. The decrease was primarily driven by reserve reductions and lower net charge-offs in the commercial real estate portfolio, reflecting stabilization of appraised values primarily in the homebuilder portfolio and fewer single name charge-offs, combined with lower net charge-offs in the commercial domestic portfolio reflecting improved borrower credit profiles.  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2010 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2009   Net income increased $2.4 billion driven by an increase in net interest income of $233 million and a decrease in provision for credit losses of $3.8 billion. The increase in net interest income was driven by improved loan spreads on new, renewed and amended facilities offset by the impact of a decline in average loan balances. Noninterest income was impacted by a decrease of $190 million due to additional costs related to our agreement to purchase certain retail automotive loans. The period-over-period changes in provision were driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above.  Global Commercial Banking Revenue   Global Commercial Banking revenues can also be categorized as business lending revenue derived from credit-related products and services and treasury services revenue primarily from capital and treasury management. Business lending revenue of $1.6 billion and $5.1 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 decreased $172 million and $52 million compared to the same periods in 2009 due to the decline in average loan balances partially offset by improved loan spreads on new, renewed and amended facilities. Treasury services revenue of $1.0 billion and $3.3 billion decreased $41 million and increased $95 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009. The decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 is primarily due to the growth in average deposits offset by lower treasury service charges and a lower residual net interest income allocation related to ALM activities. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 is due to the growth in average deposits partially offset by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion.  128    Table of Contents     Global Banking & Markets                                            Three Months Ended September 30   Nine Months Ended September 30   (Dollars in millions)   2010     2009     2010     2009           Net interest income (1)   $ 1,874     $ 2,255     $ 5,997     $ 7,403     Noninterest income:                                   Service charges     520       555       1,568       1,478     Investment and brokerage services     581       590       1,880       2,066     Investment banking income     1,306       1,232       3,824       3,957     Trading account profits     2,453       3,411       8,727       10,426     All other income (loss)     442       (369 )     935       1,695         Total noninterest income     5,302       5,419       16,934       19,622         Total revenue, net of interest expense     7,176       7,674       22,931       27,025                                         Provision for credit losses     (157 )     538       (43 )     1,451     Noninterest expense     4,446       3,653       13,602       12,328         Income before income taxes     2,887       3,483       9,372       13,246     Income tax expense (1)     1,439       1,241       3,777       4,623         Net income   $ 1,448     $ 2,242     $ 5,595     $ 8,623                                             Return on average equity     10.94 %     17.49 %     13.97 %     23.61 %   Efficiency ratio (1)     61.96       47.60       59.32       45.62                                         Balance Sheet                                                                       Average                                   Total trading-related assets (2)   $ 497,954     $ 496,278     $ 506,461     $ 513,037     Total loans and leases     98,847       105,995       97,925       114,578     Total market-based earning assets     494,777       468,844       514,249       478,288     Total earning assets     593,176       570,599       610,965       589,216     Total assets     753,287       754,295       771,483       789,860     Total deposits     106,865       104,228       107,927       103,630     Allocated equity     52,519       50,844       53,561       48,820                                         September 30     December 31     Period end   2010     2009             Total trading-related assets (2)   $ 508,611     $ 410,755     Total loans and leases     99,476       95,930     Total market-based earning assets     500,664       404,315     Total earning assets     605,761       505,698     Total assets     759,767       656,809     Total deposits     109,956       102,093                   (1)   FTE basis     (2)   Includes assets which are not considered earning assets (i.e., derivative assets).

GBAM also includes the results of our merchant processing joint venture, Banc of America Merchant Services, LLC.  129    Table of Contents   During the second quarter of 2009, we entered into a joint venture agreement with First Data Corporation (First Data) to form Banc of America Merchant Services, LLC. The joint venture provides payment solutions, including credit, debit and prepaid cards, and check and e-commerce payments to merchants ranging from small businesses to corporate and commercial clients worldwide. In addition to Bank of America and First Data, the remaining stake was initially held by a third party. During the second quarter of 2010, the third party sold its interest to the joint venture, thus increasing the Corporation’s ownership interest in the joint venture to 49 percent. For additional information on the joint venture agreement, see Note 5 – Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Three Months Ended September 30, 2010 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2009   Net income decreased $794 million to $1.4 billion driven by reduced revenues, increased noninterest expense, and higher income taxes related to the impact of the U.K. tax rate reduction on deferred tax assets, partially offset by lower provision expense.   Net interest income decreased $381 million to $1.9 billion due to lower spreads on trading-related assets and lower average loans and leases, which decreased $7.1 billion, or 7 percent, driven primarily by reduced demand. Net interest income is both market-based, which is related to sales and trading, and core, which is related to credit and treasury services. Noninterest income decreased $117 million due to decreased sales and trading revenue. Noninterest expense increased $793 million due in part to the recognition of expense on proportionately larger prior-year incentive deferrals. Provision for credit losses decreased $695 million driven by lower net charge-offs and reserve reductions reflecting improvement in borrower credit profiles and reduction in reservable criticized levels.  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2010 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2009   Net income decreased $3.0 billion to $5.6 billion due to the prior year pre-tax gain of $3.8 billion related to the contribution of the merchant processing business to the joint venture.  Components of Global Banking & Markets Sales and Trading Revenue   Sales and trading revenue is segregated into fixed-income including investment and non-investment grade corporate debt obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), RMBS and CDO; currencies including interest rate and foreign exchange contracts; commodities including primarily futures, forwards, swaps and options; and equity income from equity-linked derivatives and cash equity activity.

Sales and trading revenue decreased $768 million to $4.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to more favorable market conditions in the prior-year period, and a lack of liquidity this quarter as sovereign debt fears and regulatory uncertainty fueled investor concerns. FICC revenue decreased $477 million to $3.5 billion primarily due to lower results in credit products, which benefited a year earlier from spread tightening. Equities revenue decreased $291 million to $974 million due to lower volumes and a decline in trading revenue. Additionally, we recorded net credit spread losses on derivative liabilities in the third quarter of 2010 of $34 million compared to losses of $714 million due to more significant spread tightening during the prior year quarter. Gains on legacy assets were $264 million for the three months ended September 30, 2010 and $218 million for the same period in 2009.  130    Table of Contents   Sales and trading revenue decreased $691 million to $14.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. FICC revenue decreased $96 million to $11.4 billion due to lower revenue in our rates and currencies and credit products offset by improved results in our mortgage-backed products. We recorded net credit spread gains on derivative liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2010 of $212 million compared to losses of $631 million in 2009. Gains on legacy assets were $51 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to write-downs of $2.8 billion for the same period in 2009. Losses in the prior year were primarily driven by our CDO exposure, as well as monoline and CMBS exposure.   Equity income was $3.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to $4.0 billion for the same period in 2009 driven by lower domestic volumes and market conditions in the derivatives business.  Investment Banking Income   Product specialists within GBAM underwrite and distribute debt and equity securities, and certain other loan products, and provide advisory services. To provide a complete discussion of our consolidated investment banking income, the table below presents total investment banking income for the Corporation, substantially all of which is recorded in GBAM with the remainder in GWIM and Global Commercial Banking.

(2)   Represents the offset to fees paid on the Corporation’s transactions.     Investment banking income increased $117 million to $1.4 billion and decreased $25 million to $3.9 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009. Equity issuance fees decreased $62 million and $64 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 primarily reflecting lower levels of industry-wide activity. Debt issuance fees increased $74 million and $75 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 mainly driven by investment grade debt issuances and strong results in leveraged finance in the third quarter and first nine months of the year. Advisory fees increased $66 million and decreased $146 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010.  Global Corporate Banking   Client relationship teams along with product partners work with our customers and provide them with a wide range of lending-related products and services, integrated working capital management and treasury solutions through the Corporation’s global network of offices. Global Corporate Banking lending revenues of $821 million and $2.6 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 increased $217 million and $543 million compared to same periods in 2009. The increase for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 is primarily due to higher fees and the negative impact of hedge results in 2009. Treasury services revenue of $645 million and $2.0 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 decreased $104 million and $3.9 billion primarily due to a $3.8 billion pre-tax gain in the prior year related to the contribution of the merchant processing business to a joint venture. Equity investment income from the joint venture was $36 million and $97 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010.  131    Table of Contents  Collateralized Debt Obligation Exposure  CDO vehicles hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities and issue multiple tranches of debt securities including commercial paper, mezzanine and equity securities. Our CDO exposure can be divided into funded and unfunded super senior liquidity commitment exposure, other super senior exposure (i.e., cash positions and derivative contracts), warehouse, and sales and trading positions. For more information on our CDO liquidity commitments, see Note 8 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Super senior exposure represents the most senior class of commercial paper or notes that are issued by the CDO vehicles. These financial instruments benefit from the subordination of all other securities issued by the CDO vehicles.   For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, we incurred $64 million and $669 million of losses resulting from our CDO exposure. This compares to $287 million and $2.0 billion in CDO-related losses for the same periods in 2009. Included in these losses in 2010 were $59 million and $377 million related to counterparty risk on our CDO-related exposure, as compared to $149 million and $777 million in 2009. Also included in these losses were other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) losses of $2 million and $251 million compared to $258 million and $856 million in the same periods in 2009 related to CDOs and retained positions classified as AFS debt securities.   As presented in the table below at September 30, 2010, our hedged and unhedged super senior CDO exposure before consideration of insurance, net of write-downs, was $2.2 billion. For additional information on our CDO positions, including the super senior CDO exposure in the table below and our maximum exposure to loss, see Note 8 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2)   Includes highly-rated collateralized loan obligations and CMBS super senior exposure.     (3)   Hedged amounts are presented at carrying value before consideration of the insurance.     We value our CDO structures using market-standard models to model the specific collateral composition and cash flow structure of each deal. Key inputs to the model are prepayment rates, default rates and severities for each collateral type, and other relevant contractual features. Unrealized losses recorded in accumulated OCI on super senior cash positions and retained positions from liquidated CDOs in aggregate decreased $340 million and $222 million for the three and nine months to $628 million at September 30, 2010.   At September 30, 2010, total super senior exposure of $2.2 billion was marked at 18 percent, including $327 million of retained positions from liquidated CDOs marked at 43 percent, $537 million of non-subprime exposure marked at 32 percent, and the remaining $1.3 billion exposure marked at 14 percent of the original net exposure amounts. The percentages marked are based on original exposure balances.

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, we recorded $59 million and $392 million of counterparty credit risk-related write-downs on these positions. At December 31, 2009, the monoline wrap on our super senior CDOs had a notional value of $3.8 billion, with a receivable of $2.8 billion and a counterparty credit valuation adjustment of $1.9 billion, or 66 percent. In addition, we held collateral in the form of cash and marketable securities of $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion at September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009 related to our non-monoline purchased insurance.   In addition to the monoline exposure related to super senior CDOs, at September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, we had $35.6 billion and $38.8 billion of notional exposure to monolines that predominantly hedge corporate collateralized loan obligation and CDO exposures as well as CMBS, RMBS and other ABS cash and synthetic exposures. Mark-to-market monoline derivative credit exposure was $6.9 billion at September 30, 2010 compared to $8.3 billion at December 31, 2009. This decrease was driven by positive valuation adjustments on legacy assets and terminated monoline contracts.   At September 30, 2010, the counterparty credit valuation adjustment related to non-super senior CDO monoline derivative exposure was $3.4 billion which reduced our net mark-to-market exposure to $3.4 billion. We do not hold collateral against these derivative exposures. Also, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, we recognized gains of $146 million and $300 million for counterparty credit risk related to these positions.   With the Merrill Lynch acquisition, we acquired a loan with a carrying value of $4.3 billion as of September 30, 2010 that is collateralized by U.S. super senior ABS CDOs. Merrill Lynch originally provided financing to the borrower for an amount equal to approximately 75 percent of the fair value of the collateral. The loan has full recourse to the borrower and all scheduled payments on the loan have been received. Events of default under the loan are customary events of default, including failure to pay interest when due and failure to pay principal at maturity.

GWIM consists of three primary businesses: Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM), U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management (U.S. Trust); and Retirement & Philanthropic Services (RPS).   MLGWM’s advisory business provides a high-touch client experience through a network of approximately 15,400 financial advisors focused on clients with more than $250,000 in total investable assets. MLGWM also includes Merrill Edge, a new integrated investing and banking service, which is targeted at clients with less than $250,000 in total assets, and provides team-based investment advice and guidance, brokerage services, a self-directed online investing platform and key banking capabilities, including access to the Corporation’s branch network and approximately 18,000 ATMs. In addition, MLGWM includes the Private Banking & Investments Group.   U.S. Trust, together with MLGWM’s Private Banking & Investments Group, provides comprehensive wealth management solutions targeted at wealthy and ultra-wealthy clients with investable assets of more than $5 million, as well as customized solutions to meet clients’ wealth structuring, investment management, trust and banking needs, including specialty asset management services.   RPS partners with GWIM financial advisors to provide institutional and personal retirement solutions (including investment management administration, recordkeeping and custodial services for 401(k), pension, profit-sharing, equity award and non-qualified deferred compensation plans), and comprehensive investment advisory and philanthropic services to individuals, small to large corporations, pension plans, endowments and foundations.  134    Table of Contents   GWIM results also include the BofA Global Capital Management (BACM) business, which is the cash and liquidity asset management business that Bank of America retained following the sale of the Columbia long-term asset management business, the Corporation’s approximate 34 percent economic ownership interest in BlackRock and other miscellaneous items. The historical results of Columbia’s long-term asset management business have been transferred to All Other.   Revenue from MLGWM was $3.1 billion and $9.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, which was relatively flat compared to the same periods in the prior year. Revenue from U.S. Trust was $611 million and $1.9 billion, up two percent for both periods compared to the same periods in the prior year. Revenue from RPS was $269 million and $810 million, up eight percent and seven percent compared to the same periods in the prior year.   GWIM results include the impact of migrating clients and their related deposit and loan balances to or from Deposits, Home Loans & Insurance and the ALM portfolio as presented in the table below. The directional shift of total deposits migrated was mainly due to client segmentation threshold changes. Subsequent to the date of migration, the associated net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense are recorded in the business to which the clients migrated.

Net interest income decreased $37 million, or three percent, to $1.3 billion as higher deposit levels were more than offset by lower corporate ALM activity. Noninterest income increased $237 million, or nine percent, to $2.8 billion primarily due to higher asset management fees driven by higher market levels, continued long-term assets under management flows and lower levels of support to certain cash funds partially offset by lower brokerage income. Provision for credit losses decreased $387 million, or 75 percent, to $128 million driven by lower reserve additions and net charge-offs in the consumer real estate and commercial portfolios, along with the absence of a single large commercial charge-off in the prior year. Noninterest expense increased $444 million, or 15 percent, to $3.4 billion driven by increases in revenue-related expenses, higher personnel costs associated with increased staffing levels, higher litigation and support costs.  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2010 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2009   Net income remained relatively flat at $1.1 billion as an increase of $779 million in noninterest income and a decrease of $516 million in provision for credit losses were offset by higher noninterest expense of $748 million and a decline of $203 million in net interest income. The period over period changes in net interest income, noninterest income and provision for credit losses were driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. Additionally, the decrease in net interest income was driven by the impact of net migration of client relationships to Deposits, Home Loans & Insurance and the ALM portfolio in the prior year, and the increase in noninterest income was driven by higher equity investment income related to our investment in BlackRock. The increase in noninterest expense was driven by increases in revenue-related expenses, higher personnel costs associated with increased staffing levels and higher support costs.  135    Table of Contents  Client Balances   The table below presents client balances which consist of assets under management, client brokerage assets, assets in custody, client deposits, and loans and leases.

The decrease in client balances was due to the sale of the Columbia long-term asset management business, outflows in MLGWM’s non-fee based brokerage assets and outflows in BACM’s money market assets due to the continued low rate environment partially offset by higher market levels.  136    Table of Contents     All Other                                            Three Months Ended September 30   Nine Months Ended September 30   (Dollars in millions)   2010 (1)     2009     2010 (1)     2009           Net interest income (2)   $ 48     $ 477     $ 354     $ 1,774     Noninterest income:                                   Card income     -       286       -       891     Equity investment income     94       882       2,575       8,184     Gains on sales of debt securities     794       1,442       1,456       3,585     All other income (loss)     (276 )     (2,027 )     632       (3,326 )       Total noninterest income     612       583       4,663       9,334         Total revenue, net of interest expense     660       1,060       5,017       11,108                                         Provision for credit losses     330       2,090       2,796       6,588     Merger and restructuring charges (3)     421       594       1,450       2,188     All other noninterest expense     129       845       1,895       2,086         Income (loss) before income taxes     (220 )     (2,469 )     (1,124 )     246     Income tax benefit (2)     (543 )     (928 )     (1,751 )     (1,894 )       Net income (loss)   $ 323     $ (1,541 )   $ 627     $ 2,140                                             Balance Sheet                                                                       Average                                   Total loans and leases (4)   $ 238,457     $ 155,184     $ 250,553     $ 165,086     Total assets (4, 5)     205,204       208,221       269,484       237,403     Total deposits     44,586       95,131       59,640       92,139     Allocated equity     30,112       55,065       23,227       51,242                                                                                       September 30     December 31      Period end                   2010   2009                               Total loans and leases (4)                   $ 241,837     $ 161,128     Total assets (4, 5)                     187,928       133,135     Total deposits                     37,130       65,433              (1)    Current periods are presented in accordance with new consolidation guidance.

(5)    Includes elimination of segments’ excess asset allocations to match liabilities (i.e., deposits) of $635.9 billion and $547.6 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, $611.2 billion and $514.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, and $627.0 billion and $586.3 billion at September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009.     All Other includes our Equity Investments businesses and Other. For periods prior to 2010, Global Card Services was reported on a managed basis which included a securitization impact adjustment. All Other’s results included a corresponding securitization offset which removed the impact of these securitized loans in order to present the consolidated results on a GAAP basis (i.e., held basis). The current periods are presented in accordance with new consolidation guidance, which we adopted on January 1, 2010. For more information on managed basis, refer to Note 23 – Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.   Equity Investments includes Global Principal Investments, Corporate Investments and Strategic Investments. During the first quarter of 2010, the $2.7 billion Corporate Investment equity portfolio was sold as a result of a change in our investment portfolio objectives shifting more to core interest income and reducing our exposure to equity market risk, resulting in a loss of $331 million.   Global Principal Investments (GPI) is comprised of a diversified portfolio of investments in private equity, real estate and other alternative investments. These investments are made either directly in a company or held through a fund with related income recorded in equity investment income. Global Principal Investments had unfunded equity commitments of $1.5 billion at September 30, 2010, related to certain of these investments. For more information on these commitments, see Note 11 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Affiliates of the Corporation  137    Table of Contents  may, from time to time, act as general partner, fund manager and/or investment advisor to certain Corporation-sponsored real estate private equity funds. In such capacities, these affiliates manage and/or provide investment advisory services to such real estate private equity funds primarily for the benefit of third-party institutional and private clients. Such activities inherently involve risk to us and to the fund investors, and in certain situations may result in loss. In the third quarter, we recorded a loss of $165 million related to a consolidated real estate private equity fund for which we are the general partner and investment advisor. During the quarter, we sold our exposure of $1.7 billion in certain private equity funds, comprised of $859 million in capital and $794 million in unfunded commitments, resulting in no gain or loss in the three months ended September 30, 2010.   The Strategic Investments business includes our investment in CCB. At September 30, 2010, we owned approximately 11 percent, or 25.6 billion common shares of CCB. In the third quarter of 2010, we recorded in accumulated OCI a $6.2 billion after-tax unrealized gain on 23.6 billion shares of our investment in CCB, which previously had been carried at cost. These shares were reclassified to available-for-sale in the three months ended September 30, 2010 because the sales restrictions on 23.6 billion of these shares expire within one year, and therefore, we recorded the unrealized gain in accumulated OCI, net of an 11.5 percent restriction discount. Sales restrictions on the remaining two billion CCB shares continue until August 2013, and these shares continue to be carried at cost. At September 30, 2010, for all CCB shares, the cost basis was $9.2 billion, the carrying value was $19.0 billion and the fair value was $20.0 billion.   The table below presents the components of All Other’s equity investment income and reconciliation to the total consolidated equity investment income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009 and also All Other’s equity investments at September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009.

Other also includes certain amounts associated with ALM activities, amounts associated with the change in the value of derivatives used as economic hedges of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to revaluation of foreign currency-denominated debt, fair value adjustments on certain structured notes, certain gains (losses) on sales of whole mortgage loans, gains (losses) on sales of certain debt securities and other-than-temporary impairment write-downs on certain AFS securities. In addition, Other includes adjustments to net interest income and income tax expense to remove the FTE effect of items (primarily low-income housing tax credits) that are reported on a FTE basis in the business segments. Other also includes a trust services business which is a client-focused business providing trustee services and fund administration to various financial services companies.   On July 1, 2010, we completed the sale of First Republic at book value and as a result, we removed $17.4 billion of loans and $17.8 billion of deposits from our consolidated balance sheet.  Three Months Ended September 30, 2010 compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2009   All Other reported net income of $323 million compared to a net loss of $1.5 billion driven primarily by a significantly lower provision for credit losses and also lower noninterest expense. Net interest income decreased $429 million to $48  138    Table of Contents  million as the prior year included net interest income driven by capital raises occurring throughout 2009 that were not allocated to the businesses. Noninterest income was relatively flat and included a decrease in equity investment income of $788 million as the prior year included positive valuation adjustments on public and private investments within GPI, and gains on sales of debt securities declined $648 million to $794 million, largely offset by lower losses on structured liabilities of $190 million compared to losses of $1.8 billion in the prior year.   Provision for credit losses decreased $1.8 billion to $330 million mainly due to reserve reductions in the residential mortgage portfolio due to improving portfolio trends as compared to reserve additions in the prior year. The provision benefited from a lower reserve addition in the Countrywide purchased credit-impaired discontinued real-estate portfolio.   The income tax benefit for the current-year period included the release of a valuation allowance established for acquired capital loss carryforward amounts.  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2010 compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2009   Net income decreased $1.5 billion to $627 million as decreases in net interest income of $1.4 billion and noninterest income of $4.7 billion were partially offset by a decrease in the provision of $3.8 billion and lower merger and restructuring charges of $738 million. These period-over-period changes were driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. In addition, the prior-year period included a $7.3 billion pre-tax gain resulting from sales of shares in CCB in addition to gains on the sale of agency mortgage-backed securities of $2.1 billion. These prior period gains combined with the lower losses on structured liabilities were somewhat offset by the same factors described above. Income tax benefit was $1.8 billion compared to $1.9 billion, reflecting higher tax benefits on the decrease in pre-tax income, offset by lower benefit on the release of a valuation allowance.     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations   We have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into a number of off-balance sheet commitments including commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and commercial letters of credit to meet the financing needs of our customers. Beginning on January 1, 2010, the accounting and reporting for these commitments were subject to new consolidation guidance which is more fully discussed in Note 8 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information on our obligations and commitments, see Note 10 – Long-term Debt and Note 11 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, pages 42 through 43 of the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as Note 13 – Long-term Debt and Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Representations and Warranties   We securitize first-lien mortgage loans generally in the form of MBS guaranteed by GSEs. In addition, in prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries have sold pools of first-lien mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label MBS or in the form of whole loans. In connection with these securitizations and whole loan sales, we or our subsidiaries or legacy companies made various representations and warranties. Breaches of these representations and warranties may result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage loans, indemnify or provide other remedy to an investor or securitization trust. In such cases, the repurchaser bears any subsequent credit loss on the mortgage loans. The repurchaser’s credit loss may be reduced by any recourse to sellers of loans for representations and warranties previously provided when such loans were purchased. Subject to the requirements and limitations of the applicable agreements, representations and warranties can be enforced by the trustee, investor or, in certain first-lien and home equity securitizations where monolines have insured all or some of the related bonds issued, by the insurer at any time over the life of the loan.   Importantly, the contractual liability to repurchase arises if there is a breach of the representations and warranties that materially and adversely affects the interest of all investors in the case of non-GSE loans, or if there is a breach of other standards established by the terms of the related sale agreement. We believe many of the defaults observed in these loans have been, and continue to be, driven by external factors like the substantial depreciation in home prices, persistently high unemployment and other economic trends, diminishing the likelihood that any loan defect (assuming one exists at all) was the cause of the loan’s default. The length of time a loan performs prior to default is an important consideration. We believe that the longer a loan performs, the less likely it is that an alleged underwriting representation breach would have had a  139    Table of Contents  material impact on the loan’s performance or that a breach even exists. Historically, most demands for repurchase have occurred within the first few years after origination, generally after a loan has defaulted. However, in recent periods the time horizon has lengthened due to increased repurchase demands across all vintages. Our current operations are structured to attempt to limit the risk of repurchase and accompanying credit exposure by seeking to ensure consistent production of mortgages in accordance with our underwriting procedures and by servicing those mortgages consistent with secondary mortgage market standards.   The representations and warranties given in the sales of loans related to, among other things, the ownership of the loan and the validity of the lien securing the loan. Recently, there has been significant public commentary regarding mortgage securitization processes, the use of the electronic records system operated by the Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS), and whether securitization trusts own the loans purported to be conveyed to them and have valid liens securing those loans. The process for mortgage loan transfers into securitization trusts is based on a well-established body of law that establishes the ownership of mortgage loans by the securitization trusts and we believe we have substantially executed this process. We currently use the MERS system for a substantial portion of the residential mortgage loans that we originate, including loans that have been sold to investors or securitization trusts. Although the GSEs do not require the use of MERS, the GSEs permit standard forms of mortgages and deeds of trust that use MERS and loans that employ these forms are considered to be properly documented for the GSEs’ purposes. We believe that the use of MERS is widespread in the industry.   The probable losses to be absorbed under the representations and warranties obligations and the guarantees are recorded as a liability when the loans are sold and are updated by accruing a representations and warranties expense in mortgage banking income throughout the life of the loan as necessary when additional relevant information becomes available. The methodology used to estimate the liability for representations and warranties is a function of the representations and warranties given and considers a variety of factors, which include, depending on the counterparty, actual defaults, estimated future defaults, historical loss experience, probability that a repurchase request will be received, number of payments made by the borrower prior to default and probability that a loan will be required to be repurchased. Given that these factors vary by counterparty, we analyze our representations and warranties obligations based on the specific party with whom the sale was made. Although the timing and volume has varied, we have experienced increasing repurchase and similar requests from buyers and insurers, including monolines. To date we have received a limited number of repurchase requests related to private-label MBS transactions, but we expect efforts to attempt to assert repurchase requests by private-label MBS investors may increase in the future. See Executive Summary – Recent Events on page 95 for additional information. We perform a loan by loan review of all repurchase requests and have and will continue to contest such demands that we do not believe are valid. Overall, disputes have increased with buyers and insurers regarding representations and warranties.   The liability for representations and warranties, and corporate guarantees, is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities and the related expense is included in mortgage banking income. At September 30, 2010, and December 31, 2009, the liability was $4.4 billion and $3.5 billion. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, the representations and warranties, and corporate guarantees expense was $872 million and $2.6 billion, compared to $455 million and $1.9 billion for the same periods in 2009. Representations and warranties expense may vary significantly each period as the methodology used to estimate the expense continues to be refined based on the level and type of repurchase requests presented, defects identified, the latest experience gained on repurchase requests and other relevant facts and circumstances, which could have a material adverse impact on our earnings for the period.  140    Table of Contents  Government-sponsored Enterprises   During the last ten years Bank of America and our subsidiaries have sold over $2.0 trillion of loans to the GSEs and we have an established history of working with them on repurchase requests. Our experience with them continues to evolve and any disputes are generally related to such areas as the reasonableness of stated income, occupancy and undisclosed liabilities, and are typically focused on the 2004 through 2008 vintages. While the environment around the repurchase process continues to be challenging we strive to maintain a constructive relationship with the GSEs. We believe that our exposure to representations and warranties is most significant for loans sold between 2004 through 2008. Our repurchase claims experience related to loans originated prior to 2004 has not been significant and we believe that the changes made to our operations and underwriting policies have reduced our exposure after 2008. The graph below shows cumulative repurchase claims by vintage.  Cumulative GSE Repurchase Requests by Vintage           1 Exposure at default (EAD) represents the unpaid principal balance at the time of default, or the unpaid principal balance as of September 30, 2010.     From 2004 through 2008 Bank of America and Countrywide sold approximately $1.2 trillion of loans to the GSEs. Through September 30, 2010, we have received approximately $18.0 billion in repurchase claims associated with these vintages, representing approximately 1.5 percent of the loans sold to the GSEs in these vintages. We have successfully resolved $11.4 billion of these claims with a net loss experience of approximately 22 percent. The level of repurchase claims from the GSEs has been elevated for the last few quarters driving the total number of outstanding repurchase claims due to the time that it takes to work loans through the claims process. The volume of loans in 2007 is significantly higher than any other vintage, which together with the high delinquency level in this vintage helps to explain the high level of repurchase claims compared to the other vintages. Our liability for obligations under representations and warranties given to the GSEs considers the existing pipeline of claims and future claims we might receive on loans that have defaulted or that we estimate will default. We also take into account our experience with the GSEs in working through repurchase claims. Although our experience with the GSEs could change in the future, we believe our predictive repurchase models, utilizing our historical repurchase experience with the GSEs while considering current developments, projections of future defaults and a continued loan by loan review, allows us to reasonably estimate the liability for obligations under representations and warranties on loans sold to the GSEs.  141    Table of Contents  Monoline Insurers   In the past, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries have sold pools of first-lien mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label MBS where monolines have insured all or some of the related bonds issued. The contractual representations and warranties provided to the private-label securitizations insured by the monolines are less rigorous than those given to the GSEs as fraud and property valuation representations and warranties were generally not given in private-label securitizations. Additionally, the applicable agreements generally impose higher burdens for those seeking repurchase than the comparable agreements with the GSEs. Through September 30, 2010, legacy companies have sold approximately $180 billion of loans into these monoline-wrapped securitizations, including $75 billion of first-lien mortgages and $105 billion of second-lien mortgages. Of these balances, approximately one-third of the first-lien mortgages and 60 percent of the second-lien mortgages have paid off as of September 30, 2010. Of the first-lien mortgages sold, we estimate $38 billion were sold as whole loans to other institutions which subsequently included these loans with those of other originators in private-label securitization transactions in which the monolines typically insured one or more securities. Through September 30, 2010, we have received $4.8 billion of representations and warranties claims related to the monoline insured deals and approximately $550 million of such claims were resolved through repurchase or indemnification of the trust for the loss. At September 30, 2010, the unpaid principal balance of loans related to unresolved monoline repurchase requests was approximately $4.2 billion, including $2.7 billion that have been reviewed where it is believed a valid defect has not been identified which would constitute an actionable breach of representations and warranties and $1.5 billion that is in the process of review. We have had limited experience with most of the monoline insurers in the repurchase process, which has constrained our ability to resolve the open claims. Also, certain monoline insurers have instituted litigation against Countrywide and Bank of America, which limits our relationship and ability to enter into constructive dialogue to resolve the open claims. It is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate future repurchase obligations with respect to these claims and, therefore, no liability has been recorded in connection with these counterparties, other than a liability for repurchase requests that are in the process of review. However, certain monoline insurers have engaged with us in a consistent repurchase process and we have used that experience to record a liability related to existing and future claims from such counterparties.  Whole Loan Sales and Private-label Securitizations   In the past legacy companies and certain subsidiaries have also sold pools of first-lien mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label MBS or in the form of whole loans in which we believe there is no participation by the monoline insurers. The loans sold include prime loans, including loans with a loan balance in excess of the conforming loan limit, Alt-A, pay-option, home equity and subprime loans. Many of the loans sold in the form of whole loans were subsequently pooled with other mortgages into private-label securitizations issued by the third-party buyer of the loans. Our repurchase claims experience with this category of counterparties prior to 2004 is limited and the amount of the claims asserted is not significant. From 2004 through 2008 legacy Countrywide and to a lesser extent Bank of America, sold loans with a total principal balance of approximately $750 billion of which approximately forty percent has been paid off. Through September 30, 2010, we have received approximately $3.9 billion of representations and warranties claims related to such loans and have resolved almost $2.9 billion of those claims to date. Approximately $1.0 billion of these claims were resolved through repurchase or indemnification and $1.9 billion were rescinded by the investor. We have reviewed approximately half of the remaining $1.0 billion claims still outstanding and have declined to repurchase based on our assessment of whether a material breach exists. The majority of the claims that we have received so far are from whole loan investors. As it relates to private-label securitizations, the ultimate representations and warranties exposure requires that counterparties have the ability to both assert a claim and actually prove there is a breach of the representations and warranties that materially and adversely affects the interest of all investors in the case of non-GSE loans, or if there is a breach of other standards established by the terms of the related sale agreement. As previously noted, we believe many of the defaults observed in these securitizations have been, and continue to be, driven by external factors like the substantial depreciation in home prices, persistently high unemployment and other economic trends, diminishing the likelihood that any loan defect (assuming one exists at all) was the cause of the loan’s default. Bondholders and other market participants assumed the market and disclosed credit risks of the mortgage securities they purchased, including the loans backing those securities. The expansion of underwriting standards and increase in credit risk over time, including higher loan-to-value ratios, lower FICOs, less loan documentation and the fact that exceptions were made to underwriting guidelines was disclosed to market participants. In addition, the contractual representations and warranties are less rigorous than those given to the GSEs, for example, as fraud and property valuation representations and warranties were generally not given in private-label securitizations and the applicable agreements generally impose higher burdens on investors seeking repurchase than the comparable agreements with the GSEs, we believe these factors make it difficult to extrapolate the experience with the GSEs over the private-label securitizations population. Accordingly, until we have meaningful repurchase experiences with these counterparties, it is not possible to determine whether a loss has occurred and, although it is reasonably possible that a loss may occur, it is not possible at this time to estimate future repurchase experience and any related loss or range of loss.   From 2004 to 2007 legacy Merrill Lynch, including First Franklin Financial Corporation, sold loans in this category with a total principal balance in the amount of approximately $110 billion, including certain loans made to high net worth borrowers. In addition, certain of these loans have paid off. During the nine months ended September 30, 2010, $50 million of repurchase claims were resolved through repurchase or reimbursement to the investor or securitization trust for losses they incurred compared to $13 million for the same period in 2009. At September 30, 2010, the unpaid principal balance of loans related to unresolved repurchase requests for this portfolio was approximately $815 million. We have reviewed $626 million of the claims outstanding and have declined to repurchase based on our assessment of whether a material breach exists.   On October 18, 2010, in its capacity as servicer on 115 private label MBS securitizations, one of our subsidiaries received a letter that asserts breaches of certain servicing obligations, including an alleged failure to provide notice of breaches of representations and warranties with respect to mortgage loans included in the transactions. See Executive Summary – Recent Events on page 95 for additional information.  142    Table of Contents   See Complex Accounting Estimates – Representations and Warranties on page 205 for information related to our estimated liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees related to mortgage-related securitizations. For additional information regarding representations and warranties and disputes involving monolines, see Note 8 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 11 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Regulatory Matters   Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2010 for additional information on recent or proposed legislative and regulatory initiatives as well as other risks to which the Corporation is exposed, including among others enhanced regulatory scrutiny or potential legal liability as a result of the recent financial crisis.   On July 21, 2010, the Financial Reform Act was signed into law. The Financial Reform Act provides for sweeping financial regulatory reform and will alter the way in which we conduct certain businesses, restrict our ability to compete, increase our costs and reduce our revenues.   The Financial Reform Act mandates that the Federal Reserve Board (Federal Reserve) limit debit card interchange fees. Provisions in the legislation also ban banking organizations from engaging in proprietary trading and restrict their sponsorship of, or investing in, hedge funds and private equity funds, subject to limited exceptions. The Financial Reform Act increases regulation of the derivative markets through measures that broaden the derivative instruments subject to regulation and will require clearing and exchange trading as well as imposing additional capital and margin requirements for derivative market participants. The Financial Reform Act changes the assessment base used in calculating FDIC deposit insurance fees from assessable deposits to total assets less tangible capital; provides for resolution authority to establish a process to unwind large systemically important financial companies; establishes a consumer financial protection bureau; includes new minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements for large financial institutions; and proposes disqualification of trust preferred securities and other hybrid capital securities from Tier 1 capital. Many of these provisions have begun to be or will be phased-in over the next several months or years and will be subject both to further rulemaking and the discretion of applicable regulatory bodies.   The Financial Reform Act will have a significant and negative impact on our earnings through fee reductions, higher costs and new restrictions, as well as reduce available capital and have a material adverse impact on the value of certain assets and liabilities held on our balance sheet. The ultimate impact of the final rules on our businesses and results of operations will depend on regulatory interpretation and rulemaking, as well as the success of any of our actions to mitigate the negative earnings impact of certain provisions. Two of the major credit ratings agencies have indicated that enactment of the Financial Reform Act, including regulators’ interpretation or rulemaking thereunder, may at some point result in a downgrade of our credit ratings. One of these ratings agencies placed our and certain other banks’ credit ratings on negative outlook based on an earlier version of financial reform legislation, and the other ratings agency placed our and other banks’ credit ratings on negative outlook shortly after the Financial Reform Act was signed into law. It remains unclear what other actions the ratings agencies may take as a result of enactment of the Financial Reform Act. However, in the event of certain credit ratings downgrades, our access to credit markets, liquidity and our related funding costs would be materially adversely affected. For additional information about our credit ratings, see Liquidity Risk and Capital Management on page 146.   The limits to be placed on debit interchange fees will significantly reduce our debit card interchange revenues. Interchange fees, or “swipe” fees, are charges that merchants pay to us and other credit card companies and card-issuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions. The legislation, which provides the Federal Reserve with authority over interchange fees received or charged by a card issuer, requires that fees must be “reasonable and proportional” to the costs of processing such transactions. The Federal Reserve has nine months from the date of enactment of the Financial Reform Act to provide clarification on the rules, which are to become effective one year from the enactment of the Financial Reform Act. In issuing regulations, the Federal Reserve must consider the functional similarity between debit card transactions and traditional checking transactions and the incremental costs incurred by a card issuer in processing a particular debit card transaction. In addition, the legislation prohibits card issuers and networks from entering into exclusive arrangements requiring that debit card transactions be processed on a single network or only two affiliated networks, and allows merchants to determine transaction routing.   As previously announced on July 16, 2010, as a result of the Financial Reform Act and its related rules and subject to final rulemaking over the next year, we believe that our debit card revenue will be adversely impacted beginning in the third quarter of  143    Table of Contents  2011. Our consumer and small business card products, including the debit card business, are part of an integrated platform within the Global Card Services business segment. Based on our current estimates of the revenue impact to this business segment, we recorded a non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge for Global Card Services in the three months ended September 30, 2010 of $10.4 billion. The impairment charge, which is a non-cash item, had no impact on our reported Tier 1 and tangible equity ratios. For more information on goodwill and the impairment charge, refer to Note 9 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Complex Accounting Estimates on page 201.   On May 22, 2009, the CARD Act was signed into law. The majority of the CARD Act provisions became effective in February 2010. The CARD Act legislation contains comprehensive credit card reform related to credit card industry practices including significantly restricting banks’ ability to change interest rates and assess fees to reflect individual consumer risk, changing the way payments are applied and requiring changes to consumer credit card disclosures. The provisions of the CARD Act negatively impacted net interest income and card income during the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and are expected to negatively impact future net interest income due to the restrictions on our ability to reprice credit cards based on risk, and card income due to restrictions imposed on certain fees. The 2010 full-year decrease in revenue is expected to be approximately $1 billion after-tax.   On November 12, 2009, the Federal Reserve issued amendments to Regulation E which implements the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. The rules became effective on July 1, 2010 for new customers and August 16, 2010 for existing customers. These amendments limit the way we and other banks charge an overdraft fee for non-recurring debit card transactions that overdraw a consumer’s account unless the consumer affirmatively consents to the bank’s payment of overdrafts for those transactions. Under previously announced plans, we do not offer customers the opportunity to opt-in to overdraft services related to non-recurring debit card transactions. However, customers are able to opt-in on a withdrawal-by-withdrawal basis to access cash through the Bank of America ATM network where the bank is able to alert customers that the transaction may overdraw their account and result in a fee if they choose to proceed. The impact of Regulation E in the third quarter was a reduction in service charges of approximately $375 million pre-tax. The 2010 full-year decrease in revenue related to the implementation of Regulation E and the impact of overdraft policy changes is expected to be approximately $1 billion after-tax.   For information on certain Basel Committee on Banking Supervision consultative documents and proposed capital requirements, see Basel Regulatory Capital Requirements on page 153.   On January 21, 2010, the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, FDIC and Office of Thrift Supervision (collectively, joint agencies) issued a final rule regarding risk-based capital requirements related to the impact of the adoption of new consolidation guidance. The impact on the Corporation on January 1, 2010, due to the new consolidation guidance and the final rule was an increase in risk-weighted assets of $21.3 billion and a reduction in capital of $9.7 billion. The overall effect of the new consolidation guidance and the final rule was a decrease in Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common ratios of 76 bps and 73 bps. For more information, see the Impact of Adopting New Consolidation Guidance section on page 103 and Liquidity Risk and Capital Management beginning on page 146.   On July 27, 2010, the U.K. government enacted a law change reducing the corporate income tax rate by one percent effective for the 2011 U.K. tax financial year beginning on April 1, 2011. For additional information, see Financial Highlights – Income Tax Expense on page 102.   In the U.K., the Corporation sells payment protection insurance (PPI) through its Global Card Services business to credit card customers and has previously sold this insurance to consumer loan customers. In response to an elevated level of customer complaints of misleading sales tactics across the industry, heightened media coverage and pressure from consumer advocacy groups, the U.K. Financial Services Authority (FSA) has investigated and raised concerns about the way some companies have handled complaints relating to the sale of these insurance policies. For additional information on PPI, see Note 11 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements – Payment Protection Insurance Claim Matter on page 58.   The U.K. has adopted increased capital and liquidity requirements for local financial institutions, including regulated U.K. subsidiaries of foreign bank holding companies and other financial institutions as well as branches of foreign banks located in the U.K. In addition, the U.K. has proposed the creation and production of recovery and resolution plans (commonly referred to as living wills) by such entities. We are currently monitoring the impact of these initiatives.   On February 23, 2010, regulators issued clarifying guidance, effective in the first quarter of 2010, on modified consumer real estate loans that specifies criteria required to demonstrate a borrower’s capacity to repay the modified loan. In connection with this guidance, we reviewed our modified consumer real estate loans and determined that a portion of these loans did not meet the criteria and, therefore, were deemed collateral dependent. The guidance requires that modified loans deemed to be collateral dependent be written down to their estimated collateral value which resulted in $59 million of  144    Table of Contents  net charge-offs during the three months ended September 30, 2010, of which $38 million were home equity and $21 million were residential mortgage. In addition, the guidance resulted in $1.0 billion of net charge-offs during the nine months ended September 30, 2010 of which $809 million were home equity, $196 million were residential mortgage and $9 million were discontinued real estate.   On March 4, 2009, the U.S. Treasury provided details related to the $75 billion Making Home Affordable program (MHA) which is focused on reducing the number of foreclosures and making it easier for customers to refinance loans. The MHA consists of the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) which provides guidelines on first-lien loan modifications, and the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) which provides guidelines for loan refinancing. For additional information, refer to page 44, Regulatory Initiatives section in the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report and the paragraphs below.   As part of the MHA program, on April 28, 2009, the U.S. government announced intentions to create the second lien modification program (2MP) that is designed to reduce the monthly payments on qualifying home equity loans and lines of credit under certain conditions, including completion of a HAMP modification on the first mortgage on the property. This program provides incentives to lenders to modify all eligible loans that fall under the guidelines of this program. Additional clarification on government guidelines for the program was announced in the first quarter of 2010. On April 8, 2010, we began early implementation of the 2MP with the mailing of trial modification offers to eligible home equity customers. We will modify eligible second liens under this initiative regardless of whether the MHA modified “first lien” is serviced by Bank of America or another participating servicer.   On April 5, 2010, we implemented the Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives (HAFA) program, which is another addition to the HAMP, that assists borrowers with non-retention options instead of foreclosure. The HAFA program provides incentives to lenders to assist all eligible borrowers that fall under the guidelines of this program. Our first goal is to work with the borrower to determine if a loan modification or other homeownership retention solution is available before pursuing non-retention options such as short sales. Short sales are an important option for homeowners who are facing financial difficulty and do not have a viable option to remain in the home. HAFA’s short sale guidelines are designed to streamline and standardize the process and will be compatible with Bank of America’s new cooperative short sale program.   During the nine months ended September 30, 2010, 209,000 loan modifications were completed with a total unpaid principal balance of $48.1 billion, including 84,000 customers who were converted from trial-period to permanent modifications under the HAMP. In addition, on March 26, 2010, the U.S. government announced new changes to the MHA program guidelines that will include principal forgiveness options to the HAMP for a sub-segment of qualified HAMP borrowers. The details around eligibility, forgiveness arrangements, and the incentive structures are still being finalized and are not available at the time of this filing; however, the implementation of these changes is anticipated for the fourth quarter of 2010.   In addition to the programs described above, we have implemented several programs designed to help our customers. For information on these programs, refer to Credit Risk Management beginning on page 155. We will continue to help our customers address financial challenges through these government programs and our own home retention programs.     Managing Risk   Given our wide range of business activities as well as the competitive dynamics, the regulatory environment and the geographic span of such activities, risk taking is an inherent activity for the Corporation. Our business exposes us to strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. The Corporation’s risk management infrastructure is continually evolving to meet the challenges posed by the increased complexity of the financial services industry and markets, by our increased size and global footprint, and by the recent financial crisis. We have redefined our risk framework and articulated a risk appetite approved by the Corporation’s Board of Directors (the Board). While many of these processes, and roles and responsibilities continue to evolve and mature, we continue to enhance our risk management process with a focus on clarity of roles and accountabilities, escalation of issues, aggregation of risk and data across the enterprise, and effective governance characterized by clarity and transparency.   We take a comprehensive approach to risk management. Risk management planning is fully integrated with strategic, financial and customer/client planning so that goals and responsibilities are aligned across the organization. Risk is managed in a systematic manner by focusing on the Corporation as a whole and managing risk across the enterprise and within individual business units, products, services and transactions. We maintain a governance structure that delineates the responsibilities for risk management activities, as well as governance and oversight of those activities, by executive management and the Board. For a more detailed discussion of our risk management activities, see pages 44 through 87 of the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  145    Table of Contents     Strategic Risk Management   Strategic risk is embedded in every line of business and is one of the major risk categories along with credit, market, liquidity, compliance and operational risks. It is the risk that results from adverse business decisions, ineffective or inappropriate business plans, or failure to respond to changes in the competitive environment, business cycles, customer preferences, product obsolescence, regulatory environment, business strategy execution and resulting reputation risk. In the financial services industry, strategic risk is high due to changing customer, competitive and regulatory environments. The Corporation’s appetite for strategic risk is assessed within the context of the strategic plan, with strategic risks selectively and carefully taken to maintain relevance in the evolving marketplace. Strategic risk is managed in the context of our overall financial condition and assessed, managed and acted on by the Chief Executive Officer and executive management team. Significant strategic actions, such as material acquisitions or capital actions are reviewed and approved by the Board.   For more information on our Strategic Risk Management activities, refer to page 47 of the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Liquidity Risk and Capital Management  Funding and Liquidity Risk Management   We define liquidity risk as the potential inability to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations, on- or off-balance sheet, as they come due. Our primary liquidity objective is to ensure adequate funding for our businesses throughout market cycles, including periods of financial stress. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk, maintain excess liquidity and access diverse funding sources including our stable deposit base. We define excess liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our funding requirements as those obligations arise.   Global funding and liquidity risk management activities are centralized within Corporate Treasury. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity risk management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. For additional information regarding Funding and Liquidity Risk Management, see the discussion that follows and refer to page 47 of the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Global Excess Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets   We maintain excess liquidity available to the parent company, Bank of America Corporation, and selected subsidiaries in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that together serve as our primary means of liquidity risk mitigation. We call these assets our “Global Excess Liquidity Sources,” and we limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS and a select group of non-U.S. government securities. We believe we can quickly obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed market conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold these assets in entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities.   Our global excess liquidity sources increased $110 billion to $324 billion at September 30, 2010 compared to $214 billion at December 31, 2009 and were maintained as presented in the table below. This increase was due primarily to liquidity generated by our bank subsidiaries through loan repayments combined with lower loan demand and other factors.                          Table 13                    Global Excess Liquidity Sources       September 30     December 31     (Dollars in billions)   2010     2009           Parent company   $ 119     $ 99     Bank subsidiaries     176       89     Broker/dealers     29       26         Total global excess liquidity sources   $ 324     $ 214           146    Table of Contents   As noted above, the excess liquidity available to the parent company is held in cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities and totaled $119 billion and $99 billion at September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009. Typically, parent company cash is deposited overnight with Bank of America, N.A.   Our bank subsidiaries’ excess liquidity sources at September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009 consisted of $176 billion and $89 billion in cash on deposit at the Federal Reserve and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. These amounts are distinct from the cash deposited by the parent company, as described above. In addition to their excess liquidity sources, our bank subsidiaries hold significant amounts of other unencumbered securities that we believe could also be used to generate liquidity, such as investment grade ABS and municipal bonds. Another way our bank subsidiaries can generate incremental liquidity is by pledging a range of other unencumbered loans and securities to certain Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically identified eligible assets was approximately $193 billion and $187 billion at September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries may only be used to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries and may not be transferred to the parent company or other nonbank subsidiaries.   Our broker/dealer subsidiaries’ excess liquidity sources at September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009 consisted of $29 billion and $26 billion in cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Our broker/dealers also held significant amounts of other unencumbered securities we believe could be utilized to generate additional liquidity, including investment grade corporate bonds, ABS and equities. Liquidity held in a broker/dealer subsidiary may only be available to meet the liquidity requirements of that entity and may not be transferred to the parent company or other subsidiaries.  Time to Required Funding and Stress Modeling   We use a variety of metrics to determine the appropriate amounts of excess liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our bank and broker/dealer subsidiaries. The primary metric we use to evaluate the appropriate level of excess liquidity at the parent company is “Time to Required Funding.” This debt coverage measure indicates the number of months that the parent company can continue to meet its unsecured contractual obligations as they come due using only its Global Excess Liquidity Sources without issuing any new debt or accessing any additional liquidity sources. We define unsecured contractual obligations for purposes of this metric as maturities of senior or subordinated debt issued or guaranteed by Bank of America Corporation or Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., including certain unsecured debt instruments, primarily structured notes, which we may be required to settle for cash prior to maturity. The Asset Liability Market Risk Committee (ALMRC) has established a minimum target for Time to Required Funding of 21 months. Time to Required Funding was 23 months at September 30, 2010 compared to 25 months at December 31, 2009.   We also utilize liquidity stress models to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of excess liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our bank and broker/dealer subsidiaries. We use these models to analyze our potential contractual and contingent cash outflows and liquidity requirements under a range of scenarios with varying levels of severity and time horizons. These scenarios incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific events, including potential credit rating downgrades for the parent company and our subsidiaries. We consider and utilize scenarios based on historical experience, regulatory guidance, and both expected and unexpected future events.  Diversified Funding Sources   We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits and secured and unsecured liabilities through a globally coordinated funding strategy. We diversify our funding globally across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor bases.   We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposit base which was $977 billion and $992 billion at September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009. Deposits are primarily generated by our Deposits, Global Commercial Banking, GWIM and GBAM segments. These deposits are diversified by clients, product type and geography. Some of our domestic deposits are insured by the FDIC. We consider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of funding. We believe this deposit funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources.   Our trading activities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements; these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. We believe funding these activities in the secured financing markets is more cost-efficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing. Repurchase agreements are generally short-term and often occur overnight. Disruptions in secured financing markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant  147    Table of Contents  reductions in the availability of such financing. We manage the liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding globally from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when appropriate.   In addition, our parent company, bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries regularly access short-term secured and unsecured markets through federal funds purchased, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings to support customer activities, short-term financing requirements and cash management.   The table below presents information for short-term borrowings.

For average and period-end balance discussions, see Balance Sheet Analysis beginning on page 103.   We issue the majority of our long-term unsecured debt at the parent company and Bank of America, N.A. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2010, the parent company issued $10.1 billion and $23.5 billion of long-term senior unsecured debt. During the nine months ended September 30, 2010, Bank of America N.A. issued $3.5 billion of long-term senior unsecured debt, all of which was issued in the first quarter of 2010.   The primary benefits of our centralized funding strategy include greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations, time zone differences or other business considerations make parent company funding impractical, certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt.   We issue long-term unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. While the cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or the Corporation, we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month or quarter.  148    Table of Contents   At September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, our long-term debt was in the currencies presented in the table below.

We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For further details on our ALM activities, refer to Interest Rate Risk Management for Nontrading Activities beginning on page 195.   We also diversify our funding sources by issuing various types of debt instruments including structured notes, which are debt obligations that pay investors with returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these notes with derivative positions and/or in the underlying instruments so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to immediately settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. We had outstanding structured notes of $57 billion at both September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009.   Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity, or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price.   For additional information on debt funding, see Note 13 – Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information regarding Funding and Liquidity Risk Management, refer to pages 47 through 49 of the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Credit Ratings  Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly impacted by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions including over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. Thus, it is our objective to maintain high-quality credit ratings.   Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions subject to ongoing review by the ratings agencies and may change from time to time. The ratings agencies regularly review our performance, prospects and financial condition, and our securities and reevaluate their ratings of our long-term debt, short-term borrowings and other securities, including asset securitizations. These evaluations are based on a number of factors, including our own financial strength and operations as well as factors not under our control such as rating-agency-specific criteria or frameworks and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. In light of the recent difficulties in the financial services industry and the financial markets, there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings.   During 2009 and 2010, the ratings agencies have taken numerous actions, many of which were negative, to adjust our credit ratings and the outlooks for those ratings. Currently, Bank of America Corporation’s long-term senior debt and outlook expressed by the ratings agencies are as follows: A2 (negative) by Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. (Moody’s), A (negative) by Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (S&P), and A+ (Rating Watch Negative) by Fitch, Inc. (Fitch). Bank of America, N.A.’s long-term debt and outlook currently are as follows: A+ (negative), Aa3 (negative) and A+ (Rating Watch Negative) by those same three credit rating agencies,  149    Table of Contents  respectively. The ratings agencies have indicated that our credit ratings currently reflect their expectation that, if necessary, we would receive significant support from the U.S. government but all three ratings agencies have indicated they will reevaluate, and could reduce the uplift they include in our ratings for government support for reasons arising from financial services regulatory reform proposals or legislation. In February 2010, S&P affirmed our current credit ratings but revised the outlook to negative from stable based on its belief that it is less certain whether the U.S. government would be willing to provide extraordinary support. Also, on July 27, 2010, Moody’s affirmed our current ratings but revised the outlook to negative from stable due to its expectation for lower levels of government support over time as a result of the passage of the Financial Reform Act. Also, on October 22, 2010, Fitch placed our credit ratings on Rating Watch Negative from stable outlook due to proposed regulation that could negatively impact its assessment of future systemic government support. Other factors that influence our credit ratings include changes to the ratings agencies’ methodologies, the ratings agencies’ assessment of the general operating environment, our relative positions in the markets in which we compete, reputation, liquidity position, the level and volatility of earnings, corporate governance and risk management policies, capital position, capital management practices and current or future regulatory and legislative initiatives.   A reduction in certain of our credit ratings or the ratings of certain asset-backed securitizations would likely have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, access to credit markets, the related cost of funds, our businesses and on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where counterparty creditworthiness is critical. If Bank of America Corporation’s or Bank of America, N.A.’s commercial paper or short-term credit ratings (which currently have the following ratings: P-1 by Moody’s, A-1 by S&P and F1+ by Fitch) were downgraded by one or more levels, the effect on our incremental cost of funds and potential lost funding would be material. For information regarding the additional collateral and termination payments that would be required in connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements as a result of such a credit ratings downgrade, see Note 4 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.   The credit ratings of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. from the three major credit ratings agencies are the same as those of Bank of America Corporation. The major credit ratings agencies have indicated that the primary drivers of Merrill Lynch’s credit ratings are Bank of America Corporations’s credit ratings.  Regulatory Capital   To meet minimum, adequately capitalized regulatory requirements, an institution must maintain a Tier 1 capital ratio of four percent and a Total capital ratio of eight percent. A “well-capitalized” institution must generally maintain capital ratios 200 bps higher than the minimum guidelines. The risk-based capital rules have been further supplemented by a Tier 1 leverage ratio, defined as Tier 1 capital divided by quarterly average total assets, after certain adjustments. “Well-capitalized” bank holding companies must have a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of four percent. National banks must maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least five percent to be classified as “well-capitalized.” At September 30, 2010, the Corporation’s Tier 1 capital, Total capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios were 11.16 percent, 15.65 percent and 7.21 percent, respectively. This classifies the Corporation as “well-capitalized” for regulatory purposes, the highest classification.   Certain corporate-sponsored trust companies which issue trust preferred securities are not consolidated. In accordance with Federal Reserve guidance, the Federal Reserve currently allows the trust preferred securities to qualify as Tier 1 capital with revised quantitative limits that will be effective on March 31, 2011. As a result, we include trust preferred securities in Tier 1 capital. The Financial Reform Act includes a provision under which our previously issued and outstanding trust preferred securities in the aggregate amount of $19.9 billion (approximately 135 bps of Tier 1 capital) at September 30, 2010, will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital effective January 1, 2013. This amount excludes $1.6 billion of hybrid trust preferred securities that are expected to be converted to preferred stock prior to the date of implementation. The exclusion of trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital will be phased in “incrementally” over a three-year phase-in period. The treatment of trust preferred securities during the phase-in period remains unclear and is subject to future rulemaking. Current limits restrict core capital elements to 15 percent of total core capital elements for internationally active bank holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve revised the qualitative standards for capital instruments included in regulatory capital. Internationally active bank holding companies are those that have significant activities in non-U.S. markets with consolidated assets greater than $250 billion or on-balance sheet foreign exposure greater than $10 billion. At September 30, 2010, our restricted core capital elements comprised 11.5 percent of total core capital elements. We expect to remain fully compliant with the revised limits prior to the implementation date of March 31, 2011.   The Corporation calculates Tier 1 common capital as Tier 1 capital including any CES less preferred stock, qualifying trust preferred securities, hybrid securities and qualifying noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries. CES was included in Tier 1 common capital based upon applicable regulatory guidance and our expectation at December 31, 2009 that the underlying  150    Table of Contents  Common Equivalent Junior Preferred Stock, Series S would convert into common stock following shareholder approval of additional authorized shares. Shareholders approved the increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock at a special meeting of stockholders held on February 23, 2010 and the Common Equivalent Stock converted to common stock on February 24, 2010.   Tier 1 common capital increased $4.4 billion to $124.8 billion at September 30, 2010 compared to $120.4 billion at December 31, 2009. The Tier 1 common capital ratio increased 64 bps to 8.45 percent. The ratio increase was driven by the $9.4 billion in earnings generated for the first nine months in 2010 (excluding the goodwill impairment charge of $10.4 billion) partially offset by the $6.2 billion charge, net-of-tax, for the cumulative effect of the adoption of the new consolidation guidance primarily related to the increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses. In addition, risk-weighted assets decreased $65.7 billion primarily due to declines in loans, available-for-sale securities and letters of credit. The goodwill impairment charge does not impact regulatory capital ratios.

Enterprise-wide Stress Testing   As a part of our core risk management practices, the Corporation conducts enterprise-wide stress tests on a periodic basis to better understand earnings, capital and liquidity sensitivities to certain economic and business scenarios, including economic conditions that are more severe than anticipated. These enterprise-wide stress tests provide an understanding of the potential impacts to our risk profile, capital and liquidity. Scenarios are selected by a group comprised of senior line of business, risk and finance executives. Impacts to each line of business from each scenario are then determined and analyzed, primarily leveraging the models and processes utilized in everyday management routines. Impacts are assessed along with potential mitigating actions that may be taken. Analysis from such stress scenarios is compiled for and reviewed through our Risk Oversight Committee (ROC), ALMRC and the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Board and serves to inform and be incorporated, along with other core business processes, into decision making by management and the Board. The Corporation continues to invest in and improve stress testing capabilities as a core business process.  Regulatory Capital Impact of Final Rule on Adopting New Consolidation Guidance   On January 21, 2010, the joint agencies issued a final rule regarding risk-based capital and the impact of new consolidation guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The final rule allows for a phase-in period for a maximum of one year for the effect on risk-weighted assets and the regulatory limit on the inclusion of the allowance for loan and lease losses in Tier 2 capital related to the assets that are consolidated. The Corporation elected to forgo the phase-in period and consolidated the amounts for regulatory capital purposes as of January 1, 2010. The incremental impact to the Corporation on January 1, 2010, was an increase in assets of $100.4 billion and risk-weighted assets of $21.3 billion and a reduction in capital of $9.7 billion. The overall effect of the new consolidation guidance and the final rule was a decrease in Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common capital ratios of 76 bps and 73 bps. For more information  152    Table of Contents  on the impact of the new consolidation guidance, refer to Note 8 — Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Basel Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements   In June 2004, the Basel II Accord was published with the intent of more closely aligning regulatory capital requirements with underlying risks, similar to economic capital. While economic capital is measured to cover unexpected losses, the Corporation also manages regulatory capital to adhere to regulatory standards of capital adequacy.   The Basel II Final Rule (Basel II Rules), which was published on December 7, 2007, establishes requirements for the U.S. implementation and provides detailed capital requirements for credit and operational risk (Pillar 1), supervisory requirements (Pillar 2) and disclosure requirements (Pillar 3). We began Basel II parallel implementation on April 1, 2010.   Financial institutions are required to successfully complete a minimum parallel qualification period before receiving regulatory approval to report regulatory capital using the Basel II methodology. During the parallel period, the resulting capital calculations under both the current risk-based capital rules and the Basel II Rules will be reported to the financial institutions’ regulatory supervisors for at least four consecutive quarterly periods. Once the parallel period is successfully completed, the financial institutions will utilize Basel II as the methodology for calculating regulatory capital. A three-year transitional floor period will follow after which use of Basel I will be discontinued.   In July 2009, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Committee) released a consultative document entitled “Revisions to the Basel II Market Risk Framework” that would significantly increase the capital requirements for trading book activities if adopted as proposed. The proposal recommended implementation by December 31, 2010, but regulatory agencies continue to evaluate the proposed rulemaking and related impacts before establishing final rules. While the proposal originally recommended implementation by December 31, 2010, implementation is now targeted by December 31, 2011 but U.S. regulators have not yet issued final regulations. We continue to evaluate the capital impact of the rules as proposed and currently anticipate being fully compliant with the revised rules by the fourth quarter of 2011.   In December 2009, the Committee issued a consultative document entitled “Strengthening the Resilience of the Banking Sector,” with additional guidance published in July and September 2010 describing pending changes to the December consultative document. This document has become known as “Basel III”. The Committee expects to issue final rules by year-end 2010 and is calling for regulators to implement regulations by year-end 2012. If adopted as proposed, the rules could significantly increase capital requirements for the Corporation. The consultative document and the Financial Reform Act propose disqualification of trust preferred securities and other hybrid capital securities from Tier 1 capital treatment with the Financial Reform Act proposing to be phased in over the period from 2013 to 2015. The consultative document also proposes the potential capital deduction of certain assets (deferred tax assets, MSRs and investments in financial firms within prescribed limitations certain of which may be significant), increased capital for counterparty credit risk, and new minimum capital and buffer requirements. The phase-in period for these capital deductions is currently proposed to be in 20 percent increments during 2014 through 2018 with full implementation by December 2018. For additional information on our MSRs, refer to Note 16 – Mortgage Servicing Rights to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information on deferred tax assets, refer to Note 19 – Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.   The guidance published in July and clarified in September 2010 proposed the inclusion of three capital buffers to strengthen capital levels which would be phased in over time. These buffers include a 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer to be comprised of common equity after certain deductions to be phased in beginning in 2016. Additionally, the proposal includes a counter-cyclical buffer, with a proposed upper limit of 2.5 percent. This buffer is to be comprised of loss absorbing capital, such as common equity and is meant to retain additional capital during periods of strong credit expansion, providing incremental protection in the event of a material market downturn. The third proposed buffer is a systemic buffer, which currently does not have prescribed limits. This buffer is specific to systemically important financial institutions. The counter-cyclical and systemic buffers are scheduled to be phased in over 2013 through 2019. Beginning in January 2013 we would be required to maintain a Tier 1 common equity minimum capital ratio of 3.5 percent, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5 percent and an 8 percent total capital ratio. The common equity and Tier 1 capital ratios will also be subject to incremental increases to be phased in over time. These ratios will increase to 4.5 percent and 6.0 percent by January 1, 2015. We continue to monitor the development and potential impact of these proposals, and have determined that given current initiatives and continued focus on these proposals that by the date of full implementation of these proposals in 2018, we must have a Tier 1 common capital ratio of seven percent which we anticipate we will meet. We do not expect the need to issue any common stock to meet the new Basel proposals.   In addition to the capital proposals, in December 2009 the Committee issued a consultative document entitled “International framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring,” introducing two new measures of liquidity risk. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio identifies the amount of unencumbered, high quality liquid assets a financial institution holds that can be used to offset the net cash outflows the institution would encounter under an acute 30-day stress scenario. The Net Stable Funding Ratio measures the amount of longer-term, stable sources of funding employed by a financial institution relative to the liquidity profiles of the assets funded and the potential for contingent calls on funding liquidity arising from off-balance sheet commitments and obligations, over a one-year period. These two minimum liquidity standards are also considered part of “Basel III”. Following further guidance published in July and September 2010, the Committee expects the Liquidity Coverage Ratio to be implemented in January 2015 and the Net Stable Funding Ratio in January 2018, following observation periods beginning in 2011 and 2012, respectively. We continue to monitor the development and potential impact of these proposals.  153    Table of Contents  Common Share Issuances and Repurchases   On February 24, 2010, 1.286 billion shares of common stock were issued through the conversion of Common Equivalent Stock into common stock.
