Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any of the Corporation's subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission filings: the Corporation's ability to resolve representations and warranties repurchase and related claims and the chance that the Corporation could face related servicing, securities, fraud, indemnity, contribution or other claims from one or more counterparties, including trustees, purchasers of loans, underwriters, issuers, other parties involved in securitizations, monolines or private-label and other investors; the possibility that final court approval of negotiated settlements is not obtained, including the possibility that all of the conditions necessary to obtain final approval of the BNY Mellon Settlement do not occur; the possibility that future representations and warranties losses may occur in excess of the Corporation's recorded liability and estimated range of possible loss for its representations and warranties exposures; the possibility that the Corporation may not collect mortgage insurance claims; potential claims, damages, penalties, fines and reputational damage resulting from pending or future litigation and regulatory proceedings, including the possibility that amounts may be in excess of the Corporation's recorded liability and estimated range of possible losses for litigation exposures; the possibility that the European Commission will impose remedial measures in relation to its investigation of the Corporation's competitive practices; the possible outcome of LIBOR, other reference rate and foreign exchange inquiries and investigations; uncertainties about the financial stability and growth rates of non-U.S. jurisdictions, the risk that those jurisdictions may face difficulties servicing their sovereign debt, and related stresses on financial markets, currencies and trade, and the Corporation's exposures to such risks, including direct, indirect and operational; the impact of U.S. and global interest rates, currency exchange rates and economic conditions; the impact on the Corporation's business, financial condition and results of operations of a potential higher interest rate environment; adverse changes to the Corporation's credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies; estimates of the fair value of certain of the Corporation's assets and liabilities; uncertainty regarding the content, timing and impact of regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, including, but not limited to, any G-SIB surcharge; the possibility that in connection with our effort to exit our Advanced approaches parallel run, our internal analytical models will either not be approved by U.S. banking regulators, or will be approved with significant modifications, which could, for example, increase our risk-weighted assets and, as a result, negatively impact our capital ratios under the Advanced approaches, including an estimated 100 bps negative impact to our Common equity tier 1 ratio; the possible impact of Federal Reserve actions on the Corporation's capital plans; the impact of implementation and compliance with new and evolving U.S. and international regulations, including, but not limited to, recovery and resolution planning requirements, the Volcker Rule and derivatives regulations; the impact of the U.K tax law change limiting how much net operating losses can offset annual profit; a failure in or breach of the Corporation's operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, including as a result of cyber attacks and other similar matters.Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Corporation undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statement was made.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements referred to in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) are incorporated by reference into the MD&A. Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. Throughout the MD&A, the Corporation uses certain acronyms and abbreviations which are defined in the Glossary. 3Table of ContentsExecutive Summary Business OverviewThe Corporation is a Delaware corporation, a bank holding company (BHC) and a financial holding company. When used in this report, "the Corporation" may refer to Bank of America Corporation individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation's subsidiaries or affiliates. Our principal executive offices are located in Charlotte, North Carolina. Through our banking and various nonbank subsidiaries throughout the U.S. and in international markets, we provide a diversified range of banking and nonbank financial services and products. We operate our banking activities primarily under the Bank of America, National Association (Bank of America, N.A. or BANA) charter. At March 31, 2015, the Corporation had approximately $2.1 trillion in assets and approximately 220,000 full-time equivalent employees.In the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, we reported our results of operations through five business segments: Consumer & Business Banking (CBB), Consumer Real Estate Services (CRES), Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), Global Banking and Global Markets, with the remaining operations recorded in All Other. Effective January 1, 2015, to align the segments with how we manage the businesses in 2015, we changed our basis of presentation, and following such change, we report our results of operations through the following five business segments: Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), Global Banking, Global Markets and Legacy Assets & Servicing (LAS), with the remaining operations recorded in All Other. The Home Loans business, which was included in the former CRES segment, is now included in Consumer Banking, and LAS (also in the former CRES segment) has become a separate segment. A portion of the Business Banking business, based on the size of the client, was moved from the former CBB segment to Global Banking, and the former CBB segment was renamed Consumer Banking. Also, our merchant services joint venture moved from the former CBB segment to All Other. In addition, certain management accounting methodologies, including the treatment of intersegment assets and liabilities, and related allocations were refined. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. As of March 31, 2015, we operated in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and more than 35 countries. Our retail banking footprint covers approximately 80 percent of the U.S. population, and we serve approximately 48 million consumer and small business relationships with approximately 4,800 financial centers, 15,900 ATMs, nationwide call centers, and leading online and mobile banking platforms (www.bankofamerica.com). We offer industry-leading support to approximately three million small business owners. Our industry leading wealth management and trust businesses, with client balances of $2.5 trillion, provide tailored solutions to meet client needs through a full set of brokerage, banking, trust and retirement products. We are a global leader in corporate and investment banking and trading across a broad range of asset classes serving corporations, governments, institutions and individuals around the world.First-Quarter 2015 Economic and Business EnvironmentIn the U.S., economic growth slowed in the first quarter of 2015, restrained by severe winter weather and other temporary factors, including the capital-spending impact of large oil price declines. Retail spending was weak, following an acceleration during the second half of 2014. In addition to reduced energy-industry investment, U.S. Dollar strength was a contributor to export weakness in the first quarter.In contrast, various measures showed continued gradual labor market improvement, though payroll gains weakened in March and wage gains remained historically low. The unemployment rate also continued to fall during the quarter, ending at 5.5 percent. The sharp decline in energy prices pushed inflation to just above zero during the quarter, while core inflation (excluding food and energy) also remained well below the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System's (Federal Reserve) longer-term annual target of two percent.In March 2015, the Federal Reserve continued to indicate that it would likely be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, but emphasized the need for further improvement in the labor market and reasonable confidence that inflation would move back to its two percent objective over the medium term.Internationally, despite anxiety over Greece, European prospects improved during the quarter, supported by lower energy prices and the European Central Bank's announcement of open-ended quantitative easing. Japanese growth during the first quarter of 2015 remained modest. With Chinese economic growth continuing to moderate, China's monetary authorities and central banks throughout developing Asia continue to display a preference towards easing. The large decline in energy prices, along with international sanctions, continued to pressure the declining Russian economy. 4Table of ContentsRecent EventsBNY Mellon SettlementOn March 5, 2015, the New York Appellate Division, First Department issued an order unanimously approving the Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon) Settlement in all respects, reversing the portion of the New York Supreme Court's decision not to approve the Trustee's conduct with respect to the Trustee's consideration of a potential claim that a loan must be repurchased if the servicer modifies its term. The deadline for further appeal has passed. The BNY Mellon Settlement remains subject to certain conditions, including that an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) private letter ruling be obtained confirming that the settlement will not impact the real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC) tax status of the trusts. As part of the BNY Mellon Settlement, agreement was reached on certain servicing related matters. For information on servicing matters associated with the BNY Mellon Settlement, see Mortgage-related Settlements – Servicing Matters on page 45, and for more information on the BNY Mellon Settlement, see Note 7 – Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Capital ManagementOn March 11, 2015, we announced that the Federal Reserve completed its 2015 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and advised that it did not object to our 2015 capital plan but gave a conditional, non-objection under which we are required to resubmit our capital plan by September 30, 2015 and address certain weaknesses identified in the capital planning process. The requested capital actions included a request to repurchase $4.0 billion of common stock over five quarters beginning in the second quarter of 2015, and to maintain the quarterly common stock dividend at the current rate of $0.05 per share. If identified weaknesses are not satisfactorily addressed when the Federal Reserve reviews our resubmitted capital plan, the Federal Reserve may restrict our future capital distributions. Pending the resubmission and Federal Reserve review, we are permitted, and intend to proceed with our stock repurchase program and to maintain our common stock dividend at the current rate. For additional information, see Capital Management on page 46. 5Table of ContentsSelected Financial DataTable 1 provides selected consolidated financial data for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, and at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.Table 1Selected Financial Data Three Months Ended March 31(Dollars in millions, except per share information)2015 2014Income statement   Revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis) (1)$21,421 $22,767Net income (loss)3,357 (276)Diluted earnings (loss) per common share (2)0.27 (0.05)Dividends paid per common share0.05 0.01Performance ratios   Return on average assets0.64% n/mReturn on average tangible common shareholders' equity (1)7.88 n/mEfficiency ratio (FTE basis) (1)73.27 97.68%Asset quality   Allowance for loan and lease losses at period end$13,676 $16,618Allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding at period end (3)1.57% 1.84%Nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties at period end (3)$12,101 $17,732Net charge-offs (4)1,194 1,388Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases outstanding (3, 4)0.56% 0.62%Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases outstanding, excluding the purchased credit-impaired loan portfolio (3)0.57 0.64Annualized net charge-offs and purchased credit-impaired write-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases outstanding (3)0.70 0.79Ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses at period end to annualized net charge-offs (4)2.82 2.95Ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses at period end to annualized net charge-offs, excluding the purchased credit-impaired loan portfolio2.55 2.58Ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses at period end to annualized net charge-offs and purchased credit-impaired write-offs2.28 2.30     March 31 2015 December 31 2014Balance sheet   Total loans and leases$877,956 $881,391Total assets2,143,545 2,104,534Total deposits1,153,168 1,118,936Total common shareholders' equity227,915 224,162Total shareholders' equity250,188 243,471Capital ratios under Basel 3 Standardized – Transition   Common equity tier 1 capital11.1% 12.3%Tier 1 capital12.3 13.4Total capital15.3 16.5Tier 1 leverage8.4 8.2(1) Fully taxable-equivalent basis (FTE), return on average tangible common shareholders' equity and the efficiency ratio are non-GAAP financial measures.

The results for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the prior-year period were primarily driven by a $5.6 billion decrease in litigation expense, as well as decreases in certain other noninterest expense categories, and lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower net interest income and noninterest income. Total assets increased $39.0 billion from December 31, 2014 to $2.1 trillion at March 31, 2015 primarily related to increased cash and cash equivalents resulting from strong domestic customer deposit inflows driven by seasonality. For additional information on the increase in total assets, see Executive Summary – Balance Sheet Overview on page 10. During the quarter, we maintained our strong capital position with Common equity tier 1 capital of $147.2 billion at March 31, 2015 compared to $141.2 billion at December 31, 2014 with estimated Common equity tier 1 capital ratios of 10.3 percent compared to 10.0 percent as measured under Basel 3 Standardized approach, on a fully phased-in basis. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 6.3 percent and 5.9 percent at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, both above the 5.0 percent required minimum. Our Global Excess Liquidity Sources were $478 billion with time-to-required funding at 37 months at March 31, 2015 compared to $439 billion and 39 months at December 31, 2014.

For more information on this measure and for a corresponding reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 14.Net Interest IncomeNet interest income on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis decreased $616 million to $9.7 billion, and the net interest yield on an FTE basis decreased 12 basis points (bps) to 2.17 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. These declines were driven by negative market-related adjustments, lower loan yields and consumer loan balances, and lower net interest income from the asset and liability management (ALM) portfolio. Market-related adjustments on debt securities resulted in an expense of $484 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to an expense of $273 million for the same period in 2014. Partially offsetting these declines were reductions in funding yields, lower long-term debt balances and commercial loan growth. Market-related adjustments include acceleration of premium amortization (or discount accretion) on debt securities as the decline in long-term interest rates shortened the estimated lives of mortgage-related debt securities. Also included in market-related adjustments is hedge ineffectiveness that impacted net interest income.

The following highlights the significant changes.•Investment and brokerage services income increased $109 million primarily from increased asset management fees driven by the impact of long-term assets under management (AUM) inflows and higher market levels.•Equity investment income decreased $757 million primarily driven by the gain on the sale of a portion of an equity investment in the first quarter of 2014.•Trading account profits decreased $220 million. Excluding net debit valuation adjustments (DVA), trading account profits decreased $259 million due to lower trading volumes driven by client flows primarily in our mortgage and credit-related businesses.•Mortgage banking income increased $282 million primarily driven by improved mortgage servicing rights (MSR) net-of-hedge performance, an increase in core production revenue and lower representations and warranties provision, partially offset by a decline in servicing fees.•Other income increased $81 million due to gains associated with the sales of residential mortgage loans, partially offset by a decrease in net DVA gains on structured liabilities.Provision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses decreased $244 million to $765 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The provision for credit losses was $429 million lower than net charge-offs, resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses. The decrease in provision for credit losses from the prior-year period was due to improvement in the credit card portfolios primarily driven by lower unemployment levels, as well as lower provision in the commercial portfolio, primarily in U.S. commercial. We expect reserve releases to be lower than the first quarter for the remaining quarters of 2015.Net charge-offs totaled $1.2 billion, or 0.56 percent of average loans and leases for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $1.4 billion, or 0.62 percent, for the same period in 2014. The decrease in net charge-offs was due to credit quality improvement across most major portfolios.

Litigation expense, which is included in other general operating expense, decreased $5.6 billion to $370 million as the first quarter of 2014 included costs associated with the settlement with the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the establishment of additional reserves primarily for legacy mortgage-related matters. Telecommunications expense decreased $199 million due to efficiencies gained as we have simplified our operating model, including in-sourcing certain functions. Professional fees decreased $137 million primarily due to lower default-related servicing expenses and legal fees. Personnel expense decreased $135 million as we have continued to streamline processes and achieve cost savings. Personnel expense included approximately $1.0 billion of annual retirement-eligible incentive costs in both periods.

The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2014 was also impacted by certain nondeductible accruals, largely offset by discrete tax benefits principally from the resolution of certain tax matters. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 30 percent, absent any unusual items, for the remainder of 2015. 9Table of ContentsBalance Sheet Overview   Table 6Selected Balance Sheet Data       Average Balance   March 31 2015 December 31 2014 % Change Three Months EndedMarch 31 % Change(Dollars in millions)   2015 2014 Assets           Cash and cash equivalents$162,543 $138,589 17 % $153,884 $140,828 9 %Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell206,708 191,823 8 213,931 212,504 1Trading account assets186,860 191,785 (3) 194,391 203,836 (5)Debt securities383,989 380,461 1 383,120 329,711 16Loans and leases877,956 881,391 — 872,393 919,482 (5)Allowance for loan and lease losses(13,676) (14,419) (5) (14,247) (17,144) (17)All other assets339,165 334,904 1 335,102 350,049 (4)Total assets$2,143,545 $2,104,534 2 $2,138,574 $2,139,266 —Liabilities           Deposits$1,153,168 $1,118,936 3 $1,130,725 $1,118,178 1Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase203,758 201,277 1 214,722 204,804 5Trading account liabilities74,791 74,192 1 78,787 90,449 (13)Short-term borrowings33,270 31,172 7 29,412 48,168 (39)Long-term debt237,858 243,139 (2) 240,127 253,678 (5)All other liabilities190,512 192,347 (1) 199,057 187,430 6Total liabilities1,893,357 1,861,063 2 1,892,830 1,902,707 (1)Shareholders' equity250,188 243,471 3 245,744 236,559 4Total liabilities and shareholders' equity$2,143,545 $2,104,534 2 $2,138,574 $2,139,266 —Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management activities, primarily involving our portfolios of highly liquid assets. These portfolios are designed to ensure the adequacy of capital while enhancing our ability to manage liquidity requirements for the Corporation and our customers, and to position the balance sheet in accordance with the Corporation's risk appetite. The execution of these activities requires the use of balance sheet and capital-related limits including spot, average and risk-weighted asset limits, particularly within the market-making activities of our trading businesses. One of our key regulatory metrics, Tier 1 leverage ratio, is calculated based on adjusted quarterly average total assets. 10Table of ContentsBalance Sheet AnalysisAssetsAt March 31, 2015, total assets were approximately $2.1 trillion, up $39.0 billion from December 31, 2014. The key drivers were increased cash and cash equivalents primarily due to higher interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve as a result of strong domestic deposit inflows driven by seasonality related to income tax refunds and growth in customer and client activity, higher securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell due to a shift in mix between reverse repos and debt securities and an increase in commercial loan balances. These increases were partially offset by a decline in consumer loan balances due to loan sales and portfolio run-off outpacing new originations, and a reduction in trading account assets.Average total assets remained relatively unchanged for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. Consumer loans declined primarily due to loan sales and continued portfolio run-off. There were also declines in all other assets primarily due to decreases in other nonearning assets, time deposits placed and customer receivables as well as lower trading account assets primarily due to a reduction in non-U.S. sovereign debt inventory. These decreases were largely offset by increases in debt securities due to a shift from whole loans to securities, an increase in U.S. Treasury holdings and increases in the valuation of the debt securities portfolio. There were also increases in cash and cash equivalents primarily driven by higher interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve and non-U.S. central banks and increases in derivative dealer assets.Liabilities and Shareholders' EquityAt March 31, 2015, total liabilities were approximately $1.9 trillion, up $32.3 billion from December 31, 2014, primarily driven by an increase in deposits as well as increases in securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase and short-term borrowings. The increases were partially offset by declines in long-term debt and all other liabilities.Average total liabilities decreased $9.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The decline was primarily driven by planned reductions in short-term borrowings driving decreases in Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances, decreases in long-term debt as maturities outpaced new issuances, and decreases in trading account liabilities primarily due to lower levels of short U.S. Treasury and non-U.S. sovereign debt positions. These decreases were partially offset by growth in deposits, increases in securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase and all other liabilities.Shareholders' equity of $250.2 billion at March 31, 2015 increased $6.7 billion from December 31, 2014 driven by preferred stock issuances, earnings and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) due to a positive net change in the fair value of available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities.Average shareholders' equity of $245.7 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2015 increased $9.2 billion from the same period in 2014 driven by preferred stock issuances, earnings and an increase in accumulated OCI due to a positive net change in the fair value of AFS debt securities. These increases were partially offset by common share repurchases. 11Table of ContentsTable 7    Selected Quarterly Financial Data     2015 Quarter 2014 Quarters(In millions, except per share information)First Fourth Third Second FirstIncome statement         Net interest income$9,451 $9,635 $10,219 $10,013 $10,085Noninterest income11,751 9,090 10,990 11,734 12,481Total revenue, net of interest expense21,202 18,725 21,209 21,747 22,566Provision for credit losses765 219 636 411 1,009Noninterest expense15,695 14,196 20,142 18,541 22,238Income (loss) before income taxes4,742 4,310 431 2,795 (681)Income tax expense (benefit)1,385 1,260 663 504 (405)Net income (loss)3,357 3,050 (232) 2,291 (276)Net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders2,975 2,738 (470) 2,035 (514)Average common shares issued and outstanding10,519 10,516 10,516 10,519 10,561Average diluted common shares issued and outstanding (1)11,267 11,274 10,516 11,265 10,561Performance ratios         Return on average assets0.64% 0.57% n/m 0.42% n/mFour quarter trailing return on average assets (2)0.39 0.23 0.24% 0.37 0.45%Return on average common shareholders' equity5.35 4.84 n/m 3.68 n/mReturn on average tangible common shareholders' equity (3)7.88 7.15 n/m 5.47 n/mReturn on average tangible shareholders' equity (3)7.85 7.08 n/m 5.64 n/mTotal ending equity to total ending assets11.67 11.57 11.24 10.94 10.79Total average equity to total average assets11.49 11.39 11.14 10.87 11.06Dividend payout17.68 19.21 n/m 5.16 n/mPer common share data         Earnings (loss)$0.28 $0.26 $(0.04) $0.19 $(0.05)Diluted earnings (loss) (1)0.27 0.25 (0.04) 0.19 (0.05)Dividends paid0.05 0.05 0.05 0.01 0.01Book value21.66 21.32 20.99 21.16 20.75Tangible book value (3)14.79 14.43 14.09 14.24 13.81Market price per share of common stock         Closing$15.39 $17.89 $17.05 $15.37 $17.20High closing17.90 18.13 17.18 17.34 17.92Low closing15.15 15.76 14.98 14.51 16.10Market capitalization$161,909 $188,141 $179,296 $161,628 $181,117(1) The diluted earnings (loss) per common share excluded the effect of any equity instruments that are antidilutive to earnings per share.

We believe managing the business with net interest income on an FTE basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.Certain performance measures including the efficiency ratio and net interest yield utilize net interest income (and thus total revenue) on an FTE basis. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield measures the bps we earn over the cost of funds.We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents an adjusted shareholders' equity or common shareholders' equity amount which has been reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders' equity and return on average tangible shareholders' equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals. These ratios are as follows:•Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted common shareholders' equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders' equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities.•Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders' equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders' equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities.•Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders' equity divided by ending common shares outstanding.The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Tables 7 and 8.We evaluate our business segment results based on measures that utilize average allocated capital. Return on average allocated capital is calculated as net income adjusted for cost of funds and earnings credits and certain expenses related to intangibles, divided by average allocated capital. Allocated capital and the related return both represent non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, for purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation utilizes allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying value of its reporting units. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. For additional information, see Business Segment Operations on page 22 and Note 8 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Tables 8 and 9 provide reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation and our segments. Other companies may define or calculate these measures and ratios differently.Table 8Quarterly Supplemental Financial Data and Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures 2015 Quarter 2014

As discussed in Global Markets on page 33, we evaluate our sales and trading results and strategies on a total market-based revenue approach by combining net interest income and noninterest income for Global Markets. An analysis of net interest income, average earning assets and net interest yield on earning assets, all of which adjust for the impact of trading-related net interest income from reported net interest income on an FTE basis, is shown below. We believe the use of this non-GAAP presentation in Table 10 provides additional clarity in assessing our results.Table 10Net Interest Income Excluding Trading-related Net Interest Income Three Months Ended March 31(Dollars in millions)2015 2014Net interest income (FTE basis)   As reported$9,670 $10,286Impact of trading-related net interest income(917) (905)Net interest income excluding trading-related net interest income (1)$8,753 $9,381Average earning assets   As reported$1,804,399 $1,803,297Impact of trading-related earning assets(418,214) (442,700)Average earning assets excluding trading-related earning assets (1)$1,386,185 $1,360,597Net interest yield contribution (FTE basis) (2)   As reported2.17% 2.29%Impact of trading-related activities0.38 0.48Net interest yield on earning assets excluding trading-related activities (1)2.55% 2.77%(1) Represents a non-GAAP financial measure.(2) Calculated on an annualized basis.For the three months ended March 31, 2015, net interest income excluding trading-related net interest income decreased $628 million to $8.8 billion compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease was due to the negative market-related adjustments, lower loan yields and consumer loan balances, and lower net interest income from the ALM portfolio. Market-related adjustments on debt securities resulted in an expense of $484 million compared to an expense of $273 million for the same period in 2014. Partially offsetting the decrease were reductions in funding yields, lower long-term debt balances and commercial loan growth. For more information on the impact of interest rates, see Interest Rate Risk Management for Non-trading Activities on page 108.Average earning assets excluding trading-related earning assets for the three months ended March 31, 2015 increased $25.6 billion to $1,386.2 billion compared to the same period in 2014. The increase was primarily in debt securities and interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve, partially offset by a decline in consumer loans.For the three months ended March 31, 2015, net interest yield on earning assets excluding trading-related activities decreased 22 bps to 2.55 percent compared to the same period in 2014 due to the same factors as described above. 17Table of ContentsTable 11Quarterly Average Balances and Interest Rates – FTE Basis First Quarter 2015 Fourth Quarter 2014(Dollars in millions)AverageBalance InterestIncome/Expense Yield/Rate AverageBalance InterestIncome/Expense Yield/RateEarning assets           Interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve, non-U.S. central banks and other banks$126,189 $84 0.27% $109,042 $74 0.27%Time deposits placed and other short-term investments8,379 33 1.61 9,339 41 1.73Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell213,931 231 0.44 217,982 237 0.43Trading account assets138,946 1,122 3.26 144,147 1,142 3.15Debt securities383,120 1,898 2.01 371,014 1,687 1.82Loans and leases (1):           Residential mortgage (2)215,030 1,851 3.45 223,132 1,946 3.49Home equity84,915 770 3.66 86,825 808 3.70U.S. credit card88,695 2,027 9.27 89,381 2,087 9.26Non-U.S. credit card10,002 262 10.64 10,950 280 10.14Direct/Indirect consumer (3)80,713 491 2.47 83,121 522 2.49Other consumer (4)1,847 15 3.29 2,031 85 16.75Total consumer481,202 5,416 4.54 495,440 5,728 4.60U.S. commercial234,907 1,645 2.84 231,215 1,648 2.83Commercial real estate (5)48,234 347 2.92 46,996 360 3.04Commercial lease financing24,495 216 3.53 24,238 199 3.28Non-U.S. commercial83,555 485 2.35 86,844 527 2.41Total commercial391,191 2,693 2.79 389,293 2,734 2.79Total loans and leases872,393 8,109 3.75 884,733 8,462 3.80Other earning assets61,441 705 4.66 65,864 739 4.46Total earning assets (6)1,804,399 12,182 2.73 1,802,121 12,382 2.73Cash and due from banks27,695     27,590    Other assets, less allowance for loan and lease losses306,480     307,840    Total assets$2,138,574     $2,137,551    (1) Nonperforming loans are included in the respective average loan balances.

presentation, and following such change, we report our results of operations through the following five business segments: Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), Global Banking, Global Markets and Legacy Assets & Servicing (LAS), with the remaining operations recorded in All Other. For more information on our segment realignment, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We prepare and evaluate segment results using certain non-GAAP financial measures. For additional information, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 14. Table 12 provides selected summary financial data for our business segments and All Other for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.

For more information on this measure and for a corresponding reconciliation to a GAAP financial measure, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 14.The Corporation periodically reviews capital allocated to its businesses and allocates capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. The Corporation's internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment's credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. For more information on the nature of these risks, see Managing Risk on page 46. The capital allocated to the business segments is referred to as allocated capital, which represents a non-GAAP financial measure. For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation utilizes allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying value of its reporting units. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. For additional information, see Note 8 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements.During the latest annual planning process, we made refinements to the amount of capital allocated to each of our businesses based on multiple considerations that included, but were not limited to, risk-weighted assets measured under Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches, business segment exposures and risk profile, and strategic plans. As a result of this process, in the first quarter of 2015, we adjusted the amount of capital being allocated to our business segments, primarily LAS.For more information on the basis of presentation for business segments, including the allocation of negative market-related adjustments to net interest income, and reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income (loss) and period-end total assets, see Note 18 – Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 22Table of ContentsConsumer Banking Three Months Ended March 31   Deposits Consumer Lending Total Consumer Banking  (Dollars in millions)2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 % ChangeNet interest income (FTE basis)$2,297 $2,340 $2,574 $2,731 $4,871 $5,071 (4)%Noninterest income:             Card income3 2 1,164 1,146 1,167 1,148 2Service charges966 993 — — 966 993 (3)Mortgage banking income— — 288 178 288 178 62All other income103 91 55 170 158 261 (39)Total noninterest income1,072 1,086 1,507 1,494 2,579 2,580 —Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis)3,369 3,426 4,081 4,225 7,450 7,651 (3)              Provision for credit losses63 64 653 745 716 809 (11)Noninterest expense2,451 2,465 1,938 2,030 4,389 4,495 (2)Income before income taxes (FTE basis)855 897 1,490 1,450 2,345 2,347 —Income tax expense (FTE basis)317 336 553 543 870 879 (1)Net income$538 $561 $937 $907 $1,475 $1,468 —              Net interest yield (FTE basis)1.74% 1.87% 5.32% 5.72% 3.54% 3.85%  Return on average allocated capital18 21 22 19 21 20  Efficiency ratio (FTE basis)72.76 71.97 47.49 48.05 58.92 58.76                Balance Sheet              Three Months Ended March 31  Average2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014 % ChangeTotal loans and leases$5,879 $6,092 $193,702 $190,333 $199,581 $196,425 2 %Total earning assets (1) 535,555 508,332 196,044 193,671 558,833 533,751 5Total assets (1)562,314 535,023 205,368 202,879 594,916 569,650 4Total deposits530,289 504,065 n/m n/m 531,365 504,849 5Allocated capital12,000 11,000 17,000 19,000 29,000 30,000 (3)              Period endMarch 31 2015 December 31 2014 March 31 2015 December 31 2014 March 31 2015 December 31 2014 % ChangeTotal loans and leases$5,824 $5,951 $194,329 $196,049 $200,153 $202,000 (1)%Total earning assets (1)553,574 527,045 197,738 199,097 576,868 552,117 4Total assets (1) 580,337 554,344 207,237 208,729 613,130 589,048 4Total deposits548,303 523,348 n/m n/m 549,489 524,413 5(1) In segments and businesses where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, we allocate assets from All Other to match the segments' and businesses' liabilities and allocated shareholders' equity.

Our customers and clients have access to a franchise network that stretches coast to coast through 32 states and the District of Columbia. The franchise network includes approximately 4,800 financial centers, 15,900 ATMs, nationwide call centers, and online and mobile platforms.Consumer Banking ResultsNet income for Consumer Banking of $1.5 billion remained relatively unchanged in the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 as lower noninterest expense and lower provision for credit losses were offset by lower net interest income. Net interest income decreased $200 million to $4.9 billion primarily due to the allocation of negative market-related adjustments, lower card yields and card loan balances, partially offset by the beneficial impact of an increase in investable assets as a result of higher deposit balances. Noninterest income of $2.6 billion remained relatively unchanged as higher mortgage banking income and card income offset lower service charges and other income which included a portfolio divestiture gain in 2014. 23Table of ContentsThe provision for credit losses decreased $93 million to $716 million primarily as a result of continued improvement in credit quality within the credit card portfolio, partially offset by a slower pace of credit quality improvement within the consumer real estate portfolio. Noninterest expense decreased $106 million to $4.4 billion primarily driven by lower personnel and operating expenses.The return on average allocated capital was 21 percent, up from 20 percent, reflecting a small decrease in allocated capital. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 22.DepositsDeposits includes the results of consumer deposit activities which consist of a comprehensive range of products provided to consumers and small businesses. Our deposit products include traditional savings accounts, money market savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, noninterest- and interest-bearing checking accounts, as well as investment accounts and products. The revenue is allocated to the deposit products using our funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. Deposits generates fees such as account service fees, non-sufficient funds fees, overdraft charges and ATM fees, as well as investment and brokerage fees from Merrill Edge accounts. Merrill Edge is an integrated investing and banking service targeted at customers with less than $250,000 in investable assets. Merrill Edge provides investment advice and guidance, client brokerage asset services, a self-directed online investing platform and key banking capabilities including access to the Corporation's network of financial centers and ATMs.Deposits includes the net impact of migrating customers and their related deposit balances between Deposits and GWIM as well as other client-managed businesses. For more information on the migration of customer balances to or from GWIM, see GWIM on page 27.Net income for Deposits decreased $23 million to $538 million in the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 driven by lower revenue, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. Net interest income declined $43 million to $2.3 billion due to the allocation of negative market-related adjustments, partially offset by the beneficial impact of an increase in investable assets as a result of higher deposit balances. Noninterest income decreased $14 million to $1.1 billion primarily due to lower deposit service charges.The provision for credit losses of $63 million remained relatively unchanged. Noninterest expense decreased $14 million to $2.5 billion due to lower operating expenses.Average deposits increased $26.2 billion to $530.3 billion driven by a continuing customer shift to more liquid products in the low rate environment. Growth in checking, traditional savings and money market savings of $37.1 billion was partially offset by a decline in time deposits of $10.9 billion. As a result of our continued pricing discipline and the shift in the mix of deposits, the rate paid on average deposits declined by two bps to five bps.Key Statistics – Deposits      Three Months Ended March 31  2015 2014Total deposit spreads (excludes noninterest costs) 1.62% 1.57%     Period end    Client brokerage assets (in millions) $118,492 $100,206Online banking active accounts (units in thousands) 31,479 30,470Mobile banking active accounts (units in thousands) 16,943 14,986Financial centers 4,835 5,095ATMs 15,915 16,214Client brokerage assets increased $18.3 billion driven by new accounts, increased account flows and higher market valuations.

In addition to earning net interest spread revenue on its lending activities, Consumer Lending generates interchange revenue from credit and debit card transactions, late fees, cash advance fees, annual credit card fees, mortgage banking fee income and other miscellaneous fees. Consumer Lending products are available to our customers through our retail network, direct telephone, and online and mobile channels.Consumer Lending includes the net impact of migrating customers and their related loan balances between Consumer Lending and GWIM. For more information on the migration of customer balances to or from GWIM, see GWIM on page 27.Net income for Consumer Lending increased $30 million to $937 million in the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 primarily due to lower provision for credit losses and noninterest expense, partially offset by lower net interest income. Net interest income decreased $157 million to $2.6 billion driven by the impact of lower card yields and lower average card loan balances. Noninterest income of $1.5 billion remained relatively unchanged as mortgage banking income and card income increased while the prior-year period included a portfolio divestiture gain.The provision for credit losses decreased $92 million to $653 million driven by continued improvement in credit quality within the credit card portfolio, partially offset by a slower pace of credit quality improvement within the consumer real estate portfolio. Noninterest expense decreased $92 million to $1.9 billion primarily driven by lower personnel expense.Average loans increased $3.4 billion to $193.7 billion primarily driven by an increase in residential mortgages, partially offset by lower home equity loans and continued run-off of non-core portfolios. Beginning with new originations in 2014, we retain certain residential mortgages in Consumer Banking, consistent with where the overall relationship is managed; previously such mortgages were in All Other.

Total U.S. credit card purchase volumes increased $1.3 billion to $50.2 billion and debit card purchase volumes increased $1.0 billion to $66.9 billion, reflecting higher levels of consumer spending.Mortgage Banking IncomeMortgage banking income is earned primarily in Consumer Banking and LAS. Mortgage banking income in Consumer Lending consists mainly of core production income, which is comprised primarily of revenue from the fair value gains and losses recognized on our interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and loans held-for-sale (LHFS), the related secondary market execution, and costs related to representations and warranties in the sales transactions along with other obligations incurred in the sales of mortgage loans. 25Table of ContentsThe table below summarizes the components of mortgage banking income.Mortgage Banking Income    Three Months Ended March 31(Dollars in millions)2015 2014Consumer Lending:   Core production revenue$300 $189Representations and warranties provision6 7Other consumer mortgage banking income (1)(18) (18)Total Consumer Lending mortgage banking income288 178LAS mortgage banking income (2)461 291Eliminations (3)(55) (57)Total consolidated mortgage banking income$694 $412(1) Primarily intercompany charge for loan servicing activities provided by LAS.(2) Amounts for LAS are included in this Consumer Banking table to show the components of consolidated mortgage banking income.(3) Includes the effect of transfers of mortgage loans from Consumer Banking to the ALM portfolio included in All Other and intercompany charges for loan servicing.Core production revenue increased $111 million to $300 million due to higher first mortgage origination volumes, and to a lesser extent, an industry-wide increase in margins.Key Statistics    Three Months Ended March 31(Dollars in millions)2015 2014Loan production (1):   Total (2)   First mortgage$13,713 $8,850Home equity3,217 1,984Consumer Banking:   First mortgage$9,854 $6,702Home equity3,017 1,791(1) The above loan production amounts represent the unpaid principal balance of loans and in the case of home equity, the principal amount of the total line of credit.(2) In addition to loan production in Consumer Banking, there is also first mortgage and home equity loan production in GWIM.First mortgage loan originations in Consumer Banking and for the total Corporation increased for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 reflecting growth in the overall mortgage market as lower interest rates beginning in late 2014 drove an increase in refinances.During the three months ended March 31, 2015, 73 percent of the total Corporation first mortgage production volume was for refinance originations and 27 percent was for purchase originations compared to 66 percent and 34 percent for the same period in 2014. Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) refinance originations were three percent of all refinance originations compared to nine percent for the same period in 2014. Making Home Affordable non-HARP refinance originations were 10 percent of all refinance originations compared to 22 percent for the same period in 2014. The remaining 87 percent of refinance originations were conventional refinances compared to 69 percent for the same period in 2014.Home equity production for the total Corporation was $3.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $2.0 billion for the same period in 2014, with the increase due to a higher demand in the market based on improving housing trends, and increased market share driven by improved financial center engagement with customers and more competitive pricing. 26Table of ContentsGlobal Wealth & Investment Management Three Months Ended March 31  (Dollars in millions)2015 2014 % ChangeNet interest income (FTE basis)$1,351 $1,485 (9)%Noninterest income:     Investment and brokerage services2,723 2,604 5All other income443 458 (3)Total noninterest income3,166 3,062 3Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis)4,517 4,547 (1)      Provision for credit losses23 23 —Noninterest expense3,459 3,359 3Income before income taxes (FTE basis)1,035 1,165 (11)Income tax expense (FTE basis)384 436 (12)Net income$651 $729 (11)      Net interest yield (FTE basis)2.13% 2.40%  Return on average allocated capital22 25  Efficiency ratio (FTE basis)76.57 73.86        Balance Sheet      Three Months Ended March 31  Average2015 2014 % ChangeTotal loans and leases$126,129 $115,945 9 %Total earning assets257,625 250,732 3Total assets275,130 270,275 2Total deposits243,561 242,792 —Allocated capital12,000 12,000 —      Period endMarch 31 2015 December 31 2014 % ChangeTotal loans and leases$127,556 $125,431 2 %Total earning assets255,840 256,519 —Total assets272,777 274,887 (1)Total deposits244,080 245,391 (1)GWIM consists of two primary businesses: Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM) and U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management (U.S. Trust).MLGWM's advisory business provides a high-touch client experience through a network of financial advisors focused on clients with over $250,000 in total investable assets.

Net interest income decreased $134 million to $1.4 billion due to the allocation of negative market-related adjustments and other ALM results, partially offset by higher net interest income from loan growth. Noninterest income, primarily investment and brokerage services, increased $104 million to $3.2 billion driven by increased asset management fees due to the impact of long-term AUM flows and higher  27Table of Contentsmarket levels, partially offset by lower transactional revenue. Noninterest expense increased $100 million to $3.5 billion primarily due to higher revenue-related incentive compensation and investment in client-facing professionals.Return on average allocated capital was 22 percent, down from 25 percent, due to a decrease in net income.

Additionally, increased asset management fees due to the impact of long-term AUM flows and higher market levels were partially offset by lower transactional revenue. Revenue from U.S. Trust of $751 million decreased two percent driven by the allocation of negative market-related adjustments and other ALM results, partially offset by increased asset management fees due to the impact of higher market levels and long-term AUM flows.Client balances increased $114 billion, or five percent, to over $2.5 trillion as a result of higher market levels and AUM and loan flows.The number of client-facing professionals increased four percent due to increases in Merrill Edge financial solutions advisors, financial advisor development program participants and experienced financial advisors.Net Migration SummaryGWIM results are impacted by the net migration of clients and their corresponding deposit, loan and brokerage balances primarily to or from Consumer Banking, as presented in the table below.

The decline in net interest income reflects the allocation of negative market-related adjustments and costs for maintaining High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) requirements, and loan spread compression. Noninterest income remained relatively unchanged as higher investment banking fees were offset by a gain on sale of an equity investment in the prior-year period.The provision for credit losses decreased $185 million to $96 million, primarily in the U.S. commercial portfolio. Noninterest expense decreased $168 million to $2.0 billion primarily due to lower technology initiative costs, litigation expense and incentive compensation expense.Return on average allocated capital of 16 percent remained relatively unchanged as growth in earnings was offset by increased capital allocations.

Global Banking originates certain deal-related transactions with our corporate and commercial clients that are executed and distributed by Global Markets. For more information on investment banking fees on a consolidated basis, see page 32.Net income for Global Markets decreased $368 million to $945 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. Excluding net DVA, net income decreased $310 million to $933 million primarily driven by lower trading account profits due to declines in mortgage and credit-related products and a decline in investment banking fees primarily from lower debt issuance. Net DVA gains were $19 million in the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to gains of $112 million in the same period in 2014. Noninterest expense increased $45 million to $3.1 billion as a reduction in revenue-related incentive compensation was more than offset by higher litigation expense.Average earning assets decreased $22.0 billion to $434.9 billion largely driven by a decrease in trading account securities as well as a decrease in low-margin prime brokerage loans.Period-end loans and leases increased $3.6 billion from December 31, 2014 due to higher mortgage finance balances as a result of strong client demand.The return on average allocated capital was 11 percent, down from 16 percent, reflecting lower net income and an increase in allocated capital. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 22.Sales and Trading RevenueSales and trading revenue includes unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading and other assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. Sales and trading revenue is segregated into fixed-income (government debt obligations, investment and non-investment grade corporate debt obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities, residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), interest rate and credit derivative contracts), currencies (interest rate and foreign exchange contracts), commodities (primarily futures, forwards, swaps and options) and equities (equity-linked derivatives and cash equity activity). The table below and related discussion present sales and trading revenue, substantially all of which is in Global Markets, with the remainder in Global Banking. In addition, the table below and related discussion present sales and trading revenue excluding the impact of net DVA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe the use of this non-GAAP financial measure provides clarity in assessing the underlying performance of these businesses.Sales and Trading Revenue (1, 2)    Three Months Ended March 31(Dollars in millions)2015 2014Sales and trading revenue   Fixed income, currencies and commodities$2,749 $3,024Equities1,165 1,193Total sales and trading revenue$3,914 $4,217    Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA (3)   Fixed income, currencies and commodities$2,745 $2,944Equities1,150 1,161Total sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA (3)$3,895 $4,105(1) Includes FTE adjustments of $47 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $40 million for the same period in 2014.

FICC net DVA gains were $4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to net DVA gains of $80 million for the same period in 2014. Equities net DVA gains were $15 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to net DVA gains of $32 million for the same period in 2014.Fixed-income, currency and commodities (FICC) revenue, excluding net DVA, decreased $199 million to $2.7 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 primarily driven by declines in mortgage and credit-related businesses due to lower trading volumes driven by client flows. These declines were partially offset by stronger results in foreign exchange as increased volatility led to higher client flows and revenue. Equities revenue, excluding net DVA, was relatively flat compared to the same period in 2014.  34Table of ContentsLegacy Assets & Servicing Three Months Ended March 31  (Dollars in millions)2015 2014 % ChangeNet interest income (FTE basis)$428 $377 14 %Noninterest income:     Mortgage banking income461 291 58All other income25 18 39Total noninterest income486 309 57Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis)914 686 33      Provision for credit losses91 12 n/mNoninterest expense1,201 7,401 (84)Loss before income taxes (FTE basis)(378) (6,727) (94)Income tax benefit (FTE basis)(140) (1,847) (92)Net loss$(238) $(4,880) (95)      Net interest yield (FTE basis)4.19% 3.82%        Balance Sheet      Three Months Ended March 31  Average2015 2014 % ChangeTotal loans and leases$32,411 $38,104 (15)%Total earning assets41,371 40,026 3Total assets 52,617 57,400 (8)Allocated capital24,000 17,000 41      Period endMarch 31 2015 December 31 2014 % ChangeTotal loans and leases$31,690 $33,055 (4)%Total earning assets42,590 33,923 26Total assets53,538 45,958 16n/m = not meaningfulLAS is responsible for our mortgage servicing activities related to residential first mortgage and home equity loans serviced for others and loans held by the Corporation, including loans that have been designated as the LAS Portfolios. The LAS Portfolios (both owned and serviced), herein referred to as the Legacy Owned and Legacy Serviced Portfolios, respectively (together, the Legacy Portfolios), and as further defined below, include those loans originated prior to January 1, 2011 that would not have been originated under our established underwriting standards as of December 31, 2010. For more information on our Legacy Portfolios, see page 36. In addition, LAS is responsible for managing certain legacy exposures related to mortgage originations, sales and servicing activities (e.g., litigation, representations and warranties). LAS also includes the financial results of the home equity portfolio selected as part of the Legacy Owned Portfolio and the results of MSR activities, including net hedge results.LAS includes certain revenues and expenses on loans serviced for others, including owned loans serviced for Consumer Banking, GWIM and All Other. The net loss for LAS decreased $4.6 billion to a net loss of $238 million primarily driven by significantly lower litigation expense, which is included in noninterest expense, and higher mortgage banking income, partially offset by higher provision for credit losses. Mortgage banking income increased $170 million primarily due to higher servicing income and lower representations and warranties provision. The provision for credit losses increased $79 million driven by a slower pace of credit quality improvement. Noninterest expense decreased $6.2 billion primarily due to a $5.7 billion decrease in litigation expense. Excluding litigation, noninterest expense decreased $542 million to $1.0 billion due to lower default-related staffing and other default-related servicing expenses. We expect that noninterest expense, excluding litigation expense, will decline to approximately $800 million per quarter in the fourth quarter of 2015.The increase in allocated capital for LAS reflects higher Basel 3 Advanced approaches operational risk capital in 2014.  35Table of ContentsServicingLAS is responsible for all of our in-house servicing activities related to the residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios, including owned loans and loans serviced for others (collectively, the mortgage serviced portfolio). A portion of this portfolio has been designated as the Legacy Serviced Portfolio, which represented 26 percent and 29 percent of the total mortgage serviced portfolio, as measured by unpaid principal balance, at March 31, 2015 and 2014. In addition, LAS is responsible for managing subservicing agreements.Servicing activities include collecting cash for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers, disbursing customer draws for lines of credit, accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors and escrow payments to third parties, and responding to customer inquiries. Our home retention efforts, including single point of contact resources, are also part of our servicing activities, along with supervision of foreclosures and property dispositions. Prior to foreclosure, LAS evaluates various workout options in an effort to help our customers avoid foreclosure. For more information on our servicing activities, including the impact of foreclosure delays, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations – Servicing, Foreclosure and Other Mortgage Matters on page 53 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Legacy PortfoliosThe Legacy Portfolios (both owned and serviced) include those loans originated prior to January 1, 2011 that would not have been originated under our established underwriting standards in place as of December 31, 2010. The purchased credit-impaired (PCI) portfolio, as well as certain loans that met a pre-defined delinquency status or probability of default threshold as of January 1, 2011, are also included in the Legacy Portfolios. Since determining the pool of loans to be included in the Legacy Portfolios as of January 1, 2011, the criteria have not changed for these portfolios, but will continue to be evaluated over time.Legacy Owned PortfolioThe Legacy Owned Portfolio includes those loans that met the criteria as described above and are on the balance sheet of the Corporation. Home equity loans in this portfolio are held on the balance sheet of LAS, and residential mortgage loans in this portfolio are included as part of All Other. The financial results of the on-balance sheet loans are reported in the segment that owns the loans or in All Other. Total loans in the Legacy Owned Portfolio decreased $4.3 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2015 to $85.6 billion, of which $31.7 billion was held on the LAS balance sheet and the remainder was included as part of All Other. The decrease was largely due to payoffs and paydowns.Legacy Serviced PortfolioThe Legacy Serviced Portfolio includes loans serviced by LAS in both the Legacy Owned Portfolio and those loans serviced for outside investors that met the criteria as described above. The table below summarizes the balances of the residential mortgage loans included in the Legacy Serviced Portfolio (the Legacy Residential Mortgage Serviced Portfolio) representing 24 percent and 27 percent of the total residential mortgage serviced portfolio of $588 billion and $693 billion, as measured by unpaid principal balance, at March 31, 2015 and 2014. The decline in the Legacy Residential Mortgage Serviced Portfolio was due to paydowns and payoffs, and MSR and loan sales.Legacy Residential Mortgage Serviced Portfolio, a subset of the Residential Mortgage Serviced Portfolio (1, 2) March 31(Dollars in billions)2015 2014Unpaid principal balance   Residential mortgage loans   Total$141 $18960 days or more past due21 42    Number of loans serviced (in thousands)   Residential mortgage loans    Total764 1,02260 days or more past due109 216(1) Excludes loans for which servicing transferred to third parties as of March 31, 2015 with an effective MSR sale date of April 1, 2015, totaling $39 million.(2) Excludes $32 billion and $37 billion of home equity loans and HELOCs at March 31, 2015 and 2014. 36Table of ContentsNon-Legacy PortfolioAs previously discussed, LAS is responsible for all of our servicing activities.

The costs associated with our servicing activities are included in noninterest expense. LAS mortgage banking income also includes the cost of legacy representations and warranties exposures and revenue from the sales of loans that had returned to performing status. The table below summarizes LAS mortgage banking income.LAS Mortgage Banking Income    Three Months Ended March 31(Dollars in millions)2015 2014Servicing income:   Servicing fees$430 $533Amortization of expected cash flows (1)(198) (210)Fair value changes of MSRs, net of risk management activities used to hedge certain market risks (2)250 66Other servicing-related revenue— 4Total net servicing income482 393Representations and warranties provision(90) (185)Other mortgage banking income (3)69 83Total LAS mortgage banking income$461 $291(1) Represents the net change in fair value of the MSR asset due to the recognition of modeled cash flows.(2) Includes gains (losses) on sales of MSRs.(3) Consists primarily of revenue from sales of repurchased loans that had returned to performing status.LAS mortgage banking income increased $170 million primarily driven by improved MSR net-of-hedge performance and lower representations and warranties provision, partially offset by lower servicing fees due to a smaller servicing portfolio. 37Table of ContentsKey Statistics     (Dollars in millions, except as noted)March 31 2015 December 31 2014Mortgage serviced portfolio (in billions) (1, 2)$669  $693 Mortgage loans serviced for investors (in billions) (1)459  474 Mortgage servicing rights:     Balance (3)3,108  3,271 Capitalized mortgage servicing rights (% of loans serviced for investors)68bps 69bps(1) The servicing portfolio and mortgage loans serviced for investors represent the unpaid principal balance of loans.(2) Servicing of residential mortgage loans, HELOCs and home equity loans by LAS.(3) At March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, excludes $286 million and $259 million of certain non-U.S. residential mortgage MSR balances that are recorded in Global Markets. The decline in the size of our servicing portfolio was driven by loan prepayment activity, which exceeded new originations primarily due to our exit from non-retail channels as well as strategic sales of MSRs during 2014.Mortgage Servicing RightsAt March 31, 2015, the balance of consumer MSRs managed within LAS, which excludes $286 million of certain non-U.S. residential mortgage MSRs recorded in Global Markets, was $3.1 billion, which represented 68 bps of the related unpaid principal balance compared to $3.3 billion, or 69 bps of the related unpaid principal balance at December 31, 2014. The consumer MSR balance managed within LAS decreased $163 million in the three months ended March 31, 2015 primarily driven by a decrease in value due to lower mortgage rates at March 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014, which resulted in higher forecasted prepayment speeds, and the recognition of modeled cash flows, partially offset by additions to the portfolio and changes to other model and cash flow assumptions.

Such allocated assets were $505.2 billion and $476.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, and $516.0 billion and $478.2 billion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.n/m = not meaningful 39Table of ContentsAll Other consists of ALM activities, equity investments, the international consumer card business, liquidating businesses, residual expense allocations and other. ALM activities encompass residential mortgage securities, interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities including the residual net interest income allocation, the impact of certain allocation methodologies and accounting hedge ineffectiveness. Beginning with new originations in 2014, we retain certain residential mortgages in Consumer Banking, consistent with where the overall relationship is managed; previously such mortgages were in All Other. Additionally, certain residential mortgage loans that are managed by LAS are held in All Other. The results of certain ALM activities are allocated to our business segments. For more information on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for Non-trading Activities on page 108 and Note 18 – Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Equity investments include our merchant services joint venture as well as Global Principal Investments (GPI) which is comprised of a portfolio of equity, real estate and other alternative investments. For more information on our merchant services joint venture, see Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The net loss for All Other increased $644 million to $841 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 due to a decrease in equity investment income and lower net interest income, partially offset by gains on sales of residential mortgage loans, lower noninterest expense and an increased benefit in the provision for credit losses. Equity investment income decreased $695 million primarily due to the sale of a portion of an equity investment in the first quarter of 2014. Gains on the sales of residential mortgage loans, net of hedges, were $217 million compared to gains of $12 million a year ago.The provision (benefit) for credit losses improved $47 million to a benefit of $182 million primarily driven by the impact of recoveries on nonperforming loan sales.Noninterest expense decreased $214 million to $1.5 billion primarily driven by lower litigation expense and infrastructure and support costs. Annual retirement-eligible incentive costs of $1.0 billion were recorded on a consolidated basis in both the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014. These costs are allocated to the business segments ratably over the year. The income tax benefit was $833 million compared to a benefit of $1.1 billion, as the prior period included tax benefits attributable to the resolution of certain tax matters.     40Table of ContentsOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual ObligationsWe have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties. For more information on obligations and commitments, see Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations on page 50 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as Note 11 – Long-term Debt and Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Representations and WarrantiesWe securitize first-lien residential mortgage loans generally in the form of RMBS guaranteed by the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), which include Freddie Mac (FHLMC) and Fannie Mae (FNMA), or by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) in the case of Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed and Rural Housing Service-guaranteed mortgage loans, and sell pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans in the form of whole loans. In addition, in prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations (in certain of these securitizations, monoline insurers or other financial guarantee providers insured all or some of the securities) or in the form of whole loans. In connection with these transactions, we or certain of our subsidiaries or legacy companies make or have made various representations and warranties. Breaches of these representations and warranties have resulted in and may continue to result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage loans or to otherwise make whole or provide other remedies to the GSEs, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) with respect to FHA-insured loans, VA, whole-loan investors, securitization trusts, monoline insurers or other financial guarantors (collectively, repurchases). In all such cases, subsequent to repurchasing the loan, we would be exposed to any credit loss on the repurchased mortgage loans after accounting for any mortgage insurance (MI) or mortgage guarantee payments that we may receive.We have vigorously contested any request for repurchase when we conclude that a valid basis for repurchase does not exist and will continue to do so in the future. However, in an effort to resolve these legacy mortgage-related issues, we have reached settlements, certain of which have been for significant amounts, in lieu of a loan-by-loan review process, including with the GSEs, four monoline insurers and BNY Mellon, as trustee.On March 5, 2015, the New York Appellate Division, First Department issued an order unanimously approving the BNY Mellon Settlement in all respects, reversing the portion of the New York Supreme Court's decision not to approve the Trustee's conduct with respect to the Trustee's consideration of a potential claim that a loan must be repurchased if the servicer modifies its terms. The deadline for further appeal has passed. The BNY Mellon Settlement remains subject to certain conditions, including that an IRS private letter ruling be obtained confirming that the settlement will not impact the REMIC tax status of the trusts. There can be no assurance as to when or whether such conditions to the BNY Mellon Settlement will be satisfied. If these conditions to the effectiveness of the BNY Mellon Settlement are not satisfied, or if we and Countrywide Financial Corporation (Countrywide) withdraw from the BNY Mellon Settlement in accordance with its terms, our future representations and warranties losses could be substantially different from existing accruals and the estimated range of possible loss over existing accruals. As part of the BNY Mellon Settlement, agreement was reached on certain servicing related matters. For information on servicing matters associated with the BNY Mellon Settlement, see Mortgage-related Settlements – Servicing Matters on page 45.For more information on accounting for representations and warranties, repurchase claims and exposures, including a summary of the larger bulk settlements, see Note 7 – Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees and Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Unresolved Repurchase ClaimsUnresolved representations and warranties repurchase claims represent the notional amount of repurchase claims made by counterparties, typically the outstanding principal balance or the unpaid principal balance at the time of default. In the case of first-lien mortgages, the claim amount is often significantly greater than the expected loss amount due to the benefit of collateral and, in some cases, MI or mortgage guarantee payments. Claims received from a counterparty remain outstanding until the underlying loan is repurchased, the claim is rescinded by the counterparty or the representations and warranties claims with respect to the applicable trust are settled, and fully and finally released. When a claim is denied and we do not receive a response from the counterparty, the claim remains in the unresolved repurchase claims balance until resolution. 41Table of ContentsAt March 31, 2015, we had $25.8 billion of unresolved repurchase claims, net of duplicate claims, compared to $22.8 billion at December 31, 2014. These repurchase claims primarily relate to private-label securitizations and include claims in the amount of $6.4 billion and $4.7 billion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, net of duplicate claims, where we believe the statute of limitations has expired under current law, and $4.1 billion and $4.0 billion in claims, net of duplicate claims, related to loans in specific private-label securitization groups or tranches where we own substantially all of the outstanding securities. For additional information, see Note 7 – Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The continued increase in the notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims during the three months ended March 31, 2015 is primarily due to: (1) continued submission of claims by private-label securitization trustees, (2) the level of detail, support and analysis accompanying such claims, which impact overall claim quality and, therefore, claims resolution, (3) the lack of an established process to resolve disputes related to these claims, (4) the submission of claims where we believe the statute of limitations has expired under current law and (5) the submission of duplicate claims, often in multiple submissions, on the same loan. For example, claims submitted without individual file reviews generally lack the level of detail and analysis of individual loans found in other claims that is necessary to evaluate a claim. Absent any settlements, we expect unresolved repurchase claims related to private-label securitizations to continue to increase as such claims continue to be submitted and there is not an established process for the ultimate resolution of such claims on which there is a disagreement.During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we had limited loan-level representations and warranties repurchase claims experience with the monoline insurers due to bulk settlements in prior years and ongoing litigation with a single monoline insurer. For additional information, see Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.As a result of various bulk settlements with the GSEs, we have resolved substantially all outstanding and potential representations and warranties repurchase claims on whole loans sold by legacy Bank of America and Countrywide to FNMA and FHLMC through June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2009, respectively. For more information on the monolines and experience with GSEs, see Note 7 – Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements.In addition to unresolved repurchase claims, we have received notifications indicating that we may owe indemnity obligations pertaining to loans for which we have not received a repurchase request from sponsors of third-party securitizations with whom we engaged in whole-loan transactions. These notifications totaled $2.0 billion at both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.We also from time to time receive correspondence purporting to raise representations and warranties breach issues from entities that do not have contractual standing or ability to bring such claims. We believe such communications to be procedurally and/or substantively invalid, and generally do not respond to such correspondence.The presence of repurchase claims on a given trust, receipt of notices of indemnification obligations and receipt of other communications, as discussed above, are all factors that inform our liability for obligations under representations and warranties and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss.Representations and Warranties LiabilityThe liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related provision is included in mortgage banking income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. For more information on the representations and warranties liability and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations – Estimated Range of Possible Loss on page 44.At March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the liability for representations and warranties was $12.0 billion and $12.1 billion. For the three months ended March 31, 2015, the representations and warranties provision was $84 million compared to $178 million for the same period in 2014.Our liability at March 31, 2015 for obligations under representations and warranties is necessarily dependent on, and limited by a number of factors including for private-label securitizations the implied repurchase experience based on the BNY Mellon Settlement, as well as certain other assumptions and judgmental factors. Where relevant, we also consider more recent experience, such as claim activity, notification of potential indemnification obligations, our experience with various counterparties, recent court decisions related to the statute of limitations and other facts and circumstances, such as bulk settlements, as we believe appropriate. Accordingly, future provisions associated with obligations under representations and warranties may be materially impacted if future experiences are different from historical experience or our understandings, interpretations or assumptions. Although we have not recorded any representations and warranties liability for certain potential private-label securitization and whole-loan exposures where the applicable statute of limitations has expired under current law, these exposures are considered in the determination of the estimated range of possible loss. 42Table of ContentsExperience with Private-label Securitization and Whole-Loan InvestorsIn prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans to investors other than GSEs (although the GSEs are investors in certain private-label securitizations). Such loans originated from 2004 through 2008 had an original principal balance of $970 billion, including $786 billion sold to private-label and whole-loan investors without monoline insurance. Of the $970 billion, $578 billion in principal has been paid, $203 billion in principal has defaulted, $42 billion in principal was severely delinquent, and $147 billion in principal was current or less than 180 days past due at March 31, 2015 as summarized in Table 13.

The majority of the loans sold were included in private-label securitizations, including third-party sponsored transactions. We provided representations and warranties to the whole-loan investors and these investors may retain those rights even when the whole loans were aggregated with other collateral into private-label securitizations sponsored by the whole-loan investors. Loans originated between 2004 and 2008 and sold without monoline insurance had an original total principal balance of $786 billion included in Table 13. Of the $786 billion, $472 billion have been paid in full and $193 billion were defaulted or severely delinquent at March 31, 2015. At least 25 payments have been made on approximately 64 percent of the defaulted and severely delinquent loans.We have received approximately $37 billion of representations and warranties repurchase claims related to loans originated between 2004 and 2008, including $28 billion from private-label securitization trustees and a financial guarantee provider, $8 billion from whole-loan investors and $815 million from one private-label securitization counterparty. Continued high levels of new private-label claims are primarily related to repurchase requests received from trustees for private-label securitization transactions not included in the BNY Mellon Settlement. We have resolved $9 billion of these claims with losses of $2 billion. The majority of these resolved claims were from third-party whole-loan investors. Approximately $4 billion of these claims were resolved through repurchase or indemnification, $5 billion  43Table of Contentswere rescinded by the investor and $335 million were resolved through settlements. As of March 31, 2015, 15 percent of the whole-loan claims for these vintages that we initially denied have subsequently been resolved through repurchase or make-whole payments and 44 percent have been resolved through rescission of the claim by the counterparty or repayment in full by the borrower. At March 31, 2015, for these vintages, the notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims submitted by private-label securitization trustees, whole-loan investors, including third-party securitization sponsors and others was $28 billion, including $4 billion of duplicate claims primarily submitted without a loan file review. We have performed an initial review with respect to substantially all of these claims and although we do not believe a valid basis for repurchase has been established by the claimant, we consider such claims activity in the computation of our liability for representations and warranties. Until we receive a repurchase claim, we generally do not review loan files related to private-label securitizations and believe we are not required by the governing documents to do so.Estimated Range of Possible LossWe currently estimate that the range of possible loss for representations and warranties exposures could be up to $4 billion over existing accruals at March 31, 2015. The estimated range of possible loss reflects principally non-GSE exposures. It represents a reasonably possible loss, but does not represent a probable loss, and is based on currently available information, significant judgment and a number of assumptions that are subject to change.For more information on the methodology used to estimate the representations and warranties liability, the corresponding estimated range of possible loss and the types of losses not considered, see Note 7 – Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K and, for more information related to the sensitivity of the assumptions used to estimate our liability for obligations under representations and warranties, see Complex Accounting Estimates – Representations and Warranties Liability on page 113 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Servicing, Foreclosure and Other Mortgage MattersWe service a large portion of the loans we or our subsidiaries have securitized and also service loans on behalf of third-party securitization vehicles and other investors. Our servicing obligations are set forth in servicing agreements with the applicable counterparty. These obligations may include, but are not limited to, loan repurchase requirements in certain circumstances, indemnifications, payment of fees, advances for foreclosure costs that are not reimbursable, or responsibility for losses in excess of partial guarantees for VA loans. Servicing agreements with the GSEs and GNMA generally provide the GSEs and GNMA with broader rights relative to the servicer than are found in servicing agreements with private investors. For example, the GSEs claim that they have the contractual right to loan repurchase for certain servicing breaches. In addition, the GSEs' first-lien mortgage seller/servicer guides provide timelines to resolve delinquent loans through workout efforts or liquidation, if necessary, and purport to require the imposition of compensatory fees if those deadlines are not satisfied except for reasons beyond the control of the servicer. Servicers for GNMA are required to service in accordance with the applicable government agency requirements which include detailed regulatory requirements for servicing loans and reducing the amount of insurance or guaranty benefits that are paid if the applicable timelines are not satisfied. In addition, many non-agency RMBS and whole-loan servicing agreements state that the servicer may be liable for failure to perform its servicing obligations in keeping with industry standards or for acts or omissions that involve willful malfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance of, or reckless disregard of, the servicer's duties. 44Table of ContentsIt is not possible to reasonably estimate our liability with respect to certain potential servicing-related claims. While we have recorded certain accruals for servicing-related claims, the amount of potential liability in excess of existing accruals could be material to the Corporation's results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period.Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc.For information on Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations – Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. on page 54 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Other Mortgage-related MattersWe continue to be subject to additional borrower and non-borrower litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny related to our past and current origination, servicing, transfer of servicing and servicing rights, servicing compliance obligations, and foreclosure activities, including those claims not covered by the National Mortgage Settlement or the settlement with the Department of Justice (DoJ). This scrutiny may extend beyond our pending foreclosure matters to issues arising out of alleged irregularities with respect to previously completed foreclosure activities. The ongoing environment of additional regulation, increased regulatory compliance obligations, and enhanced regulatory enforcement, combined with ongoing uncertainty related to the continuing evolution of the regulatory environment, has resulted in operational and compliance costs and may limit our ability to continue providing certain products and services. For more information on management's estimate of the aggregate range of possible loss and on regulatory investigations, see Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Mortgage-related Settlements – Servicing MattersIn connection with the BNY Mellon Settlement, BANA has agreed to implement certain servicing changes related to loss mitigation activities. BANA also agreed to transfer the servicing rights related to certain high-risk loans to qualified subservicers on a schedule that began with the signing of the BNY Mellon Settlement. This servicing transfer protocol has reduced the servicing fees payable to BANA. Upon final approval of the BNY Mellon Settlement, failure to meet the established benchmarking standards for loans not in subservicing arrangements can trigger payment of agreed-upon fees. Additionally, we and Countrywide have agreed to work to resolve with the Trustee certain mortgage documentation issues related to the enforceability of mortgages in foreclosure and to reimburse the related Covered Trust for any loss if BANA is unable to foreclose on the mortgage and the Covered Trust is not made whole by a title policy because of these issues. These agreements will terminate if final approval of the BNY Mellon Settlement is not obtained, although we could still have exposure under the pooling and servicing agreements related to the mortgages in the Covered Trusts for these issues.BANA has agreed to implement uniform servicing standards established under the National Mortgage Settlement. These standards are intended to strengthen procedural safeguards and documentation requirements associated with foreclosure, bankruptcy and loss mitigation activities, as well as addressing the imposition of fees and the integrity of documentation, with a goal of ensuring greater transparency for borrowers. These uniform servicing standards also obligate us to implement compliance processes reasonably designed to provide assurance of the achievement of these objectives. Compliance with the uniform servicing standards is subject to ongoing review by the independent monitor. Implementation of these uniform servicing standards has contributed to elevated costs associated with the servicing process, but is not expected to result in material delays or dislocation in the performance of our mortgage servicing obligations, including the completion of foreclosures. 45Table of ContentsManaging RiskRisk is inherent in all our business activities. The seven types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. Sound risk management is needed to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risks can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. The Corporation takes a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement which are approved annually by the Corporation's Board of Directors (the Board) and the Board's Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC).Our Risk Framework is the foundation for comprehensive management of the risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth clear roles, responsibilities and accountability for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities.Our Risk Appetite Statement is intended to ensure that the Corporation maintains an acceptable risk profile by providing a common framework and a comparable set of measures for senior management and the Board to clearly indicate the level of risk the Corporation is willing to accept. Risk appetite is set at least annually in conjunction with the strategic, capital and financial operating plans to align risk appetite with the Corporation's strategy and financial resources. Our line of business strategies and risk appetite are also similarly aligned. For a more detailed discussion of our risk management activities, see the discussion below and pages 55 through 109 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Strategic Risk ManagementStrategic risk is embedded in every business and is one of the major risk categories along with credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. It is the risk that results from incorrect assumptions, unsuitable business plans, ineffective strategy execution, or failure to respond in a timely manner to changes in the regulatory, macroeconomic and competitive environments, customer preferences, and technology developments in the geographic locations in which we operate.Our appetite for strategic risk is assessed based on the strategic plan, with strategic risks selectively and carefully considered against the backdrop of the evolving marketplace. Strategic risk is managed in the context of our overall financial condition, risk appetite and stress test results, among other considerations. The chief executive officer and executive management team manage and act on significant strategic actions, such as divestitures, consolidation of legal entities or capital actions subsequent to required review and approval by the Board.For more information on our strategic risk management activities, see page 58 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Capital ManagementThe Corporation manages its capital position to maintain sufficient capital to support its business activities and maintain capital, risk and risk appetite commensurate with one another. Additionally, we seek to maintain safety and soundness at all times even under adverse scenarios, take advantage of organic growth opportunities, maintain ready access to financial markets, continue to serve as a credit intermediary, remain a source of strength for our subsidiaries, and satisfy current and future regulatory capital requirements. Capital management is integrated into our risk and governance processes, as capital is a key consideration in the development of our strategic plan, risk appetite and risk limits.We conduct an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) on a quarterly basis. The ICAAP is a forward-looking assessment of our projected capital needs and resources, incorporating earnings, balance sheet and risk forecasts under baseline and adverse economic and market conditions. We utilize quarterly stress tests to assess the potential impacts to our balance sheet, earnings, regulatory capital and liquidity under a variety of stress scenarios. We perform qualitative risk assessments to identify and assess material risks not fully captured in our forecasts or stress tests. We assess the capital impacts of proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements. Management assesses ICAAP results and provides documented quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our capital guidelines and capital position to the Board or its committees.The Corporation periodically reviews capital allocated to its businesses and allocates capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. For additional information, see Business Segment Operations on page 22. 46Table of ContentsCCAR and Capital PlanningThe Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and requests for capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) capital plan. The CCAR capital plan is the central element of the Federal Reserve's approach to ensure that large BHCs have adequate capital and robust processes for managing their capital.In January 2015, we submitted our 2015 CCAR capital plan and related supervisory stress tests, and we received the results in March 2015. Based on the information in our January 2015 submission, we exceeded all stressed capital ratio minimum requirements in the severely adverse scenario with more than $20 billion in excess capital after all planned capital actions, a significant improvement from the prior-year CCAR quantitative results. On March 11, 2015, the Federal Reserve advised that it did not object to our 2015 capital plan but gave a conditional, non-objection under which we are required to resubmit our capital plan by September 30, 2015 and address certain weaknesses identified in the capital planning process. If identified weaknesses are not satisfactorily addressed when the Federal Reserve reviews our resubmitted capital plan, the Federal Reserve may restrict our future capital distributions. The requested capital actions included a request to repurchase $4.0 billion of common stock over five quarters beginning in the second quarter of 2015, and to maintain the quarterly common stock dividend at the current rate of $0.05 per share. We have begun a review of our entire CCAR process with a goal of assuring better alignment with regulator expectations. Pending the resubmission of our capital plan, we are permitted, and have proceeded with our stock repurchase program and to maintain our common stock dividend at the current rate. The timing and amount of common stock repurchases and common stock dividends will be consistent with our 2015 CCAR capital plan and subject to the Federal Reserve's review of our submission of a revised capital plan as discussed above. In addition, the timing and amount of common stock repurchases will be subject to various factors, including the Corporation's capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. The common stock repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.Regulatory CapitalAs a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by U.S. banking regulators. On January 1, 2014, we became subject to Basel 3, which includes certain transition provisions through January 1, 2019 (Basel 3 Standardized – Transition). Basel 3 generally continues to be subject to interpretation and clarification by U.S. banking regulators. Basel 3 expanded and modified the calculation of risk-weighted assets for credit and market risk (applicable to banks that meet the definition as an advanced approaches bank), and introduced a Standardized approach for the calculation of risk-weighted assets, which serves as a minimum. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, meet the definition of an advanced approaches bank and measure regulatory capital adequacy based on Basel 3.Risk-weighted assets are calculated for credit risk for all on- and off-balance sheet credit exposures and for market risk on trading assets and liabilities, including derivative exposures. Credit risk-weighted assets are calculated by assigning a prescribed risk weight to all on-balance sheet assets and to the credit equivalent amount of certain off-balance sheet exposures. Off-balance sheet exposures include financial guarantees, unfunded lending commitments, letters of credit and derivatives. Market risk-weighted assets are calculated using risk models for trading account positions, including all foreign exchange and commodity positions, regardless of the applicable accounting guidance. Any assets that are a direct deduction from the computation of capital are excluded from risk-weighted assets and adjusted average total assets, consistent with regulatory guidance. For more information on the regulatory capital amounts and calculations, see Basel 3 below.Basel 3Basel 3 provides Tier 1 and Total capital calculations and establishes a Common equity tier 1 capital ratio. Basel 3 also includes minimum capital ratios and buffer requirements and a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), and addresses the composition of regulatory capital and the adequately capitalized minimum requirements under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. The composition of regulatory capital under Basel 3 is subject to a transition period as described below. The new minimum capital ratio requirements and related buffers are being phased in from January 1, 2014 through January 1, 2019. For more information on the SLR, see Capital Management – Other Regulatory Capital Requirements on page 53. 47Table of ContentsAs an advanced approaches bank, under Basel 3, we are required to complete a qualification period (parallel run) to demonstrate compliance with the Basel 3 rules to the satisfaction of U.S. banking regulators. Upon notification of approval by U.S. banking regulators to exit our parallel run, we will be required to report regulatory capital ratios and risk-weighted assets under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is to be used to assess capital adequacy including under the PCA framework. Prior to receipt of notification of approval, we are required to report our capital adequacy under the Standardized approach only.Effective January 1, 2015, the PCA framework was amended to reflect the new capital requirements under Basel 3. The PCA framework establishes categories of capitalization, including "well capitalized," based on regulatory ratio requirements. U.S. banking regulators are required to take certain mandatory actions depending on the category of capitalization, with no mandatory actions required for "well-capitalized" banking organizations, which included BANA at March 31, 2015. Effective January 1, 2015, Common equity tier 1 capital is included in the measurement of "well capitalized."Regulatory Capital Composition – TransitionBasel 3 requires deductions from capital related to MSRs, deferred tax assets and defined benefit pension assets. Basel 3 also provides for the inclusion in capital of unrealized gains and losses on AFS debt and certain marketable equity securities recorded in accumulated OCI. These changes will be impacted by, among other things, fluctuations in interest rates, earnings performance and corporate actions. Changes to the composition of regulatory capital under Basel 3 are recognized in 20 percent annual increments, and will be fully recognized as of January 1, 2018.Table 14 summarizes how certain regulatory capital deductions and adjustments have been or will be transitioned from 2014 through 2018 for Common equity tier 1 and Tier 1 capital.Table 14Summary of Certain Basel 3 Regulatory Capital Transition ProvisionsBeginning on January 1 of each year2014 2015 2016 2017 2018Common equity tier 1 capital         Percent of total amount deducted from Common equity tier 1 capital includes:20% 40% 60% 80% 100%Deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards; intangibles, other than mortgage servicing rights and goodwill; defined benefit pension fund net assets; net unrealized cumulative gains (losses) related to changes in own credit risk on liabilities, including derivatives, measured at fair value; direct and indirect investments in own Common equity tier 1 capital instruments; certain amounts exceeding the threshold by 10 percent individually and 15 percent in aggregatePercent of total amount used to adjust Common equity tier 1 capital includes (1):80% 60% 40% 20% 0%Net unrealized gains (losses) on AFS debt and certain marketable equity securities recorded in accumulated OCI; employee benefit plan adjustments recorded in accumulated OCITier 1 capital         Percent of total amount deducted from Tier 1 capital includes:80% 60% 40% 20% 0%Deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards; defined benefit pension fund net assets; net unrealized cumulative gains (losses) related to changes in own credit risk on liabilities, including derivatives, measured at fair value(1) Represents the phase-out percentage of the exclusion by year (e.g., 20 percent of net unrealized gains (losses) on AFS debt and certain marketable equity securities recorded in accumulated OCI was included in 2014).Additionally, Basel 3 revised the regulatory capital treatment for Trust Securities, requiring them to be transitioned from Tier 1 capital into Tier 2 capital in 2014 and 2015, until fully excluded from Tier 1 capital in 2016, and transitioned from Tier 2 capital beginning in 2016 with the full amount excluded in 2022. As of March 31, 2015, our qualifying Trust Securities were $1.4 billion (approximately 10 bps of the Tier 1 capital ratio). 48Table of ContentsStandardized ApproachUnder the Basel 3 Standardized approach, credit risk-weighted assets are measured by applying fixed risk weights to each exposure (excluding securitizations), determined based on the characteristics of the exposure, such as type of obligor, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) country risk code and maturity, among others. For securitization exposures, risk-weighted assets are determined using the Simplified Supervisory Formula Approach (SSFA). Under the Standardized approach, no distinction is made for variations in credit quality for corporate exposures, and the economic benefit of collateral is restricted to a limited list of eligible securities and cash. We estimate that our Common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the Basel 3 Standardized approach, on a fully phased-in basis, would have been 10.3 percent at March 31, 2015. As of March 31, 2015, we estimate that our Basel 3 Standardized Common equity tier 1 capital would have been $147.2 billion and total risk-weighted assets would have been $1,431 billion, on a fully phased-in basis. For a reconciliation of Basel 3 Standardized – Transition to Basel 3 Standardized estimates on a fully phased-in basis for Common equity tier 1 capital, see Table 18. Our estimates under the Basel 3 Standardized approach may be refined over time as a result of further rulemaking or clarification by U.S. banking regulators or as our understanding and interpretation of the rules evolve. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.Advanced ApproachesIn addition to the exposures calculated under the Basel 3 Standardized approach, the Basel 3 Advanced approaches include measures of operational risk and risks related to the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) for over-the-counter (OTC) derivative exposures. The Advanced approaches rely on internal analytical models to measure risk weights for credit risk exposures and allow the use of models to estimate the exposure at default (EAD) for certain exposure types. Market risk capital measurements are consistent with the Standardized approach, except for securitization exposures, where the Supervisory Formula Approach (SFA) is also permitted. Credit risk for securitization exposures is based on the SSFA if an SFA approach is unavailable for a particular exposure. Non-securitization credit risk exposures are measured using internal ratings-based models to determine the applicable risk weight by estimating the probability of default, loss-given default (LGD) and, in certain instances, EAD. The internal analytical models primarily rely on internal historical default and loss experience. Operational risk is measured using internal analytical models which rely on both internal and external operational loss experience and data. The calculations require management to make estimates, assumptions and interpretations, including with respect to the probability of future events based on historical experience. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.We estimate that our Common equity tier 1 capital ratio under the Basel 3 Advanced approaches, on a fully phased-in basis, would have been 10.1 percent at March 31, 2015. As of March 31, 2015, we estimate that our Basel 3 Advanced Common equity tier 1 capital would have been $147.2 billion and total risk-weighted assets would have been $1,461 billion, on a fully phased-in basis. These estimates assume approval by U.S. banking regulators of our internal analytical models, including approval of the internal models methodology, but do not include the benefit of the removal of the surcharge applicable to the Comprehensive Risk Measure (CRM). Our estimates under the Basel 3 Advanced approaches may be refined over time as a result of further rulemaking or clarification by U.S. banking regulators or as our understanding and interpretation of the rules evolve. The U.S. banking regulators have requested modifications to certain internal analytical models including the wholesale (e.g., commercial) and other credit models which would increase our risk-weighted assets and, as a result, negatively impact our capital ratios, including our Common equity tier 1 ratio by approximately 100 bps. We are currently working with the U.S. banking regulators in order to exit parallel run. 49Table of ContentsCapital Composition and RatiosTable 15 presents Bank of America Corporation's capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized – Transition as measured at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.Table 15Bank of America Corporation Regulatory Capital March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014(Dollars in millions)Ratio (1) Amount Ratio (1) AmountCommon equity tier 1 capital11.1% $155,438 12.3% $155,361Tier 1 capital12.3 173,155 13.4 168,973Total capital15.3 214,481 16.5 208,670Tier 1 leverage8.4 173,155 8.2 168,973             March 31 2015 December 31 2014Risk-weighted assets (in billions) (2)    $1,405 $1,262Adjusted quarterly average total assets (in billions) (3)    2,060 2,060(1) When presented on a fully phased-in basis, beginning January 1, 2019, the minimum Basel 3 Common equity tier 1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratio requirements for the Corporation are expected to significantly increase and will be comprised of the minimum ratio for Common equity tier 1, Tier 1 and Total capital, plus a capital conservation buffer and the G-SIB buffer. For more information on these buffers, see Capital Management – Other Regulatory Capital Requirements on page 53.(2) On a pro-forma basis, under the Basel 3 Standardized – Transition as measured at January 1, 2015, the December 31, 2014 risk-weighted assets would have been $1,392 billion.(3) Reflects adjusted average total assets for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.Table 16 presents regulatory minimum and "well-capitalized" ratio requirements in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized – Transition as measured at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.

For more information on Basel 3 transition provisions, see Table 14. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, Total capital increased $5.8 billion primarily driven by earnings and issuances of preferred stock and subordinated debt. The Tier 1 leverage ratio increased 21 bps for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014 primarily driven by an increase in Tier 1 capital. For additional information, see Tables 15 and 17.Risk-weighted assets increased $144 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2015 to $1,405 billion primarily due to the change in the calculation of risk-weighted assets from the general risk-based approach at December 31, 2014 to the Basel 3 Standardized approach. 50Table of ContentsAt March 31, 2015, an increase or decrease in our Common equity tier 1, Tier 1 or Total capital ratios by one bp would require a change of $141 million in Common equity tier 1, Tier 1 or Total capital. We could also increase our Common equity tier 1, Tier 1 or Total capital ratios by one bp on such date by a reduction in risk-weighted assets of $1.3 billion, $1.1 billion and $920 million, respectively. An increase in our Tier 1 leverage ratio by one bp on such date would require $206 million of additional Tier 1 capital or a reduction of $2.4 billion in adjusted average assets.Table 17 presents the capital composition as measured under Basel 3 Standardized – Transition at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.Table 17Capital Composition(Dollars in millions)March 31 2015 December 31 2014Total common shareholders' equity$227,915 $224,162Goodwill(69,231) (69,234)Intangibles, other than mortgage servicing rights and goodwill(1,214) (639)Net unrealized gains (losses) on AFS debt securities and net losses on derivatives recorded in accumulated OCI, net-of-tax— 573Unamortized net periodic benefit costs recorded in accumulated OCI, net-of-tax1,995 2,680DVA related to liabilities and derivatives (1)332 231Deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards(4,021) (2,226)Other(338) (186)Common equity tier 1 capital155,438 155,361Qualifying preferred stock, net of issuance cost22,273 19,308Deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards under transition(6,031) (8,905)DVA related to liabilities and derivatives under transition498 925Defined benefit pension fund assets(459) (599)Trust preferred securities1,447 2,893Other(11) (10)Total Tier 1 capital173,155 168,973Long-term debt qualifying as Tier 2 capital19,538 17,953Nonqualifying trust preferred securities subject to phase out from Tier 2 capital4,843 3,881Qualifying allowance for credit losses14,213 14,634Other2,732 3,229Total capital$214,481 $208,670(1) Represents loss on structured liabilities and derivatives, net-of-tax, that is excluded from Common equity tier 1, Tier 1 and Total capital for regulatory capital purposes. 51Table of ContentsTable 18 presents a reconciliation of our Common equity tier 1 capital in accordance with the Basel 3 Standardized – Transition to the Basel 3 Standardized approach fully phased-in estimates and Basel 3 Advanced approaches fully phased-in estimates at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.

We are currently working with the U.S. banking regulators in order to exit parallel run.Bank of America, N.A. Regulatory CapitalTable 19 presents regulatory capital information for BANA in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized – Transition as measured at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.Table 19Bank of America, N.A.

The Total capital ratio decreased 59 bps to 14.0 percent at March 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014 and the Tier 1 leverage ratio decreased 11 bps to 9.5 percent. The decrease in the Total capital ratio was driven by the same factors as the Common equity tier 1 capital ratio. The decrease in the Tier 1 leverage ratio was primarily driven by an increase in adjusted quarterly average total assets.Other Regulatory Capital RequirementsSupplementary Leverage RatioBasel 3 also requires the calculation of a SLR. The numerator of the SLR is quarter-end Basel 3 Tier 1 capital. The denominator is supplementary leverage exposure based on the daily average of the sum of on-balance sheet exposures less permitted Tier 1 deductions, as well as the simple average of certain off-balance sheet exposures, as of the end of each month in a quarter. Off-balance sheet exposures include lending commitments, letters of credit, OTC derivatives, repo-style transactions and margin loan commitments. Total leverage exposure includes the effective notional principal amount of credit derivatives and similar instruments through which credit protection is sold. The credit conversion factors (CCFs) applied to certain off-balance sheet exposures, conform to the graduated CCF utilized under the Basel 3 Standardized approach, but are subject to a minimum 10 percent CCF. Effective January 1, 2018, the Corporation will be required to maintain a minimum SLR of 3.0 percent, plus a supplementary leverage buffer of 2.0 percent, in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses. Insured depository institutions, including BANA, will be required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered "well capitalized."As of March 31, 2015, the Corporation's SLR was 6.3 percent, which exceeds the 5.0 percent threshold that represents the minimum plus the supplementary leverage buffer for BHCs. The SLR for BANA was 7.1 percent, which exceeds the 6.0 percent "well-capitalized" level for insured depository institutions of BHCs.Global Systemically Important Bank SurchargeIn November 2011, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) published a methodology to identify global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) and impose an additional loss absorbency requirement through the introduction of a surcharge of up to 3.5 percent, which must be satisfied with Common equity tier 1 capital. The assessment methodology relies on an indicator-based measurement approach to determine a score relative to the global banking industry. The chosen indicators are size, complexity, cross-jurisdictional activity, inter-connectedness and substitutability/financial institution infrastructure. Institutions with the highest scores are designated as G-SIBs and are assigned to one of four loss absorbency buckets from 1.0 percent to 2.5 percent, in 0.5 percent increments based on each institution's relative score and supervisory judgment. A fifth loss absorbency bucket of 3.5 percent is currently empty and serves to discourage banks from becoming more systemically important. Also in November 2011, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) published an integrated set of policy measures and identified an initial group of G-SIBs, which included the Corporation.In July 2013, the Basel Committee updated the November 2011 methodology to recalibrate the substitutability/financial institution infrastructure indicator by introducing a cap on the weighting of that component, and requiring the annual publication by the FSB of key information necessary to permit each G-SIB to calculate its score and observe its position within the buckets and relative to the industry total for each indicator. Every three years, beginning on January 1, 2016, the Basel Committee will reconsider and recalibrate the bucket thresholds. The Basel Committee and FSB expect banks to change their behavior in response to the incentives of the G-SIB framework, as well as other aspects of Basel 3 and jurisdiction-specific regulations.In November 2014, the Basel Committee published an updated list of G-SIBs and their respective loss absorbency buckets. As of March 31, 2015, we estimated our surcharge at 1.5 percent based on this information and the FSB's report, "2014 update of list of global systemically important banks (G-SIBs)." Our surcharge could change each year based on our actions and those of our peers, as the scoring methods utilize data from the Corporation in combination with the industry. If our score were to increase, we could be subject to a higher G-SIB surcharge.In December 2014, the Federal Reserve proposed a regulation that would implement G-SIB surcharge requirements for the largest U.S. BHCs. Under the proposal, assignment to loss absorbency buckets would be determined by the higher score as calculated according to two methods. Method 1 is substantially similar to the Basel Committee's methodology, whereas Method 2 replaces the substitutability/financial institution infrastructure indicator with a measure of short-term wholesale funding and then multiplies the overall score by two. The Federal Reserve estimates that Method 2 will yield a higher surcharge, currently ranging from 1.0 percent to 4.5 percent. 53Table of ContentsUnder the proposed U.S. rules, the G-SIB surcharge requirement will begin to phase in effective January 2016, with full implementation in January 2019. Data from the Basel Committee's original five indicators, measured as of December 31, 2014, combined with short-term wholesale funding data covering the third quarter of 2015, is expected to be used to determine the G-SIB surcharge that will be effective in 2016.For more information on regulatory capital, see Note 16 – Regulatory Requirements and Restrictions to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Capital Conservation and Countercyclical Capital BuffersBeginning January 1, 2016, we will be subject to capital conservation and countercyclical capital buffers. The Corporation will be required to maintain a capital conservation buffer greater than 2.5 percent, plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer once fully phased in, in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and bonus payments. The capital conservation buffer will be composed solely of Common equity tier 1 capital. The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set at zero. U.S. banking regulators must jointly decide on any increase in the countercyclical buffer, after which time banks will have one year to implement.Minimum Total Loss Absorbing CapacityIn November 2014, the FSB proposed standards for the total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) that G-SIBs would be required to maintain in order to facilitate an orderly resolution in the event of failure. The proposal would require G-SIBs to hold sufficient amounts of qualifying regulatory capital and debt instruments to help ensure continuity of critical functions upon a resolution without imposing losses on taxpayers or threatening financial stability. Under the proposal, a G-SIB would be required to maintain minimum TLAC of 16.0 percent to 20.0 percent of risk-weighted assets, excluding regulatory capital buffers, and at least twice the minimum Basel 3 Tier 1 leverage ratio. The proposal is expected to be revised after the FSB reviews public comments received on the proposal and completes its impact assessment including a quantitative impact study and a market survey. The FSB intends to submit a final proposal to the Group of Twenty (G-20) by the fourth quarter of 2015 in advance of its summit. U.S. banking regulators are expected to propose TLAC rules in 2015 which would be applicable to U.S. banks that have been designated as G-SIBs.Broker-dealer Regulatory Capital and Securities RegulationThe Corporation's principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith (MLPF&S) and Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp (MLPCC). MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of MLPF&S and provides clearing and settlement services. Both entities are subject to the net capital requirements of SEC Rule 15c3-1. Both entities are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Regulation 1.17.MLPF&S has elected to compute the minimum capital requirement in accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirement as permitted by SEC Rule 15c3-1. At March 31, 2015, MLPF&S's regulatory net capital as defined by Rule 15c3-1 was $10.5 billion and exceeded the minimum requirement of $1.5 billion by $9.0 billion. MLPCC's net capital of $3.3 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $518 million by $2.7 billion.In accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirements, MLPF&S is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion, net capital in excess of $500 million and notify the SEC in the event its tentative net capital is less than $5.0 billion. At March 31, 2015, MLPF&S had tentative net capital and net capital in excess of the minimum and notification requirements.Merrill Lynch International (MLI), a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority, and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At March 31, 2015, MLI's capital resources were $34.4 billion which exceeded the minimum requirement of $19.7 billion. 54Table of ContentsCommon and Preferred Stock DividendsFor a summary of our declared quarterly cash dividends on common stock during the first quarter of 2015 and through April 29, 2015, see Note 11 – Shareholders' Equity to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet all contractual and contingent financial obligations at all times, including during periods of stress. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain excess liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks. We define excess liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as those obligations arise. We manage our liquidity position through line of business and asset-liability management activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity risk management within Corporate Treasury enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. For more information regarding global funding and liquidity risk management, see Liquidity Risk – Funding and Liquidity Risk Management on page 65 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Global Excess Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered AssetsWe maintain excess liquidity available to Bank of America Corporation, including the parent company and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Our liquidity buffer, or Global Excess Liquidity Sources, is comprised of assets that are readily available to the parent company and selected subsidiaries, including bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, even during stressed market conditions. Our cash is primarily on deposit with the Federal Reserve and, to a lesser extent, central banks outside of the U.S. We limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS and a select group of non-U.S. government and supranational securities. We believe we can quickly obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold our Global Excess Liquidity Sources in legal entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses, and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities. Our Global Excess Liquidity Sources are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final LCR rules. For more information on the final rules, see Liquidity Risk – Basel 3 Liquidity Standards on page 58. 56Table of ContentsOur Global Excess Liquidity Sources were $478 billion and $439 billion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 and were maintained as presented in Table 21.Table 21Global Excess Liquidity Sources(Dollars in billions)March 31 2015 December 31 2014 Average for Three Months Ended March 31, 2015Parent company$93 $98 $92Bank subsidiaries354 306 339Other regulated entities31 35 35Total Global Excess Liquidity Sources$478 $439 $466As shown in Table 21, parent company Global Excess Liquidity Sources totaled $93 billion and $98 billion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The decrease in parent company liquidity was primarily due to derivative collateral outflows and incentive compensation funding. Typically, parent company excess liquidity is in the form of cash deposited with BANA.Global Excess Liquidity Sources available to our bank subsidiaries totaled $354 billion and $306 billion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The increase in bank subsidiaries' liquidity was primarily due to deposit inflows and a shift from less liquid mortgage loans into more liquid securities, partially offset by dividends to the parent company. Global Excess Liquidity Sources at bank subsidiaries exclude the cash deposited by the parent company. Our bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of other unencumbered loans and securities to certain FHLBs and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was approximately $190 billion and $214 billion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries and can only be transferred to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries with prior regulatory approval.Global Excess Liquidity Sources available to our other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, totaled $31 billion and $35 billion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Our other regulated entities also held other unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity. Liquidity held in an other regulated entity is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity and transfers to the parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements.Table 22 presents the composition of Global Excess Liquidity Sources at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.Table 22Global Excess Liquidity Sources Composition (Dollars in billions)March 31 2015 December 31 2014Cash on deposit$122 $97U.S. Treasury securities60 74U.S. agency securities and mortgage-backed securities274 252Non-U.S. government and supranational securities22 16Total Global Excess Liquidity Sources$478 $439 57Table of ContentsTime-to-required Funding and Stress ModelingWe use a variety of metrics to determine the appropriate amounts of excess liquidity to maintain at the parent company, our bank subsidiaries and other regulated entities. One metric we use to evaluate the appropriate level of excess liquidity at the parent company is "time-to-required funding." This debt coverage measure indicates the number of months that the parent company can continue to meet its unsecured contractual obligations as they come due using only its Global Excess Liquidity Sources without issuing any new debt or accessing any additional liquidity sources. We define unsecured contractual obligations for purposes of this metric as maturities of senior or subordinated debt issued or guaranteed by Bank of America Corporation. These include certain unsecured debt instruments, primarily structured liabilities, which we may be required to settle for cash prior to maturity. Our time-to-required funding was 37 months at March 31, 2015. For purposes of calculating time-to-required funding at March 31, 2015, we have included in the amount of unsecured contractual obligations $8.6 billion related to the BNY Mellon Settlement. The BNY Mellon Settlement is subject to final approval and the timing of this payment is not certain. For more information on the BNY Mellon Settlement, see Note 7 – Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We also utilize liquidity stress models to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of excess liquidity to maintain at the parent company, our bank subsidiaries and other regulated entities. These models are risk sensitive and have become increasingly important in analyzing our potential contractual and contingent cash outflows beyond those outflows considered in the time-to-required funding analysis. We evaluate the liquidity requirements under a range of scenarios with varying levels of severity and time horizons. The scenarios we consider and utilize incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific events, including potential credit rating downgrades for the parent company and our subsidiaries, and are based on historical experience, regulatory guidance, and both expected and unexpected future events.The types of potential contractual and contingent cash outflows we consider in our scenarios may include, but are not limited to, upcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt and reductions in new debt issuance; diminished access to secured financing markets; potential deposit withdrawals; increased draws on loan commitments, liquidity facilities and letters of credit; additional collateral that counterparties could call if our credit ratings were downgraded; collateral and margin requirements arising from market value changes; and potential liquidity required to maintain businesses and finance customer activities. Changes in certain market factors including, but not limited to, credit rating downgrades, could negatively impact potential contractual and contingent outflows and the related financial instruments, and in some cases these impacts could be material to our financial results.We consider all sources of funds that we could access during each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available sources with corresponding liquidity requirements by legal entity. We also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset-liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses.Basel 3 Liquidity Standards The Basel Committee has issued two liquidity risk-related standards that are considered part of the Basel 3 liquidity standards: the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). In 2014, the U.S. banking regulators finalized LCR requirements for the largest U.S. financial institutions on a consolidated basis and for their subsidiary depository institutions with total assets greater than $10 billion. The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution's unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Under the final rule, an initial minimum LCR of 80 percent was required as of January 2015, and will increase thereafter in 10 percentage point increments annually through January 2017. These minimum requirements are applicable to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. As of March 31, 2015, we estimate the consolidated Corporation was above the 2017 LCR requirements. In 2014, the Basel Committee issued a final standard for the NSFR, the standard that is intended to reduce funding risk over a longer time horizon. The NSFR is designed to ensure an appropriate amount of stable funding, generally capital and liabilities maturing beyond one year, given the mix of assets and off-balance sheet items. The final standard aligns the NSFR to the LCR and gives more credit to a wider range of funding. The final standard also includes adjustments to the stable funding required for certain types of assets, some of which reduce the stable funding requirement and some of which increase it. Basel Committee standards generally do not apply directly to U.S. financial institutions, but require adoption by U.S. banking regulators. The U.S. banking regulators are expected to propose a similar NSFR regulation applicable to U.S. financial institutions in the near future. We expect to meet the NSFR requirement within the regulatory timeline. 58Table of ContentsDiversified Funding SourcesWe fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding strategy. We diversify our funding globally across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups.The primary benefits of our centralized funding strategy include greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations, time zone differences or other business considerations make parent company funding impractical, certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt.We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.15 trillion and $1.12 trillion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Deposits are primarily generated by our Consumer Banking, GWIM and Global Banking segments. These deposits are diversified by clients, product type and geography, and the majority of our U.S. deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. We consider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of funding. We believe this deposit funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources. Our lending activities may also be financed through secured borrowings, including credit card securitizations and securitizations with GSEs, the FHA and private-label investors, as well as FHLB loans.Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. We believe funding these activities in the secured financing markets is more cost-efficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing. Repurchase agreements are generally short-term and often overnight. Disruptions in secured financing markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant reductions in the availability of such financing. We manage the liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding globally from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when appropriate. For more information on secured financing agreements, see Note 9 – Federal Funds Sold or Purchased, Securities Financing Agreements and Short-term Borrowings to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We issue long-term unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. While the cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or the Corporation, we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month or quarter. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we issued $9.3 billion of long-term debt, consisting of $4.2 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $3.4 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $1.7 billion of other debt. 59Table of ContentsTable 23 presents the carrying value of aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt as of March 31, 2015. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we had total long-term debt maturities and purchases of $11.7 billion consisting of $7.2 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $2.3 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $2.2 billion of other debt.Table 23Long-term Debt By Maturity Remainder of            (Dollars in millions)2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Thereafter TotalBank of America Corporation             Senior notes$11,420 $16,954 $18,463 $19,941 $15,929 $40,547 $123,254Senior structured notes3,333 3,290 1,520 1,830 1,389 6,945 18,307Subordinated notes1,210 4,992 4,995 2,632 1,473 15,654 30,956Junior subordinated notes— — — — — 7,284 7,284Total Bank of America Corporation15,963 25,236 24,978 24,403 18,791 70,430 179,801Bank of America, N.A.

We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity and other factors. In addition, our other regulated entities may make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. For more information on long-term debt funding, see Note 11 – Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K and for more information regarding funding and liquidity risk management, see page 65 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 60Table of ContentsWe use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For further details on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for Non-trading Activities on page 108.We may also issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes for client purposes. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we issued $872 million of structured notes, a majority of which was issued by Bank of America Corporation. Structured notes are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured liability obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. We had outstanding structured liabilities with a carrying value of $34.6 billion and $38.8 billion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price.Contingency PlanningWe maintain contingency funding plans that outline our potential responses to liquidity stress events at various levels of severity. These policies and plans are based on stress scenarios and include potential funding strategies and communication and notification procedures that we would implement in the event we experienced stressed liquidity conditions. We periodically review and test the contingency funding plans to validate efficacy and assess readiness.Our U.S. bank subsidiaries can access contingency funding through the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries have access to central bank facilities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. While we do not rely on these sources in our liquidity modeling, we maintain the policies, procedures and governance processes that would enable us to access these sources if necessary.Credit RatingsOur borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are impacted by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including OTC derivatives. Thus, it is our objective to maintain high-quality credit ratings, and management maintains an active dialogue with the rating agencies.Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies, and they consider a number of factors, including our own financial strength, performance, prospects and operations, as well as factors not under our control. The rating agencies could make adjustments to our ratings at any time, and they provide no assurances that they will maintain our ratings at current levels.Other factors that influence our credit ratings include changes to the rating agencies' methodologies for our industry or certain security types, the rating agencies' assessment of the general operating environment for financial services companies, the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government, our mortgage exposures (including litigation), our relative positions in the markets in which we compete, reputation, liquidity position, diversity of funding sources, funding costs, the level and volatility of earnings, corporate governance and risk management policies, capital position, capital management practices, and current or future regulatory and legislative initiatives.All three agencies have indicated that, as a systemically important financial institution, the senior credit ratings of the Corporation and Bank of America, N.A. (or in the case of Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's), only the ratings of Bank of America, N.A.) currently reflect the expectation that, if necessary, we would receive significant support from the U.S. government, and that they will continue to assess such support in the context of sovereign financial strength and regulatory and legislative developments.On March 17, 2015, Moody's announced several rating actions affecting banks globally following the publication of its new bank rating methodology. As a result, certain ratings of Bank of America have been placed on review for upgrade, including the long-term senior debt and preferred stock ratings of Bank of America Corporation and the long-term senior debt and long-term deposit ratings of Bank of America, N.A. Moody's has indicated that Bank of America Corporation's and Bank of America, N.A.'s long-term senior debt ratings could each increase by one notch to Baa1 and A1, respectively, as a result of this review. The ratings and outlook of the short-term and long-term subordinated debt of Bank of America Corporation and the short-term debt of Bank of America, N.A. remain unchanged. Moody's indicated that it expects to conclude its review in the coming few months. 61Table of ContentsOn December 2, 2014, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (S&P) affirmed the ratings of Bank of America, and revised the outlook on our core operating subsidiaries, including Bank of America, N.A., MLPF&S and MLI, to stable from negative. The negative outlook on the ratings of Bank of America Corporation reflects S&P's ongoing evaluation of whether to continue to include uplift for extraordinary U.S. government support in the ratings of systematically important BHCs. S&P currently includes two notches of uplift for extraordinary U.S. government support in its senior debt rating for Bank of America Corporation.On November 25, 2014, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) concluded its periodic review of 12 large, complex securities trading and universal banks, including Bank of America Corporation. As a result of this review, Fitch affirmed all of the Corporation's credit ratings and retained a negative outlook. The negative outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that the probability of the U.S. government providing support to a systemically important financial institution during a crisis is likely to decline due to the orderly liquidation provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Fitch has stated that it is likely to remove its support-driven rating floor of A for systemically important U.S. BHCs during the first half of 2015; such removal would likely result in a one-notch downgrade to Bank of America Corporation's long-term senior debt rating.Table 25 presents the Corporation's current long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies.Table 25Senior Debt Ratings  Moody's Investors Service Standard & Poor's Fitch Ratings Long-term Short-term Outlook Long-term Short-term Outlook Long-term Short-term OutlookBank of America CorporationBaa2 P-2 (1) Review for upgrade A- A-2 Negative A F1 NegativeBank of America, N.A.A2 P-1 (1) Review for upgrade A A-1 Stable A F1 NegativeMerrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & SmithNR NR NR A A-1 Stable A F1 NegativeMerrill Lynch InternationalNR NR NR A A-1 Stable A F1 Negative(1) The short-term ratings are not on review for upgrade.NR = not ratedA reduction in certain of our credit ratings or the ratings of certain asset-backed securitizations may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, potential loss of access to credit markets, the related cost of funds, our businesses and on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where counterparty creditworthiness is critical. In addition, under the terms of certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, in the event of downgrades of our or our rated subsidiaries' credit ratings, the counterparties to those agreements may require us to provide additional collateral, or to terminate these contracts or agreements, which could cause us to sustain losses and/or adversely impact our liquidity. If the short-term credit ratings of our parent company, bank or broker-dealer subsidiaries were downgraded by one or more levels, the potential loss of access to short-term funding sources such as repo financing and the effect on our incremental cost of funds could be material.Table 26 presents the amount of additional collateral that would have been contractually required by derivative contracts and other trading agreements at March 31, 2015 if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch and by an additional second incremental notch.Table 26Additional Collateral Required to be Posted Upon Downgrade March 31, 2015(Dollars in millions)One incremental notch Second incremental notchBank of America Corporation$1,358 $2,714Bank of America, N.A. and subsidiaries (1)1,087 1,877(1) Included in Bank of America Corporation collateral requirements in this table. 62Table of ContentsTable 27 presents the derivative liabilities that would be subject to unilateral termination by counterparties and the amounts of collateral that would have been contractually required at March 31, 2015 if the long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries had been lower by one incremental notch and by an additional second incremental notch.Table 27Derivative Liability Subject to Unilateral Termination Upon Downgrade March 31, 2015(Dollars in millions)One incremental notch Second incremental notchDerivative liability$1,364 $4,724Collateral posted1,106 3,922While certain potential impacts are contractual and quantifiable, the full scope of the consequences of a credit rating downgrade to a financial institution is inherently uncertain, as it depends upon numerous dynamic, complex and inter-related factors and assumptions, including whether any downgrade of a company's long-term credit ratings precipitates downgrades to its short-term credit ratings, and assumptions about the potential behaviors of various customers, investors and counterparties. For more information on potential impacts of credit rating downgrades, see Liquidity Risk – Time-to-required Funding and Stress Modeling on page 58.For more information on the additional collateral and termination payments that could be required in connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements as a result of such a credit rating downgrade, see Note 2 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein and Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 63Table of ContentsCredit Risk ManagementCredit quality remained strong in the first quarter of 2015 driven by lower U.S. unemployment as well as our proactive credit risk management activities positively impacting our credit portfolio as nonperforming loans and leases and delinquencies continued to improve. For additional information, see Executive Summary – First-Quarter 2015 Economic and Business Environment on page 4.We proactively refine our underwriting and credit risk management practices as well as credit standards to meet the changing economic environment. To actively mitigate losses and enhance customer support in our consumer businesses, we have in place collection programs and loan modification and customer assistance infrastructures. We utilize a number of actions to mitigate losses in the commercial businesses including increasing the frequency and intensity of portfolio monitoring, hedging activity and our practice of transferring management of deteriorating commercial exposures to independent special asset officers as credits enter criticized categories.We have non-U.S. exposure largely in Europe and Asia Pacific. For more information on our exposures and related risks in non-U.S. countries, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 96 and Item 1A.

Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience. These models are a component of our consumer credit risk management process and are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk.During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we completed approximately 16,400 customer loan modifications with a total unpaid principal balance of approximately $3 billion, including approximately 5,700 permanent modifications, under the U.S. government's Making Home Affordable Program. Of the loan modifications completed during the three months ended March 31, 2015, in terms of both the volume of modifications and the unpaid principal balance associated with the underlying loans, more than half were in the Corporation's held-for-investment (HFI) portfolio. For modified loans on our balance sheet, these modification types are generally considered troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). For more information on TDRs and portfolio impacts, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity on page 82 and Note 4 – Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Consumer Credit PortfolioImprovement in the U.S. unemployment rate continued during the three months ended March 31, 2015 resulting in improved credit quality and lower credit losses across most major consumer portfolios compared to the same period in 2014. Nearly all consumer loan portfolios 30 days or more past due and all consumer loan portfolios 90 days or more past due declined during the three months ended March 31, 2015 as a result of improved delinquency trends. Although home prices have shown steady improvement since the beginning of 2012, they have not fully recovered to their 2006 levels.Improved credit quality and continued loan balance run-off across the consumer portfolio drove a $803 million decrease in the consumer allowance for loan and lease losses during the three months ended March 31, 2015 to $9.2 billion at March 31, 2015. For additional information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 98.For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, charge-offs and TDRs for the consumer portfolio, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Nonperforming loans do not include past due consumer credit card loans, other unsecured loans and in general, consumer non-real estate-secured loans (loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy are included) as these loans are typically charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. Real estate-secured past due consumer loans that are insured by the FHA or individually insured under long-term standby agreements with FNMA and FHLMC (collectively, the fully-insured loan portfolio) are reported as accruing as opposed to nonperforming since the principal repayment is insured. Fully-insured loans included in accruing past due 90 days or more are primarily from our repurchases of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA. Additionally, nonperforming loans and accruing balances past due 90 days or more do not include the PCI loan portfolio or loans accounted for under the fair value option even though the customer may be contractually past due.Table 29Consumer Credit Quality Nonperforming Accruing Past Due 90 Days or More(Dollars in millions)March 31 2015 December 31 2014 March 31 2015 December 31 2014Residential mortgage (1)$6,421 $6,889 $9,912 $11,407Home equity3,759 3,901 — —U.S. credit cardn/a n/a 795 866Non-U.S. credit cardn/a n/a 88 95Direct/Indirect consumer28 28 51 64Other consumer1 1 1 1Total (2)$10,209 $10,819 $10,847 $12,433Consumer loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans and leases (2)2.16% 2.22% 2.30% 2.56%Consumer loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding loans and leases, excluding PCI and fully-insured loan portfolios (2)2.58 2.70 0.24 0.26(1) Residential mortgage loans accruing past due 90 days or more are fully-insured loans.

These write-offs decreased the PCI valuation allowance included as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. For more information on PCI write-offs, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 77.(2) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option.Net charge-off ratios, excluding the PCI and fully-insured loan portfolios, were 0.59 percent and 0.36 percent for residential mortgage, 0.88 percent and 1.42 percent for home equity, and 1.14 percent and 1.31 percent for the total consumer portfolio for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These are the only product classifications that include PCI and fully-insured loans for these periods.Net charge-offs exclude write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio of $188 million and $281 million in residential mortgage and $100 million and $110 million in home equity for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014. These write-offs decreased the PCI valuation allowance included as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. Net charge-off ratios including the PCI write-offs were 0.73 percent and 0.67 percent for residential mortgage and 1.30 percent and 1.81 percent for home equity for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014.

Write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio decrease the PCI valuation allowance included as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. For more information on PCI write-offs, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 77. 69Table of ContentsWe believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we provide information that excludes the impact of the PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option in certain credit quality statistics. We separately disclose information on the PCI loan portfolio on page 77.Residential MortgageThe residential mortgage portfolio makes up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 44 percent of consumer loans and leases at March 31, 2015. Nearly 70 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio is in All Other and is comprised of originated loans, purchased loans used in our overall ALM activities, delinquent FHA loans repurchased pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA as well as loans repurchased related to our representations and warranties. Approximately 25 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio is in GWIM and represents residential mortgages originated for the home purchase and refinancing needs of our wealth management clients and the remaining portion of the portfolio is primarily in Consumer Banking.Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, decreased $8.3 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2015 due to loan sales including $5.3 billion of loans with standby insurance agreements and $1.0 billion of nonperforming and other delinquent loans, and to a lesser extent, runoff outpacing the retention of new originations. These declines were partially offset by repurchases of delinquent loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA, which are part of our mortgage banking activities.At March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the residential mortgage portfolio included $57.5 billion and $65.0 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans. On this portion of the residential mortgage portfolio, we are protected against principal loss as a result of either FHA insurance or long-term standby agreements with FNMA and FHLMC. At March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, $45.2 billion and $47.8 billion had FHA insurance with the remainder protected by long-term standby agreements. At March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, $14.9 billion and $15.9 billion of the FHA-insured loan population were repurchases of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA.The long-term standby agreements with FNMA and FHLMC reduce our regulatory risk-weighted assets due to the transfer of a portion of our credit risk to unaffiliated parties. At March 31, 2015, these programs had the cumulative effect of reducing our risk-weighted assets by $3.7 billion, increasing both our Tier 1 capital ratio and Common equity tier 1 capital ratio by three bps under the Basel 3 Standardized – Transition. This compared to reducing our risk-weighted assets by $5.2 billion, increasing both our Tier 1 capital ratio and Tier 1 Common capital ratio by five bps at December 31, 2014 under Basel 3 Standardized – Transition.Table 32 presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, and excluding the PCI loan portfolio, our fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. Additionally, in the "Reported Basis" columns in the table below, accruing balances past due and nonperforming loans do not include the PCI loan portfolio, in accordance with our accounting policies, even though the customer may be contractually past due. As such, the following discussion presents the residential mortgage portfolio excluding the PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option.

There were $1.9 billion of residential mortgage loans accounted for under the fair value option at both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. For more information on the fair value option, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option on page 81 and Note 15 – Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(2) These vintages of loans account for $2.5 billion, or 39 percent, and $2.8 billion, or 41 percent of nonperforming residential mortgage loans at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. For the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, these vintages accounted for $47 million, or 24 percent, and $64 million, or 51 percent of total residential mortgage net charge-offs.(3) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option.Nonperforming residential mortgage loans decreased $468 million during the three months ended March 31, 2015 including sales of $371 million, partially offset by a $130 million net increase related to the settlement with the DoJ for those loans that are no longer fully insured. Excluding these items, nonperforming residential mortgage loans decreased as outflows, including the transfer of certain qualifying borrowers discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy to performing status, outpaced new inflows. Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at March 31, 2015, $2.1 billion, or 33 percent, were current on contractual payments. Nonperforming loans that are contractually current primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, as well as loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance. In addition, $3.1 billion, or 48 percent of nonperforming residential mortgage loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans past due 30 days or more decreased $189 million during the three months ended March 31, 2015.Net charge-offs increased $70 million to $197 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015, or 0.59 percent of total average residential mortgage loans, compared to net charge-offs of $127 million, or 0.36 percent, for the same period in 2014. The increase in net charge-offs was primarily driven by $185 million of charge-offs related to the consumer relief portion of the settlement with the DoJ, partially offset by recoveries of $40 million related to nonperforming loan sales. Excluding these items, losses declined driven by favorable portfolio trends and decreased write-downs on loans greater than 180 days past due, which were written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell, due in part to improvement in home prices and the U.S. economy.Residential mortgage loans with a greater than 90 percent but less than or equal to 100 percent refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) represented six percent of the residential mortgage portfolio at both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent represented seven percent of the residential mortgage loan portfolio at both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Of the loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent, 96 percent were performing at both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where the outstanding carrying value of the loan is greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. The majority of these loans have a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent primarily due to home price deterioration since 2006, somewhat mitigated by subsequent appreciation. Loans to borrowers with refreshed FICO scores below 620 represented seven percent and eight percent of the residential mortgage portfolio at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. 71Table of ContentsOf the $136.2 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at March 31, 2015, as shown in Table 33, 40 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $12.7 billion, or 23 percent, at March 31, 2015. Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally have experienced a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At March 31, 2015, $248 million, or two percent of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $1.7 billion, or one percent for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at March 31, 2015, $907 million, or seven percent of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $462 million were contractually current, compared to $6.4 billion, or five percent for the entire residential mortgage portfolio, of which $2.1 billion were contractually current. Loans in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio have an interest-only period of three to ten years and more than 90 percent of these loans have yet to enter the amortization period and will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2016 or later.Table 33 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 13 percent of outstandings at both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. For both the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, loans within this MSA contributed net recoveries of $5 million within the residential mortgage portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 11 percent of outstandings at both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. For the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, loans within this MSA contributed net charge-offs of $39 million and $22 million within the residential mortgage portfolio.Table 33Residential Mortgage State Concentrations Outstandings (1) Nonperforming (1) Net Charge-offs (2) March 31 2015 December 31 2014 March 31 2015 December 31 2014 Three Months EndedMarch 31(Dollars in millions)    2015 2014California$45,950 $45,496 $1,328 $1,459 $(9) $(8)New York (3)12,091 11,826 470 477 13 13Florida (3)10,119 10,116 799 858 24 5Texas6,231 6,635 244 269 5 1Virginia4,334 4,402 226 244 7 6Other U.S./Non-U.S.57,504 57,600 3,354 3,582 157 110Residential mortgage loans (4)$136,229 $136,075 $6,421 $6,889 $197 $127Fully-insured loan portfolio57,511 64,970        Purchased credit-impaired residential mortgage loan portfolio14,185 15,152        Total residential mortgage loan portfolio$207,925 $216,197        (1) Outstandings and nonperforming amounts exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option.

For more information on the fair value option, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option on page 81 and Note 15 – Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(2) Net charge-offs exclude $188 million and $281 million of write-offs in the residential mortgage PCI loan portfolio for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014. These write-offs decreased the PCI valuation allowance included as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses. For more information on PCI write-offs, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 77.(3) In these states, foreclosure requires a court order following a legal proceeding (judicial states).(4) Amounts exclude the PCI residential mortgage and fully-insured loan portfolios.The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) encourages banks to meet the credit needs of their communities for housing and other purposes, particularly in neighborhoods with low or moderate incomes. Our CRA portfolio was $8.8 billion and $9.0 billion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, or six percent and seven percent of the residential mortgage portfolio. The CRA portfolio included $889 million and $986 million of nonperforming loans at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, representing 14 percent of total nonperforming residential mortgage loans for both periods. Net charge-offs in the CRA portfolio were $34 million for both the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, or 17 percent and 27 percent of total net charge-offs for the residential mortgage portfolio. 72Table of ContentsHome EquityAt March 31, 2015, the home equity portfolio made up 18 percent of the consumer portfolio and is comprised of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages.At March 31, 2015, our HELOC portfolio had an outstanding balance of $72.4 billion, or 87 percent of the total home equity portfolio compared to $74.2 billion, or 87 percent, at December 31, 2014. HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years. During the initial draw period, the borrowers are only required to pay the interest due on the loans on a monthly basis. After the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15-year amortizing loans. At March 31, 2015, our home equity loan portfolio had an outstanding balance of $9.4 billion, or 11 percent of the total home equity portfolio compared to $9.8 billion, or 11 percent, at December 31, 2014. Home equity loans are almost all fixed-rate loans with amortizing payment terms of 10 to 30 years and of the $9.4 billion at March 31, 2015, 53 percent have 25- to 30-year terms. At March 31, 2015, our reverse mortgage portfolio had an outstanding balance, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, of $1.8 billion, or two percent of the total home equity portfolio compared to $1.7 billion, or two percent, at December 31, 2014. We no longer originate reverse mortgages.At March 31, 2015, approximately 54 percent of the home equity portfolio was included in Consumer Banking, 37 percent was included in LAS and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM. Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, decreased $2.2 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2015 primarily due to paydowns and charge-offs outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. Of the total home equity portfolio at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, $20.7 billion and $20.6 billion, or 25 percent and 24 percent, were in first-lien positions (26 percent for both periods excluding the PCI home equity portfolio). At March 31, 2015, outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $14.8 billion, or 19 percent of our total home equity portfolio excluding the PCI loan portfolio.Unused HELOCs totaled $53.4 billion at March 31, 2015 compared to $53.7 billion at December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily due to customers choosing to close accounts, which more than offset customer paydowns of principal balances, as well as the impact of new production. The HELOC utilization rate was 58 percent at both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. 73Table of ContentsTable 34 presents certain home equity portfolio key credit statistics on both a reported basis excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, and excluding the PCI loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. Additionally, in the "Reported Basis" columns in the table below, accruing balances past due 30 days or more and nonperforming loans do not include the PCI loan portfolio, in accordance with our accounting policies, even though the customer may be contractually past due. As such, the following discussion presents the home equity portfolio excluding the PCI loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option.

For more information on the fair value option, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option on page 81 and Note 15 – Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(2) Accruing past due 30 days or more includes $92 million and $98 million and nonperforming loans includes $491 million and $505 million of loans where we serviced the underlying first-lien at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.(3) These vintages of loans have higher refreshed combined LTV ratios and accounted for 46 percent and 47 percent of nonperforming home equity loans at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, and 59 percent and 57 percent of net charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014.(4) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option.Nonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $142 million during the three months ended March 31, 2015 as outflows, including the transfer of certain qualifying borrowers discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy to performing status, outpaced new inflows. Of the nonperforming home equity portfolio at March 31, 2015, $1.6 billion, or 43 percent, were current on contractual payments. Nonperforming loans that are contractually current primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, junior-lien loans where the underlying first-lien is 90 days or more past due, as well as loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance. In addition, $1.5 billion, or 39 percent of nonperforming home equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Outstanding balances accruing past due 30 days or more increased $14 million during the three months ended March 31, 2015.In some cases, the junior-lien home equity outstanding balance that we hold is performing, but the underlying first-lien is not. For outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio on which we service the first-lien loan, we are able to track whether the first-lien loan is in default. For loans where the first-lien is serviced by a third party, we utilize credit bureau data to estimate the delinquency status of the first-lien. Given that the credit bureau database we use does not include a property address for the mortgages, we are unable to identify with certainty whether a reported delinquent first-lien mortgage pertains to the same property for which we hold a junior-lien loan. For certain loans, we utilize a third-party vendor to combine credit bureau and public record data to better link a junior-lien loan with the underlying first-lien mortgage. At March 31, 2015, we estimate that $1.5 billion of current and $201 million of 30 to 89 days past due junior-lien loans were behind a delinquent first-lien loan. We service the first-lien loans on $251 million of these combined amounts, with the remaining $1.5 billion serviced by third parties. Of the $1.7 billion of current to 89 days past due junior-lien loans, based on available credit bureau data and our own internal servicing data, we estimate that approximately $657 million had first-lien loans that were 90 days or more past due. 74Table of ContentsNet charge-offs decreased $130 million to $172 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015, or 0.88 percent of the total average home equity portfolio, compared to $302 million, or 1.42 percent for the same period in 2014. This decrease in net charge-offs for the three-month period was primarily driven by favorable portfolio trends due in part to improvement in home prices and the U.S. economy, partially offset by $45 million of charge-offs related to the consumer relief portion of the settlement with the DoJ. The net charge-off ratios were also impacted by lower outstanding balances primarily as a result of paydowns and charge-offs outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines.Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio with greater than 90 percent but less than or equal to 100 percent refreshed combined loan-to-value (CLTVs) comprised seven percent of the home equity portfolio at both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Outstanding balances with refreshed CLTVs greater than 100 percent comprised 15 percent and 14 percent of the home equity portfolio at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where the carrying value and available line of credit of the combined loans are equal to or greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. Depending on the value of the property, there may be collateral in excess of the first-lien that is available to reduce the severity of loss on the second-lien. Home price deterioration since 2006, partially mitigated by subsequent appreciation, has contributed to an increase in CLTV ratios. Of those outstanding balances with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent, 97 percent of the customers were current on their home equity loan and 93 percent of second-lien loans with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent were current on both their second-lien and underlying first-lien loans at March 31, 2015. Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio to borrowers with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented seven percent of the home equity portfolio at both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.Of the $78.2 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at March 31, 2015, as shown in Table 35, 74 percent were interest-only loans, almost all of which were HELOCs. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that have entered the amortization period was $6.2 billion, or nine percent of total HELOCs at March 31, 2015. The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At March 31, 2015, $152 million, or two percent of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $599 million, or one percent for the entire HELOC portfolio. In addition, at March 31, 2015, $937 million, or 15 percent of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $421 million were contractually current, compared to $3.4 billion, or five percent for the entire HELOC portfolio, of which $1.4 billion were contractually current. Loans in our HELOC portfolio generally have an initial draw period of 10 years and more than 75 percent of these loans have yet to enter the amortization period and will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2016 or later. We communicate to contractually current customers more than a year prior to the end of their draw period to inform them of the potential change to the payment structure before entering the amortization period, and provide payment options to customers prior to the end of the draw period.Although we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and that is still in its revolving period (i.e., customers may draw on and repay their line of credit, but are generally only required to pay interest on a monthly basis). During the three months ended March 31, 2015, approximately 52 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs. 75Table of ContentsTable 35 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 12 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. For the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, loans within this MSA contributed 11 percent and 14 percent of net charge-offs within the home equity portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 12 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. For three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, loans within this MSA contributed five percent and seven percent of net charge-offs within the home equity portfolio.Table 35Home Equity State Concentrations Outstandings (1) Nonperforming (1) Net Charge-offs (2) March 31 2015 December 31 2014 March 31 2015 December 31 2014 Three Months EndedMarch 31(Dollars in millions)    2015 2014California$22,652 $23,250 $993 $1,012 $24 $58Florida (3)9,383 9,633 569 574 30 47New Jersey (3)5,814 5,883 283 299 13 22New York (3)5,594 5,671 366 387 12 27Massachusetts3,578 3,655 138 148 5 8Other U.S./Non-U.S.31,196 32,016 1,410 1,481 88 140Home equity loans (4)$78,217 $80,108 $3,759 $3,901 $172 $302Purchased credit-impaired home equity portfolio5,354 5,617        Total home equity loan portfolio$83,571 $85,725        (1)Outstandings and nonperforming amounts exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option.

During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we sold PCI loans with a carrying value of $586 million compared to sales of $454 million for the same period in 2014.Of the unpaid principal balance of $20.1 billion at March 31, 2015, $16.7 billion, or 83 percent, was current based on the contractual terms, $1.4 billion, or seven percent, was in early stage delinquency, and $1.5 billion was 180 days or more past due, including $1.5 billion of first-lien mortgages and $95 million of home equity loans.During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we recorded a provision benefit of $50 million for the PCI loan portfolio including $13 million for residential mortgage and $37 million for home equity. This compared to no provision expense for the three months ended March 31, 2014. The provision benefit for the three months ended March 31, 2015 was primarily driven by improved macro-economic conditions.The PCI valuation allowance declined $338 million during the three months ended March 31, 2015 due to write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio of $188 million in residential mortgage and $100 million in home equity, and a provision benefit of $50 million. 77Table of ContentsPurchased Credit-impaired Residential Mortgage Loan PortfolioThe PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio represented 73 percent of the total PCI loan portfolio at March 31, 2015. Those loans to borrowers with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 38 percent of the PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio at March 31, 2015. Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 90 percent, after consideration of purchase accounting adjustments and the related valuation allowance, represented 36 percent of the PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio and 46 percent based on the unpaid principal balance at March 31, 2015. Table 37 presents outstandings net of purchase accounting adjustments and before the related valuation allowance, by certain state concentrations.Table 37Outstanding Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio – Residential Mortgage State Concentrations(Dollars in millions)March 31 2015 December 31 2014California$6,534 $6,885Florida (1)1,170 1,289Virginia615 640Maryland549 602Texas292 318Other U.S./Non-U.S.5,025 5,418Total$14,185 $15,152(1)In this state, foreclosure requires a court order following a legal proceeding (judicial state).Pay option adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which are included in the PCI residential mortgage portfolio, have interest rates that adjust monthly and minimum required payments that adjust annually, subject to resetting if minimum payments are made and deferred interest limits are reached. Annual payment adjustments are subject to a 7.5 percent maximum change. To ensure that contractual loan payments are adequate to repay a loan, the fully-amortizing loan payment amount is re-established after the initial five- or ten-year period and again every five years thereafter. These payment adjustments are not subject to the 7.5 percent limit and may be substantial due to changes in interest rates and the addition of unpaid interest to the loan balance. Payment advantage ARMs have interest rates that are fixed for an initial period of five years. Payments are subject to reset if the minimum payments are made and deferred interest limits are reached. If interest deferrals cause a loan's principal balance to reach a certain level within the first 10 years of the life of the loan, the payment is reset to the interest-only payment; then at the 10-year point, the fully-amortizing payment is required.The difference between the frequency of changes in a loan's interest rates and payments along with a limitation on changes in the minimum monthly payments of 7.5 percent per year can result in payments that are not sufficient to pay all of the monthly interest charges (i.e., negative amortization). Unpaid interest is added to the loan balance until the loan balance increases to a specified limit, which can be no more than 115 percent of the original loan amount, at which time a new monthly payment amount adequate to repay the loan over its remaining contractual life is established.At March 31, 2015, the unpaid principal balance of pay option loans, which include pay option ARMs and payment advantage ARMs, was $3.0 billion, with a carrying value of $2.9 billion, including $2.5 billion of loans that were credit-impaired upon acquisition and, accordingly, the reserve is based on a life-of-loan loss estimate. The total unpaid principal balance of pay option loans with accumulated negative amortization was $834 million, including $49 million of negative amortization. For those borrowers who are making payments in accordance with their contractual terms, one percent at both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 elected to make only the minimum payment on pay option loans. We believe the majority of borrowers are now making scheduled payments primarily because the low rate environment has caused the fully indexed rates to be affordable to more borrowers. We continue to evaluate our exposure to payment resets on the acquired negative-amortizing loans including the PCI pay option loan portfolio and have taken into consideration in the evaluation several assumptions including prepayment and default rates. Of the loans in the pay option portfolio at March 31, 2015 that have not already experienced a payment reset, two percent are expected to reset before 2016, 43 percent are expected to reset in 2016 and 18 percent are expected to reset thereafter. In addition, seven percent are expected to prepay and approximately 30 percent are expected to default prior to being reset, most of which were severely delinquent as of March 31, 2015. We no longer originate pay option loans. 78Table of ContentsPurchased Credit-impaired Home Equity Loan PortfolioThe PCI home equity portfolio represented 27 percent of the total PCI loan portfolio at March 31, 2015. Those loans with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 15 percent of the PCI home equity portfolio at March 31, 2015. Loans with a refreshed CLTV greater than 90 percent, after consideration of purchase accounting adjustments and the related valuation allowance, represented 65 percent of the PCI home equity portfolio and 70 percent based on the unpaid principal balance at March 31, 2015.

Outstandings in the U.S. credit card portfolio decreased $4.6 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2015 due to a seasonal decline in retail transaction volume. Net charge-offs decreased $97 million to $621 million during the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due to improvements in delinquencies and bankruptcies as a result of an improved economic environment and the impact of higher credit quality originations. U.S. credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $120 million while loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $71 million during the three months ended March 31, 2015 as a result of the factors mentioned above that contributed to lower net charge-offs.Table 39 presents certain key credit statistics for the U.S. credit card portfolio.Table 39   U.S. Credit Card – Key Credit Statistics(Dollars in millions)March 31 2015 December 31 2014Outstandings$87,288 $91,879Accruing past due 30 days or more1,581 1,701Accruing past due 90 days or more795 866     Three Months Ended March 31 2015 2014Net charge-offs$621 $718Net charge-off ratios (1)2.84% 3.25%(1)Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans.Unused lines of credit for U.S. credit card totaled $312.9 billion and $305.9 billion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The $7.0 billion increase was driven by a seasonal decrease in line utilization due to lower transaction volumes and closures of inactive accounts. 79Table of ContentsTable 40 presents certain state concentrations for the U.S. credit card portfolio.Table 40U.S. Credit Card State Concentrations Outstandings Accruing Past Due90 Days or More Net Charge-offs March 31 2015 December 31 2014 March 31 2015 December 31 2014 Three Months EndedMarch 31(Dollars in millions)    2015 2014California$13,096 $13,682 $118 $127 $94 $114Florida7,210 7,530 78 89 67 76Texas6,318 6,586 53 58 41 49New York5,381 5,655 58 59 42 46New Jersey3,745 3,943 36 40 27 31Other U.S.51,538 54,483 452 493 350 402Total U.S. credit card portfolio$87,288 $91,879 $795 $866 $621 $718Non-U.S. Credit CardOutstandings in the non-U.S. credit card portfolio, which are recorded in All Other, decreased $805 million during the three months ended March 31, 2015 due to weakening of the British Pound against the U.S. Dollar and a seasonal decline in retail transaction volume. For the three months ended March 31, 2015, net charge-offs decreased $32 million to $44 million compared to the same period in 2014 due to improvement in delinquencies as a result of higher credit quality originations and an improved economic environment, as well as increased recoveries from the sale of previously charged-off loans.Unused lines of credit for non-U.S. credit card totaled $27.0 billion and $28.2 billion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The $1.2 billion decrease was driven by weakening of the British Pound against the U.S. Dollar.Table 41 presents certain key credit statistics for the non-U.S. credit card portfolio.Table 41   Non-U.S. Credit Card – Key Credit Statistics(Dollars in millions)March 31 2015 December 31 2014Outstandings$9,660 $10,465Accruing past due 30 days or more168 183Accruing past due 90 days or more88 95     Three Months Ended March 31 2015 2014Net charge-offs$44 $76Net charge-off ratios (1)1.80% 2.66%(1)Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans. 80Table of ContentsDirect/Indirect ConsumerAt March 31, 2015, approximately 50 percent of the direct/indirect portfolio was included in GWIM (principally securities-based lending loans), 49 percent was included in Consumer Banking (consumer auto and specialty lending (formerly referred to as dealer financial services) – automotive, marine, aircraft, recreational vehicle loans, and consumer personal loans) and the remainder was primarily student loans in All Other.Outstandings in the direct/indirect portfolio increased $1.8 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2015 as a bulk auto loan purchase and growth in the securities-based lending portfolio were partially offset by lower outstandings in the unsecured consumer lending portfolio.For the three months ended March 31, 2015, net charge-offs decreased $24 million to $34 million, or 0.17 percent of total average direct/indirect loans, compared to $58 million, 0.29 percent for the same period in 2014. This decrease in net charge-offs was primarily driven by improvements in delinquencies and bankruptcies in the unsecured consumer lending portfolio as a result of an improved economic environment as well as reduced outstandings in this portfolio.Direct/indirect loans that were past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest declined $13 million to $51 million during the three months ended March 31, 2015 due to decreases in the unsecured consumer lending, and auto and specialty lending portfolios.Table 42 presents certain state concentrations for the direct/indirect consumer loan portfolio.Table 42Direct/Indirect State Concentrations Outstandings Accruing Past Due90 Days or More Net Charge-offs March 31 2015 December 31 2014 March 31 2015 December 31 2014 Three Months EndedMarch 31(Dollars in millions)    2015 2014California$10,058 $9,770 $4 $5 $3 $5Florida8,163 7,930 4 5 4 8Texas7,913 7,741 4 5 4 6New York4,585 4,458 2 2 1 4New Jersey2,649 2,625 1 2 1 2Other U.S./Non-U.S.48,773 47,857 36 45 21 33Total direct/indirect loan portfolio$82,141 $80,381 $51 $64 $34 $58Other ConsumerAt March 31, 2015, approximately 58 percent of the $1.8 billion other consumer portfolio were consumer auto leases included in Consumer Banking. The remainder is primarily associated with certain consumer finance businesses that we previously exited.Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value OptionOutstanding consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option totaled $2.1 billion at March 31, 2015 and were comprised of residential mortgage loans that were previously classified as held-for-sale, residential mortgage loans held in consolidated variable interest entities (VIEs) and repurchased home equity loans. The loans that were previously classified as held-for-sale were transferred to the residential mortgage portfolio in connection with the decision to retain the loans. The fair value option had been elected at the time of origination and the loans continue to be measured at fair value after the reclassification. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, we recorded net gains of $3 million resulting from changes in the fair value of these loans, including losses of $3 million on loans held in consolidated VIEs that were offset by gains recorded on related long-term debt. 81Table of ContentsNonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties ActivityTable 43 presents nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014. Nonperforming LHFS are excluded from nonperforming loans as they are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. Nonperforming loans do not include past due consumer credit card loans, other unsecured loans and in general, consumer non-real estate-secured loans (loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy are included) as these loans are typically charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. The charge-offs on these loans have no impact on nonperforming activity and, accordingly, are excluded from this table. The fully-insured loan portfolio is not reported as nonperforming as principal repayment is insured. Additionally, nonperforming loans do not include the PCI loan portfolio or loans accounted for under the fair value option. For more information on nonperforming loans, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K. During three months ended March 31, 2015, nonperforming consumer loans declined $610 million to $10.2 billion and included the impact of sales of $371 million, partially offset by a net increase of $85 million related to the impact of the consumer relief portion of the settlement with the DoJ for those loans that are no longer fully insured. Excluding these, nonperforming loans declined as outflows, including the transfer of certain qualifying borrowers discharged in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy to performing status outpaced new inflows.The outstanding balance of a real estate-secured loan that is in excess of the estimated property value less costs to sell is charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due unless repayment of the loan is fully insured. At March 31, 2015, $5.2 billion, or 48 percent of nonperforming consumer real estate loans and foreclosed properties had been written down to their estimated property value less costs to sell, including $4.5 billion of nonperforming loans 180 days or more past due and $632 million of foreclosed properties. In addition, at March 31, 2015, $3.8 billion, or 37 percent of nonperforming consumer loans were modified and are now current after successful trial periods, or are current loans classified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable policies.Foreclosed properties increased $2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2015 as additions outpaced liquidations. PCI loans are excluded from nonperforming loans as these loans were written down to fair value at the acquisition date; however, once the underlying real estate is acquired by the Corporation upon foreclosure of the delinquent PCI loan, it is included in foreclosed properties. PCI-related foreclosed properties increased $20 million during the three months ended March 31, 2015. Not included in foreclosed properties at March 31, 2015 was $1.2 billion of real estate that was acquired upon foreclosure of certain delinquent government-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans). We exclude these amounts from our nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties activity as we expect we will be reimbursed once the property is conveyed to the guarantor for principal and, up to certain limits, costs incurred during the foreclosure process and interest incurred during the holding period. For more information on the review of our foreclosure processes, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations – Servicing, Foreclosure and Other Mortgage Matters on page 44.Restructured LoansNonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. These concessions typically result from the Corporation's loss mitigation activities and could include reductions in the interest rate, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions. Certain TDRs are classified as nonperforming at the time of restructuring and may only be returned to performing status after considering the borrower's sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period, generally six months. Nonperforming TDRs, excluding those modified loans in the PCI loan portfolio, are included in Table 43. 82Table of ContentsTable 43Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity (1) Three Months EndedMarch 31(Dollars in millions)2015 2014Nonperforming loans and leases, January 1$10,819 $15,840Additions to nonperforming loans and leases:   New nonperforming loans and leases1,469 2,027Reductions to nonperforming loans and leases:   Paydowns and payoffs(253) (468)Sales(371) —Returns to performing status (2)(867) (800)Charge-offs(460) (583)Transfers to foreclosed properties (3)(128) (172)Total net additions (reductions) to nonperforming loans and leases(610) 4Total nonperforming loans and leases, March 31 (4)10,209 15,844Foreclosed properties, January 1630 533Additions to foreclosed properties:   New foreclosed properties (3)196 186Reductions to foreclosed properties:   Sales(168) (159)Write-downs(26) (22)Total net additions to foreclosed properties2 5Total foreclosed properties, March 31 (5)632 538Nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties, March 31$10,841 $16,382Nonperforming consumer loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans and leases (6)2.16% 3.06%Nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties (6)2.29 3.16(1)Balances do not include nonperforming LHFS of $10 million and $33 million and nonaccruing TDRs removed from the PCI loan portfolio prior to January 1, 2010 of $86 million and $257 million at March 31, 2015 and 2014 as well as loans accruing past due 90 days or more as presented in Table 29 and Note 4 – Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(2) Consumer loans may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection.(3) New foreclosed properties represents transfers of nonperforming loans to foreclosed properties net of charge-offs taken during the first 90 days after transfer of a loan to foreclosed properties. New foreclosed properties also includes properties obtained upon foreclosure of delinquent PCI loans, properties repurchased due to representations and warranties exposure and properties acquired with newly consolidated subsidiaries.(4) At March 31, 2015, 45 percent of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due.(5) Foreclosed property balances do not include properties insured by certain government-guaranteed loans, principally FHA-insured loans, that entered foreclosure of $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion at March 31, 2015 and 2014.(6) Outstanding consumer loans and leases exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option.Our policy is to record any losses in the value of foreclosed properties as a reduction in the allowance for loan and lease losses during the first 90 days after transfer of a loan to foreclosed properties. Thereafter, further losses in value as well as gains and losses on sale are recorded in noninterest expense. New foreclosed properties included in Table 43 are net of $32 million and $45 million of charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, recorded during the first 90 days after transfer.We classify junior-lien home equity loans as nonperforming when the first-lien loan becomes 90 days past due even if the junior-lien loan is performing. At March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, $657 million and $800 million of such junior-lien home equity loans were included in nonperforming loans and leases. This decline was driven by overall portfolio improvement as well as $45 million of charge-offs related to the consumer relief portion of the settlement with the DoJ. 83Table of ContentsTable 44 presents TDRs for the consumer real estate portfolio.

Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the customer's interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months, all of which are considered TDRs (the renegotiated TDR portfolio). In addition, the accounts of non-U.S. credit card customers who do not qualify for a fixed payment plan may have their interest rates reduced, as required by certain local jurisdictions. These modifications, which are also TDRs, tend to experience higher payment default rates given that the borrowers may lack the ability to repay even with the interest rate reduction. In all cases, the customer's available line of credit is canceled.Modifications of credit card and other consumer loans are primarily made through internal renegotiation programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external renegotiation programs. The renegotiated TDR portfolio is excluded in large part from Table 43 as substantially all of the loans remain on accrual status until either charged off or paid in full. At March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, our renegotiated TDR portfolio was $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, of which $818 million and $907 million were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. The decline in the renegotiated TDR portfolio was primarily driven by paydowns and charge-offs as well as lower program enrollments. For more information on the renegotiated TDR portfolio, see Note 4 – Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 84Table of ContentsCommercial Portfolio Credit Risk ManagementCommercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure do not result in undesirable levels of risk. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 49, 54 and 59 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio.For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and net charge-offs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Commercial Credit PortfolioAs compared to 2014, during the three months ended March 31, 2015 credit quality among large corporate borrowers continued to improve despite some headwinds related to credit spreads and flat equity markets. Commercial real estate borrowers also showed improved credit quality as property valuations continue to increase and vacancy rates remain low. There were decreases in the credit quality of certain borrowers impacted by the sustained drop in oil prices. Outstanding commercial loans and leases increased $10.7 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2015, primarily in U.S. commercial and non-U.S. commercial. Nonperforming loans and leases decreased $117 million during the three months ended March 31, 2015. As a percentage of outstanding loans and leases, nonperforming commercial loans and leases decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2015 to 0.25 percent from 0.28 percent (0.25 percent from 0.29 percent excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option) at December 31, 2014. Reservable criticized balances increased $733 million during the three months ended March 31, 2015 as a result of downgrades outpacing paydowns and upgrades. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio increased $60 million to $4.5 billion at March 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014 driven by loan growth and an increase in reservable criticized balances. For additional information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 98.Table 45 presents our commercial loans and leases portfolio, and related credit quality information at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.Table 45Commercial Loans and Leases Outstandings Nonperforming Accruing Past Due 90Days or More(Dollars in millions)March 31 2015 December 31 2014 March 31 2015 December 31 2014 March 31 2015 December 31 2014U.S. commercial$225,081 $220,293 $680 $701 $22 $110Commercial real estate (1)49,446 47,682 132 321 25 3Commercial lease financing24,468 24,866 16 3 9 41Non-U.S. commercial84,842 80,083 79 1 — — 383,837 372,924 907 1,026 56 154U.S. small business commercial (2)13,226 13,293 89 87 65 67Commercial loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option397,063 386,217 996 1,113 121 221Loans accounted for under the fair value option (3)6,411 6,604 — — — —Total commercial loans and leases$403,474 $392,821 $996 $1,113 $121 $221(1) Includes U.S. commercial real estate loans of $46.7 billion and $45.2 billion and non-U.S. commercial real estate loans of $2.8 billion and $2.5 billion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.(2) Includes card-related products.(3) Commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option include U.S. commercial loans of $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion and non-U.S. commercial loans of $4.5 billion and $4.7 billion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. For more information on the fair value option, see Note 15 – Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 85Table of ContentsTable 46 presents net charge-offs and related ratios for our commercial loans and leases for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014. The increase in net charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily related to a net recovery in commercial real estate in the prior-year period.Table 46    Commercial Net Charge-offs and Related Ratios     Three Months Ended March 31 Net Charge-offs Net Charge-off Ratios (1)(Dollars in millions)2015 2014 2015 2014U.S. commercial$7 $5 0.01 % 0.01 %Commercial real estate5 (37) 0.04 (0.31)Commercial lease financing5 (2) 0.09 (0.04)Non-U.S. commercial(2) 19 (0.01) 0.09 15 (15) 0.02 (0.02)U.S. small business commercial62 64 1.90 1.95Total commercial$77 $49 0.08 0.05(1) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option.Table 47 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, bankers' acceptances and commercial letters of credit for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions, during a specified time period. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes. Total commercial utilized credit exposure increased $15.9 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2015 primarily driven by loans and leases, and derivative assets, partially offset by decreases in LHFS, and debt securities and other investments. The utilization rate for loans and leases, SBLCs and financial guarantees, commercial letters of credit and bankers' acceptances, in the aggregate, was 57 percent at both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.Table 47Commercial Credit Exposure by Type Commercial Utilized (1) Commercial Unfunded (2, 3) Total Commercial Committed(Dollars in millions)March 31 2015 December 31 2014 March 31 2015 December 31 2014 March 31 2015 December 31 2014Loans and leases$403,474 $392,821 $323,946 $317,258 $727,420 $710,079Derivative assets (4)61,331 52,682 — — 61,331 52,682Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees32,649 33,550 660 745 33,309 34,295Debt securities and other investments16,388 17,301 5,972 5,315 22,360 22,616Loans held-for-sale5,491 7,036 1,816 2,315 7,307 9,351Commercial letters of credit1,872 2,037 142 126 2,014 2,163Bankers' acceptances199 255 — — 199 255Foreclosed properties and other1,125 960 — — 1,125 960Total$522,529 $506,642 $332,536 $325,759 $855,065 $832,401(1) Total commercial utilized exposure includes loans of $6.4 billion and $6.6 billion and issued letters of credit accounted for under the fair value option with a notional amount of $469 million and $535 million at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.(2) Total commercial unfunded exposure includes loan commitments accounted for under the fair value option with a notional amount of $8.4 billion and $9.4 billion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.(3) Excludes unused business card lines which are not legally binding.(4) Derivative assets are carried at fair value, reflect the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and have been reduced by cash collateral of $52.7 billion and $47.3 billion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.

Criticized exposure corresponds to the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful asset categories as defined by regulatory authorities. Total commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure increased $733 million, or six percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2015 driven by downgrades outpacing paydowns and upgrades. Approximately 87 percent of commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure was secured at both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.Table 48Commercial Utilized Reservable Criticized Exposure March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014(Dollars in millions)Amount (1) Percent (2) Amount (1) Percent (2)U.S. commercial$8,422 3.34% $7,597 3.07%Commercial real estate854 1.67 1,108 2.24Commercial lease financing1,067 4.36 1,034 4.16Non-U.S. commercial1,085 1.20 887 1.03 11,428 2.73 10,626 2.60U.S. small business commercial875 6.62 944 7.10Total commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure$12,303 2.85 $11,570 2.74(1) Total commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure includes loans and leases of $10.9 billion and $10.2 billion and commercial letters of credit of $1.3 billion and $1.3 billion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.(2) Percentages are calculated as commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure divided by total commercial utilized reservable exposure for each exposure category.U.S. CommercialAt March 31, 2015, 70 percent of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small business, was managed in Global Banking, 16 percent in Global Markets, 10 percent in GWIM (generally business-purpose loans for high net worth clients) and the remainder primarily in Consumer Banking. U.S. commercial loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, increased $4.8 billion, or two percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2015 due to growth across all of the commercial businesses. Nonperforming loans and leases decreased $21 million, or three percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2015. Net charge-offs increased $2 million to $7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.Commercial Real EstateCommercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans and leases secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 21 percent and 22 percent of the commercial real estate loans and leases portfolio at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms. Outstanding loans increased $1.8 billion, or four percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2015 due to new originations primarily in major metropolitan markets.For the three months ended March 31, 2015, we continued to see improvements in credit quality in both the residential and non-residential portfolios. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio including transfers of deteriorating exposures to management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation.Nonperforming commercial real estate loans and foreclosed properties increased $8 million, or two percent, and reservable criticized balances decreased $254 million, or 23 percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2015. Net charge-offs were $5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to a net recovery of $37 million for the same period in 2014. 87Table of ContentsTable 49 presents outstanding commercial real estate loans by geographic region, based on the geographic location of the collateral, and by property type.Table 49Outstanding Commercial Real Estate Loans(Dollars in millions)March 31 2015 December 31 2014By Geographic Region   California$10,213 $10,352Northeast9,249 8,781Southwest6,888 6,570Southeast5,849 5,495Midwest2,748 2,867Florida2,718 2,520Illinois2,371 2,785Northwest2,256 2,151Midsouth1,750 1,724Non-U.S. 2,795 2,494Other (1)2,609 1,943Total outstanding commercial real estate loans$49,446 $47,682By Property Type   Non-residential   Office$13,637 $13,306Multi-family rental8,349 8,382Shopping centers/retail8,160 7,969Industrial/warehouse5,262 4,550Hotels/motels3,855 3,578Multi-use1,678 1,943Land and land development528 490Other6,163 5,754Total non-residential47,632 45,972Residential1,814 1,710Total outstanding commercial real estate loans$49,446 $47,682(1) Includes unsecured loans to real estate investment trusts and national home builders whose portfolios of properties span multiple geographic regions and properties in the states of Colorado, Utah, Hawaii, Wyoming and Montana. 88Table of ContentsTables 50 and 51 present commercial real estate credit quality data by non-residential and residential property types.

Non-residential nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties increased $10 million, or three percent, to $376 million at March 31, 2015 compared to $366 million at December 31, 2014, which represented 0.79 percent of total non-residential loans and foreclosed properties for both periods. The increase in nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties in the non-residential portfolio was primarily in the industrial/warehouse and hotel/motels property types, largely offset by the office property type. Non-residential utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased $251 million, or 23 percent, to $829 million at March 31, 2015 compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2014, which represented 1.69 percent and 2.27 percent of non-residential utilized reservable exposure. For the non-residential portfolio, net charge-offs were $5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to a net recovery of $37 million for the same period in 2014.At March 31, 2015, total committed residential exposure was $3.7 billion compared to $3.6 billion at December 31, 2014, of which $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion were funded secured loans at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Residential nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties decreased $2 million, or nine percent, and residential utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased $3 million, or 11 percent during the three months ended March 31, 2015. The nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties and the utilized reservable criticized ratios for the residential portfolio were 1.08 percent and 1.31 percent at March 31, 2015 compared to 1.28 percent and 1.51 percent at December 31, 2014. At March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the commercial real estate loan portfolio included $7.0 billion and $6.7 billion of funded construction and land development loans that were originated to fund the construction and/or rehabilitation of commercial properties. Reservable criticized construction and land development loans totaled $102 million and $164 million, and nonperforming construction and land development loans and foreclosed properties totaled $55 million and $80 million at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. During a property's construction phase, interest income is typically paid from interest reserves that are established at the inception of the loan. As construction is completed and the property is put into service, these interest reserves are depleted and interest payments from operating cash flows begin. We do not recognize interest income on nonperforming loans regardless of the existence of an interest reserve.Non-U.S. CommercialAt March 31, 2015, 76 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking and 24 percent in Global Markets. Outstanding loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, increased $4.8 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2015 primarily due to growth in securitization finance on consumer loans and increased corporate demand. We had a net recovery of $2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to net charge-offs of $19 million for the same period in 2014. For additional information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 96.U.S. Small Business CommercialThe U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of small business card loans and small business loans managed in Consumer Banking. Credit card-related products were 44 percent and 43 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Net charge-offs decreased $2 million to $62 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. Of the U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs, 77 percent were credit card-related products for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to 80 percent for the same period in 2014.Commercial Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value OptionThe portfolio of commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option is held primarily in Global Markets and Global Banking. Outstanding commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option decreased $193 million to an aggregate fair value of $6.4 billion at March 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014 primarily due to decreased corporate borrowings under bank credit facilities. We recorded net losses of $97 million during the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to net gains of $17 million for the same period in 2014 from changes in the fair value of this loan portfolio. These amounts were primarily attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were recorded in other income and do not reflect the results of hedging activities.In addition, unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit accounted for under the fair value option had an aggregate fair value of $329 million and $405 million at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, which was recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The associated aggregate notional amount of unfunded lending commitments and letters of credit accounted for under the fair value option was $8.9 billion and $9.9 billion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. We recorded net gains of $118 million during the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $9 million for the same period in 2014 from changes in the fair value of commitments and letters of credit. These amounts were primarily attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, were recorded in other income and do not reflect the results of hedging activities. 90Table of ContentsNonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties ActivityTable 52 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014. Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, nonperforming commercial loans and leases decreased $117 million to $996 million driven by transfers to foreclosed properties, paydowns and charge-offs outpacing new nonperforming loans. Transfers to foreclosed properties of $205 million were largely related to one client relationship. Approximately 96 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were secured and approximately 52 percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans were carried at approximately 79 percent of their unpaid principal balance before consideration of the allowance for loan and lease losses as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated property value less costs to sell.Table 52   Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity (1, 2) Three Months Ended March 31(Dollars in millions)2015 2014Nonperforming loans and leases, January 1$1,113 $1,309Additions to nonperforming loans and leases:   New nonperforming loans and leases287 262Advances2 8Reductions to nonperforming loans and leases:   Paydowns(110) (171)Sales(16) (27)Returns to performing status (3)(24) (63)Charge-offs (51) (50)Transfers to foreclosed properties (4)(205) (3)Total net reductions to nonperforming loans and leases(117) (44)Total nonperforming loans and leases, March 31996 1,265Foreclosed properties, January 167 90Additions to foreclosed properties:   New foreclosed properties (4)200 2Reductions to foreclosed properties:   Sales(2) (5)Write-downs(1) (2)Total net additions (reductions) to foreclosed properties197 (5)Total foreclosed properties, March 31264 85Nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties, March 31$1,260 $1,350Nonperforming commercial loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans and leases (5)0.25% 0.33%Nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties (5)0.32 0.35(1) Balances do not include nonperforming LHFS of $334 million and $259 million at March 31, 2015 and 2014.(2) Includes U.S. small business commercial activity.

Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial committed credit exposure increased $22.7 billion, or three percent, during the three months to March 31, 2015 to $855.1 billion. Increases in commercial committed exposure were concentrated in diversified financials, banking, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, and real estate, partially offset by lower exposure to healthcare equipment and services, and energy. Industry limits are used internally to manage industry concentrations and are based on committed exposures and capital usage that are allocated on an industry-by-industry basis. A risk management framework is in place to set and approve industry limits as well as to provide ongoing monitoring. The Management Risk Committee (MRC) oversees industry limit governance.Diversified financials, our largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $111.3 billion, increased $7.8 billion, or eight percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2015. The increase was driven by growth in loan and loan equivalent exposure to asset managers and capital markets.Real estate, our second largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $78.4 billion, increased $2.2 billion, or three percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to new originations and renewals outpacing paydowns and sales. Real estate construction and land development exposure represented 13 percent of the total real estate industry committed exposure at both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. For more information on the commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Commercial Real Estate on page 87.The following changes in our industry concentrations occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2015. Committed exposure to healthcare equipment and services industry decreased $3.4 billion, or seven percent, primarily driven by repayment of bridge financing for acquisitions. Banking committed exposure increased $3.4 billion, or seven percent, primarily reflecting growth in mortgage banking exposure driven by increases in residential and commercial mortgage origination volume. Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology committed exposure increased $3.3 billion, or 25 percent, primarily reflecting a bridge commitment for an acquisition. Energy committed exposure decreased $2.3 billion, or five percent, primarily due to repayment of bridge financing.Our committed state and municipal exposure of $39.4 billion at March 31, 2015 consisted of $32.3 billion of commercial utilized exposure (including $19.1 billion of funded loans, $6.4 billion of SBLCs and $2.6 billion of derivative assets) and $7.1 billion of unfunded commercial exposure (primarily unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit) and is reported in the government and public education industry in Table 54. With the U.S. economy gradually strengthening, most state and local governments are experiencing improved fiscal circumstances and continue to honor debt obligations as agreed. While historical default rates have been low, as part of our overall and ongoing risk management processes, we continually monitor these exposures through a rigorous review process. Additionally, internal communications are regularly circulated such that exposure levels are maintained in compliance with established concentration guidelines. 92Table of ContentsTable 54Commercial Credit Exposure by Industry (1) CommercialUtilized Total CommercialCommitted(Dollars in millions)March 31 2015 December 31 2014 March 31 2015 December 31 2014Diversified financials$65,579 $63,306 $111,306 $103,528Real estate (2)57,930 53,834 78,357 76,153Retailing34,612 33,683 58,701 58,043Capital goods29,254 29,028 54,171 54,653Banking46,539 42,330 51,732 48,353Government and public education42,894 42,095 51,066 49,937Healthcare equipment and services31,636 32,923 49,022 52,450Materials24,586 23,664 46,503 45,821Energy22,174 23,830 45,416 47,667Food, beverage and tobacco17,100 16,131 35,083 34,465Consumer services21,987 21,657 34,094 33,269Commercial services and supplies18,473 17,997 30,623 30,451Utilities10,559 9,399 25,679 25,235Transportation18,050 17,538 25,655 24,541Media11,615 11,128 21,596 21,502Individuals and trusts16,723 16,749 21,568 21,195Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology5,956 5,707 16,800 13,493Software and services5,542 5,927 15,052 14,071Technology hardware and equipment5,158 5,489 14,125 12,350Consumer durables and apparel6,457 6,111 10,827 10,613Automobiles and components5,203 4,114 10,479 9,683Telecommunication services3,991 3,814 10,407 9,295Insurance, including monolines4,758 5,204 10,402 11,252Food and staples retailing3,812 3,848 7,482 7,418Religious and social organizations4,692 4,881 6,215 6,548Other 7,249 6,255 12,704 10,415Total commercial credit exposure by industry$522,529 $506,642 $855,065 $832,401Net credit default protection purchased on total commitments (3)    $(6,720) $(7,302)(1) Includes U.S. small business commercial exposure.(2) Industries are viewed from a variety of perspectives to best isolate the perceived risks.

For additional information, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Risk Mitigation on page 94. 93Table of ContentsRisk MitigationWe purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection.At March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $6.7 billion and $7.3 billion. We recorded net losses of $71 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to net losses of $29 million for the same period in 2014 on these positions. The gains and losses on these instruments were offset by gains and losses on the related exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) results for these exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio information in Table 62.

In addition to our net notional credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain credit exposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making activities for clients and establishing positions intended to profit from directional or relative value changes. We execute the majority of our credit derivative trades in the OTC market with large, multinational financial institutions, including broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of other investors. Because these transactions are executed in the OTC market, we are subject to settlement risk. We are also subject to credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to perform under the terms of these contracts. In most cases, credit derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit downgrade, depending on the ultimate rating level, or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required by the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades. 94Table of ContentsTable 57 presents the total contract/notional amount of credit derivatives outstanding and includes both purchased and written credit derivatives. The credit risk amounts are measured as net asset exposure by counterparty, taking into consideration all contracts with the counterparty. For more information on our written credit derivatives, see Note 2 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The credit risk amounts discussed above and presented in Table 57 take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements while amounts disclosed in Note 2 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements are shown on a gross basis. Credit risk reflects the potential benefit from offsetting exposure to non-credit derivative products with the same counterparties that may be netted upon the occurrence of certain events, thereby reducing our overall exposure.Table 57Credit Derivatives March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014(Dollars in millions)Contract/Notional Credit Risk Contract/Notional Credit RiskPurchased credit derivatives:       Credit default swaps$1,054,657 $3,925 $1,094,796 $3,833Total return swaps/other43,763 138 44,333 510Total purchased credit derivatives$1,098,420 $4,063 $1,139,129 $4,343Written credit derivatives:       Credit default swaps$1,032,418 n/a $1,073,101 n/aTotal return swaps/other61,834 n/a 61,031 n/aTotal written credit derivatives$1,094,252 n/a $1,134,132 n/an/a = not applicableCounterparty Credit Risk Valuation AdjustmentsWe record counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments on certain derivative assets, including our credit default protection purchased, in order to properly reflect the credit risk of the counterparty, as presented in Table 58. We calculate CVA based on a modeled expected exposure that incorporates current market risk factors including changes in market spreads and non-credit related market factors that affect the value of a derivative. The exposure also takes into consideration credit mitigants such as legally enforceable master netting agreements and collateral. For additional information, see Note 2 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Table 58           Credit Valuation Gains and LossesGains (Losses)Three Months Ended March 31 2015 2014(Dollars in millions)Gross Hedge Net Gross Hedge NetCredit valuation$8 $116 $124 $52 $(12) $40 95Table of ContentsNon-U.S. PortfolioOur non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. Management oversight of country risk, including cross-border risk, is the responsibility of a subcommittee of the MRC. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance, rather than through country risk governance.Table 59 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at March 31, 2015. These exposures accounted for 87 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at March 31, 2015 and 88 percent at December 31, 2014. Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $1.5 billion from December 31, 2014 driven by higher derivatives exposure in the United Kingdom, Brazil and Germany, and reductions in hedges in the United Kingdom, France, Spain and Japan. These increases were partially offset by reductions in funded and unfunded loans and loan equivalents exposure in Germany, Japan, France, China and Russia, and decreases in securities exposure in the United Kingdom, Italy and Taiwan.Non-U.S. exposure is presented on an internal risk management basis and includes sovereign and non-sovereign credit exposure, securities and other investments issued by or domiciled in countries other than the U.S. The risk assignments by country can be adjusted for external guarantees and certain collateral types. Exposures that are subject to external guarantees are reported under the country of the guarantor. Exposures with tangible collateral are reflected in the country where the collateral is held. For securities received, other than cross-border resale agreements, outstandings are assigned to the domicile of the issuer of the securities.Funded loans and loan equivalents include loans, leases, and other extensions of credit and funds, including letters of credit and due from placements, which have not been reduced by collateral, hedges or credit default protection. Funded loans and loan equivalents are reported net of charge-offs but prior to any allowance for loan and lease losses. Unfunded commitments are the undrawn portion of legally binding commitments related to loans and loan equivalents.Net counterparty exposure includes the fair value of derivatives, including the counterparty risk associated with credit default swaps (CDS), and secured financing transactions. Derivatives exposures are presented net of collateral, which is predominantly cash, pledged under legally enforceable master netting agreements. Secured financing transaction exposures are presented net of eligible cash or securities pledged as collateral.Securities and other investments are carried at fair value and long securities exposures are netted against short exposures with the same underlying issuer to, but not below, zero (i.e., negative issuer exposures are reported as zero). Other investments include our GPI portfolio and strategic investments. 96Table of ContentsNet country exposure represents country exposure less hedges and credit default protection purchased, net of credit default protection sold. We hedge certain of our country exposures with credit default protection primarily in the form of single-name, as well as indexed and tranched CDS. The exposures associated with these hedges represent the amount that would be realized upon the isolated default of an individual issuer in the relevant country assuming a zero recovery rate for that individual issuer, and are calculated based on the CDS notional amount adjusted for any fair value receivable or payable. Changes in the assumption of an isolated default can produce different results in a particular tranche.Table 59Top 20 Non-U.S. Countries Exposure(Dollars in millions)Funded Loans and Loan Equivalents Unfunded Loan Commitments Net Counterparty Exposure Securities/OtherInvestments Country Exposure at March 31 2015 Hedges and Credit Default Protection Net Country Exposure at March 31 2015 Increase (Decrease) from December 31 2014United Kingdom$24,140 $10,921 $8,414 $6,134 $49,609 $(3,285) $46,324 $777Canada6,139 6,922 2,007 4,307 19,375 (1,798) 17,577 (963)Brazil10,400 777 1,198 4,437 16,812 (330) 16,482 1,498Japan11,068 482 4,127 1,546 17,223 (929) 16,294 (440)Germany4,902 4,788 4,159 4,996 18,845 (3,435) 15,410 2,851India6,496 369 247 4,622 11,734 (292) 11,442 856China9,698 600 795 1,242 12,335 (912) 11,423 (869)France2,590 4,956 1,370 4,625 13,541 (3,501) 10,040 (398)Netherlands3,076 3,808 1,320 1,556 9,760 (1,145) 8,615 480Hong Kong6,037 380 1,009 719 8,145 (13) 8,132 (476)South Korea3,607 1,081 956 2,596 8,240 (670) 7,570 1,121Australia3,415 1,598 809 2,070 7,892 (675) 7,217 (456)Switzerland2,933 3,402 1,084 707 8,126 (999) 7,127 596Italy3,151 930 2,430 501 7,012 (2,672) 4,340 (1,059)Singapore2,207 215 780 959 4,161 (55) 4,106 102Spain2,202 827 222 1,280 4,531 (546) 3,985 369Mexico3,032 256 198 644 4,130 (336) 3,794 (477)Russia3,648 83 353 100 4,184 (1,360) 2,824 (785)Turkey2,602 130 24 54 2,810 (141) 2,669 181Taiwan2,078 20 245 112 2,455 (2) 2,453 (1,412)Total top 20 non-U.S. countries exposure$113,421 $42,545 $31,747 $43,207 $230,920 $(23,096) $207,824 $1,496Russian intervention in Ukraine during 2014 significantly increased regional geopolitical tensions. The Russian economy continues to slow due to the negative impacts of weak oil prices, ongoing economic sanctions and high interest rates resulting from Russian central bank actions taken to counter ruble depreciation. Net exposure to Russia was reduced to $2.8 billion at March 31, 2015, concentrated in oil and gas companies and commercial banks. Our exposure to Ukraine was minimal. In response to Russian actions, U.S. and European governments have imposed sanctions on a limited number of Russian individuals and business entities. Geopolitical and economic conditions remain fluid with potential for further escalation of tensions, increased severity of sanctions against Russian interests, sustained low oil prices and rating agency downgrades.Certain European countries, including Italy, Spain, Ireland, Greece and Portugal, have experienced varying degrees of financial stress in recent years. While market conditions have improved in Europe, policymakers continue to address fundamental challenges of competitiveness, growth, deflation and high unemployment. A return of political stress or financial instability in these countries could disrupt financial markets and have a detrimental impact on global economic conditions and sovereign and non-sovereign debt in these countries. Net exposure at March 31, 2015 to Italy and Spain was $4.3 billion and $4.0 billion as presented in Table 59. Net exposure at March 31, 2015 for Ireland, Greece and Portugal was $1.7 billion, $386 million and $168 million, respectively. We expect to continue to support client activities in the region and our exposures may vary over time as we monitor the situation and manage our risk profile. 97Table of ContentsProvision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses decreased $244 million to $765 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The provision for credit losses was $429 million lower than net charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2015, resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses. This compared to a reduction of $379 million in the allowance for credit losses for the three months ended March 31, 2014. We expect reserve releases to be lower than the first quarter for the remaining quarters of 2015.The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio decreased $31 million to $619 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to improvement in the credit card portfolios primarily driven by lower unemployment levels as well as a provision benefit of $50 million related to the PCI loan portfolio for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to no provision for the same period in 2014. These were partially offset by a slower pace of credit quality improvement in the consumer real estate portfolio.The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, decreased $213 million to $146 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, primarily in the U.S. commercial portfolio.Allowance for Credit Losses Allowance for Loan and Lease LossesThe allowance for loan and lease losses is comprised of two components. The first component covers nonperforming commercial loans and TDRs. The second component covers loans and leases on which there are incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable, as well as incurred losses that may not be represented in the loss forecast models. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the total of these two components, each of which is described in more detail below. The allowance for loan and lease losses excludes LHFS and loans accounted for under the fair value option as the fair value reflects a credit risk component.The first component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers both nonperforming commercial loans and all TDRs within the consumer and commercial portfolios. These loans are subject to impairment measurement based on the present value of projected future cash flows discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate, or in certain circumstances, impairment may also be based upon the collateral value or the loan's observable market price if available. Impairment measurement for the renegotiated consumer credit card, small business credit card and unsecured consumer TDR portfolios is based on the present value of projected cash flows discounted using the average portfolio contractual interest rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring. For purposes of computing this specific loss component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool using historical experience for the respective product types and risk ratings of the loans.The second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers the remaining consumer and commercial loans and leases that have incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable. The allowance for consumer and certain homogeneous commercial loan and lease products is based on aggregated portfolio evaluations, generally by product type. Loss forecast models are utilized that consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, estimated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends, delinquencies, economic trends and credit scores. Our consumer real estate loss forecast model estimates the portion of loans that will default based on individual loan attributes, the most significant of which are refreshed LTV or CLTV, and borrower credit score as well as vintage and geography, all of which are further broken down into current delinquency status. Additionally, we incorporate the delinquency status of underlying first-lien loans on our junior-lien home equity portfolio in our allowance process. Incorporating refreshed LTV and CLTV into our probability of default allows us to factor the impact of changes in home prices into our allowance for loan and lease losses. These loss forecast models are updated on a quarterly basis to incorporate information reflecting the current economic environment. As of March 31, 2015, the loss forecast process resulted in reductions in the allowance for all major consumer portfolios compared to December 31, 2014.The allowance for commercial loan and lease losses is established by product type after analyzing historical loss experience, internal risk rating, current economic conditions, industry performance trends, geographic and obligor concentrations within each portfolio and any other pertinent information. The statistical models for commercial loans are generally updated annually and utilize our historical database of actual defaults and other data. The loan risk ratings and composition of the commercial portfolios used to calculate the allowance are updated quarterly to incorporate the most recent data reflecting the current economic environment. For risk-rated commercial loans, we estimate the probability of default and the LGD based on our historical experience of defaults and credit losses. Factors considered when assessing the internal risk rating include the value of the underlying collateral, if applicable, the industry in which the obligor operates, the obligor's liquidity and other financial indicators, and other quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the obligor's credit  98Table of Contentsrisk. As of March 31, 2015, the allowance increased for the U.S. commercial, commercial real estate and non-U.S. commercial portfolios compared to December 31, 2014.Also included within the second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses are reserves to cover losses that are incurred but, in our assessment, may not be adequately represented in the historical loss data used in the loss forecast models. For example, factors that we consider include, among others, changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in economic and business conditions, changes in the nature and size of the portfolio, changes in portfolio concentrations, changes in the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements. We also consider factors that are applicable to unique portfolio segments. For example, we consider the risk of uncertainty in our loss forecasting models related to junior-lien home equity loans that are current, but have first-lien loans that we do not service that are 30 days or more past due. In addition, we consider the increased risk of default associated with our interest-only loans that have yet to enter the amortization period. Further, we consider the inherent uncertainty in mathematical models that are built upon historical data.During the three months ended March 31, 2015, the factors that impacted the allowance for loan and lease losses included overall improvements in the credit quality of the portfolios driven by continuing improvements in the U.S. economy and labor markets, continuing proactive credit risk management initiatives and the impact of recent higher credit quality originations. Additionally, the resolution of uncertainties through current recognition of net charge-offs has impacted the amount of reserve needed in certain portfolios. Evidencing the improvements in the U.S. economy and labor markets are modest growth in consumer spending, improvements in unemployment levels and a decrease in the absolute level and our share of national consumer bankruptcy filings. In addition to these improvements, returns to performing status, charge-offs, sales, paydowns and transfers to foreclosed properties continued to outpace new nonaccrual loans.We monitor differences between estimated and actual incurred loan and lease losses. This monitoring process includes periodic assessments by senior management of loan and lease portfolios and the models used to estimate incurred losses in those portfolios.Additions to, or reductions of, the allowance for loan and lease losses generally are recorded through charges or credits to the provision for credit losses. Credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses. Recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses.The allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumer portfolio, as presented in Table 61, was $9.2 billion at March 31, 2015, a decrease of $803 million from December 31, 2014. The decrease was primarily in the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios due to improved residential mortgage delinquencies, a decrease in consumer loan balances, as well as the utilization of reserves built as a part of the settlement with the DoJ. Further, the residential mortgage and home equity allowance declined due to write-offs in our PCI loan portfolio. These write-offs decreased the PCI valuation allowance included as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses.The decrease in the allowance related to the U.S. credit card and unsecured consumer lending portfolios in Consumer Banking was primarily due to improvement in delinquencies and more generally in unemployment levels. For example, in the U.S. credit card portfolio, accruing loans 30 days or more past due decreased to $1.6 billion at March 31, 2015 from $1.7 billion (to 1.81 percent from 1.85 percent of outstanding U.S. credit card loans) at December 31, 2014, and accruing loans 90 days or more past due decreased to $795 million at March 31, 2015 from $866 million (to 0.91 percent from 0.94 percent of outstanding U.S. credit card loans) at December 31, 2014. See Tables 29, 30, 39 and 41 for additional details on key credit statistics for the credit card and other unsecured consumer lending portfolios.The allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio, as presented in Table 61, was $4.5 billion at March 31, 2015, an increase of $60 million from December 31, 2014. The commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure increased to $12.3 billion at March 31, 2015 from $11.6 billion (to 2.85 percent from 2.74 percent of total commercial utilized reservable exposure) at December 31, 2014. Nonperforming commercial loans decreased to $996 million at March 31, 2015 from $1.1 billion (to 0.25 percent from 0.29 percent of outstanding commercial loans) at December 31, 2014. Commercial loans and leases outstanding increased to $403.5 billion at March 31, 2015 from $392.8 billion at December 31, 2014. See Tables 45, 46 and 48 for additional details on key commercial credit statistics.The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 1.57 percent at March 31, 2015 compared to 1.65 percent at December 31, 2014. The decrease in the ratio was primarily due to improved credit quality driven by improved economic conditions, write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio and utilization of reserves related to the settlement with the DoJ. The March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 ratios above include the PCI loan portfolio. Excluding the PCI loan portfolio, the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 1.45 percent at March 31, 2015 compared to 1.50 percent at December 31, 2014. 99Table of ContentsTable 60 presents a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014.Table 60   Allowance for Credit Losses    Three Months Ended March 31(Dollars in millions)2015 2014Allowance for loan and lease losses, January 1$14,419 $17,428Loans and leases charged off   Residential mortgage(300) (202)Home equity(252) (394)U.S. credit card(729) (826)Non-U.S. credit card(70) (98)Direct/Indirect consumer(106) (135)Other consumer(59) (69)Total consumer charge-offs(1,516) (1,724)U.S. commercial (1)(109) (116)Commercial real estate(13) (7)Commercial lease financing(7) (1)Non-U.S. commercial— (20)Total commercial charge-offs(129) (144)Total loans and leases charged off(1,645) (1,868)Recoveries of loans and leases previously charged off   Residential mortgage103 75Home equity80 92U.S. credit card108 108Non-U.S. credit card26 22Direct/Indirect consumer72 77Other consumer10 11Total consumer recoveries399 385U.S. commercial (2)40 47Commercial real estate8 44Commercial lease financing2 3Non-U.S. commercial2 1Total commercial recoveries52 95Total recoveries of loans and leases previously charged off451 480Net charge-offs(1,194) (1,388)Write-offs of PCI loans(288) (391)Provision for loan and lease losses756 984Other (3)(17) (15)Allowance for loan and lease losses, March 3113,676 16,618Reserve for unfunded lending commitments, January 1528 484Provision for unfunded lending commitments9 25Reserve for unfunded lending commitments, March 31537 509Allowance for credit losses, March 31$14,213 $17,127(1) Includes U.S. small business commercial charge-offs of $78 million and $79 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014.(2) Includes U.S. small business commercial recoveries of $16 million and $15 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014.(3) Primarily represents the net impact of portfolio sales, consolidations and deconsolidations, and foreign currency translation adjustments. 100Table of ContentsTable 60   Allowance for Credit Losses (continued)    Three Months Ended March 31(Dollars in millions)2015 2014Loan and allowance ratios:   Loans and leases outstanding at March 31 (4)$869,490 $905,154Allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding at March 31 (4)1.57% 1.84%Consumer allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total consumer loans and leases outstanding at March 31 (5)1.94 2.38Commercial allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total commercial loans and leases outstanding at March 31 (6)1.13 1.11Average loans and leases outstanding (4)$863,536 $909,265Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases outstanding (4, 7)0.56% 0.62%Annualized net charge-offs and PCI write-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases outstanding (4)0.70 0.79Allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total nonperforming loans and leases at March 31 (4, 8)122 97Ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses at March 31 to annualized net charge-offs (7)2.82 2.95Ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses at March 31 to annualized net charge-offs and PCI write-offs2.28 2.30Amounts included in allowance for loan and lease losses for loans and leases that are excluded from nonperforming loans and leases at March 31 (9)$5,492 $7,143Allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total nonperforming loans and leases, excluding the allowance for loan and lease losses for loans and leases that are excluded from nonperforming loans and leases at March 31 (4, 9)73% 55%Loan and allowance ratios excluding PCI loans and the related valuation allowance: (10)   Allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding at March 31 (4)1.45% 1.65%Consumer allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total consumer loans and leases outstanding at March 31 (5)1.74 2.07Annualized net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans and leases outstanding (4)0.57 0.64Allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total nonperforming loans and leases at March 31 (4, 8)110 85Ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses at March 31 to annualized net charge-offs2.55 2.58(4) Outstanding loan and lease balances and ratios do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option of $8.5 billion and $11.1 billion at March 31, 2015 and 2014.

Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option included residential mortgage loans of $1.9 billion at both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 and home equity loans of $205 million and $196 million at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option included U.S. commercial loans of $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion and non-U.S. commercial loans of $4.5 billion and $4.7 billion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.(2) Includes allowance for loan and lease losses for U.S. small business commercial loans of $533 million and $536 million at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.(3) Includes allowance for loan and lease losses for impaired commercial loans of $155 million and $159 million at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.(4) Includes $1.3 billion and $1.7 billion of valuation allowance presented with the allowance for loan and lease losses related to PCI loans at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.Reserve for Unfunded Lending CommitmentsIn addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers' acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option. Unfunded lending commitments are subject to the same assessment as funded loans, including estimates of probability of default and LGD. Due to the nature of unfunded commitments, the estimate of probable losses must also consider utilization. To estimate the portion of these undrawn commitments that is likely to be drawn by a borrower at the time of estimated default, analyses of the Corporation's historical experience are applied to the unfunded commitments to estimate the funded EAD. The expected loss for unfunded lending commitments is the product of the probability of default, the LGD and the EAD, adjusted for any qualitative factors including economic uncertainty and inherent imprecision in models.The reserve for unfunded lending commitments was $537 million at March 31, 2015, an increase of $9 million from December 31, 2014. 102Table of ContentsMarket Risk ManagementMarket risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations, primarily within our Global Markets segment. We are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities). In the event of market stress, these risks could have a material impact on the results of the Corporation. For additional information, see Interest Rate Risk Management for Non-trading Activities on page 108.Our traditional banking loan and deposit products are non-trading positions and are generally reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities (historical cost). However, these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions, with one of the primary risks being changes in the levels of interest rates. The risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our non-trading positions arising from changes in interest rates is managed through our ALM activities. We have elected to account for certain assets and liabilities under the fair value option.Our trading positions are reported at fair value with changes reflected in income. Trading positions are subject to various changes in market-based risk factors. The majority of this risk is generated by our activities in the interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity and commodities markets. In addition, the values of assets and liabilities could change due to market liquidity, correlations across markets and expectations of market volatility. We seek to manage these risk exposures by using a variety of techniques that encompass a broad range of financial instruments. The key risk management techniques are discussed in more detail in the Trading Risk Management section.A subcommittee has been designated by the MRC as the primary risk governance authority for Global Markets (Global Markets, or GM subcommittee). The GM subcommittee's focus is to take a forward-looking view of the primary credit, market and operational risks impacting Global Markets and prioritize those that need a proactive risk mitigation strategy.Global Markets Risk Management is responsible for providing senior management with a clear and comprehensive understanding of the trading risks to which the Corporation is exposed. These responsibilities include ownership of market risk policy, developing and maintaining quantitative risk models, calculating aggregated risk measures, establishing and monitoring position limits consistent with risk appetite, conducting daily reviews and analysis of trading inventory, approving material risk exposures and fulfilling regulatory requirements. Market risks that impact businesses outside of Global Markets are monitored and governed by their respective governance functions.Quantitative risk models, such as VaR, are an essential component in evaluating the market risks within a portfolio. A subcommittee of the MRC is responsible for providing management oversight and approval of model risk management and governance (Risk Management, or RM subcommittee). The RM subcommittee defines model risk standards, consistent with the Corporation's risk framework and risk appetite, prevailing regulatory guidance and industry best practice. Models must meet certain validation criteria, including effective challenge of the model development process and a sufficient demonstration of developmental evidence incorporating a comparison of alternative theories and approaches. The RM subcommittee ensures model standards are consistent with model risk requirements and monitors the effective challenge in the model validation process across the Corporation. In addition, the relevant stakeholders must agree on any required actions or restrictions to the models and maintain a stringent monitoring process to ensure continued compliance.For more information on the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, see Note 14 – Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For more information on our market risk management process, see page 99 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Trading Risk ManagementTo evaluate risk in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. Various techniques and procedures are utilized to enable the most complete understanding of these risks. Quantitative measures of market risk are evaluated on a daily basis from a single position to the portfolio of the Corporation. These measures include sensitivities of positions to various market risk factors, such as the potential impact on revenue from a one basis point change in interest rates, and statistical measures utilizing both actual and hypothetical market moves, such as VaR and stress testing. Periods of extreme market stress influence the reliability of these techniques to varying degrees. Qualitative evaluations of market risk utilize the suite of quantitative risk measures while understanding each of their respective limitations. Additionally, risk managers independently evaluate the risk of the portfolios under the current market environment and potential future environments. 103Table of ContentsVaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk as it allows the aggregation of market risk factors, including the effects of portfolio diversification. A VaR model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss a portfolio is not expected to exceed more than a certain number of times per period, based on a specified holding period, confidence level and window of historical data. We use one VaR model consistently across the trading portfolios and it uses a historical simulation approach based on a three-year window of historical data. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level. This means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days.Within any VaR model, there are significant and numerous assumptions that will differ from company to company. The accuracy of a VaR model depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the risk factors in the portfolio. A VaR model may require additional modeling assumptions for new products that do not have the necessary historical market data or for less liquid positions for which accurate daily prices are not consistently available. For positions with insufficient historical data for the VaR calculation, the process for establishing an appropriate proxy is based on fundamental and statistical analysis of the new product or less liquid position. This analysis identifies reasonable alternatives that replicate both the expected volatility and correlation to other market risk factors that the missing data would be expected to experience.VaR may not be indicative of realized revenue volatility as changes in market conditions or in the composition of the portfolio can have a material impact on the results. In particular, the historical data used for the VaR calculation might indicate higher or lower levels of portfolio diversification than will be experienced. In order for the VaR model to reflect current market conditions, we update the historical data underlying our VaR model on a weekly basis, or more frequently during periods of market stress, and regularly review the assumptions underlying the model. A relatively minor portion of risks related to our trading positions are not included in VaR. These risks are reviewed as part of our ICAAP.Global Markets Risk Management continually reviews, evaluates and enhances our VaR model so that it reflects the material risks in our trading portfolio. Changes to the VaR model are reviewed and approved prior to implementation and any material changes are reported to management through the appropriate management committees.Trading limits on quantitative risk measures, including VaR, are monitored on a daily basis. These trading limits are independently set by Global Markets Risk Management and reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they remain relevant and within our overall risk appetite for market risks. Trading limits are reviewed in the context of market liquidity, volatility and strategic business priorities. Trading limits are set at both a granular level to ensure extensive coverage of risks as well as at aggregated portfolios to account for correlations among risk factors. All trading limits are approved at least annually and the MRC has given authority to the GM subcommittee to approve changes to trading limits throughout the year. Approved trading limits are stored and tracked in a centralized limits management system. Trading limit excesses are communicated to management for review. Certain quantitative market risk measures and corresponding limits have been identified as critical in the Corporation's Risk Appetite Statement. These risk appetite limits are monitored on a daily basis and are approved at least annually by the ERC and the Board. In periods of market stress, the GM subcommittee members communicate daily to discuss losses, key risk positions and any limit excesses. As a result of this process, the businesses may selectively reduce risk.Table 62 presents the total market-based trading portfolio VaR which is the combination of the covered positions trading portfolio and the impact from less liquid trading exposures. Covered positions are defined by regulatory standards as trading assets and liabilities, both on- and off-balance sheet, that meet a defined set of specifications. These specifications identify the most liquid trading positions which are intended to be held for a short-term horizon and where the Corporation is able to hedge the material risk elements in a two-way market. Positions in less liquid markets, or where there are restrictions on the ability to trade the positions, typically do not qualify as covered positions. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, except for structural foreign currency positions that we choose to exclude with prior regulatory approval. In addition, Table 62 presents our fair value option portfolio, which includes the funded and unfunded exposures for which we elect the fair value option and their corresponding hedges. The fair value option portfolio combined with the total market-based trading portfolio VaR represents the Corporation's total market-based portfolio VaR. Additionally, market risk VaR for trading activities as presented in Table 62 differs from VaR used for regulatory capital calculations due to the holding period used. The holding period for VaR used for regulatory capital calculations is 10 days, while for the market risk VaR presented below, it is one day. Both measures utilize the same process and methodology.The total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 62 include market risk from all business segments to which the Corporation is exposed. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment. 104Table of ContentsTable 62 presents period-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for the three months ended March 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2014 using a 99 percent confidence level.Table 62Market Risk VaR for Trading Activities Three Months Ended March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 March 31, 2014(Dollars in millions)Period EndAverageHigh (1)Low (1) Period EndAverageHigh (1)Low (1) Period EndAverageHigh (1)Low (1)Foreign exchange$10$10$17$6 $13$12$22$8 $20$18$24$13Interest rate32304222 24274921 43354919Credit44414637 43394332 45627145Equity1013229 16193211 15172411Commodity6685 8896 7796Portfolio diversification(40)(46)—— (56)(60)—— (84)(77)——Total covered positions trading portfolio62546640 48456434 46628645Impact from less liquid exposures98—— 76—— 39——Total market-based trading portfolio71627452 55516738 497110148Fair value option loans28313626 35314022 30323827Fair value option hedges14172211 2116238 12141711Fair value option portfolio diversification(27)(31)—— (37)(29)—— (21)(23)——Total fair value option portfolio15171915 19181915 21232821Portfolio diversification(8)(8)—— (7)(10)—— (11)(10)——Total market-based portfolio$78$71$85$60 $67$59$73$46 $59$84$120$56(1) The high and low for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the high and low for the components. Therefore the impact from less liquid exposures and the amount of portfolio diversification, which is the difference between the total portfolio and the sum of the individual components, are not relevant.The average total market-based trading portfolio VaR increased for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to a reduction in portfolio diversification largely driven by changes in the equity risk profile as well as increased credit risk in order to facilitate client transactions.The graph below presents the daily total market-based trading portfolio VaR for the previous five quarters, corresponding to the data in Table 62.Additional VaR statistics produced within the Corporation's single VaR model are provided in Table 63 at the same level of detail as in Table 62. Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution. Table 63 presents average trading VaR statistics for 99 percent and 95 percent confidence levels for the three months ended March 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2014. 105Table of ContentsTable 63Average Market Risk VaR for Trading Activities – 99 Percent and 95 Percent VaR Statistics Three Months Ended March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 March 31, 2014(Dollars in millions)99 percent95 percent 99 percent95 percent 99 percent95 percentForeign exchange$10$6 $12$7 $18$11Interest rate3020 2717 3521Credit4122 3920 6233Equity137 1910 179Commodity64 84 74Portfolio diversification(46)(31) (60)(36) (77)(46)Total covered positions trading portfolio5428 4522 6232Impact from less liquid exposures82 62 95Total market-based trading portfolio6230 5124 7137Fair value option loans3118 3117 3214Fair value option hedges1711 1611 149Fair value option portfolio diversification(31)(19) (29)(19) (23)(12)Total fair value option portfolio1710 189 2311Portfolio diversification(8)(7) (10)(7) (10)(7)Total market-based portfolio$71$33 $59$26 $84$41BacktestingThe accuracy of the VaR methodology is evaluated by backtesting, which compares the daily VaR results, utilizing a one-day holding period, against a comparable subset of trading revenue. A backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss exceeds the VaR for the corresponding day. These excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss and to ensure that the VaR methodology accurately represents those losses. As our primary VaR statistic used for backtesting is based on a 99 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, we expect one trading loss in excess of VaR every 100 days, or between two to three trading losses in excess of VaR over the course of a year. The number of backtesting excesses observed can differ from the statistically expected number of excesses if the current level of market volatility is materially different than the level of market volatility that existed during the three years of historical data used in the VaR calculation.We conduct daily backtesting on our portfolios, ranging from the total market-based portfolio to individual trading areas. Additionally, we conduct daily backtesting on the VaR results used for regulatory capital calculations as well as the VaR results for key legal entities, regions and risk factors. These results are reported to senior market risk management. Senior management regularly reviews and evaluates the results of these tests.The trading revenue used for backtesting is defined by regulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the VaR component of the regulatory capital calculation. This revenue differs from total trading-related revenue in that it excludes revenue from trading activities that either do not generate market risk or the market risk cannot be included in VaR. Some examples of the types of revenue excluded for backtesting are fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intraday trading revenues.During the three months ended March 31, 2015, there were no days in which there was a backtesting excess for our total market-based portfolio, utilizing a one-day holding period. There were no backtesting excesses for the VaR results used for regulatory capital calculations, utilizing a one-day holding period. 106Table of ContentsTotal Trading-related RevenueTotal trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. Trading account assets and liabilities are reported at fair value. For more information on fair value, see Note 14 – Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Trading-related revenues can be volatile and are largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Also, trading-related revenues are dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. Significant daily revenues by business are monitored and the primary drivers of these are reviewed. When it is deemed material, an explanation of these revenues is provided to the GM subcommittee.The histogram below is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2014. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 97 percent of the trading days, of which 86 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million and the largest loss was $3 million. This compares to the three months ended December 31, 2014, where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 86 percent of the trading days, of which 55 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million and the largest loss was $17 million. 107Table of ContentsTrading Portfolio Stress TestingBecause the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements.A set of scenarios, categorized as either historical or hypothetical, are computed daily for the overall trading portfolio and individual businesses. These scenarios include shocks to underlying market risk factors that may be well beyond the shocks found in the historical data used to calculate VaR. Historical scenarios simulate the impact of the market moves that occurred during a period of extended historical market stress. Generally, a 10-business day window or longer representing the most severe point during a crisis is selected for each historical scenario. Hypothetical scenarios provide simulations of the estimated portfolio impact from potential future market stress events. Scenarios are reviewed and updated in response to changing positions and new economic or political information. In addition, new or ad hoc scenarios are developed to address specific potential market events or particular vulnerabilities in the portfolio. The stress tests are reviewed on a regular basis and the results are presented to senior management.Stress testing for the trading portfolio is integrated with enterprise-wide stress testing and incorporated into the limits framework. The macroeconomic scenarios used for enterprise-wide stress testing purposes differ from the typical trading portfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and the results are forecasted over multiple periods for use in consolidated capital and liquidity planning. For additional information, see Managing Risk on page 46.Interest Rate Risk Management for Nontrading ActivitiesThe following discussion presents net interest income excluding the impact of trading-related activities.Interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our non-trading balance sheet. Interest rate risk is measured as the potential change in net interest income caused by movements in market interest rates. Client-facing activities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet.We prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income. The baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future business growth, ALM positioning and the direction of interest rate movements as implied by the market-based forward curve. We then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The net interest income forecast is frequently updated for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends, market conditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually monitor our balance sheet position in order to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes.The interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate balance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing and maturity characteristics. Our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital.Table 64 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.Table 64Forward Rates March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 Federal Funds Three-monthLIBOR 10-Year Swap Federal Funds Three-monthLIBOR 10-Year SwapSpot rates0.25% 0.27% 2.02% 0.25% 0.26% 2.28%12-month forward rates0.75 0.83 2.26 0.75 0.91 2.55Table 65 shows the pretax dollar impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented to ensure that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. For more information on net interest income excluding the impact of trading-related activities, see page 17. 108Table of ContentsThe asset sensitivity of our balance sheet increased in the quarter primarily due to the low rate environment. We continue to be asset sensitive to both a parallel move in interest rates and a long-end led steepening of the yield curve. Additionally, rising interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as AFS, may adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near term adverse impact to accumulated OCI and Basel 3 capital is reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income. For more information on the phase-in provisions of Basel 3 including accumulated OCI, see Capital Management – Regulatory Capital on page 47.Table 65       Estimated Net Interest Income Excluding Trading-related Net Interest Income(Dollars in millions)Curve ChangeShort Rate (bps) Long Rate (bps) March 31 2015 December 31 2014Parallel shifts        +100 bps instantaneous shift+100 +100 $4,551 $3,685 -50 bps instantaneous shift-50 -50 (3,478) (3,043)Flatteners       Short-end instantaneous change+100 — 2,219 1,966Long-end instantaneous change— -50 (2,105) (1,772)Steepeners       Short-end instantaneous change-50 — (1,361) (1,261)Long-end instantaneous change— +100 2,422 1,782The sensitivity analysis in Table 65 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity.The behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis in Table 65 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher-yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce the Corporation's benefit in those scenarios.SecuritiesThe securities portfolio is an integral part of our interest rate risk management, which includes our ALM positioning, and is primarily comprised of debt securities including MBS and U.S. Treasury securities. As part of the ALM positioning, we use derivatives to hedge interest rate and duration risk. At March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, our debt securities portfolio had a carrying value of $384.0 billion and $380.5 billion.During the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, we purchased debt securities of $55.7 billion and $65.1 billion, sold $38.5 billion and $30.7 billion, and had maturities and received paydowns of $19.4 billion and $19.2 billion, respectively. We also exchanged $5.2 billion of loans supported by long-term standby agreements with FNMA into debt securities guaranteed by FNMA. We realized $268 million and $377 million in net gains on sales of AFS debt securities.At March 31, 2015, accumulated OCI included after-tax net unrealized gains of $2.7 billion on AFS debt securities and after-tax net unrealized gains of $36 million on AFS marketable equity securities compared to after-tax net unrealized losses of $2.0 billion and $12 million at March 31, 2014. For more information on accumulated OCI, see Note 12 – Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The pretax net amounts in accumulated OCI related to AFS debt securities increased $2.1 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2015 to a $4.3 billion net unrealized gain primarily due to the impact of interest rates. For more information on our securities portfolio, see Note 3 – Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 109Table of ContentsResidential Mortgage PortfolioAt March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, our residential mortgage portfolio was $207.9 billion and $216.2 billion excluding $1.9 billion of consumer residential mortgage loans accounted for under the fair value option at each period end. For more information on consumer fair value option loans, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Consumer Loans Accounted for Under the Fair Value Option on page 81. The $8.3 billion decrease in the three months ended March 31, 2015 was primarily due to loan sales including $5.3 billion of loans with standby insurance agreements and $1.0 billion of nonperforming and other delinquent loans, and to a lesser extent, runoff outpacing the retention of new originations. These declines were partially offset by repurchases of delinquent loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA, which are part of our mortgage banking activities.During the three months ended March 31, 2015, Consumer Banking and GWIM originated $8.1 billion of first-lien mortgages that we retained compared to $4.6 billion in the same period in 2014. We received paydowns of $10.0 billion compared to $9.0 billion in the same period in 2014. We repurchased $1.1 billion of loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA and redelivered $548 million, primarily FHA-insured loans, compared to repurchases of $1.3 billion and redeliveries of $1.4 billion in the same period in 2014. Sales of loans, excluding redelivered FHA-insured loans, were $6.3 billion compared to $740 million in the same period in 2014. Gains recognized on the sales of residential mortgages were $233 million compared to $12 million in the same period in 2014.Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative ContractsInterest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components. For more information on our hedging activities, see Note 2 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Our interest rate contracts are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards. In addition, we use foreign exchange contracts, including cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and options to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities.Changes to the composition of our derivatives portfolio during the three months ended March 31, 2015 reflect actions taken for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk management. The decisions to reposition our derivatives portfolio are based on the current assessment of economic and financial conditions including the interest rate and foreign currency environments, balance sheet composition and trends, and the relative mix of our cash and derivative positions. 110Table of ContentsTable 66 presents derivatives utilized in our ALM activities including those designated as accounting and economic hedging instruments and shows the notional amount, fair value, weighted-average receive-fixed and pay-fixed rates, expected maturity and average estimated durations of our open ALM derivatives at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. These amounts do not include derivative hedges on our MSRs.Table 66Asset and Liability Management Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Contracts     March 31, 2015       Expected Maturity  (Dollars in millions, average estimated duration in years)FairValue Total Remainder of 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Thereafter AverageEstimatedDurationReceive-fixed interest rate swaps (1, 2)$8,866               5.53Notional amount  $116,407 $10,156 $15,339 $21,453 $17,049 $10,233 $42,177  Weighted-average fixed-rate  3.30% 3.32% 3.12% 3.64% 3.78% 2.37% 3.23%  Pay-fixed interest rate swaps (1, 2)(1,209)               8.73Notional amount  $14,668 $520 $1,025 $1,527 $2,908 $425 $8,263  Weighted-average fixed-rate  2.40% 2.30% 1.65% 1.84% 1.62% 1.78% 2.91%  Same-currency basis swaps (3)(79)                Notional amount  $84,783 $9,563 $15,691 $20,810 $11,026 $6,789 $20,904  Foreign exchange basis swaps (2, 4, 5)(4,097)                Notional amount  152,635 17,870 24,948 27,067 13,720 11,986 57,044  Option products (6)5                Notional amount (7)  942 928 — — — — 14  Foreign exchange contracts (2, 5, 8)3,187                Notional amount (7)  (20,707) (26,554) (2,438) 5,324 (2,270) 2,113 3,118  Futures and forward rate contracts(118)                Notional amount (7)  (14,943) (14,943) — — — — —  Net ALM contracts$6,555                                       December 31, 2014       Expected Maturity  (Dollars in millions, average estimated duration in years)FairValue Total 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Thereafter AverageEstimatedDurationReceive-fixed interest rate swaps (1, 2)$7,626               4.34Notional amount  $113,766 $11,785 $15,339 $21,453 $15,299 $10,233 $39,657  Weighted-average fixed-rate  2.98% 3.56% 3.12% 3.64% 4.07% 0.49% 2.63%  Pay-fixed interest rate swaps (1, 2)(829)               8.05Notional amount  $14,668 $520 $1,025 $1,527 $2,908 $425 $8,263  Weighted-average fixed-rate  2.27% 2.30% 1.65% 1.84% 1.62% 0.09% 2.77%  Same-currency basis swaps (3)(74)                Notional amount  $94,413 $18,881 $15,691 $21,068 $11,026 $6,787 $20,960  Foreign exchange basis swaps (2, 4, 5)(2,352)                Notional amount  161,196 27,629 26,118 27,026 14,255 12,359 53,809  Option products (6)11                Notional amount (7)  980 964 — — — — 16  Foreign exchange contracts (2, 5, 8)3,700                Notional amount (7)  (22,572) (29,931) (2,036) 6,134 (2,335) 2,359 3,237  Futures and forward rate contracts(129)                Notional amount (7)  (14,949) (14,949) — — — — —  Net ALM contracts$7,953                (1) There were no forward starting receive-fixed interest rate swap positions at both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.

Amounts shown as negative reflect a net short position.(8) The notional amount of foreign exchange contracts of $(20.7) billion at March 31, 2015 was comprised of $19.3 billion in foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed swaps, $(34.2) billion in net foreign currency forward rate contracts, $(7.5) billion in foreign currency-denominated pay-fixed swaps and $1.7 billion in net foreign currency futures contracts. Foreign exchange contracts of $(22.6) billion at December 31, 2014 were comprised of $21.0 billion in foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed swaps, $(36.4) billion in net foreign currency forward rate contracts, $(8.3) billion in foreign currency-denominated pay-fixed swaps and $1.1 billion in foreign currency futures contracts. 111Table of ContentsWe use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities and other forecasted transactions (collectively referred to as cash flow hedges). The net losses on both open and terminated cash flow hedge derivative instruments recorded in accumulated OCI were $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion, on a pretax basis, at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. These net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged cash flows. Assuming no change in open cash flow derivative hedge positions and no changes in prices or interest rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at March 31, 2015, the pretax net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings as follows: $863 million, or 33 percent, within the next year, 43 percent in years two through five, and 16 percent in years six through ten, with the remaining eight percent thereafter. For more information on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see Note 2 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We hedge our net investment in non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar using forward foreign exchange contracts that typically settle in less than 180 days, cross-currency basis swaps and foreign exchange options. We recorded net after-tax losses on derivatives in accumulated OCI associated with net investment hedges which were offset by gains on our net investments in consolidated non-U.S. entities at March 31, 2015.Mortgage Banking Risk ManagementWe originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be HFI or held-for-sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate.Interest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. Fluctuations in interest rates drive consumer demand for new mortgages and the level of refinancing activity, which in turn, affects total origination and servicing income. Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage banking is a complex process that requires complex modeling and ongoing monitoring. Typically, an increase in mortgage interest rates will lead to a decrease in mortgage originations and related fees. IRLCs and the related residential first mortgage LHFS are subject to interest rate risk between the date of the IRLC and the date the loans are sold to the secondary market, as an increase in mortgage interest rates will typically lead to a decrease in the value of these instruments.MSRs are nonfinancial assets created when the underlying mortgage loan is sold to investors and we retain the right to service the loan. Typically, an increase in mortgage rates will lead to an increase in the value of the MSRs driven by lower prepayment expectations. This increase in value from increases in mortgage rates is opposite of, and therefore offsets, the risk described for IRLCs and LHFS. Previously we hedged MSRs separately from the IRLCs and first mortgage LHFS assets. Because the interest rate risks of these two hedged items offset, we combined them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio.Interest rate and certain market risks of IRLCs and residential mortgage LHFS are economically hedged in combination with MSRs. To hedge these combined assets, we use certain derivatives such as interest rate options, interest rate swaps, forward sale commitments, eurodollar and U.S. Treasury futures, and mortgage TBAs, as well as other securities including agency MBS, principal-only and interest-only MBS and U.S. Treasury securities. For the three months ended March 31, 2015, we recorded in mortgage banking income gains of $242 million related to the change in fair value of the derivative contracts and other securities used to hedge the market risks of the MSRs and loan basis compared to gains of $317 million for the same period in 2014. For more information on MSRs, see Note 17 – Mortgage Servicing Rights to the Consolidated Financial Statements and for more information on mortgage banking income, see Consumer Banking on page 23. 112Table of ContentsCompliance Risk ManagementCompliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to the reputation of the Corporation in the event of the failure of the Corporation to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules, regulations, related self-regulatory organization standards and codes of conduct (collectively, applicable laws, rules and regulations). Global Compliance independently assesses compliance risk, and evaluates adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations, including identifying compliance issues and risks, performing monitoring and testing, and reporting on the state of compliance activities across the Corporation. Additionally, Global Compliance works with Front Line Units (FLUs) and control functions so that day-to-day activities operate in a compliant manner. For more information on FLUs and control functions, see page 55 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Corporation's approach to the management of compliance risk is further described in the Global Compliance Policy, which outlines the requirements of the Corporation's global compliance program, and defines roles and responsibilities related to the implementation, execution and management of the compliance program by Global Compliance. The requirements work together to drive a comprehensive risk-based approach for the proactive identification, management and escalation of compliance risks throughout the Corporation.The Global Compliance Policy sets the requirements for reporting compliance risk information to executive management as well as the Board or appropriate Board-level committees with an outline for conducting objective oversight of the Corporation's compliance risk management activities. The Board provides oversight of compliance risks through its Audit Committee and ERC.Operational Risk ManagementThe Corporation defines operational risk as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events. Operational risk may occur anywhere in the Corporation, including third-party business processes, and is not limited to operations functions. Effects may extend beyond financial losses and may result in reputational risk impacts. Operational risk includes legal risk. Successful operational risk management is particularly important to diversified financial services companies because of the nature, volume and complexity of the financial services business. Operational risk is a significant component in the calculation of total risk-weighted assets used in the Basel 3 capital estimate under the Advanced approaches. For more information on Basel 3 Advanced approaches, see Capital Management – Advanced Approaches on page 49.We approach operational risk management from two perspectives within the structure of the Corporation: (1) at the enterprise level to provide independent, integrated management of operational risk across the organization, and (2) at the business and control function levels to address operational risk in revenue producing and non-revenue producing units. The Operational Risk Management Program addresses the overarching processes for identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling operational risk, and reporting operational risk information to management and the Board. A sound internal governance structure enhances the effectiveness of the Corporation's Operational Risk Management Program and is accomplished at the enterprise level through formal oversight by the Board, the ERC, the Chief Risk Officer and a variety of management committees and risk oversight groups aligned to the Corporation's overall risk governance framework and practices. Of these, the MRC oversees the Corporation's policies and processes for sound operational risk management. The MRC also serves as an escalation point for critical operational risk matters within the Corporation. The MRC reports operational risk activities to the ERC. The independent operational risk management teams oversee the businesses and control functions to monitor adherence to the Operational Risk Management Program and advise and challenge operational risk exposures.Within the Global Risk Management organization, the Corporate Operational Risk team develops and guides the strategies, enterprise-wide policies, practices, controls and monitoring tools for assessing and managing operational risks across the organization and reports results to businesses, control functions, senior management, governance committees, and the ERC and the Board.The businesses and control functions are responsible for assessing, monitoring and managing all the risks within their units, including operational risks. In addition to enterprise risk management tools such as loss reporting, scenario analysis and Risk and Control Self Assessments (RCSAs), operational risk executives, working in conjunction with senior business executives, have developed key tools to help identify, measure, monitor and control risk in each business and control function. Examples of these include personnel management practices; data reconciliation processes; fraud management units; cybersecurity controls, processes and systems; transaction processing, monitoring and analysis; business recovery planning; and new product introduction processes. The business and control functions are also responsible for consistently implementing and monitoring adherence to corporate practices. 113Table of ContentsBusiness and control function management uses the enterprise RCSA process to capture the identification and assessment of operational risk exposures and evaluate the status of risk and control issues including mitigation plans, as appropriate. The goals of this process are to assess changing market and business conditions, evaluate key risks impacting each business and control function, and assess the controls in place to mitigate the risks. Key operational risk indicators have been developed and are used to assist in identifying trends and issues on an enterprise, business and control function level. Independent review and challenge to the Corporation's overall operational risk management framework is performed by the Corporate Operational Risk Program Adherence Team and reported through the operational risk governance committees and management routines.Where appropriate, insurance policies are purchased to mitigate the impact of operational losses. These insurance policies are explicitly incorporated in the structural features of operational risk evaluation. As insurance recoveries, especially given recent market events, are subject to legal and financial uncertainty, the inclusion of these insurance policies is subject to reductions in their expected mitigating benefits.Complex Accounting EstimatesOur significant accounting principles, as described in Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K, are essential in understanding the MD&A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments.The more judgmental estimates impacting results for the three months ended March 31, 2015 are summarized in the following discussion. We have identified and described the development of the variables most important in the estimation processes that involve mathematical models to derive the estimates. In many cases, there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs to the models. Where alternatives exist, we have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs. Actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could impact our results of operations. Separate from the possible future impact to our results of operations from input and model variables, the value of our lending portfolio and market-sensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet date, often significantly, due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions. Such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant, negative effect on future operating results. These fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs.For additional information, see Complex Accounting Estimates on page 109 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsWe classify the fair values of financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established under applicable accounting guidance which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Applicable accounting guidance establishes three levels of inputs used to measure fair value. For additional information, see Note 14 – Fair Value Measurements and Note 15 – Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and Complex Accounting Estimates on page 109 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Level 3 Assets and LiabilitiesFinancial assets and liabilities where values are based on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy established in applicable accounting guidance. The Level 3 financial assets and liabilities include certain loans, MBS, ABS, collateralized debt obligations, CLOs and structured liabilities, as well as highly structured, complex or long-dated derivative contracts, private equity investments and consumer MSRs. The fair value of these Level 3 financial assets and liabilities is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. 114Table of ContentsTable 67Recurring Level 3 Asset and Liability Summary March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014(Dollars in millions)Level 3Fair Value As a %of TotalLevel 3Assets As a %of TotalAssets Level 3Fair Value As a %of TotalLevel 3Assets As a %of TotalAssetsTrading account assets$5,714 26.47% 0.27% $6,259 28.12% 0.30%Derivative assets7,450 34.51 0.35 6,851 30.77 0.33AFS debt securities1,684 7.80 0.08 2,555 11.48 0.12Mortgage servicing rights3,394 15.72 0.16 3,530 15.86 0.17All other Level 3 assets at fair value3,344 15.50 0.15 3,067 13.77 0.14Total Level 3 assets at fair value (1)$21,586 100.00% 1.01% $22,262 100.00% 1.06%             Level 3Fair Value As a %of TotalLevel 3Liabilities As a %of TotalLiabilities Level 3Fair Value As a %of TotalLevel 3Liabilities As a %of TotalLiabilitiesDerivative liabilities$8,531 74.81% 0.45% $7,771 76.34% 0.42%Long-term debt2,806 24.61 0.15 2,362 23.20 0.13All other Level 3 liabilities at fair value66 0.58 — 46 0.46 —Total Level 3 liabilities at fair value (1)$11,403 100.00% 0.60% $10,179 100.00% 0.55%(1) Level 3 total assets and liabilities are shown before the impact of cash collateral and counterparty netting related to our derivative positions.Level 3 financial instruments may be hedged with derivatives classified as Level 1 or 2; therefore, gains or losses associated with Level 3 financial instruments may be offset by gains or losses associated with financial instruments classified in other levels of the fair value hierarchy. The Level 3 gains and losses recorded in earnings did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or capital resources. We conduct a review of our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of Level 3 are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable, respectively, in the current marketplace. These transfers are considered to be effective as of the beginning of the quarter in which they occur. For more information on the significant transfers into and out of Level 3 during the three months ended March 31, 2015, see Note 14 – Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsEffective January 1, 2015, the Corporation realigned its reporting segments. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. As part of the realignment, the Corporation moved a portion of the Business Banking business, including $1.6 billion of goodwill, from the former Consumer & Business Banking segment to Global Banking. This business constitutes a new reporting unit, Business Banking Regions, within the Global Banking segment. The remaining portion of the Business Banking business will be evaluated with Deposits as a single reporting unit within Consumer Banking. Prior periods were reclassified to conform to current period presentation. The realignment triggered a test for goodwill impairment, which was performed both immediately before and after the realignment. In performing the goodwill impairment test, we compared the fair value of the affected reporting units with their carrying value as measured by allocated equity. As of January 1, 2015, the fair value as a percentage of the carrying value for Business Banking Regions and Deposits was 150.3% and 128.5%, respectively. As the fair value of the affected reporting units exceeded their carrying value, no goodwill impairment resulted from the realignment. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 8 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding testing goodwill for impairment. 115Table of ContentsGlossaryAlt-A Mortgage – A type of U.S. mortgage that, for various reasons, is considered riskier than A-paper, or "prime," and less risky than "subprime," the riskiest category. Alt-A interest rates, which are determined by credit risk, therefore tend to be between those of prime and subprime consumer real estate loans. Typically, Alt-A mortgages are characterized by borrowers with less than full documentation, lower credit scores and higher LTVs.Assets in Custody – Consist largely of custodial and non-discretionary trust assets excluding brokerage assets administered for clients. Trust assets encompass a broad range of asset types including real estate, private company ownership interest, personal property and investments.Assets Under Management (AUM) – The total market value of assets under the investment advisory and discretion of GWIM which generate asset management fees based on a percentage of the assets' market values. AUM reflects assets that are generally managed for institutional, high net worth and retail clients, and are distributed through various investment products including mutual funds, other commingled vehicles and separate accounts. AUM is classified in two categories, Liquidity AUM and Long-term AUM. Liquidity AUM are assets under advisory and discretion of GWIM in which the investment strategy seeks to maximize income while maintaining liquidity and capital preservation. The duration of these strategies is primarily less than one year. Long-term AUM are assets under advisory and discretion of GWIM in which the duration of investment strategy is longer than one year.Carrying Value (with respect to loans) – The amount at which a loan is recorded on the balance sheet. For loans recorded at amortized cost, carrying value is the unpaid principal balance net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and costs, and unamortized purchase premium or discount. For loans that are or have been on nonaccrual status, the carrying value is also reduced by any net charge-offs that have been recorded and the amount of interest payments applied as a reduction of principal under the cost recovery method. For PCI loans, the carrying value equals fair value upon acquisition adjusted for subsequent cash collections and yield accreted to date. For credit card loans, the carrying value also includes interest that has been billed to the customer. For loans classified as held-for-sale, carrying value is the lower of carrying value as described in the sentences above, or fair value. For loans for which we have elected the fair value option, the carrying value is fair value.Client Brokerage Assets – Include client assets which are held in brokerage accounts. This includes non-discretionary brokerage and fee-based assets which generate brokerage income and asset management fee revenue.Committed Credit Exposure – Includes any funded portion of a facility plus the unfunded portion of a facility on which the lender is legally bound to advance funds during a specified period under prescribed conditions.Credit Derivatives – Contractual agreements that provide protection against a credit event on one or more referenced obligations. The nature of a credit event is established by the protection purchaser and protection seller at the inception of the transaction, and such events generally include bankruptcy or insolvency of the referenced credit entity, failure to meet payment obligations when due, as well as acceleration of indebtedness and payment repudiation or moratorium. The purchaser of the credit derivative pays a periodic fee in return for a payment by the protection seller upon the occurrence, if any, of such a credit event. A credit default swap is a type of a credit derivative.Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) – A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the counterparty credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments. Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) – A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the Corporation's own credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments and/or structured liabilities. Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA) – A portfolio adjustment required to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives.Interest Rate Lock Commitment (IRLC) – Commitment with a loan applicant in which the loan terms, including interest rate and price, are guaranteed for a designated period of time subject to credit approval.Letter of Credit – A document issued on behalf of a customer to a third party promising to pay the third party upon presentation of specified documents. A letter of credit effectively substitutes the issuer's credit for that of the customer.  116Table of ContentsLoan-to-value (LTV) – A commonly used credit quality metric that is reported in terms of ending and average LTV. Ending LTV is calculated as the outstanding carrying value of the loan at the end of the period divided by the estimated value of the property securing the loan. An additional metric related to LTV is combined loan-to-value (CLTV) which is similar to the LTV metric, yet combines the outstanding balance on the residential mortgage loan and the outstanding carrying value on the home equity loan or available line of credit, both of which are secured by the same property, divided by the estimated value of the property. A LTV of 100 percent reflects a loan that is currently secured by a property valued at an amount exactly equal to the carrying value or available line of the loan. Estimated property values are generally determined through the use of automated valuation models (AVMs) or the CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index. An AVM is a tool that estimates the value of a property by reference to large volumes of market data including sales of comparable properties and price trends specific to the MSA in which the property being valued is located. CoreLogic Case-Shiller is a widely used index based on data from repeat sales of single family homes. CoreLogic Case-Shiller indexed-based values are reported on a three-month or one-quarter lag.Margin Receivable – An extension of credit secured by eligible securities in certain brokerage accounts.Market-related Adjustments – Include adjustments to premium amortization or discount accretion on debt securities when a decrease in long-term rates shortens (or an increase extends) the estimated lives of mortgage-related debt securities. Also included in market-related adjustments is hedge ineffectiveness that impacts net interest income.Matched Book – Repurchase and resale agreements and securities borrowed and loaned transactions entered into to accommodate customers and earn interest rate spreads.Mortgage Servicing Right (MSR) – The right to service a mortgage loan when the underlying loan is sold or securitized. Servicing includes collections for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors.Net Interest Yield – Net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets.Nonperforming Loans and Leases – Include loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status, including nonaccruing loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties (TDRs). Loans accounted for under the fair value option, PCI loans and LHFS are not reported as nonperforming loans and leases. Consumer credit card loans, business card loans, consumer loans secured by personal property (except for certain secured consumer loans, including those that have been modified in a TDR), and consumer loans secured by real estate that are insured by the FHA or through long-term credit protection agreements with FNMA and FHLMC (fully-insured loan portfolio) are not placed on nonaccrual status and are, therefore, not reported as nonperforming loans and leases.Purchased Credit-impaired (PCI) Loan – A loan purchased as an individual loan, in a portfolio of loans or in a business combination with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination for which it is probable, upon acquisition, that the investor will be unable to collect all contractually required payments. These loans are recorded at fair value upon acquisition.Subprime Loans – Although a standard industry definition for subprime loans (including subprime mortgage loans) does not exist, the Corporation defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers, including individuals with one or a combination of high credit risk factors, such as low FICO scores, high debt to income ratios and inferior payment history.Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) – Loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Certain consumer loans for which a binding offer to restructure has been extended are also classified as TDRs. Concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate to a rate that is below market on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance, loans discharged in bankruptcy or other actions intended to maximize collection. Secured consumer loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not been reaffirmed by the borrower are classified as TDRs at the time of discharge from bankruptcy. TDRs are generally reported as nonperforming loans and leases while on nonaccrual status. Nonperforming TDRs may be returned to accrual status when, among other criteria, payment in full of all amounts due under the restructured terms is expected and the borrower has demonstrated a sustained period of repayment performance, generally six months. TDRs that are on accrual status are reported as performing TDRs through the end of the calendar year in which the restructuring occurred or the year in which they are returned to accrual status. In addition, if accruing TDRs bear less than a market rate of interest at the time of modification, they are reported as performing TDRs throughout their remaining lives unless and until they cease to perform in accordance with their modified contractual terms, at which time they would be placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming TDRs.Value-at-Risk (VaR) – VaR is a model that simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss the portfolio is expected to experience with a given confidence level based on historical data. A VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios.  117Table of ContentsAcronyms   ABS Asset-backed securitiesAFS Available-for-saleALM Asset and liability managementARM Adjustable-rate mortgageAUM Assets under managementBHC Bank holding companyCCAR Comprehensive Capital Analysis and ReviewCDO Collateralized debt obligationCLO Collateralized loan obligationCRA Community Reinvestment ActCVA Credit valuation adjustmentDVA Debit valuation adjustmentEAD Exposure at defaultERC Enterprise Risk CommitteeFHA Federal Housing AdministrationFHLB Federal Home Loan BankFHLMC Freddie MacFICC Fixed-income, currencies and commoditiesFICO Fair Isaac Corporation (credit score)FLUs Front line unitsFNMA Fannie MaeFSB Financial Stability BoardFTE Fully taxable-equivalentFVA Funding valuation adjustmentGAAP Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of AmericaGNMA Government National Mortgage AssociationGSE Government-sponsored enterprise       HELOC Home equity lines of creditHFI Held-for-investmentHQLA High Quality Liquid AssetsHUD U.S. Department of Housing and Urban DevelopmentLCR Liquidity Coverage RatioLGD Loss-given defaultLHFS Loans held-for-saleLIBOR London InterBank Offered RateLTV Loan-to-valueMBS Mortgage-backed securitiesMD&A Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsMI Mortgage insuranceMRC Management Risk CommitteeMSR Mortgage servicing rightNSFR Net Stable Funding RatioOCI Other comprehensive incomeOTC Over-the-counterOTTI Other-than-temporary impairmentPCI Purchased credit-impairedPPI Payment protection insuranceRCSAs Risk and Control Self AssessmentsRMBS Residential mortgage-backed securitiesSEC Securities and Exchange CommissionSLR Supplementary leverage ratioTDR Troubled debt restructurings VIE Variable interest entity 118Table of ContentsItem 3.

of America Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the Corporation), a bank holding company and a financial holding company, provides a diverse range of financial services and products throughout the U.S. and in certain international markets. The term "the Corporation" as used herein may refer to Bank of America Corporation individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation's subsidiaries or affiliates.Principles of Consolidation and Basis of PresentationThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries, and those variable interest entities (VIEs) where the Corporation is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Results of operations of acquired companies are included from the dates of acquisition and for VIEs, from the dates that the Corporation became the primary beneficiary. Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Corporation accounts for investments in companies for which it owns a voting interest and for which it has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financing decisions using the equity method of accounting. These investments are included in other assets. Equity method investments are subject to impairment testing and the Corporation's proportionate share of income or loss is included in equity investment income.In the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, the Corporation reported its results of operations through five business segments: Consumer & Business Banking (CBB), Consumer Real Estate Services (CRES), Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), Global Banking and Global Markets, with the remaining operations recorded in All Other. Effective January 1, 2015, to align the segments with how the Corporation manages the businesses in 2015, it changed its basis of presentation, and following such change, reports its results of operations through the following five business segments: Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), Global Banking, Global Markets and Legacy Assets & Servicing (LAS), with the remaining operations recorded in All Other. The Home Loans business, which was included in the former CRES segment, is now included in Consumer Banking, and LAS (also in the former CRES segment) has become a separate segment. A portion of the Business Banking business, based on the size of the client, was moved from the former CBB segment to Global Banking, and the former CBB segment was renamed Consumer Banking. Also, the Corporation's merchant services joint venture moved from the former CBB segment to All Other. In addition, certain management accounting methodologies, including the treatment of intersegment assets and liabilities, and related allocations were refined. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Realized results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The nature of the Corporation's business is such that the results of any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which consist of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the interim period results have been made. The Corporation evaluates subsequent events through the date of filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.New Accounting PronouncementsIn February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance that amends the criteria for determining whether limited partnerships and similar entities are VIEs, clarifies when a general partner or asset manager should consolidate an entity and eliminates the indefinite deferral of certain aspects of VIE accounting guidance for investments in certain investment funds. Money market funds registered under Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act and similar funds are exempt from consolidation under the new guidance. The new accounting guidance is effective beginning on January 1, 2016. Early adoption is permitted; however, the Corporation does not expect to adopt this new guidance early. The Corporation does not expect the new guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. 126Table of ContentsIn August 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on classification and measurement of foreclosed mortgage loans that are government guaranteed. This new guidance states that certain foreclosed properties should be classified as receivables and measured based on the amount of the loan balance expected to be recovered from the guarantor. The new guidance is effective beginning on January 1, 2015 using either a prospective or modified retrospective transition method. The Corporation adopted the modified retrospective transition method which did not have a material impact on the Corporation's consolidated financial position or results of operations.In June 2014, the FASB issued new guidance on accounting and disclosure of repurchase-to-maturity (RTM) transactions and repurchase financings (repos). Under this new accounting guidance, RTMs are accounted for as secured borrowings rather than sales of an asset, and transfers of financial assets with a contemporaneous repo are no longer evaluated to determine whether they should be accounted for on a combined basis as forward contracts. The new guidance also prescribes additional disclosures particularly on the nature of collateral pledged in repos accounted for as secured borrowings. The new guidance was effective beginning on January 1, 2015 and did not have a material impact on the Corporation's consolidated financial position or results of operations. For the additional disclosures under this guidance, see Note 2 – Derivatives. In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. The new accounting guidance, which does not apply to financial instruments, is effective on a retrospective basis beginning on January 1, 2017; however, the FASB has issued a proposal to extend the effective date by one year. The Corporation is assessing the impact of this new guidance on its consolidated financial position and results of operations.In January 2014, the FASB issued new guidance on accounting for qualified affordable housing projects which permits entities to make an accounting policy election to apply the proportional amortization method when specific conditions are met. The new accounting guidance is effective on a retrospective basis beginning on January 1, 2015 with early adoption permitted. The Corporation did not adopt the proportional amortization method. 127Table of ContentsNOTE 2 – Derivatives Derivative BalancesDerivatives are entered into on behalf of custmers, for trading, or to support risk management activities. Derivatives used in risk management activities include derivatives that may or may not be designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships. Derivatives that are not designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships are referred to as other risk management derivatives. For more information on the Corporation's derivatives and hedging activities, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following tables present derivative instruments included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in derivative assets and liabilities at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting. Total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and have been reduced by the cash collateral received or paid.

(ISDA) master netting agreements or similar agreements with substantially all of the Corporation's derivative counterparties. Where legally enforceable, these master netting agreements give the Corporation, in the event of default by the counterparty, the right to liquidate securities held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty. For purposes of the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation offsets derivative assets and liabilities and cash collateral held with the same counterparty where it has such a legally enforceable master netting agreement.The Offsetting of Derivatives table presents derivative instruments included in derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 by primary risk (e.g., interest rate risk) and the platform, where applicable, on which these derivatives are transacted. Exchange-traded derivatives include listed options transacted on an exchange. Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives include bilateral transactions between the Corporation and a particular counterparty. OTC-cleared derivatives include bilateral transactions between the Corporation and a counterparty where the transaction is cleared through a clearinghouse. Balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting. Total gross derivative assets and liabilities  129Table of Contentsare adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements which includes reducing the balance for counterparty netting and cash collateral received or paid.Other gross derivative assets and liabilities in the table represent derivatives entered into under master netting agreements where uncertainty exists as to the enforceability of these agreements under bankruptcy laws in some countries or industries and, accordingly, receivables and payables with counterparties in these countries or industries are reported on a gross basis.Also included in the table is financial instrument collateral related to legally enforceable master netting agreements that represents securities collateral received or pledged and customer cash collateral held at third-party custodians. These amounts are not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but are shown as a reduction to total derivative assets and liabilities in the table to derive net derivative assets and liabilities.For more information on offsetting of securities financing agreements, see Note 9 – Federal Funds Sold or Purchased, Securities Financing Agreements and Short-term Borrowings.Offsetting of Derivatives        March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014(Dollars in billions)DerivativeAssets DerivativeLiabilities DerivativeAssets DerivativeLiabilitiesInterest rate contracts       Over-the-counter$401.5 $387.9 $386.6 $373.2Exchange-traded0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1Over-the-counter cleared318.1 319.0 365.7 368.7Foreign exchange contracts       Over-the-counter146.2 153.8 133.0 139.9Over-the-counter cleared0.1 0.1 — —Equity contracts       Over-the-counter19.7 17.3 19.5 16.7Exchange-traded8.8 8.7 8.6 7.8Commodity contracts       Over-the-counter8.3 11.2 10.2 11.9Exchange-traded5.8 6.0 7.4 7.7Over-the-counter cleared0.1 0.1 0.1 0.6Credit derivatives       Over-the-counter27.1 26.8 30.8 30.2Over-the-counter cleared7.4 7.2 7.0 6.8Total gross derivative assets/liabilities, before netting     Over-the-counter602.8 597.0 580.1 571.9Exchange-traded14.7 14.8 16.1 15.6Over-the-counter cleared325.7 326.4 372.8 376.1Less: Legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral received/paid       Over-the-counter(566.7) (568.7) (545.7) (545.5)Exchange-traded(12.8) (12.8) (13.9) (13.9)Over-the-counter cleared(325.2) (326.3) (372.5) (375.5)Derivative assets/liabilities, after netting38.5 30.4 36.9 28.7Other gross derivative assets/liabilities 22.8 21.8 15.8 18.2Total derivative assets/liabilities61.3 52.2 52.7 46.9Less: Financial instruments collateral (1)(12.3) (8.4) (13.3) (8.9)Total net derivative assets/liabilities$49.0 $43.8 $39.4 $38.0(1) These amounts are limited to the derivative asset/liability balance and, accordingly, do not include excess collateral received/pledged. 130Table of ContentsALM and Risk Management DerivativesThe Corporation's asset and liability management (ALM) and risk management activities include the use of derivatives to mitigate risk to the Corporation including derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships and derivatives used in other risk management activities. Interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, commodity and credit contracts are utilized in the Corporation's ALM and risk management activities.The Corporation maintains an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts, which are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation's goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity and volatility so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings or capital. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in fair value. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are linked to the hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this unrealized appreciation or depreciation.Market risk, including interest rate risk, can be substantial in the mortgage business. Market risk is the risk that values of mortgage assets or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as interest rate movements. To mitigate the interest rate risk in mortgage banking production income, the Corporation utilizes forward loan sale commitments and other derivative instruments, including purchased options, and certain debt securities. The Corporation also utilizes derivatives such as interest rate options, interest rate swaps, forward settlement contracts and eurodollar futures to hedge certain market risks of mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). For more information on MSRs, see Note 17 – Mortgage Servicing Rights.The Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities, as well as the Corporation's investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Foreign exchange contracts, which include spot and forward contracts, represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon settlement date. Exposure to loss on these contracts will increase or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange and interest rates fluctuate.The Corporation enters into derivative commodity contracts such as futures, swaps, options and forwards as well as non-derivative commodity contracts to provide price risk management services to customers or to manage price risk associated with its physical and financial commodity positions. The non-derivative commodity contracts and physical inventories of commodities expose the Corporation to earnings volatility. Cash flow and fair value accounting hedges provide a method to mitigate a portion of this earnings volatility.The Corporation purchases credit derivatives to manage credit risk related to certain funded and unfunded credit exposures. Credit derivatives include credit default swaps (CDS), total return swaps and swaptions. These derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income. 131Table of ContentsDerivatives Designated as Accounting HedgesThe Corporation uses various types of interest rate, commodity and foreign exchange derivative contracts to protect against changes in the fair value of its assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates, commodity prices and exchange rates (fair value hedges). The Corporation also uses these types of contracts and equity derivatives to protect against changes in the cash flows of its assets and liabilities, and other forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges). The Corporation hedges its net investment in consolidated non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar using forward exchange contracts and cross-currency basis swaps, and by issuing foreign currency-denominated debt (net investment hedges).Fair Value HedgesThe table below summarizes information related to fair value hedges for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, including hedges of interest rate risk on long-term debt that were acquired as part of a business combination and redesignated. At redesignation, the fair value of the derivatives was positive. As the derivatives mature, the fair value will approach zero. As a result, ineffectiveness will occur and the fair value changes in the derivatives and the long-term debt being hedged may be directionally the same in certain scenarios. Based on a regression analysis, the derivatives continue to be highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value of the long-term debt attributable to interest rate risk.Derivatives Designated as Fair Value HedgesGains (Losses)Three Months Ended March 31 2015(Dollars in millions)Derivative HedgedItem HedgeIneffectivenessInterest rate risk on long-term debt (1)$1,096 $(1,292) $(196)Interest rate and foreign currency risk on long-term debt (1)(1,644) 1,588 (56)Interest rate risk on available-for-sale securities (2)43 (45) (2)Price risk on commodity inventory (3)11 (7) 4Total$(494) $244 $(250)       2014Interest rate risk on long-term debt (1)$366 $(560) $(194)Interest rate and foreign currency risk on long-term debt (1)118 (144) (26)Interest rate risk on available-for-sale securities (2)2 (3) (1)Price risk on commodity inventory (3)2 5 7Total$488 $(702) $(214)(1) Amounts are recorded in interest expense on long-term debt and in other income.(2) Amounts are recorded in interest income on debt securities.(3) Amounts relating to commodity inventory are recorded in trading account profits. 132Table of ContentsCash Flow and Net Investment HedgesThe table below summarizes certain information related to cash flow hedges and net investment hedges for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014. Of the $1.6 billion net loss (after-tax) on derivatives in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) at March 31, 2015, $863 million ($540 million after-tax) is expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months. These net losses reclassified into earnings are expected to primarily reduce net interest income related to the respective hedged items. Amounts related to price risk on restricted stock awards reclassified from accumulated OCI are recorded in personnel expense.Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges Three Months Ended March 31 2015(Dollars in millions, amounts pretax)Gains (Losses) Recognized in Accumulated OCI on Derivatives Gains (Losses) in Income Reclassified from Accumulated OCI Hedge Ineffectiveness and Amounts Excluded from Effectiveness Testing (1)Cash flow hedges     Interest rate risk on variable-rate portfolios$24 $(255) $(1)Price risk on restricted stock awards (2)(210) (1) —Total$(186) $(256) $(1)Net investment hedges     Foreign exchange risk$1,982 $— $(98)       2014Cash flow hedges     Interest rate risk on variable-rate portfolios$17 $(281) $—Price risk on restricted stock awards (2)156 150 —Total$173 $(131) $—Net investment hedges     Foreign exchange risk$(181) $(2) $(58)(1) Amounts related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges represent hedge ineffectiveness and amounts related to net investment hedges represent amounts excluded from effectiveness testing.(2) The hedge gain (loss) recognized in accumulated OCI is primarily related to the change in the Corporation's stock price for the period. 133Table of ContentsOther Risk Management DerivativesOther risk management derivatives are used by the Corporation to reduce certain risk exposures. These derivatives are not qualifying accounting hedges because either they did not qualify for or were not designated as accounting hedges. The table below presents gains (losses) on these derivatives for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014. These gains (losses) are largely offset by the income or expense that is recorded on the hedged item.Other Risk Management DerivativesGains (Losses)Three Months Ended March 31(Dollars in millions)2015 2014Interest rate risk on mortgage banking income (1)$296 $180Credit risk on loans (2)(27) (6)Interest rate and foreign currency risk on ALM activities (3)(319) (598)Price risk on restricted stock awards (4)(470) 364Other13 (3)(1) Net gains (losses) on these derivatives are recorded in mortgage banking income as they are used to mitigate the interest rate risk related to MSRs, interest rate lock commitments and mortgage loans held-for-sale, all of which are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in mortgage banking income. The net gains on interest rate lock commitments related to the origination of mortgage loans that are held-for-sale, which are not included in the table but are considered derivative instruments, were $260 million and $173 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014.(2) Net gains (losses) on these derivatives are recorded in other income.(3) Primarily related to hedges of debt securities carried at fair value and hedges of foreign currency-denominated debt. Gains (losses) on these derivatives and the related hedged items are recorded in other income.(4) Gains (losses) on these derivatives are recorded in personnel expense.Transfers of Financial Assets with Risk Retained through DerivativesThe Corporation enters into certain transactions involving the transfer of financial assets that are accounted for as sales where substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred financial assets is retained by the Corporation through a derivative agreement with the initial transferee. These transactions are accounted for as sales because the Corporation does not retain control over the assets transferred. Through March 31, 2015, the Corporation transferred $8.8 billion of non-U.S. government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and non-U.S. government securities primarily to a trust created by a third party. The Corporation received gross cash proceeds of $8.8 billion at the transfer dates. The Corporation simultaneously entered into derivatives with those counterparties whereby the Corporation retained certain economic exposures to those securities (e.g., interest rate and/or credit risk). Generally, the maturity of the derivatives is the same as the maturity of assets initially transferred. A derivative asset of $107 million and a liability of $22 million were recorded at March 31, 2015 and are included in credit derivatives in the derivative instruments table on page 128. At March 31, 2015, the fair value of the securities previously transferred was $8.9 billion. The economic exposure retained by the Corporation, which is primarily interest rate risk and prepayment risk, is typically hedged with interest rate swaps and interest rate swaptions and, to a lesser extent, total return swaps.Sales and Trading RevenueThe Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate client transactions and to manage risk exposures arising from trading account assets and liabilities. It is the Corporation's policy to include these derivative instruments in its trading activities which include derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments. The resulting risk from these derivatives is managed on a portfolio basis as part of the Corporation's Global Markets business segment. The related sales and trading revenue generated within Global Markets is recorded in various income statement line items including trading account profits and net interest income as well as other revenue categories. Sales and trading revenue includes changes in the fair value and realized gains and losses on the sales of trading and other assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. Revenue is generated by the difference in the client price for an instrument and the price at which the trading desk can execute the trade in the dealer market. For equity securities, commissions related to purchases and sales are recorded in the "Other" column in the Sales and Trading Revenue table. Changes in the fair value of these securities are included in trading account profits. For debt securities, revenue, with the exception of interest associated with the debt securities, is typically included in trading account profits. Unlike commissions for equity securities, the initial revenue related to broker-dealer services for debt securities is typically included in the pricing of the instrument rather than being charged through separate  134Table of Contentsfee arrangements. Therefore, this revenue is recorded in trading account profits as part of the initial mark to fair value. For derivatives, the majority of revenue is included in trading account profits. In transactions where the Corporation acts as agent, which include exchange-traded futures and options, fees are recorded in other income.The table below, which includes both derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments, identifies the amounts in the respective income statement line items attributable to the Corporation's sales and trading revenue in Global Markets, categorized by primary risk, for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014. The difference between total trading account profits in the table below and in the Consolidated Statement of Income represents trading activities in business segments other than Global Markets. This table includes debit valuation and funding valuation adjustment (DVA/FVA) gains (losses). Global Markets results in Note 18 – Business Segment Information are presented on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis. The table below is not presented on an FTE basis.Sales and Trading Revenue        Three Months Ended March 31 2015(Dollars in millions)TradingAccountProfits Net Interest Income Other (1) TotalInterest rate risk$510 $306 $89 $905Foreign exchange risk446 (2) (31) 413Equity risk570 13 577 1,160Credit risk444 587 167 1,198Other risk157 (22) 56 191Total sales and trading revenue$2,127 $882 $858 $3,867         2014Interest rate risk$369 $279 $138 $786Foreign exchange risk237 2 (30) 209Equity risk601 (14) 604 1,191Credit risk1,027 699 155 1,881Other risk133 (90) 67 110Total sales and trading revenue$2,367 $876 $934 $4,177(1) Represents amounts in investment and brokerage services and other income that are recorded in Global Markets and included in the definition of sales and trading revenue.

Credit derivatives derive value based on an underlying third-party referenced obligation or a portfolio of referenced obligations and generally require the Corporation, as the seller of credit protection, to make payments to a buyer upon the occurrence of a pre-defined credit event. Such credit events generally include bankruptcy of the referenced credit entity and failure to pay under the obligation, as well as acceleration of indebtedness and payment repudiation or moratorium. For credit derivatives based on a portfolio of referenced credits or credit indices, the Corporation may not be required to make payment until a specified amount of loss has occurred and/or may only be required to make payment up to a specified amount. 135Table of ContentsCredit derivative instruments where the Corporation is the seller of credit protection and their expiration are summarized in the table below. These instruments are classified as investment and non-investment grade based on the credit quality of the underlying referenced obligation. The Corporation considers ratings of BBB- or higher as investment grade. Non-investment grade includes non-rated credit derivative instruments. The Corporation discloses internal categorizations of investment grade and non-investment grade consistent with how risk is managed for these instruments.Credit Derivative Instruments   March 31, 2015 Carrying Value(Dollars in millions)Less thanOne Year One to Three Years Three toFive Years Over FiveYears TotalCredit default swaps:         Investment grade$27 $286 $760 $688 $1,761Non-investment grade306 1,732 1,727 4,058 7,823Total333 2,018 2,487 4,746 9,584Total return swaps/other:         Investment grade26 — — — 26Non-investment grade169 113 8 — 290Total195 113 8 — 316Total credit derivatives$528 $2,131 $2,495 $4,746 $9,900Credit-related notes:         Investment grade$3 $361 $583 $2,460 $3,407Non-investment grade8 151 66 1,442 1,667Total credit-related notes$11 $512 $649 $3,902 $5,074 Maximum Payout/NotionalCredit default swaps:         Investment grade$125,169 $323,858 $210,676 $48,022 $707,725Non-investment grade51,770 170,382 77,803 24,738 324,693Total176,939 494,240 288,479 72,760 1,032,418Total return swaps/other:         Investment grade26,442 — — — 26,442Non-investment grade25,449 9,685 152 106 35,392Total51,891 9,685 152 106 61,834Total credit derivatives$228,830 $503,925 $288,631 $72,866 $1,094,252           December 31, 2014 Carrying ValueCredit default swaps:         Investment grade$100 $714 $1,455 $939 $3,208Non-investment grade916 2,107 1,338 4,301 8,662Total1,016 2,821 2,793 5,240 11,870Total return swaps/other:         Investment grade24 — — — 24Non-investment grade64 247 2 — 313Total88 247 2 — 337Total credit derivatives$1,104 $3,068 $2,795 $5,240 $12,207Credit-related notes:         Investment grade$2 $365 $568 $2,634 $3,569Non-investment grade5 141 85 1,443 1,674Total credit-related notes$7 $506 $653 $4,077 $5,243 Maximum Payout/NotionalCredit default swaps:         Investment grade$132,974 $342,914 $242,728 $28,982 $747,598Non-investment grade54,326 170,580 80,011 20,586 325,503Total187,300 513,494 322,739 49,568 1,073,101Total return swaps/other:         Investment grade22,645 — — — 22,645Non-investment grade23,839 10,792 3,268 487 38,386Total46,484 10,792 3,268 487 61,031Total credit derivatives$233,784 $524,286 $326,007 $50,055 $1,134,132 136Table of ContentsThe notional amount represents the maximum amount payable by the Corporation for most credit derivatives. However, the Corporation does not monitor its exposure to credit derivatives based solely on the notional amount because this measure does not take into consideration the probability of occurrence. As such, the notional amount is not a reliable indicator of the Corporation's exposure to these contracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and establish limits to help ensure that certain credit risk-related losses occur within acceptable, predefined limits.The Corporation manages its market risk exposure to credit derivatives by entering into a variety of offsetting derivative contracts and security positions. For example, in certain instances, the Corporation may purchase credit protection with identical underlying referenced names to offset its exposure. The carrying value and notional amount of written credit derivatives for which the Corporation held purchased credit derivatives with identical underlying referenced names and terms were $4.6 billion and $799.3 billion at March 31, 2015, and $5.7 billion and $880.6 billion at December 31, 2014.Credit-related notes in the table on page 136 include investments in securities issued by collateralized debt obligation (CDO), collateralized loan obligation (CLO) and credit-linked note vehicles. These instruments are primarily classified as trading securities. The carrying value of these instruments equals the Corporation's maximum exposure to loss. The Corporation is not obligated to make any payments to the entities under the terms of the securities owned.Credit-related Contingent Features and CollateralThe Corporation executes the majority of its derivative contracts in the OTC market with large, international financial institutions, including broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of non-financial companies. Substantially all of the derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit rating downgrade (depending on the ultimate rating level) or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required of the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow the Corporation to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades. Further, as previously discussed on page 128, the Corporation enters into legally enforceable master netting agreements which reduce risk by permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of certain events.A majority of the Corporation's derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features, primarily in the form of ISDA master netting agreements and credit support documentation that enhance the creditworthiness of these instruments compared to other obligations of the respective counterparty with whom the Corporation has transacted. These contingent features may be for the benefit of the Corporation as well as its counterparties with respect to changes in the Corporation's creditworthiness and the mark-to-market exposure under the derivative transactions. At March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Corporation held cash and securities collateral of $85.5 billion and $82.0 billion, and posted cash and securities collateral of $72.6 billion and $67.7 billion in the normal course of business under derivative agreements.In connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, the Corporation can be required to provide additional collateral or to terminate transactions with certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade of the senior debt ratings of the Corporation or certain subsidiaries. The amount of additional collateral required depends on the contract and is usually a fixed incremental amount and/or the market value of the exposure.At March 31, 2015, the amount of collateral, calculated based on the terms of the contracts, that the Corporation and certain subsidiaries could be required to post to counterparties but had not yet posted to counterparties was approximately $1.3 billion, including $675 million for Bank of America, N.A. (BANA).Some counterparties are currently able to unilaterally terminate certain contracts, or the Corporation or certain subsidiaries may be required to take other action such as find a suitable replacement or obtain a guarantee. At March 31, 2015, the current liability recorded for these derivative contracts was $103 million, against which the Corporation and certain subsidiaries had posted approximately $54 million of collateral. 137Table of ContentsThe table below presents the amount of additional collateral that would have been contractually required by derivative contracts and other trading agreements at March 31, 2015 if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch and by an additional second incremental notch.Additional Collateral Required to Be Posted Upon Downgrade March 31, 2015(Dollars in millions)One incremental notch Second incremental notchBank of America Corporation$1,358 $2,714Bank of America, N.A. and subsidiaries (1)1,087 1,877(1) Included in Bank of America Corporation collateral requirements in this table.The table below presents the derivative liabilities that would be subject to unilateral termination by counterparties and the amounts of collateral that would have been contractually required at March 31, 2015 if the long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries had been lower by one incremental notch and by an additional second incremental notch.Derivative Liabilities Subject to Unilateral Termination Upon Downgrade March 31, 2015(Dollars in millions)One incremental notch Second incremental notchDerivative liabilities$1,364 $4,724Collateral posted1,106 3,922 138Table of ContentsValuation Adjustments on DerivativesThe Corporation records credit risk valuation adjustments on derivatives in order to properly reflect the credit quality of the counterparties and its own credit quality. The Corporation calculates valuation adjustments on derivatives based on a modeled expected exposure that incorporates current market risk factors. The exposure also takes into consideration credit mitigants such as enforceable master netting agreements and collateral. CDS spread data is used to estimate the default probabilities and severities that are applied to the exposures. Where no observable credit default data is available for counterparties, the Corporation uses proxies and other market data to estimate default probabilities and severity.Valuation adjustments on derivatives are affected by changes in market spreads, non-credit-related market factors such as interest rate and currency changes that affect the expected exposure, and other factors like changes in collateral arrangements and partial payments. Credit spreads and non-credit factors can move independently. For example, for an interest rate swap, changes in interest rates may increase the expected exposure, which would increase the counterparty credit valuation adjustment (CVA). Independently, counterparty credit spreads may tighten, which would result in an offsetting decrease to CVA.In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Corporation adopted FVA into valuation estimates primarily to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives. The Corporation calculates this valuation adjustment based on modeled expected exposure profiles discounted for the funding risk premium inherent in these derivatives. FVA related to derivative assets and liabilities is the effect of funding costs on the fair value of these derivatives.The Corporation enters into risk management activities to offset market driven exposures. The Corporation often hedges the counterparty spread risk in CVA with CDS. The Corporation hedges other market risks in both CVA and debit valuation adjustment (DVA) primarily with currency and interest rate swaps. In certain instances, the net-of-hedge amounts in the table below move in the same direction as the gross amount or may move in the opposite direction. This is a consequence of the complex interaction of the risks being hedged resulting in limitations in the ability to perfectly hedge all of the market exposures at all times.The table below presents CVA, DVA and FVA gains (losses) on derivatives, which are recorded in trading account profits, on a gross and net of hedge basis for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014. CVA gains reduce the cumulative CVA thereby increasing the derivative assets balance. DVA gains increase the cumulative DVA thereby decreasing the derivative liabilities balance. CVA and DVA losses have the opposite impact. FVA gains related to derivative assets reduce the cumulative FVA thereby increasing the derivative assets balance. FVA gains related to derivative liabilities increase the cumulative FVA thereby decreasing the derivative liabilities balance.Valuation Adjustments on DerivativesGains (Losses)Three Months Ended March 31 2015 2014(Dollars in millions)GrossNet GrossNetDerivative assets (CVA) (1)$8$124 $52$40Derivative assets (FVA) (2)3434 ——Derivative liabilities (DVA) (3)23(46) (82)(85)Derivative liabilities (FVA) (2)(28)(28) ——(1) At both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the cumulative CVA reduced the derivative assets balance by $1.6 billion.(2) At March 31, 2015, the cumulative FVA reduced the net derivatives balances by $491 million.

Substantially all OTTI losses in the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 consisted of credit losses on non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and were recorded in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The credit losses on the RMBS during the three months ended March 31, 2015 were driven by decreases in the estimated RMBS cash flows primarily due to a model change resulting in the refinement of the expected cash flows. A debt security is impaired when its fair value is less than its amortized cost. If the Corporation intends or will more-likely-than-not be required to sell a debt security prior to recovery, the entire impairment loss is recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income. For AFS debt securities the Corporation does not intend or will not more-likely-than-not be required  142Table of Contentsto sell, an analysis is performed to determine if any of the impairment is due to credit or whether it is due to other factors (e.g., interest rate). Credit losses are considered unrecoverable and are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income with the remaining unrealized losses recorded in OCI. In certain instances, the credit loss on a debt security may exceed the total impairment, in which case, the excess of the credit loss over the total impairment is recorded as an unrealized gain in OCI.Net Credit-related Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings Three Months Ended March 31(Dollars in millions)2015 2014Total OTTI losses$(74) $(1)Less: non-credit portion of total OTTI losses recognized in OCI4 —Net credit-related impairment credit losses recognized in earnings$(70) $(1)The table below presents a rollforward of the credit losses recognized in earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 on AFS debt securities that the Corporation does not have the intent to sell or will not more-likely-than-not be required to sell.Rollforward of OTTI Credit Losses Recognized Three Months Ended March 31(Dollars in millions)2015 2014Balance, beginning of period$201 $184Additions for credit losses recognized on AFS debt securities that had no previous impairment losses14 —Additions for credit losses recognized on AFS debt securities that had previously incurred impairment losses56 1Reductions for AFS debt securities matured, sold or intended to be sold(15) —Balance, March 31$256 $185The Corporation estimates the portion of a loss on a security that is attributable to credit using a discounted cash flow model and estimates the expected cash flows of the underlying collateral using internal credit, interest rate and prepayment risk models that incorporate management's best estimate of current key assumptions such as default rates, loss severity and prepayment rates. Assumptions used for the underlying loans that support the MBS can vary widely from loan to loan and are influenced by such factors as loan interest rate, geographic location of the borrower, borrower characteristics and collateral type. Based on these assumptions, the Corporation then determines how the underlying collateral cash flows will be distributed to each MBS issued from the applicable special purpose entity. Expected principal and interest cash flows on an impaired AFS debt security are discounted using the effective yield of each individual impaired AFS debt security.Significant assumptions used in estimating the expected cash flows for measuring credit losses on non-agency RMBS were as follows at March 31, 2015.Significant Assumptions   Range (1) Weighted-average 10th Percentile (2) 90th Percentile (2)Annual prepayment speed11.8% 3.5% 23.7%Loss severity40.8 13.8 51.2Life default rate36.3 1.5 97.6(1) Represents the range of inputs/assumptions based upon the underlying collateral.(2) The value of a variable below which the indicated percentile of observations will fall.Annual constant prepayment speed and loss severity rates are projected considering collateral characteristics such as loan-to-value (LTV), creditworthiness of borrowers as measured using FICO scores, and geographic concentrations. The weighted-average severity by collateral type was 37.7 percent for prime, 39.2 percent for Alt-A and 52.4 percent for subprime at March 31, 2015. Additionally, default rates are projected by considering collateral characteristics including, but not limited to, LTV, FICO and geographic concentration. Weighted-average life default rates by collateral type were 22.9 percent for prime, 38.5 percent for Alt-A and 39.6 percent for subprime at March 31, 2015. 143Table of ContentsThe expected maturity distribution of the Corporation's MBS, the contractual maturity distribution of the Corporation's other debt securities carried at fair value and HTM debt securities, and the yields on the Corporation's debt securities carried at fair value and HTM debt securities at March 31, 2015 are summarized in the table below.

For additional information, see Note 14 – Fair Value Measurements and Note 15 – Fair Value Option.(10) Total outstandings includes U.S. commercial real estate loans of $45.2 billion and non-U.S. commercial real estate loans of $2.5 billion.The Corporation has entered into long-term credit protection agreements with FNMA and FHLMC on loans totaling $12.3 billion and $17.2 billion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, providing full credit protection on residential mortgage loans that become severely delinquent. All of these loans are individually insured and therefore the Corporation does not record an allowance for credit losses related to these loans.Nonperforming Loans and LeasesThe Corporation classifies junior-lien home equity loans as nonperforming when the first-lien loan becomes 90 days past due even if the junior-lien loan is performing. At March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, $657 million and $800 million of such junior-lien home equity loans were included in nonperforming loans. 146Table of ContentsThe Corporation classifies consumer real estate loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), irrespective of payment history or delinquency status, even if the repayment terms for the loan have not been otherwise modified. The Corporation continues to have a lien on the underlying collateral. At March 31, 2015, nonperforming loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy with no change in repayment terms were $1.1 billion of which $660 million were current on their contractual payments, while $354 million were 90 days or more past due. Of the contractually current nonperforming loans, nearly 80 percent were discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy more than 12 months ago, and more than 60 percent were discharged 24 months or more ago. As subsequent cash payments are received on these nonperforming loans that are contractually current, the interest component of the payments is generally recorded as interest income on a cash basis and the principal component is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the loan. During the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, the Corporation sold nonperforming and other delinquent consumer real estate loans with a carrying value of $1.0 billion and $730 million, including $586 million and $454 million of purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, the Corporation recorded recoveries of $40 million and gains on sale of $35 million in noninterest income related to these transactions. Gains recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2014 were immaterial.The table below presents the Corporation's nonperforming loans and leases including nonperforming TDRs, and loans accruing past due 90 days or more at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Nonperforming loans held-for-sale (LHFS) are excluded from nonperforming loans and leases as they are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. For more information on the criteria for classification as nonperforming, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Credit Quality        Nonperforming Loans and Leases (1) Accruing Past Due 90 Days or More(Dollars in millions)March 31 2015 December 31 2014 March 31 2015 December 31 2014Consumer real estate       Core portfolio       Residential mortgage (2)$2,278 $2,398 $3,573 $3,942Home equity1,473 1,496 — —Legacy Assets & Servicing portfolio       Residential mortgage (2)4,143 4,491 6,339 7,465Home equity2,286 2,405 — —Credit card and other consumer       U.S. credit cardn/a n/a 795 866Non-U.S. credit cardn/a n/a 88 95Direct/Indirect consumer28 28 51 64Other consumer1 1 1 1Total consumer10,209 10,819 10,847 12,433Commercial       U.S. commercial680 701 22 110Commercial real estate132 321 25 3Commercial lease financing16 3 9 41Non-U.S. commercial79 1 — —U.S. small business commercial89 87 65 67Total commercial996 1,113 121 221Total loans and leases$11,205 $11,932 $10,968 $12,654(1) Nonperforming loan balances do not include nonaccruing TDRs removed from the PCI loan portfolio prior to January 1, 2010 of $86 million and $102 million at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.(2) Residential mortgage loans in the Core and Legacy Assets & Servicing portfolios accruing past due 90 days or more are fully-insured loans. At March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, residential mortgage includes $6.2 billion and $7.3 billion of loans on which interest has been curtailed by the FHA, and therefore are no longer accruing interest, although principal is still insured, and $3.7 billion and $4.1 billion of loans on which interest is still accruing.n/a = not applicable 147Table of ContentsCredit Quality IndicatorsThe Corporation monitors credit quality within its Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio segments based on primary credit quality indicators. For more information on the portfolio segments, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment, the primary credit quality indicators are refreshed LTV and refreshed FICO score. Refreshed LTV measures the carrying value of the loan as a percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. Home equity loans are evaluated using combined loan-to-value (CLTV) which measures the carrying value of the combined loans that have liens against the property and the available line of credit as a percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. FICO score measures the creditworthiness of the borrower based on the financial obligations of the borrower and the borrower's credit history. At a minimum, FICO scores are refreshed quarterly, and in many cases, more frequently. FICO scores are also a primary credit quality indicator for the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment and the business card portfolio within U.S. small business commercial. Within the Commercial portfolio segment, loans are evaluated using the internal classifications of pass rated or reservable criticized as the primary credit quality indicators. The term reservable criticized refers to those commercial loans that are internally classified or listed by the Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful, which are asset quality categories defined by regulatory authorities. These assets have an elevated level of risk and may have a high probability of default or total loss. Pass rated refers to all loans not considered reservable criticized. In addition to these primary credit quality indicators, the Corporation uses other credit quality indicators for certain types of loans. 148Table of ContentsThe following tables present certain credit quality indicators for the Corporation's Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio segments, by class of financing receivables, at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.Consumer Real Estate – Credit Quality Indicators (1)       March 31, 2015(Dollars in millions)Core Portfolio Residential Mortgage (2)Legacy Assets & Servicing Residential Mortgage (2)ResidentialMortgage PCI (3)Core Portfolio Home Equity (2)Legacy Assets & Servicing Home Equity (2)Home Equity PCIRefreshed LTV (4)      Less than or equal to 90 percent$101,243$17,772$9,050$44,705$16,671$1,868Greater than 90 percent but less than or equal to 100 percent5,0042,9381,9252,3473,124960Greater than 100 percent4,1775,0953,2103,9777,3932,526Fully-insured loans (5)46,46411,047————Total consumer real estate$156,888$36,852$14,185$51,029$27,188$5,354       Refreshed FICO score      Less than 620$4,122$5,988$5,350$2,158$3,352$812Greater than or equal to 620 and less than 6806,1423,9062,9053,6134,434953Greater than or equal to 680 and less than 74022,0026,2313,28810,0677,6141,578Greater than or equal to 74078,1589,6802,64235,19111,7882,011Fully-insured loans (5)46,46411,047————Total consumer real estate$156,888$36,852$14,185$51,029$27,188$5,354(1) Excludes $2.1 billion of loans accounted for under the fair value option.(2) Excludes PCI loans.(3) Includes $2.5 billion of pay option loans.

Impaired loans include nonperforming commercial loans and all consumer and commercial TDRs. Impaired loans exclude nonperforming consumer loans and nonperforming commercial leases unless they are classified as TDRs. Loans accounted for under the fair value option are also excluded. PCI loans are excluded and reported separately on page 161. For additional information, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Consumer Real EstateImpaired consumer real estate loans within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment consist entirely of TDRs. Excluding PCI loans, most modifications of consumer real estate loans meet the definition of TDRs when a binding offer is extended to a borrower. Modifications of consumer real estate loans are done in accordance with the government's Making Home Affordable Program (modifications under government programs) or the Corporation's proprietary programs (modifications under proprietary programs). These modifications are considered to be TDRs if concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Concessions may include reductions in interest rates, capitalization of past due amounts, principal and/or interest forbearance, payment extensions, principal and/or interest forgiveness, or combinations thereof.Prior to permanently modifying a loan, the Corporation may enter into trial modifications with certain borrowers under both government and proprietary programs. Trial modifications generally represent a three- to four-month period during which the borrower makes monthly payments under the anticipated modified payment terms. Upon successful completion of the trial period, the Corporation and the borrower enter into a permanent modification. Binding trial modifications are classified as TDRs when the trial offer is made and continue to be classified as TDRs regardless of whether the borrower enters into a permanent modification.Consumer real estate loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy with no change in repayment terms of $2.3 billion were included in TDRs at March 31, 2015, of which $1.1 billion were classified as nonperforming and $996 million were loans fully-insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). For more information on loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, see Nonperforming Loans and Leases in this Note.A consumer real estate loan, excluding PCI loans which are reported separately, is not classified as impaired unless it is a TDR. Once such a loan has been designated as a TDR, it is then individually assessed for impairment. Consumer real estate TDRs are measured primarily based on the net present value of the estimated cash flows discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate, as discussed in the following paragraph. If the carrying value of a TDR exceeds this amount, a specific allowance is recorded as a component of the allowance for loan and lease losses. Alternatively, consumer real estate TDRs that are considered to be dependent solely on the collateral for repayment (e.g., due to the lack of income verification) are measured based on the estimated fair value of the collateral and a charge-off is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the collateral. Consumer real estate loans that reached 180 days past due prior to modification had been charged off to their net realizable value, less costs to sell, before they were modified as TDRs in accordance with established policy. Therefore, modifications of consumer real estate loans that are 180 or more days past due as TDRs do not have an impact on the allowance for loan and lease losses nor are additional charge-offs required at the time of modification. Subsequent declines in the fair value of the collateral after a loan has reached 180 days past due are recorded as charge-offs. Fully-insured loans are protected against principal loss, and therefore, the Corporation does not record an allowance for loan and lease losses on the outstanding principal balance, even after they have been modified in a TDR. 151Table of ContentsThe net present value of the estimated cash flows used to measure impairment is based on model-driven estimates of projected payments, prepayments, defaults and loss-given-default (LGD). Using statistical modeling methodologies, the Corporation estimates the probability that a loan will default prior to maturity based on the attributes of each loan. The factors that are most relevant to the probability of default are the refreshed LTV, or in the case of a subordinated lien, refreshed CLTV, borrower credit score, months since origination (i.e., vintage) and geography. Each of these factors is further broken down by present collection status (whether the loan is current, delinquent, in default or in bankruptcy). Severity (or LGD) is estimated based on the refreshed LTV for first mortgages or CLTV for subordinated liens. The estimates are based on the Corporation's historical experience as adjusted to reflect an assessment of environmental factors that may not be reflected in the historical data, such as changes in real estate values, local and national economies, underwriting standards and the regulatory environment. The probability of default models also incorporate recent experience with modification programs including redefaults subsequent to modification, a loan's default history prior to modification and the change in borrower payments post-modification.At March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, remaining commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose terms have been modified in a consumer real estate TDR were immaterial. Consumer real estate foreclosed properties totaled $632 million and $630 million at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The carrying value of consumer real estate loans, including fully-insured and PCI loans, for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process as of March 31, 2015 was $6.9 billion. The table below provides the unpaid principal balance, carrying value and related allowance at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, and the average carrying value and interest income recognized for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 for impaired loans in the Corporation's Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment and includes primarily loans managed by LAS. Certain impaired consumer real estate loans do not have a related allowance as the current valuation of these impaired loans exceeded the carrying value, which is net of previously recorded charge-offs.Impaired Loans – Consumer Real Estate                        Three Months Ended March 31   March 31, 2015 2015 2014(Dollars in millions)  UnpaidPrincipalBalance CarryingValue RelatedAllowance AverageCarryingValue InterestIncomeRecognized (1) AverageCarryingValue InterestIncomeRecognized (1)With no recorded allowance               Residential mortgage  $18,524 $14,662 $— $15,393 $108 $16,360 $160Home equity  3,636 1,705 — 1,692 25 1,401 22With an allowance recorded               Residential mortgage  $8,058 $7,892 $537 $7,586 $64 $12,332 $131Home equity  861 732 190 714 7 751 8Total               Residential mortgage  $26,582 $22,554 $537 $22,979 $172 $28,692 $291Home equity  4,497 2,437 190 2,406 32 2,152 30                   December 31, 2014        With no recorded allowance               Residential mortgage  $19,710 $15,605 $—        Home equity  3,540 1,630 —        With an allowance recorded               Residential mortgage  $7,861 $7,665 $531        Home equity  852 728 196        Total               Residential mortgage  $27,571 $23,270 $531        Home equity  4,392 2,358 196        (1) Interest income recognized includes interest accrued and collected on the outstanding balances of accruing impaired loans as well as interest cash collections on nonaccruing impaired loans for which the principal is considered collectible. 152Table of ContentsThe table below presents the March 31, 2015 and 2014 unpaid principal balance, carrying value, and average pre- and post-modification interest rates on consumer real estate loans that were modified in TDRs during the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, and net charge-offs recorded during the period in which the modification occurred.

A payment default for consumer real estate TDRs is recognized when a borrower has missed three monthly payments (not necessarily consecutively) since modification. Payment defaults on a trial modification where the borrower has not yet met the terms of the agreement are included in the table below if the borrower is 90 days or more past due three months after the offer to modify is made.Consumer Real Estate – TDRs Entering Payment Default That Were Modified During the Preceding 12 Months Three Months Ended March 31, 2015(Dollars in millions) Residential Mortgage HomeEquity Total Carrying ValueModifications under government programs$107 $1 $108Modifications under proprietary programs40 12 52Loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy (1)71 10 81Trial modifications (2)1,768 24 1,792Total modifications$1,986 $47 $2,033       Three Months Ended March 31, 2014Modifications under government programs$158 $1 $159Modifications under proprietary programs272 — 272Loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy (1)121 1 122Trial modifications775 3 778Total modifications$1,326 $5 $1,331(1) Includes loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy with no change in repayment terms that are classified as TDRs.(2) Includes $1.4 billion of trial modification offers made in connection with the August 2014 Department of Justice settlement to which the customer has not responded.Credit Card and Other ConsumerImpaired loans within the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment consist entirely of loans that have been modified in TDRs (the renegotiated credit card and other consumer TDR portfolio, collectively referred to as the renegotiated TDR portfolio). The Corporation seeks to assist customers that are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying loans while ensuring compliance with federal, local and international laws and guidelines. Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months, all of which are considered TDRs. In addition, the accounts of non-U.S. credit card customers who do not qualify for a fixed payment plan may have their interest rates reduced, as required by certain local jurisdictions. These modifications, which are also TDRs, tend to experience higher payment default rates given that the borrowers may lack the ability to repay even with the interest rate reduction. In all cases, the customer's available line of credit is canceled. The Corporation makes loan modifications directly with borrowers for debt held only by the Corporation (internal programs). Additionally, the Corporation makes loan modifications for borrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies that provide solutions to customers' entire unsecured debt structures (external programs). The Corporation classifies other secured consumer loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy as TDRs which are written down to collateral value and placed on nonaccrual status no later than the time of discharge. For more information on the regulatory guidance on loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, see Nonperforming Loans and Leases in this Note.All credit card and substantially all other consumer loans that have been modified in TDRs remain on accrual status until the loan is either paid in full or charged off, which occurs no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due or generally at 120 days past due for a loan that has been placed on a fixed payment plan.The allowance for impaired credit card and substantially all other consumer loans is based on the present value of projected cash flows, which incorporates the Corporation's historical payment default and loss experience on modified loans, discounted using the portfolio's average contractual interest rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring. Credit card and other consumer loans are included in homogeneous pools which are collectively evaluated for impairment. For these portfolios, loss forecast models are utilized that consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, delinquency status, economic trends and credit scores. 155Table of ContentsThe table below provides the unpaid principal balance, carrying value and related allowance at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, and the average carrying value and

default during the quarter in which a borrower misses the second of two consecutive payments. Payment defaults are one of the factors considered when projecting future cash flows in the calculation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for impaired credit card and other consumer loans. Based on historical experience, the Corporation estimates that 14 percent of new U.S. credit card TDRs, 83 percent of new non-U.S. credit card TDRs and 12 percent of new direct/indirect consumer TDRs may be in payment default within 12 months after modification. Loans that entered into payment default during the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 that had been modified in a TDR during the preceding 12 months were $12 million and $13 million for U.S. credit card, $41 million and $56 million for non-U.S. credit card, and $1 million and $2 million for direct/indirect consumer. 157Table of ContentsCommercial LoansImpaired commercial loans, which include nonperforming loans and TDRs (both performing and nonperforming), are primarily measured based on the present value of payments expected to be received, discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate. Commercial impaired loans may also be measured based on observable market prices or, for loans that are solely dependent on the collateral for repayment, the estimated fair value of collateral, less costs to sell. If the carrying value of a loan exceeds this amount, a specific allowance is recorded as a component of the allowance for loan and lease losses.Modifications of loans to commercial borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty are designed to reduce the Corporation's loss exposure while providing the borrower with an opportunity to work through financial difficulties, often to avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy. Each modification is unique and reflects the individual circumstances of the borrower. Modifications that result in a TDR may include extensions of maturity at a concessionary (below market) rate of interest, payment forbearances or other actions designed to benefit the customer while mitigating the Corporation's risk exposure. Reductions in interest rates are rare. Instead, the interest rates are typically increased, although the increased rate may not represent a market rate of interest. Infrequently, concessions may also include principal forgiveness in connection with foreclosure, short sale or other settlement agreements leading to termination or sale of the loan.At the time of restructuring, the loans are remeasured to reflect the impact, if any, on projected cash flows resulting from the modified terms. If there was no forgiveness of principal and the interest rate was not decreased, the modification may have little or no impact on the allowance established for the loan. If a portion of the loan is deemed to be uncollectible, a charge-off may be recorded at the time of restructuring. Alternatively, a charge-off may have already been recorded in a previous period such that no charge-off is required at the time of modification. For more information on modifications for the U.S. small business commercial portfolio, see Credit Card and Other Consumer in this Note.At March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, remaining commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose terms have been modified in a commercial loan TDR were immaterial.

Payment defaults are one of the factors considered when projecting future cash flows, along with observable market prices or fair value of collateral when measuring the allowance for loan and lease losses. TDRs that were in payment default had a carrying value of $110 million and $95 million for U.S. commercial and $60 million and $121 million for commercial real estate at March 31, 2015 and 2014. 160Table of ContentsPurchased Credit-impaired LoansThe table below shows activity for the accretable yield on PCI loans, which includes the Countrywide Financial Corporation (Countrywide) portfolio and loans repurchased in connection with the settlement with FNMA. For more information on the settlement with FNMA, see Note 7 – Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The amount of accretable yield is affected by changes in credit outlooks, including metrics such as default rates and loss severities, prepayment speeds, which can change the amount and period of time over which interest payments are expected to be received, and the interest rates on variable rate loans. The reclassifications from nonaccretable difference during 2014 were due to lower expected loss rates and a decrease in forecasted prepayment speeds. The reclassifications to nonaccretable difference in the three months ended March 31, 2015 were due to an increase in forecasted prepayment speeds as a result of lower interest rates. Changes in the prepayment assumption affect the expected remaining life of the portfolio which results in a change to the amount of future interest cash flows.Rollforward of Accretable Yield(Dollars in millions) Accretable yield, January 1, 2014$6,694Accretion(1,061)Disposals/transfers(506)Reclassifications from nonaccretable difference481Accretable yield, December 31, 20145,608Accretion(233)Disposals/transfers(136)Reclassifications to nonaccretable difference(72)Accretable yield, March 31, 2015$5,167During the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, the Corporation sold PCI loans with a carrying value of $586 million and $454 million, excluding the related allowance of $110 million and $158 million.

Cash and non-cash proceeds from sales and paydowns of loans originally classified as LHFS were $11.6 billion and $8.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014. Cash used for originations and purchases of LHFS totaled $10.6 billion and $10.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014. 161Table of ContentsNOTE 5 – Allowance for Credit LossesThe table below summarizes the changes in the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014.

This compared to no provision for credit losses in the same period in 2014. Write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio totaled $288 million with a corresponding decrease in the PCI valuation allowance during the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $391 million for the same period in 2014. Write-offs included $110 million associated with the sale of PCI loans during the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $158 million for the same period in 2014. The valuation allowance associated with the PCI loan portfolio was $1.3 billion and $1.7 billion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. 162Table of ContentsThe table below presents the allowance and the carrying value of outstanding loans and leases by portfolio segment at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.Allowance and Carrying Value by Portfolio Segment        March 31, 2015(Dollars in millions)Consumer Real Estate Credit Cardand OtherConsumer Commercial TotalImpaired loans and troubled debt restructurings (1)       Allowance for loan and lease losses (2)$727 $314 $155 $1,196Carrying value (3)24,991 1,020 1,995 28,006Allowance as a percentage of carrying value2.91% 30.78% 7.77% 4.27%Loans collectively evaluated for impairment       Allowance for loan and lease losses$3,209 $3,615 $4,342 $11,166Carrying value (3, 4)246,966 179,911 395,068 821,945Allowance as a percentage of carrying value (4)1.30% 2.01% 1.10% 1.36%Purchased credit-impaired loans       Valuation allowance$1,314 n/a n/a $1,314Carrying value gross of valuation allowance19,539 n/a n/a 19,539Valuation allowance as a percentage of carrying value6.73% n/a n/a 6.73%Total       Allowance for loan and lease losses$5,250 $3,929 $4,497 $13,676Carrying value (3, 4)291,496 180,931 397,063 869,490Allowance as a percentage of carrying value (4)1.80% 2.17% 1.13% 1.57%         December 31, 2014Impaired loans and troubled debt restructurings (1)       Allowance for loan and lease losses (2)$727 $339 $159 $1,225Carrying value (3)25,628 1,141 2,198 28,967Allowance as a percentage of carrying value2.84% 29.71% 7.23% 4.23%Loans collectively evaluated for impairment       Allowance for loan and lease losses$3,556 $3,708 $4,278 $11,542Carrying value (3, 4)255,525 183,430 384,019 822,974Allowance as a percentage of carrying value (4)1.39% 2.02% 1.11% 1.40%Purchased credit-impaired loans       Valuation allowance$1,652 n/a n/a $1,652Carrying value gross of valuation allowance20,769 n/a n/a 20,769Valuation allowance as a percentage of carrying value7.95% n/a n/a 7.95%Total       Allowance for loan and lease losses$5,935 $4,047 $4,437 $14,419Carrying value (3, 4)301,922 184,571 386,217 872,710Allowance as a percentage of carrying value (4)1.97% 2.19% 1.15% 1.65%(1) Impaired loans include nonperforming commercial loans and all TDRs, including both commercial and consumer TDRs.

The Corporation routinely securitizes loans and debt securities using VIEs as a source of funding for the Corporation and as a means of transferring the economic risk of the loans or debt securities to third parties. The assets are transferred into a trust or other securitization vehicle such that the assets are legally isolated from the creditors of the Corporation and are not available to satisfy its obligations. These assets can only be used to settle obligations of the trust or other securitization vehicle. The Corporation also administers, structures or invests in other VIEs including CDOs, investment vehicles and other entities. For more information on the Corporation's utilization of VIEs, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 6 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The tables in this Note present the assets and liabilities of consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, in situations where the Corporation has continuing involvement with transferred assets or if the Corporation otherwise has a variable interest in the VIE. The tables also present the Corporation's maximum loss exposure at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 resulting from its involvement with consolidated VIEs and unconsolidated VIEs in which the Corporation holds a variable interest. The Corporation's maximum loss exposure is based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and incorporates not only potential losses associated with assets recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but also potential losses associated with off-balance sheet commitments such as unfunded liquidity commitments and other contractual arrangements. The Corporation's maximum loss exposure does not include losses previously recognized through write-downs of assets.The Corporation invests in asset-backed securities (ABS) issued by third-party VIEs with which it has no other form of involvement. These securities are included in Note 3 – Securities and Note 14 – Fair Value Measurements. In addition, the Corporation uses VIEs such as trust preferred securities trusts in connection with its funding activities. For additional information, see Note 11 – Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Corporation uses VIEs, such as cash funds managed within Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), to provide investment opportunities for clients. These VIEs, which are not consolidated by the Corporation, are not included in the tables in this Note.Except as described below and in Note 6 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Corporation did not provide financial support to consolidated or unconsolidated VIEs during the three months ended March 31, 2015 or the year ended December 31, 2014 that it was not previously contractually required to provide, nor does it intend to do so.Mortgage-related SecuritizationsFirst-lien MortgagesAs part of its mortgage banking activities, the Corporation securitizes a portion of the first-lien residential mortgage loans it originates or purchases from third parties, generally in the form of RMBS guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises, FNMA and FHLMC (collectively the GSEs), or GNMA primarily in the case of FHA-insured and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed mortgage loans. Securitization usually occurs in conjunction with or shortly after origination or purchase and the Corporation may also securitize loans held in its residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, the Corporation may, from time to time, securitize commercial mortgages it originates or purchases from other entities. The Corporation typically services the loans it securitizes. Further, the Corporation may retain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts including senior and subordinate securities and equity tranches issued by the trusts. Except as described below and in Note 7 – Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees, the Corporation does not provide guarantees or recourse to the securitization trusts other than standard representations and warranties. 164Table of ContentsThe table below summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage securitizations for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014.First-lien Mortgage Securitizations   Three Months Ended March 31 Residential Mortgage  Agency Commercial Mortgage(Dollars in millions)20152014 20152014Cash proceeds from new securitizations (1)$7,571$7,466 $2,156$704Gain (loss) on securitizations (2)173(11) (7)27(1) The Corporation transfers residential mortgage loans to securitizations sponsored by the GSEs or GNMA in the normal course of business and receives RMBS in exchange which may then be sold into the market to third-party investors for cash proceeds.(2) A majority of the first-lien residential and commercial mortgage loans securitized are initially classified as LHFS and accounted for under the fair value option. Gains recognized on these LHFS prior to securitization, which totaled $169 million and $198 million, net of hedges, during the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, are not included in the table above.In addition to cash proceeds as reported in the table above, the Corporation received securities with an initial fair value of $5.4 billion and $506 million in connection with first-lien mortgage securitizations for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014. All of these securities were initially classified as Level 2 assets within the fair value hierarchy. During the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no changes to the initial classification.The Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization of first-lien mortgage loans. Servicing fee and ancillary fee income on consumer mortgage loans serviced, including securitizations where the Corporation has continuing involvement, were $389 million and $494 million during the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014. Servicing advances on consumer mortgage loans, including securitizations where the Corporation has continuing involvement, were $9.6 billion and $10.4 billion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The Corporation may have the option to repurchase delinquent loans out of securitization trusts, which reduces the amount of servicing advances it is required to make. During the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion of loans were repurchased from first-lien securitization trusts primarily as a result of loan delinquencies or to perform modifications. The majority of these loans repurchased were FHA-insured mortgages collateralizing GNMA securities. For more information on MSRs, see Note 17 – Mortgage Servicing Rights. 165Table of ContentsThe table below summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage securitization trusts in which the Corporation held a variable interest at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.First-lien Mortgage VIEs        Residential Mortgage      Non-agency   Agency Prime Subprime Alt-A Commercial Mortgage(Dollars in millions)March 31 2015December 31 2014 March 31 2015December 31 2014 March 31 2015December 31 2014 March 31 2015December 31 2014 March 31 2015December 31 2014Unconsolidated VIEs              Maximum loss exposure (1)$19,523$14,918 $1,223$1,288 $3,089$3,167 $654$710 $324$352On-balance sheet assets              Senior securities held (2):              Trading account assets$526$584 $3$3 $25$14 $49$81 $79$54Debt securities carried at fair value18,17813,473 755816 2,7162,811 378383 1476Held-to-maturity securities796837 —— —— —— 3742Subordinate securities held (2):              Trading account assets—— —— 18— 21 3958Debt securities carried at fair value—— 1112 45 —— 5558Held-to-maturity securities—— —— —— —— 1315Residual interests held—— 1210 —— —— 4122All other assets (3)2324 5156 11 225245 ——Total retained positions$19,523$14,918 $832$897 $2,764$2,831 $654$710 $278$325Principal balance outstanding (4)$386,169$397,055 $19,304$20,167 $31,601$32,592 $48,208$50,054 $25,034$20,593               Consolidated VIEs              Maximum loss exposure (1)$36,644$38,345 $76$77 $197$206 $—$— $—$—On-balance sheet assets              Trading account assets$1,099$1,538 $—$— $29$30 $—$— $—$—Loans and leases34,73436,187 128130 767768 —— ——Allowance for loan and lease losses(2)(2) —— —— —— ——All other assets815623 66 1415 —— ——Total assets$36,646$38,346 $134$136 $810$813 $—$— $—$—On-balance sheet liabilities              Long-term debt$2$1 $55$56 $770$770 $—$— $—$—All other liabilities1— 33 1113 —— ——Total liabilities$3$1 $58$59 $781$783 $—$— $—$—(1) Maximum loss exposure excludes the liability for representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees and also excludes servicing advances and other servicing rights and obligations.

During the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no OTTI losses recorded on those securities classified as AFS debt securities.(3) Not included in the table above are all other assets of $365 million and $635 million, representing the unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans eligible for repurchase from unconsolidated residential mortgage securitization vehicles, principally guaranteed by GNMA, and all other liabilities of $365 million and $635 million, representing the principal amount that would be payable to the securitization vehicles if the Corporation was to exercise the repurchase option, at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.(4) Principal balance outstanding includes loans the Corporation transferred with which it has continuing involvement, which may include servicing the loans. 166Table of ContentsHome Equity LoansThe Corporation retains interests in home equity securitization trusts to which it transferred home equity loans. These retained interests include senior and subordinate securities and residual interests. In addition, the Corporation may be obligated to provide subordinate funding to the trusts during a rapid amortization event. The Corporation typically services the loans in the trusts. Except as described below and in Note 7 – Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees, the Corporation does not provide guarantees or recourse to the securitization trusts other than standard representations and warranties. There were no securitizations of home equity loans during the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, and all of the home equity trusts that hold revolving home equity lines of credit have entered the rapid amortization phase.The table below summarizes select information related to home equity loan securitization trusts in which the Corporation held a variable interest at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.Home Equity Loan VIEs     March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014(Dollars in millions)ConsolidatedVIEs UnconsolidatedVIEs Total ConsolidatedVIEs UnconsolidatedVIEs TotalMaximum loss exposure (1)$942 $5,061 $6,003 $991 $5,224 $6,215On-balance sheet assets           Trading account assets$— $47 $47 $— $14 $14Debt securities carried at fair value— 44 44 — 39 39Loans and leases954 — 954 1,014 — 1,014Allowance for loan and lease losses(52) — (52) (56) — (56)All other assets40 — 40 33 — 33Total$942 $91 $1,033 $991 $53 $1,044On-balance sheet liabilities           Long-term debt$995 $— $995 $1,076 $— $1,076Total$995 $— $995 $1,076 $— $1,076Principal balance outstanding$954 $6,133 $7,087 $1,014 $6,362 $7,376(1) For unconsolidated VIEs, the maximum loss exposure includes outstanding trust certificates issued by trusts in rapid amortization, net of recorded reserves, and excludes the liability for representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees.The maximum loss exposure in the table above includes the Corporation's obligation to provide subordinated funding to the consolidated and unconsolidated home equity loan securitizations that have entered a rapid amortization period. During this period, cash payments from borrowers are accumulated to repay outstanding debt securities and the Corporation continues to make advances to borrowers when they draw on their lines of credit. At March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, home equity loan securitizations in rapid amortization for which the Corporation has a subordinated funding obligation, including both consolidated and unconsolidated trusts, had $6.0 billion and $6.3 billion of trust certificates outstanding. This amount is significantly greater than the amount the Corporation expects to fund. The charges that will ultimately be recorded as a result of the rapid amortization events depend on the undrawn available credit on the home equity lines, which totaled $36 million and $39 million at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, as well as performance of the loans, the amount of subsequent draws and the timing of related cash flows. 167Table of ContentsCredit Card SecuritizationsThe Corporation securitizes originated and purchased credit card loans. The Corporation's continuing involvement with the securitization trust includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided interest (seller's interest) in the receivables, and holding certain retained interests including senior and subordinate securities, subordinate interests in accrued interest and fees on the securitized receivables, and cash reserve accounts. The seller's interest in the trust, which is pari passu to the investors' interest, is classified in loans and leases.The table below summarizes select information related to consolidated credit card securitization trusts in which the Corporation held a variable interest at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.Credit Card VIEs   (Dollars in millions)March 31 2015 December 31 2014Consolidated VIEs   Maximum loss exposure$38,996 $43,139On-balance sheet assets   Derivative assets$— $1Loans and leases (1)49,927 53,068Allowance for loan and lease losses(1,810) (1,904)All other assets (2)389 391Total$48,506 $51,556On-balance sheet liabilities   Long-term debt$9,484 $8,401All other liabilities26 16Total$9,510 $8,417(1) At March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, loans and leases included $31.1 billion and $36.9 billion of seller's interest.(2) At March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, all other assets included restricted cash, certain short-term investments, and unbilled accrued interest and fees.During the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, $1.1 billion and $1.8 billion of new senior debt securities were issued to third-party investors from the credit card securitization trust.The Corporation held subordinate securities issued by the credit card securitization trust with a notional principal amount of $7.5 billion and $7.4 billion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. These securities serve as a form of credit enhancement to the senior debt securities and have a stated interest rate of zero percent. There were $178 million and $282 million of these subordinate securities issued during the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014. 168Table of ContentsOther Asset-backed SecuritizationsOther asset-backed securitizations include resecuritization trusts, municipal bond trusts, and automobile and other securitization trusts.

The Corporation may also resecuritize securities within its investment portfolio for purposes of improving liquidity and capital, and managing credit or interest rate risk. Generally, there are no significant ongoing activities performed in a resecuritization trust and no single investor has the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust.The Corporation resecuritized $6.1 billion and $2.3 billion of securities during the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014. Securities transferred into resecuritization vehicles during the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 were classified as trading account assets. As such, changes in fair value were recorded in trading account profits prior to the resecuritization and no gain or loss on sale was recorded.Municipal Bond TrustsThe Corporation administers municipal bond trusts that hold highly-rated, long-term, fixed-rate municipal bonds. The trusts obtain financing by issuing floating-rate trust certificates that reprice on a weekly or other short-term basis to third-party investors. The Corporation may transfer assets into the trusts and may also serve as remarketing agent and/or liquidity provider for the trusts. The floating-rate investors have the right to tender the certificates at specified dates. Should the Corporation be unable to remarket the tendered certificates, it may be obligated to purchase them at par under standby liquidity facilities. The Corporation also provides credit enhancement to investors in certain municipal bond trusts whereby the Corporation guarantees the payment of interest and principal on floating-rate certificates issued by these trusts in the event of default by the issuer of the underlying municipal bond.The Corporation's liquidity commitments to unconsolidated municipal bond trusts, including those for which the Corporation was transferor, totaled $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The weighted-average remaining life of bonds held in the trusts at March 31, 2015 was seven years. There were no material write-downs or downgrades of assets or issuers during the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014.Automobile and Other Securitization TrustsThe Corporation transfers automobile and other loans into securitization trusts, typically to improve liquidity or manage credit risk. At March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Corporation serviced assets or otherwise had continuing involvement with automobile and other securitization trusts with outstanding balances of $1.1 billion and $1.9 billion, including trusts collateralized by automobile loans of $313 million and $400 million, student loans of $549 million and $609 million, and other loans of $209 million and $876 million. 170Table of ContentsOther Variable Interest EntitiesThe table below summarizes select information related to other VIEs in which the Corporation held a variable interest at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.Other VIEs            March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014(Dollars in millions)Consolidated Unconsolidated Total Consolidated Unconsolidated TotalMaximum loss exposure$6,731 $11,392 $18,123 $7,981 $12,391 $20,372On-balance sheet assets           Trading account assets$1,520 $376 $1,896 $1,575 $355 $1,930Derivative assets5 298 303 5 284 289Debt securities carried at fair value— 188 188 — 483 483Loans and leases3,261 2,413 5,674 4,020 2,693 6,713Allowance for loan and lease losses(5) — (5) (6) — (6)Loans held-for-sale731 667 1,398 1,267 814 2,081All other assets1,629 6,239 7,868 1,641 6,374 8,015Total$7,141 $10,181 $17,322 $8,502 $11,003 $19,505On-balance sheet liabilities           Long-term debt (1)$1,845 $— $1,845 $1,834 $— $1,834All other liabilities81 2,579 2,660 105 2,643 2,748Total$1,926 $2,579 $4,505 $1,939 $2,643 $4,582Total assets of VIEs$7,141 $36,968 $44,109 $8,502 $41,467 $49,969(1)Includes $780 million and $705 million of long-term debt at March 31, 2015 and $780 million and $584 million of long-term debt at December 31, 2014 issued by consolidated investment vehicles and customer vehicles, respectively, which has recourse to the general credit of the Corporation.Customer VehiclesCustomer vehicles include credit-linked, equity-linked and commodity-linked note vehicles, repackaging vehicles, and asset acquisition vehicles, which are typically created on behalf of customers who wish to obtain market or credit exposure to a specific company, index, commodity or financial instrument. The Corporation may transfer assets to and invest in securities issued by these vehicles. The Corporation typically enters into credit, equity, interest rate, commodity or foreign currency derivatives to synthetically create or alter the investment profile of the issued securities.The Corporation's maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated customer vehicles totaled $3.6 billion and $4.7 billion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, including the notional amount of derivatives to which the Corporation is a counterparty, net of losses previously recorded, and the Corporation's investment, if any, in securities issued by the vehicles. The maximum loss exposure has not been reduced to reflect the benefit of offsetting swaps with the customers or collateral arrangements. The Corporation also had liquidity commitments, including written put options and collateral value guarantees, with certain unconsolidated vehicles of $650 million and $658 million at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, that are included in the table above. 171Table of ContentsCollateralized Debt Obligation VehiclesThe Corporation receives fees for structuring CDO vehicles, which hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities, typically corporate debt or ABS, which they fund by issuing multiple tranches of debt and equity securities. Synthetic CDOs enter into a portfolio of CDS to synthetically create exposure to fixed-income securities. CLOs, which are a subset of CDOs, hold pools of loans, typically corporate loans. CDOs are typically managed by third-party portfolio managers. The Corporation typically transfers assets to these CDOs, holds securities issued by the CDOs and may be a derivative counterparty to the CDOs, including a CDS counterparty for synthetic CDOs. The Corporation has also entered into total return swaps with certain CDOs whereby the Corporation absorbs the economic returns generated by specified assets held by the CDO.The Corporation's maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated CDOs totaled $732 million and $780 million at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. This exposure is calculated on a gross basis and does not reflect any benefit from insurance purchased from third parties.At March 31, 2015, the Corporation had $1.2 billion of aggregate liquidity exposure, included in the Other VIEs table net of previously recorded losses, to unconsolidated CDOs which hold senior CDO debt securities or other debt securities on the Corporation's behalf. For additional information, see Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies.Investment VehiclesThe Corporation sponsors, invests in or provides financing, which may be in connection with the sale of assets, to a variety of investment vehicles that hold loans, real estate, debt securities or other financial instruments and are designed to provide the desired investment profile to investors or the Corporation. At both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Corporation's consolidated investment vehicles had total assets of $1.1 billion. The Corporation also held investments in unconsolidated vehicles with total assets of $8.8 billion and $11.2 billion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The Corporation's maximum loss exposure associated with both consolidated and unconsolidated investment vehicles totaled $4.3 billion and $5.1 billion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 comprised primarily of on-balance sheet assets less non-recourse liabilities.The Corporation transferred servicing advance receivables to independent third parties in connection with the sale of MSRs. Portions of the receivables were transferred into unconsolidated securitization trusts. The Corporation retained senior interests in such receivables with a maximum loss exposure and funding obligation of $250 million and $660 million, including a funded balance of $150 million and $431 million at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, which were classified in other debt securities carried at fair value.Leveraged Lease TrustsThe Corporation's net investment in consolidated leveraged lease trusts totaled $3.2 billion and $3.3 billion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The trusts hold long-lived equipment such as rail cars, power generation and distribution equipment, and commercial aircraft. The Corporation structures the trusts and holds a significant residual interest. The net investment represents the Corporation's maximum loss exposure to the trusts in the unlikely event that the leveraged lease investments become worthless. Debt issued by the leveraged lease trusts is non-recourse to the Corporation.Real Estate VehiclesThe Corporation held investments in unconsolidated real estate vehicles with total assets of $6.2 billion at both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, which primarily consisted of investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships that finance the construction and rehabilitation of affordable rental housing and commercial real estate. An unrelated third party is typically the general partner and has control over the significant activities of the partnership. The Corporation earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the real estate projects. The Corporation's risk of loss is mitigated by policies requiring that the project qualify for the expected tax credits prior to making its investment. The Corporation may from time to time be asked to invest additional amounts to support a troubled project. Such additional investments have not been and are not expected to be significant. 172Table of ContentsNOTE 7 – Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees BackgroundThe Corporation securitizes first-lien residential mortgage loans generally in the form of RMBS guaranteed by the GSEs or by GNMA in the case of FHA-insured, VA-guaranteed and Rural Housing Service-guaranteed mortgage loans, and sells pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans in the form of whole loans. In addition, in prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations (in certain of these securitizations, monoline insurers or other financial guarantee providers insured all or some of the securities) or in the form of whole loans. In connection with these transactions, the Corporation or certain of its subsidiaries or legacy companies make or have made various representations and warranties. These representations and warranties, as set forth in the agreements, related to, among other things, the ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing the loan, the absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property securing the loan, the process used to select the loan for inclusion in a transaction, the loan's compliance with any applicable loan criteria, including underwriting standards, and the loan's compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws. Breaches of these representations and warranties have resulted in and may continue to result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage loans or to otherwise make whole or provide other remedies to the GSEs, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) with respect to FHA-insured loans, VA, whole-loan investors, securitization trusts, monoline insurers or other financial guarantors (collectively, repurchases). In all such cases, subsequent to repurchasing the loan, the Corporation would be exposed to any credit loss on the repurchased mortgage loans after accounting for any mortgage insurance (MI) or mortgage guarantee payments that it may receive.Subject to the requirements and limitations of the applicable sales and securitization agreements, these representations and warranties can be enforced by the GSEs, HUD, VA, the whole-loan investor, the securitization trustee or others as governed by the applicable agreement or, in certain first-lien and home equity securitizations where monoline insurers or other financial guarantee providers have insured all or some of the securities issued, by the monoline insurer or other financial guarantor, where the contract so provides. In the case of private-label securitizations, the applicable agreements may permit investors, which may include the GSEs, with sufficient holdings to direct or influence action by the securitization trustee. In the case of loans sold to parties other than the GSEs or GNMA, the Corporation believes the contractual liability to repurchase typically arises only if there is a breach of the representations and warranties that materially and adversely affects the interest of the investor, or investors, or of the monoline insurer or other financial guarantor (as applicable) in the loan. Contracts with the GSEs do not contain equivalent language. The Corporation believes that the longer a loan performs prior to default, the less likely it is that an alleged underwriting breach of representations and warranties would have a material impact on the loan's performance. Currently, the volume of unresolved repurchase claims from the FHA and VA for loans in GNMA-guaranteed securities is not significant because the claims are typically resolved promptly.The liability for representations and warranties exposures and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss is based upon currently available information, significant judgment, and a number of factors and assumptions, including those discussed in Liability for Representations and Warranties and Corporate Guarantees in this Note, that are subject to change. Changes to any one of these factors could significantly impact the liability for representations and warranties exposures and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss and could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation's results of operations for any particular period. Given that these factors vary by counterparty, the Corporation analyzes representations and warranties obligations based on the specific counterparty, or type of counterparty, with whom the sale was made. For additional information, see Note 7 – Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Settlement ActionsThe Corporation has vigorously contested any request for repurchase when it concludes that a valid basis for repurchase does not exist and will continue to do so in the future. However, in an effort to resolve these legacy mortgage-related issues, the Corporation has reached bulk settlements, including various settlements with the GSEs, including settlement amounts which have been significant, with counterparties in lieu of a loan-by-loan review process. These bulk settlements generally did not cover all transactions with the relevant counterparties or all potential claims that may arise, including in some instances securities law, fraud and servicing claims. The Corporation's liability in connection with the transactions and claims not covered by these settlements could be material to the Corporation's results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period. The Corporation may reach other settlements in the future if opportunities arise on terms it believes to be advantageous. However, there can be no assurance that the Corporation will reach future settlements or, if it does, that the terms of past settlements can be relied upon to predict the terms of future settlements. The following provides a summary of the settlement with Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon), which remains subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. For a discussion of other large settlement actions entered into by the Corporation in recent years, see Note 7 – Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 173Table of ContentsSettlement with the Bank of New York Mellon, as TrusteeOn June 28, 2011, the Corporation, BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP (BAC HLS, which was subsequently merged with and into BANA in July 2011), and its Countrywide affiliates entered into a settlement agreement with BNY Mellon (BNY Mellon Settlement), as trustee (the Trustee), to resolve all outstanding and potential claims related to alleged representations and warranties breaches (including repurchase claims), substantially all historical loan servicing claims and certain other historical claims with respect to 525 Countrywide first-lien and five second-lien non-GSE residential mortgage-backed securitization trusts (the Covered Trusts) containing loans principally originated between 2004 and 2008 for which BNY Mellon acts as trustee or indenture trustee. The Covered Trusts had an original principal balance of approximately $424 billion, of which $409 billion was originated between 2004 and 2008, and total outstanding principal and unpaid principal balance of loans that had defaulted (collectively, unpaid principal balance) of approximately $220 billion at June 28, 2011.The BNY Mellon Settlement provides for a cash payment of $8.5 billion to the Trustee for distribution to the Covered Trusts after final approval of the BNY Mellon Settlement. In addition, the Corporation is obligated to pay certain attorneys' fees and costs as well as all fees and expenses incurred by the Trustee related to obtaining final approval of the BNY Mellon Settlement and certain tax rulings.On March 5, 2015, the New York Appellate Division, First Department issued an order unanimously approving the BNY Mellon Settlement in all respects. The deadline for further appeal has passed. The BNY Mellon Settlement remains subject to certain conditions, including that an Internal Revenue Service private letter ruling be obtained confirming that the settlement will not impact the real estate mortgage investment conduit tax status of the trusts. There can be no assurance as to when or whether such conditions to the BNY Mellon Settlement will be satisfied. If final approval is not obtained by December 31, 2015, the Corporation and Countrywide may withdraw from the BNY Mellon Settlement, if the Trustee consents. If final approval is not obtained, or if the Corporation and Countrywide withdraw from the BNY Mellon Settlement in accordance with its terms, the Corporation's future representations and warranties losses could be substantially different from existing accruals and the estimated range of possible loss over existing accruals described under Private-label Securitizations and Whole-loan Sales Experience in this Note.Unresolved Repurchase ClaimsUnresolved representations and warranties repurchase claims represent the notional amount of repurchase claims made by counterparties, typically the outstanding principal balance or the unpaid principal balance at the time of default. In the case of first-lien mortgages, the claim amount is often significantly greater than the expected loss amount due to the benefit of collateral and, in some cases, MI or mortgage guarantee payments. Claims received from a counterparty remain outstanding until the underlying loan is repurchased, the claim is rescinded by the counterparty or the representations and warranties claims with respect to the applicable trust are settled, and fully and finally released. When a claim is denied and the Corporation does not receive a response from the counterparty, the claim remains in the unresolved repurchase claims balance until resolution. Certain of the claims that have been received are duplicate claims which represent more than one claim outstanding related to a particular loan, typically as the result of bulk claims submitted without individual file reviews. 174Table of ContentsThe table below presents unresolved repurchase claims at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The unresolved repurchase claims include only claims where the Corporation believes that the counterparty has the contractual right to submit claims. For additional information, see Private-label Securitizations and Whole-loan Sales Experience in this Note.Unresolved Repurchase Claims by Counterparty and Product Type   (Dollars in millions)March 31 2015 December 31 2014 (1)By counterparty    Private-label securitization trustees, whole-loan investors, including third-party securitization sponsors and other (2, 3)$27,816 $24,489Monolines (4)1,546 1,546GSEs45 59Total gross claims (3)29,407 26,094Duplicate claims (5)(3,625) (3,248)Total unresolved repurchase claims by counterparty, net of duplicate claims $25,782 $22,846By product type   Prime loans$601 $587Alt-A2,734 2,397Home equity2,649 2,485Pay option6,399 6,294Subprime16,276 14,121Other748 210Total (3)29,407 26,094Duplicate claims (5)(3,625) (3,248)Total unresolved repurchase claims by product type, net of duplicate claims $25,782 $22,846(1) The December 31, 2014 amounts have been updated to reflect additional claims submitted from a single monoline, currently pursuing litigation, served in the fourth quarter of 2014, and addressed by the Corporation in 2015 pursuant to an existing litigation schedule. For more information on bond insurance litigation, see Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.(2) The total notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims does not include repurchase claims related to the trusts covered by the BNY Mellon Settlement.(3) Includes $14.2 billion and $14.1 billion of claims based on individual file reviews and $13.6 billion and $10.4 billion of claims submitted without individual file reviews at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.(4) At March 31, 2015, substantially all of the unresolved monoline claims are currently the subject of litigation with a single monoline insurer and predominately pertain to second-lien loans.(5) Represents more than one claim outstanding related to a particular loan, typically as the result of bulk claims submitted without individual file reviews. The March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 amounts include approximately $3.3 billion and $2.9 billion of duplicate claims related to private-label investors submitted without individual loan file reviews.During the three months ended March 31, 2015, the Corporation received $3.4 billion in new repurchase claims, including $3.2 billion of claims submitted without individual loan file reviews. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, $161 million in claims were resolved.The continued increase in the notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims during the three months ended March 31, 2015 is primarily due to: (1) continued submission of claims by private-label securitization trustees, (2) the level of detail, support and analysis accompanying such claims, which impact overall claim quality and, therefore, claims resolution, (3) the lack of an established process to resolve disputes related to these claims, (4) the submission of claims where the Corporation believes the statute of limitations has expired under current law and (5) the submission of duplicate claims, often in multiple submissions, on the same loan. For example, claims submitted without individual file reviews generally lack the level of detail and analysis of individual loans found in other claims that is necessary to evaluate a claim. Absent any settlements, the Corporation expects unresolved repurchase claims related to private-label securitizations to continue to increase as such claims continue to be submitted and there is not an established process for the ultimate resolution of such claims on which there is a disagreement. In addition to the unresolved repurchase claims in the Unresolved Repurchase Claims by Counterparty and Product Type table, the Corporation has received notifications indicating that the Corporation may owe indemnity obligations pertaining to loans for which the Corporation has not received a repurchase request from sponsors of third-party securitizations with whom the Corporation engaged in whole-loan transactions. These notifications totaled $2.0 billion at both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. 175Table of ContentsThe Corporation also from time to time receives correspondence purporting to raise representations and warranties breach issues from entities that do not have contractual standing or ability to bring such claims. The Corporation believes such communications to be procedurally and/or substantively invalid, and generally does not respond to such correspondence.The presence of repurchase claims on a given trust, receipt of notices of indemnification obligations and receipt of other communications, as discussed above, are all factors that inform the Corporation's liability for obligations under representations and warranties and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss.Government-sponsored Enterprises ExperienceAs a result of various bulk settlements with the GSEs, the Corporation has resolved substantially all outstanding and potential representations and warranties repurchase claims on whole loans sold by legacy Bank of America and Countrywide to FNMA and FHLMC through June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2009, respectively. After these settlements, the Corporation's exposure to representations and warranties liability for loans originated prior to 2009 and sold to the GSEs is limited to loans with an original principal balance of $18.3 billion and loans with certain defects excluded from the settlements that the Corporation does not believe will be material, such as certain specified violations of the GSEs' charters, fraud and title defects. As of March 31, 2015, of the $18.3 billion, approximately $15.9 billion in principal has been paid and $966 million in principal has defaulted or was severely delinquent. The notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims submitted by the GSEs was $31 million related to these vintages.Private-label Securitizations and Whole-loan Sales ExperienceIn private-label securitizations, the applicable contracts contain provisions that investors meet certain presentation thresholds to direct a trustee to assert repurchase claims. However, in certain circumstances, the Corporation believes that trustees have presented repurchase claims without requiring investors to meet contractual voting rights thresholds. Continued high levels of new private-label claims are primarily related to repurchase requests received from trustees for private-label securitization transactions not included in the BNY Mellon Settlement.A December 2013 decision by the New York Appellate Division, First Department held that, under New York law, which governs many RMBS trusts, the six-year statute of limitations starts to run at the time the representations and warranties are made, not the date when the repurchase demand was denied. That decision has been applied by the state and federal courts in several RMBS lawsuits in which the Corporation is not a party, resulting in the dismissal as untimely of claims involving representations and warranties made more than six years prior to the initiation of the lawsuit. Unless overturned by New York's highest appellate court, which has taken the case for review and has scheduled arguments for April 30, 2015, this decision would apply to representations and warranties claims and lawsuits brought against the Corporation where New York law governs. A significant amount of representations and warranties claims and/or lawsuits the Corporation has received or may receive involve representations and warranties claims where the statute of limitations has expired under this ruling and has not been tolled by agreement and which the Corporation therefore believes would be untimely. It is possible that in response to the statute of limitations rulings, parties seeking to pursue representations and warranties claims and/or lawsuits with respect to trusts where the statute of limitations for representations and warranties claims against the sponsor and/or issuer has run, may pursue alternate legal theories of recovery and/or assert claims against other contractual parties. For example, in 2014, institutional investors filed lawsuits against trustees alleging failure to pursue representations and warranties claims and servicer defaults based upon alleged contractual, statutory and tort theories of liability. The impact on the Corporation, if any, of such alternative legal theories or assertions is unclear. 176Table of ContentsThe Corporation provided representations and warranties in connection with the sale of whole loans and the whole-loan investors may retain the right to make repurchase claims even when the loans were aggregated with other collateral into private-label securitizations sponsored by the whole-loan investors; in other third-party securitizations, the whole-loan investor's rights to enforce the representations and warranties were transferred to the securitization trustees. Private-label securitization investors generally do not have the contractual right to demand repurchase of loans directly or the right to access loan files directly. The majority of the repurchase claims that the Corporation has received and resolved outside of those from the GSEs and monolines are from third-party whole-loan investors. The Corporation reviews properly presented repurchase claims for these whole loans on a loan-by-loan basis. If, after the Corporation's review, it does not believe a claim is valid, it will deny the claim and generally indicate a reason for the denial. When the whole-loan investor agrees with the Corporation's denial of the claim, the whole-loan investor may rescind the claim. When there is disagreement as to the resolution of the claim, meaningful dialogue and negotiation between the parties are generally necessary to reach a resolution on an individual claim. When a claim has been denied and the Corporation does not hear from the counterparty for six months, the Corporation views these claims as inactive; however, they remain in the outstanding claims balance until resolution. In the case of private-label securitization trustees and third-party sponsors, there is currently no established process in place for the parties to reach a conclusion on an individual loan if there is a disagreement on the resolution of the claim. For more information on repurchase demands, see Unresolved Repurchase Claims in this Note.At March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, for loans originated between 2004 and 2008, the notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims, net of duplicate claims, submitted by private-label securitization trustees, whole-loan investors, including third-party securitization sponsors, and others was $24.1 billion and $21.2 billion. These repurchase claims at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 include claims in the amount of $6.4 billion and $4.7 billion, net of duplicate claims, where the Corporation believes the statute of limitations has expired under current law, and $4.1 billion and $4.0 billion in claims, net of duplicate claims, related to loans in specific private-label securitization groups or tranches where the Corporation owns substantially all of the outstanding securities. The Corporation has performed an initial review with respect to substantially all of these claims and, although the Corporation does not believe a valid basis for repurchase has been established by the claimant, it considers such claims activity in the computation of its liability for representations and warranties.Monoline Insurers ExperienceFor a description of the Corporation's experience with monoline insurers, see Note 7 – Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees and Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Open Mortgage Insurance Rescission Notices In addition to repurchase claims, the Corporation receives notices from mortgage insurance companies of claim denials, cancellations or coverage rescission (collectively, MI rescission notices). For more information, see Note 7 – Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Liability for Representations and Warranties and Corporate GuaranteesThe liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related provision is included in mortgage banking income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The liability for representations and warranties is established when those obligations are both probable and reasonably estimable.The Corporation's liability and corresponding estimated range of possible loss at March 31, 2015 for obligations under representations and warranties given to the GSEs considers a number of factors. These include the Corporation's experience related to actual defaults, projected future defaults, historical loss experience, estimated home prices and other economic conditions. In addition, the liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees and corresponding estimated range of possible loss consider such factors as the number of payments made by the borrower prior to default as well as certain other assumptions and judgmental factors. 177Table of ContentsThe Corporation's non-GSE representations and warranties liability and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss at March 31, 2015 considers, among other things, implied repurchase experience based on the BNY Mellon Settlement, adjusted to reflect differences between the Covered Trusts and the remainder of the population of private-label securitizations, and assumes that the conditions to the BNY Mellon Settlement will be met. Since the non-GSE securitization trusts that were included in the BNY Mellon Settlement differ from those that were not included in the BNY Mellon Settlement, the Corporation adjusted the repurchase experience implied in the settlement in order to determine the non-GSE representations and warranties liability and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss. The judgmental adjustments made include consideration of the differences in the mix of products in the subject securitizations, loan originator, likelihood of claims expected, the differences in the number of payments that the borrower has made prior to default and the sponsor of the securitizations. Where relevant, the Corporation also considers more recent experience, such as claim activity, notification of potential indemnification obligations, its experience with various counterparties, recent court decisions related to the statute of limitations as summarized above and other facts and circumstances, such as bulk settlements, as the Corporation believes appropriate.A factor that impacts the non-GSE representations and warranties liability and the portion of the estimated range of possible loss corresponding to non-GSE representations and warranties exposures is the likelihood that claims will be presented, which is impacted by a number of factors, including contractual provisions that investors meet certain presentation thresholds under the non-GSE securitization agreements. A securitization trustee may investigate or demand repurchase on its own action, and most agreements contain a presentation threshold, for example 25 percent of the voting rights per trust, that allows investors to declare a servicing event of default under certain circumstances or to request certain action, such as requesting loan files, that the trustee may choose to accept and follow, exempt from liability, provided the trustee is acting in good faith. If there is an uncured servicing event of default and the trustee fails to bring suit during a 60-day period, then, under most agreements, investors may file suit. In addition to this, most agreements allow investors to direct the securitization trustee to investigate loan files or demand the repurchase of loans if security holders hold a specified percentage, for example, 25 percent, of the voting rights of each tranche of the outstanding securities. However, in certain circumstances the Corporation believes that trustees have presented repurchase claims without requiring investors to meet contractual voting rights thresholds. The population of private-label securitizations included in the BNY Mellon Settlement encompasses almost all Countrywide first-lien private-label securitizations including loans originated principally between 2004 and 2008. For the remainder of the population of private-label securitizations, claimants have come forward on certain securitizations and the Corporation believes it is probable that other claimants may continue to come forward with claims that meet the contractual requirements of other securitizations. For more information on the representations and warranties liability and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss, see Estimated Range of Possible Loss in this Note.The table below presents a rollforward of the liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees.Representations and Warranties and Corporate Guarantees    Three Months Ended March 31(Dollars in millions)2015 2014Liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees, January 1$12,081 $13,282Additions for new sales1 3Net reductions(174) (52)Provision84 178Liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees, March 31$11,992 $13,411The representations and warranties liability represents the Corporation's best estimate of probable incurred losses as of March 31, 2015. However, it is reasonably possible that future representations and warranties losses may occur in excess of the amounts recorded for these exposures. Although the Corporation has not recorded any representations and warranties liability for certain potential private-label securitization and whole-loan exposures where the applicable statute of limitations has expired under current law, these exposures are considered in the determination of the estimated range of possible loss. 178Table of ContentsEstimated Range of Possible LossThe Corporation currently estimates that the range of possible loss for representations and warranties exposures could be up to $4 billion over existing accruals at March 31, 2015. The estimated range of possible loss reflects principally non-GSE exposures. It represents a reasonably possible loss, but does not represent a probable loss, and is based on currently available information, significant judgment and a number of assumptions that are subject to change.The liability for representations and warranties exposures and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss do not consider losses related to servicing (except as such losses are included as potential costs of the BNY Mellon Settlement), including foreclosure and related costs, fraud, indemnity, or claims (including for RMBS) related to securities law or monoline insurance litigations. Losses with respect to one or more of these matters could be material to the Corporation's results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period.Future provisions and/or ranges of possible loss for representations and warranties may be significantly impacted if actual experiences are different from the Corporation's assumptions in predictive models, including, without limitation, ultimate resolution of the BNY Mellon Settlement, estimated repurchase rates, estimated MI rescission rates, economic conditions, estimated home prices, consumer and counterparty behavior, the applicable statute of limitations and a variety of other judgmental factors. Adverse developments with respect to one or more of the assumptions underlying the liability for representations and warranties and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss could result in significant increases to future provisions and/or the estimated range of possible loss. Finally, although the Corporation believes that the representations and warranties typically given in non-GSE transactions are less rigorous than those given in GSE transactions, the Corporation does not have sufficient experience resolving loan-level claims in non-GSE transactions to measure the impact of these differences on the probability that a loan will be required to be repurchased.Cash PaymentsThe Loan Repurchases and Indemnification Payments table presents first-lien and home equity loan repurchases and indemnification payments made by the Corporation to reimburse the investor or securitization trust for losses they incurred, and to resolve repurchase claims. Cash paid for loan repurchases includes the unpaid principal balance of the loan plus past due interest. The amount of loss for loan repurchases is reduced by the fair value of the underlying loan collateral. The repurchase of loans and indemnification payments related to first-lien and home equity repurchase claims generally resulted from material breaches of representations and warranties related to the loans' material compliance with the applicable underwriting standards, including borrower misrepresentation, credit exceptions without sufficient compensating factors and non-compliance with underwriting procedures. The actual representations and warranties made in a sales transaction and the resulting repurchase and indemnification activity can vary by transaction or investor. Loan repurchases or indemnification payments related to first-lien residential mortgages primarily involved the GSEs while repurchases or indemnification payments related to home equity loans primarily involved the monoline insurers.Loan Repurchases and Indemnification Payments (excluding cash payments for settlements) Three Months Ended March 31 2015 2014(Dollars in millions)UnpaidPrincipalBalance Cash PaidforRepurchases Loss UnpaidPrincipalBalance Cash PaidforRepurchases LossFirst-lien           Repurchases$35 $38 $10 $46 $51 $12Indemnification payments99 23 23 101 28 28Total first-lien134 61 33 147 79 40Home equity, indemnification payments4 4 4 11 11 11Total first-lien and home equity$138 $65 $37 $158 $90 $51 179Table of ContentsNOTE 8 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets GoodwillThe table below presents goodwill balances by business segment at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The reporting units utilized for goodwill impairment testing are the operating segments or one level below. For additional information, see Note 8 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Goodwill(Dollars in millions)March 31 2015 December 31 2014Consumer Banking$30,123 $30,123Global Wealth & Investment Management9,698 9,698Global Banking23,923 23,923Global Markets5,197 5,197All Other835 836Total goodwill$69,776 $69,777For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation utilizes allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying value of its reporting units. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. Allocated capital is based on multiple considerations that include, but are not limited to, risk-weighted assets measured under the Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches, business segment exposures and risk profile, and strategic plans. The goodwill impairment test involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill, as measured by allocated equity. Effective January 1, 2015, the Corporation realigned its reporting segments. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles for additional information. As part of the realignment, the Corporation moved a portion of the Business Banking business, including $1.6 billion of goodwill, from the former Consumer & Business Banking segment to Global Banking. This business constitutes a new reporting unit, Business Banking Regions, within the Global Banking segment. The remaining portion of the Business Banking business will be evaluated with Deposits as a single reporting unit within Consumer Banking. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. The realignment triggered a test for goodwill impairment, which was performed both immediately before and after the realignment. In performing the goodwill impairment test, the Corporation compared the fair value of the affected reporting units with their carrying value as measured by allocated equity. The fair value of the affected reporting units exceeded their carrying value and, accordingly, no goodwill impairment resulted from the realignment. See Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 8 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding testing goodwill for impairment.There was no goodwill in LAS at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. 180Table of ContentsIntangible AssetsThe table below presents the gross carrying value and accumulated amortization for intangible assets at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.Intangible Assets (1, 2)   March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014(Dollars in millions)GrossCarrying Value AccumulatedAmortization Net Carrying Value GrossCarrying Value AccumulatedAmortization Net Carrying ValuePurchased credit card relationships$5,457 $4,555 $902 $5,504 $4,527 $977Core deposit intangibles1,779 1,414 365 1,779 1,382 397Customer relationships4,025 2,735 1,290 4,025 2,648 1,377Affinity relationships1,557 1,297 260 1,565 1,283 282Other intangibles2,045 471 1,574 2,045 466 1,579Total intangible assets$14,863 $10,472 $4,391 $14,918 $10,306 $4,612(1) Excludes fully amortized intangible assets.(2) At March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, none of the intangible assets were impaired.The table below presents intangible asset amortization expense for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014.Amortization Expense Three Months EndedMarch 31(Dollars in millions)2015 2014Purchased credit card and Affinity relationships$89 $105Core deposit intangibles32 36Customer relationships87 91Other intangibles5 7Total amortization expense$213 $239The table below presents estimated future intangible asset amortization expense as of March 31, 2015.Estimated Future Amortization Expense(Dollars in millions)Remainder of2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020Purchased credit card and Affinity relationships$268 $299 $239 $180 $121 $62Core deposit intangibles91 104 90 80 — —Customer relationships253 325 310 302 — —Other intangibles10 9 6 3 2 —Total estimated future amortization expense$622 $737 $645 $565 $123 $62 181Table of ContentsNOTE 9 – Federal Funds Sold or Purchased, Securities Financing Agreements and Short-term BorrowingsThe table below presents federal funds sold or purchased, securities financing agreements, which include securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, and short-term borrowings.

The Corporation offsets securities borrowing and lending transactions with the same counterparty on the Consolidated Balance Sheet where it has such a legally enforceable master netting agreement and the transactions have the same maturity date.The Securities Financing Agreements table presents securities financing agreements included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, and in federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty netting. Gross assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements. For more information on the offsetting of derivatives, see Note 2 – Derivatives.The "Other" amount in the table, which is included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accrued expenses and other liabilities, relates to transactions where the Corporation acts as the lender in a securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral. In these transactions, the Corporation recognizes an asset at fair value, representing the securities received, and a liability, representing the obligation to return those securities.Gross assets and liabilities in the table include activity where uncertainty exists as to the enforceability of certain master netting agreements under bankruptcy laws in some countries or industries and, accordingly, these are reported on a gross basis.The column titled "Financial Instruments" in the table includes securities collateral received or pledged under repurchase or securities lending agreements where there is a legally enforceable master netting agreement. These amounts are not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, but are shown as a reduction to the net balance sheet amount in this table to derive a net asset or liability. Securities collateral received or pledged where the legal enforceability of the master netting agreements is not certain is not included.Securities Financing Agreements March 31, 2015(Dollars in millions)Gross Assets/Liabilities Amounts Offset Net Balance Sheet Amount Financial Instruments Net Assets/LiabilitiesSecurities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell (1)$343,394 $(136,686) $206,708 $(164,058) $42,650          Securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase$340,431 $(136,686) $203,745 $(165,035) $38,710Other12,326 — 12,326 (12,326) —Total$352,757 $(136,686) $216,071 $(177,361) $38,710           December 31, 2014Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell (1)$316,567 $(124,744) $191,823 $(145,573) $46,250          Securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase$326,007 $(124,744) $201,263 $(164,306) $36,957Other11,641 — 11,641 (11,641) —Total$337,648 $(124,744) $212,904 $(175,947) $36,957(1) Excludes repurchase activity of $7.7 billion and $5.6 billion reported in loans and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. 183Table of ContentsNOTE 10 – Commitments and ContingenciesIn the normal course of business, the Corporation enters into a number of off-balance sheet commitments. These commitments expose the Corporation to varying degrees of credit and market risk and are subject to the same credit and market risk limitation reviews as those instruments recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For more information on commitments and contingencies, see Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Credit Extension CommitmentsThe Corporation enters into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and commercial letters of credit to meet the financing needs of its customers. The table below includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments net of amounts distributed (e.g., syndicated) to other financial institutions of $14.6 billion and $15.7 billion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. At March 31, 2015, the carrying value of these commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option, was $556 million, including deferred revenue of $19 million and a reserve for unfunded lending commitments of $537 million. At December 31, 2014, the comparable amounts were $546 million, $18 million and $528 million, respectively. The carrying value of these commitments is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.The table below also includes the notional amount of commitments of $8.9 billion and $9.9 billion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 that are accounted for under the fair value option. However, the table below excludes cumulative net fair value adjustments of $329 million and $405 million on these commitments, which are classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities.

Amounts include consumer SBLCs of $373 million and $396 million at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.(2) Includes business card unused lines of credit.Legally binding commitments to extend credit generally have specified rates and maturities. Certain of these commitments have adverse change clauses that help to protect the Corporation against deterioration in the borrower's ability to pay. 184Table of ContentsOther CommitmentsAt March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Corporation had commitments to purchase loans (e.g., residential mortgage and commercial real estate) of $2.2 billion and $1.8 billion, which upon settlement will be included in loans or LHFS.At March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Corporation had commitments to enter into forward-dated resale and securities borrowing agreements of $105.8 billion and $73.2 billion, and commitments to enter into forward-dated repurchase and securities lending agreements of $85.1 billion and $55.8 billion. These commitments expire within the next 12 months.The Corporation is a party to operating leases for certain of its premises and equipment. Commitments under these leases are approximately $1.9 billion, $2.3 billion, $1.9 billion, $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion for the remainder of 2015 and the years through 2019, respectively, and $5.1 billion in the aggregate for all years thereafter.Other GuaranteesBank-owned Life Insurance Book Value ProtectionThe Corporation sells products that offer book value protection to insurance carriers who offer group life insurance policies to corporations, primarily banks. The book value protection is provided on portfolios of intermediate investment-grade fixed-income securities and is intended to cover any shortfall in the event that policyholders surrender their policies and market value is below book value. These guarantees are recorded as derivatives and carried at fair value in the trading portfolio. At both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the notional amount of these guarantees totaled $13.6 billion and the Corporation's maximum exposure related to these guarantees totaled $3.1 billion with estimated maturity dates between 2031 and 2039. The net fair value including the fee receivable associated with these guarantees was $22 million and $25 million at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, and reflects the probability of surrender as well as the multiple structural protection features in the contracts.Merchant ServicesIn accordance with credit and debit card association rules, the Corporation sponsors merchant processing servicers that process credit and debit card transactions on behalf of various merchants. In connection with these services, a liability may arise in the event of a billing dispute between the merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately resolved in the cardholder's favor. If the merchant defaults on its obligation to reimburse the cardholder, the cardholder, through its issuing bank, generally has until six months after the date of the transaction to present a chargeback to the merchant processor, which is primarily liable for any losses on covered transactions. However, if the merchant processor fails to meet its obligation to reimburse the cardholder for disputed transactions, then the Corporation, as the sponsor, could be held liable for the disputed amount. For the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, the sponsored entities processed and settled $154.6 billion and $149.4 billion of transactions and recorded losses of $4 million in both periods. A significant portion of this activity was processed by a joint venture in which the Corporation holds a 49 percent ownership. At March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the sponsored merchant processing servicers held as collateral $143 million and $130 million of merchant escrow deposits which may be used to offset amounts due from the individual merchants.The Corporation believes the maximum potential exposure for chargebacks would not exceed the total amount of merchant transactions processed through Visa and MasterCard for the last six months, which represents the claim period for the cardholder, plus any outstanding delayed-delivery transactions. As of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the maximum potential exposure for sponsored transactions totaled $262.1 billion and $269.3 billion. However, the Corporation believes that the maximum potential exposure is not representative of the actual potential loss exposure and does not expect to make material payments in connection with these guarantees.Other Derivative ContractsThe Corporation funds selected assets, including securities issued by CDOs and CLOs, through derivative contracts, typically total return swaps, with third parties and VIEs that are not consolidated by the Corporation. The total notional amount of these derivative contracts was $494 million and $527 million with commercial banks at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 and $1.2 billion with VIEs at both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The underlying securities are senior securities and substantially all of the Corporation's exposures are insured. Accordingly, the Corporation's exposure to loss consists principally of counterparty risk to the insurers. In certain circumstances, generally as a result of ratings downgrades, the Corporation may be required to purchase the underlying assets, which would not result in additional gain or loss to the Corporation as such exposure is already reflected in the fair value of the derivative contracts. 185Table of ContentsOther GuaranteesThe Corporation has entered into additional guarantee agreements and commitments, including sold risk participation swaps, liquidity facilities, lease-end obligation agreements, partial credit guarantees on certain leases, real estate joint venture guarantees, divested business commitments and sold put options that require gross settlement. The maximum potential future payment under these agreements was approximately $6.3 billion and $6.2 billion at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The estimated maturity dates of these obligations extend up to 2040. The Corporation has made no material payments under these guarantees.In the normal course of business, the Corporation periodically guarantees the obligations of its affiliates in a variety of transactions including ISDA-related transactions and non-ISDA related transactions such as commodities trading, repurchase agreements, prime brokerage agreements and other transactions.Payment Protection Insurance Claims MatterIn the U.K., the Corporation previously sold payment protection insurance (PPI) through its international card services business to credit card customers and consumer loan customers. PPI covers a consumer's loan or debt repayment if certain events occur such as loss of job or illness. In response to an elevated level of customer complaints across the industry, heightened media coverage and pressure from consumer advocacy groups, the U.K. Financial Services Authority, which has subsequently been replaced by the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), investigated and raised concerns about the way some companies have handled complaints related to the sale of these insurance policies. In connection with this matter, the Corporation established a reserve for PPI. The reserve was $266 million and $378 million at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The Corporation recorded no expense for the three months ended March 31, 2015 compared to $141 million of expense for the same period in 2014. It is reasonably possible that the Corporation will incur additional expense related to PPI claims; however, the amount of such additional expense cannot be reasonably estimated.Litigation and Regulatory MattersThe following supplements the disclosure in Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K (the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure).In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to many pending and threatened legal actions and proceedings, including actions brought on behalf of various classes of claimants. These actions and proceedings are generally based on alleged violations of consumer protection, securities, environmental, banking, employment, contract and other laws. In some of these actions and proceedings, claims for substantial monetary damages are asserted against the Corporation and its subsidiaries.In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are also subject to regulatory and governmental examinations, information gathering requests, inquiries, investigations, and threatened legal actions and proceedings. For example, certain subsidiaries of the Corporation are registered broker-dealers or investment advisors and are subject to regulation by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the European Commission, the PRA, the FCA and other international, federal and state securities regulators. In connection with formal and informal inquiries, the Corporation and its subsidiaries receive numerous requests, subpoenas and orders for documents, testimony and information in connection with various aspects of the Corporation's regulated activities.In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such litigation, regulatory and governmental matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties, the Corporation generally cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be, what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be, or what the eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter may be. 186Table of ContentsIn accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Corporation establishes an accrued liability for litigation, regulatory and governmental matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. As a litigation, regulatory or governmental matter develops, the Corporation, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates on an ongoing basis whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and estimable. When a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, the Corporation does not establish an accrued liability. If, at the time of evaluation, the loss contingency related to a litigation, regulatory or governmental matter is not both probable and estimable, the matter will continue to be monitored for further developments that would make such loss contingency both probable and estimable. Once the loss contingency related to a litigation, regulatory or governmental matter is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Corporation will establish an accrued liability with respect to such loss contingency and record a corresponding amount of litigation-related expense. The Corporation continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established. Excluding expenses of internal or external legal service providers, litigation-related expense of $370 million and $6.0 billion was recognized for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014.For a limited number of the matters disclosed in this Note, and in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure, for which a loss, whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, is reasonably possible in future periods, the Corporation is able to estimate a range of possible loss. In determining whether it is possible to estimate a range of possible loss, the Corporation reviews and evaluates its material litigation, regulatory and governmental matters on an ongoing basis, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. These may include information learned through the discovery process, rulings on dispositive motions, settlement discussions, and other rulings by courts, arbitrators or others. In cases in which the Corporation possesses sufficient appropriate information to estimate a range of possible loss, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed below. There may be other disclosed matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but such an estimate of the range of possible loss may not be possible. For those matters where an estimate of the range of possible loss is possible, management currently estimates the aggregate range of possible loss is $0 to $2.5 billion in excess of the accrued liability (if any) related to those matters. This estimated range of possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions, and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. Those matters for which an estimate is not possible are not included within this estimated range. Therefore, this estimated range of possible loss represents what the Corporation believes to be an estimate of possible loss only for certain matters meeting these criteria. It does not represent the Corporation's maximum loss exposure.Information is provided below, or in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure, regarding the nature of all of these contingencies and, where specified, the amount of the claim associated with these loss contingencies. Based on current knowledge, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters, including the matters described herein and in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the Corporation. However, in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters, some of which are beyond the Corporation's control, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to the Corporation's results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period.Interchange and Related LitigationFollowing approval of the class settlement agreement, a number of class members opted out of the settlement; the Corporation was named in two opt-out suits, as well as in an action brought by cardholders. In the cardholder action, the parties have moved for reconsideration of the court's November 26, 2014 decision dismissing the Sherman Act claim, and have also appealed the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.LIBOR, Other Reference Rate and Foreign Exchange (FX) Inquiries and LitigationIn the civil actions filed against the Corporation and other FX market participants, plaintiff in the Foreign Action appealed the dismissal of the action, but voluntarily dismissed the appeal with prejudice on April 24, 2015. In April 2015, the Corporation and BANA agreed to settle the U.S. Action for $180 million, which was fully accrued as of March 31, 2015. The agreement is subject to execution of a final settlement agreement and court approval.  187Table of ContentsMortgage-backed Securities LitigationPrudential Insurance LitigationThe parties have agreed to resolve Prudential's claims for an amount that is not material to the Corporation's results of operations, and that was fully accrued as of March 31, 2015. Pursuant to the settlement, Prudential has filed stipulations for dismissal of all claims with prejudice.Ocala Investor LitigationOn March 25, 2015, BANA and Deutsche Bank AG entered into a final agreement to settle the 2009 Actions. On March 30, 2015, BANA and BNP Paribas Mortgage Corporation entered into a final agreement to settle the 2009 Actions.

O'Donnell LitigationOn February 20, 2015, Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., Countrywide Bank, FSB and BANA appealed the verdict and judgment previously rendered by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.Policemen's Annuity LitigationOn March 12, 2015, the court approved the settlement in all respects and issued a final judgment dismissing all claims with prejudice. 188Table of ContentsNOTE 11 – Shareholders' Equity Common StockThe table below presents the declared quarterly cash dividends on common stock in 2015 and through April 29, 2015.Declaration DateRecord DatePayment DateDividend Per Share April 16, 2015June 5, 2015June 26, 2015$0.05 February 10, 2015March 6, 2015March 27, 20150.05 During the three months ended March 31, 2015, in connection with employee stock plans, the Corporation issued approximately 7 million shares and repurchased approximately 3 million shares of its common stock to satisfy tax withholding obligations. At March 31, 2015, the Corporation had reserved 1.8 billion unissued shares of common stock for future issuances under employee stock plans, common stock warrants, convertible notes and preferred stock.The Corporation has certain warrants outstanding and exercisable to purchase 150.4 million shares of its common stock, expiring on January 16, 2019 and warrants outstanding and exercisable to purchase 121.8 million shares of its common stock, expiring on October 28, 2018. These warrants were originally issued in connection with preferred stock issuances to the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2009 and 2008, and are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The exercise price of these warrants is subject to continued adjustment each time the quarterly cash dividend is in excess of $0.01 per common share to compensate the holders of the warrants for dilution resulting from an increased dividend. As a result of the Corporation's first-quarter 2015 dividend of $0.05 per common share, the exercise price of the warrants expiring on January 16, 2019 was adjusted to $13.20. The warrants expiring on October 28, 2018 also contain this anti-dilution provision except the adjustment is triggered only when the Corporation declares quarterly dividends at a level greater than $0.32 per common share.Preferred StockDuring the three months ended March 31, 2015, the Corporation declared $382 million of cash dividends on preferred stock, of which $319 million was paid during the quarter with the remainder paid in April 2015.On January 27, 2015, the Corporation issued 44,000 shares of its 6.500% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series Y for $1.1 billion. Dividends will be paid quarterly commencing on April 27, 2015. On March 17, 2015, the Corporation issued 76,000 shares of its Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series AA for $1.9 billion. Dividends will be paid semi-annually commencing on September 17, 2015. Series Y and AA preferred stock have a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share and are subject to certain restrictions in the event that the Corporation fails to declare and pay full dividends.Restricted Stock UnitsDuring the three months ended March 31, 2015, the Corporation granted 131 million restricted stock unit (RSU) awards to certain employees under the Key Associate Stock Plan. Generally, one-third of the RSUs vest on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date provided that the employee remains continuously employed with the Corporation during that time. Except for two million RSUs that are authorized to settle in shares of common stock of the Corporation, the RSUs will be paid in cash to the employees on the vesting date based on the fair value of the Corporation's common stock as of the vesting date. The RSUs are expensed ratably over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures, for non-retirement eligible employees based upon the fair value of the Corporation's common stock on the accrual date. For RSUs granted to employees who are retirement eligible or will become retirement eligible during the vesting period, the RSUs are expensed as of the grant date or ratably over the period from the grant date to the date the employee becomes retirement eligible, net of estimated forfeitures. The accrued liability for the RSUs is adjusted to fair value based on changes in the fair value of the Corporation's common stock. The Corporation enters into cash-settled equity derivatives for a significant portion of the RSUs to minimize the change in expense driven by fluctuations in the fair value of the RSUs over the applicable vesting period.

There were no potential common shares that are dilutive for the three months ended March 31, 2014 because of the net loss.The Corporation previously issued a warrant to purchase 700 million shares of the Corporation's common stock to the holder of the Series T Preferred Stock. The warrant may be exercised, at the option of the holder, through tendering the Series T Preferred Stock or paying cash. For the three months ended March 31, 2015, the 700 million average dilutive potential common shares were included in the diluted share count under the "if-converted" method. For the three months ended March 31, 2014, the 700 million average dilutive potential common shares were not included in the diluted share count because the result would have been antidilutive under the "if-converted" method.For the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, 62 million average dilutive potential common shares associated with the 7.25% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, Series L were not included in the diluted share count because the result would have been antidilutive under the "if-converted" method. For the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, average options to purchase 73 million and 101 million shares of common stock were outstanding but not included in the computation of EPS because the result would have been antidilutive under the treasury stock method. For the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, average warrants to purchase 122 million and 272 million shares of common stock were outstanding but not included in the computation of EPS because the result would have been antidilutive under the treasury stock method. For the three months ended March 31, 2015, average warrants to purchase 150 million shares of common stock were included in the diluted EPS calculation using the treasury stock method. 192Table of ContentsNOTE 14 – Fair Value MeasurementsUnder applicable accounting guidance, fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Corporation determines the fair values of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established under applicable accounting guidance which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs used to measure fair value. The Corporation conducts a review of its fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of fair value hierarchy classifications are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable, respectively, in the current marketplace. These transfers are considered to be effective as of the beginning of the quarter in which they occur. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy and how the Corporation measures fair value, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 20 – Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Corporation accounts for certain financial instruments under the fair value option. For additional information, see Note 15 – Fair Value Option.Valuation Processes and TechniquesThe Corporation has various processes and controls in place to ensure that fair value is reasonably estimated. A model validation policy governs the use and control of valuation models used to estimate fair value. This policy requires review and approval of models by personnel who are independent of the front office, and periodic reassessments of models to ensure that they are continuing to perform as designed. In addition, detailed reviews of trading gains and losses are conducted on a daily basis by personnel who are independent of the front office. A price verification group, which is also independent of the front office, utilizes available market information including executed trades, market prices and market-observable valuation model inputs to ensure that fair values are reasonably estimated. The Corporation performs due diligence procedures over third-party pricing service providers in order to support their use in the valuation process. Where market information is not available to support internal valuations, independent reviews of the valuations are performed and any material exposures are escalated through a management review process.While the Corporation believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.During the three months ended March 31, 2015, there were no changes to the valuation techniques that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on the Corporation's consolidated financial position or results of operations.Level 1, 2 and 3 Valuation TechniquesFinancial instruments are considered Level 1 when the valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 financial instruments are valued using quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or models using inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Financial instruments are considered Level 3 when their values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques, and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable and when determination of the fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. 193Table of ContentsRecurring Fair ValueAssets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, including financial instruments which the Corporation accounts for under the fair value option, are summarized in the following tables.

Transfers into Level 3 for trading account assets were primarily the result of decreased availability of third-party prices for certain corporate debt securities. Transfers into Level 3 for AFS debt securities were primarily due to decreased price observability on certain CLOs. Transfers into Level 3 for LHFS were primarily due to decreased price observability due to a decline in trading activity. Transfers into Level 3 for long-term debt were primarily due to changes in the impact of unobservable inputs on the value of certain structured liabilities. Transfers occur on a regular basis for these long-term debt instruments due to changes in the impact of unobservable inputs on the value of the embedded derivative in relation to the instrument as a whole.During the three months ended March 31, 2015, the transfers out of Level 3 included $300 million of trading account assets, $933 million of AFS debt securities and $126 million of long-term debt. Transfers out of Level 3 for trading account assets were primarily the result of increased market liquidity and price observability for certain corporate debt securities. Transfers out of Level 3 for AFS debt securities were primarily due to increased price observability for certain corporate debt securities. Transfers out of Level 3 for long-term debt were primarily due to changes in the impact of unobservable inputs on the value of certain structured liabilities. 196Table of ContentsLevel 3 – Fair Value Measurements (1) Three Months Ended March 31, 2014    Gross   (Dollars in millions)BalanceJanuary 12014Gains(Losses) inEarningsGains(Losses) inOCIPurchasesSalesIssuancesSettlementsGrossTransfersintoLevel 3GrossTransfersout ofLevel 3Balance March 31 2014Trading account assets:          Corporate securities, trading loans and other$3,559$122$—$286$(354)$—$(238)$148$(906)$2,617Equity securities38619—30(29)——7(70)343Non-U.S. sovereign debt46855—23(6)—(6)—(1)533Mortgage trading loans and ABS4,63178—366(552)—(224)—(12)4,287Total trading account assets9,044274—705(941)—(468)155(989)7,780Net derivative assets (2)(224)14—125(691)—(101)1226(839)AFS debt securities:          Non-U.S securities107—————(107)———Other taxable securities3,8478(2)47——(463)——3,437Tax-exempt securities80611———(25)——783Total AFS debt securities4,7609(1)47——(595)——4,220Loans and leases (3, 4)3,05732——(3)689(723)6(5)3,053Mortgage servicing rights (4)5,042(290)——(20)265(232)——4,765Loans held-for-sale (3)92912——(3)—(201)—(1)736Other assets (5)1,669(60)——(269)—(208)——1,132Trading account liabilities – Corporate securities and other(35)1—3(7)———2(36)Accrued expenses and other liabilities(10)1——————1(8)Long-term debt (3)(1,990)(67)—46—(9)119(144)204(1,841)(1) Assets (liabilities).

Commercial loans, debt securities and other include corporate CLOs and CDOs, commercial loans and bonds, and securities backed by non-real estate assets. Structured liabilities primarily include equity-linked notes that are accounted for under the fair value option.The Corporation uses multiple market approaches in valuing certain of its Level 3 financial instruments. For example, market comparables and discounted cash flows are used together. For a given product, such as corporate debt securities, market comparables may be used to estimate some of the unobservable inputs and then these inputs are incorporated into a discounted cash flow model. Therefore, the balances disclosed encompass both of these techniques.The level of aggregation and diversity within the products disclosed in the tables result in certain ranges of inputs being wide and unevenly distributed across asset and liability categories. At March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, weighted averages are disclosed for all loans, securities, structured liabilities and net derivative assets.For more information on the inputs and techniques used in the valuation of MSRs, see Note 17 – Mortgage Servicing Rights.Sensitivity of Fair Value Measurements to Changes in Unobservable InputsLoans and SecuritiesFor instruments backed by residential real estate assets and commercial loans, debt securities and other, a significant increase in market yields, default rates, loss severities or duration would result in a significantly lower fair value for long positions. Short positions would be impacted in a directionally opposite way. The impact of changes in prepayment speeds would have differing impacts depending on the seniority of the instrument and, in the case of CLOs, whether prepayments can be reinvested.For auction rate securities, a significant increase in price would result in a significantly higher fair value.Structured Liabilities and DerivativesFor credit derivatives, a significant increase in market yield, including spreads to indices, upfront points (i.e., a single upfront payment made by a protection buyer at inception), default rates or loss severities would result in a significantly lower fair value for protection sellers and higher fair value for protection buyers. The impact of changes in prepayment speeds would have differing impacts depending on the seniority of the instrument and, in the case of CLOs, whether prepayments can be reinvested.Structured credit derivatives, which include tranched portfolio CDS and derivatives with derivative product company (DPC) and monoline counterparties, are impacted by credit correlation, including default and wrong-way correlation. Default correlation is a parameter that describes the degree of dependence among credit default rates within a credit portfolio that underlies a credit derivative instrument. The sensitivity of this input on the fair value varies depending on the level of subordination of the tranche. For senior tranches that are net purchases of protection, a significant increase in default correlation would result in a significantly higher fair value. Net short protection positions would be impacted in a directionally opposite way. Wrong-way correlation is a parameter that describes the probability that as exposure to a counterparty increases, the credit quality of the counterparty decreases. A significantly higher degree of wrong-way correlation between a DPC counterparty and underlying derivative exposure would result in a significantly lower fair value.For equity derivatives, commodity derivatives, interest rate derivatives and structured liabilities, a significant change in long-dated rates and volatilities and correlation inputs (e.g., the degree of correlation between an equity security and an index, between two different commodities, between two different interest rates, or between interest rates and foreign exchange rates) would result in a significant impact to the fair value; however, the magnitude and direction of the impact depends on whether the Corporation is long or short the exposure. 202Table of ContentsNonrecurring Fair ValueThe Corporation holds certain assets that are measured at fair value, but only in certain situations (e.g., impairment) and these measurements are referred to herein as nonrecurring.

Appraisals are generally conducted every 90 days. Factors considered in determining the fair value include geographic sales trends, the value of comparable surrounding properties as well as the condition of the property. 203Table of ContentsNOTE 15 – Fair Value OptionThe Corporation elects to account for certain financial instruments under the fair value option.

The following disclosures include financial instruments where only a portion of the ending balance at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For more information on these financial instruments, see Note 20 – Fair Value Measurements and Note 22 – Fair Value of Financial Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe carrying values and fair values by fair value hierarchy of certain financial instruments where only a portion of the ending balance was carried at fair value at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 are presented in the table below.Fair Value of Financial Instruments March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014   Fair Value   Fair Value(Dollars in millions)CarryingValue Level 2 Level 3 Total CarryingValue Level 2 Level 3 TotalFinancial assets               Loans$839,962 $80,683 $780,895 $861,578 $842,259 $87,174 $776,370 $863,544Loans held-for-sale9,732 8,991 741 9,732 12,836 12,236 618 12,854Financial liabilities               Deposits$1,153,168 $1,153,707 $— $1,153,707 $1,118,936 $1,119,427 $— $1,119,427Long-term debt237,858 242,920 2,806 245,726 243,139 249,692 2,362 252,054Commercial Unfunded Lending CommitmentsFair values were generally determined using a discounted cash flow valuation approach which is applied using market-based CDS or internally developed benchmark credit curves. The Corporation accounts for certain loan commitments under the fair value option.The carrying values and fair values of the Corporation's commercial unfunded lending commitments were $866 million and $3.5 billion at March 31, 2015, and $932 million and $3.8 billion at December 31, 2014. Commercial unfunded lending commitments are primarily classified as Level 3. The carrying value of these commitments is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities.The Corporation does not estimate the fair values of consumer unfunded lending commitments because, in many instances, the Corporation can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing notice to the borrower. For more information on commitments, see Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies. 206Table of ContentsNOTE 17 – Mortgage Servicing RightsThe Corporation accounts for consumer MSRs at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in mortgage banking income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The Corporation manages the risk in these MSRs with securities including MBS and U.S. Treasury securities, as well as certain derivatives such as options and interest rate swaps, which are not designated as accounting hedges. The securities used to manage the risk in the MSRs are classified in other assets with changes in the fair value of the securities and the related interest income recorded in mortgage banking income.The table below presents activity for residential mortgage and home equity MSRs for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014.Rollforward of Mortgage Servicing Rights    Three Months EndedMarch 31(Dollars in millions)2015 2014Balance, January 1$3,530 $5,042Additions179 265Sales— (20)Amortization of expected cash flows (1)(230) (232)Impact of changes in interest rates and other market factors (2)(176) (317)Model and other cash flow assumption changes: (3)   Projected cash flows, including changes in costs to service loans87 (36)Impact of changes in the Home Price Index(12) (11)Impact of changes to the prepayment model9 160Other model changes (4)7 (86)Balance, March 31 (5)$3,394 $4,765Mortgage loans serviced for investors (in billions)$475 $542(1) Represents the net change in fair value of the MSR asset due to the recognition of modeled cash flows.(2) These amounts reflect the changes in modeled MSR fair value primarily due to observed changes in interest rates, volatility, spreads and the shape of the forward swap curve and periodic adjustments to valuation based on third-party price discovery.(3) These amounts reflect periodic adjustments to the valuation model to reflect changes in the modeled relationship between inputs and their impact on projected cash flows as well as changes in certain cash flow assumptions such as cost to service and ancillary income per loan.(4) These amounts include the impact of periodic recalibrations of the model to reflect changes in the relationship between market interest rate spreads and projected cash flows.(5) At March 31, 2015, includes $3.1 billion of U.S. and $286 million of non-U.S. consumer MSR balances compared to $4.6 billion and $188 million at March 31, 2014.The Corporation primarily uses an option-adjusted spread (OAS) valuation approach which factors in prepayment risk to determine the fair value of MSRs. This approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using risk-adjusted discount rates. In addition to updating the valuation model for interest, discount and prepayment rates, periodic adjustments are made to recalibrate the valuation model for factors used to project cash flows. The changes to the factors capture the effect of variances related to actual versus estimated servicing proceeds. 207Table of ContentsSignificant economic assumptions in estimating the fair value of MSRs at March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 are presented below. The change in fair value as a result of changes in OAS rates is included within "Model and other cash flow assumption changes" in the Rollforward of Mortgage Servicing Rights table. The weighted-average life is not an input in the valuation model but is a product of both changes in market rates of interest and changes in model and other cash flow assumptions. The weighted-average life represents the average period of time that the MSRs' cash flows are expected to be received. Absent other changes, an increase (decrease) to the weighted-average life would generally result in an increase (decrease) in the fair value of the MSRs.Significant Economic Assumptions March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 Fixed Adjustable Fixed AdjustableWeighted-average OAS4.60% 7.76% 4.52% 7.61%Weighted-average life, in years4.26 3.14 4.53 2.95The table below presents the sensitivity of the weighted-average lives and fair value of MSRs to changes in modeled assumptions. These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. As the amounts indicate, changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of MSRs that continue to be held by the Corporation is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities. The below sensitivities do not reflect any hedge strategies that may be undertaken to mitigate such risk.Sensitivity Impacts March 31, 2015 Change in Weighted-average Lives  (Dollars in millions)Fixed Adjustable Change inFair ValuePrepayment rates         Impact of 10% decrease0.23 years 0.19 years $226Impact of 20% decrease0.50   0.40   482          Impact of 10% increase(0.20)   (0.17)   (201)Impact of 20% increase(0.38)   (0.32)   (381)OAS level         Impact of 100 bps decrease        $140Impact of 200 bps decrease        292          Impact of 100 bps increase        (129)Impact of 200 bps increase        (249) 208Table of ContentsNOTE 18 – Business Segment InformationEffective January 1, 2015, to align the segments with how the Corporation manages the businesses in 2015, it changed its basis of presentation, and following such change, reports its results of operations through the following five business segments: Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), Global Banking, Global Markets and Legacy Assets & Servicing (LAS), with the remaining operations recorded in All Other. For more information on the Corporation's segment realignment, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles.Consumer BankingConsumer Banking offers a diversified range of credit, banking and investment products and services to consumers and small businesses. Consumer Banking product offerings include traditional savings accounts, money market savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, noninterest- and interest-bearing checking accounts, investment accounts and products, as well as credit and debit cards, residential mortgages and home equity loans, and direct and indirect loans to consumers and small businesses in the U.S. Customers and clients have access to a franchise network that stretches coast to coast through 32 states and the District of Columbia. The franchise network includes approximately 4,800 financial centers, 15,900 ATMs, nationwide call centers, and online and mobile platforms.Global Wealth & Investment ManagementGWIM provides a high-touch client experience through a network of financial advisors focused on clients with over $250,000 in total investable assets, as well as tailored solutions to meet clients' needs through a full set of brokerage, banking and retirement products. GWIM also provides comprehensive wealth management solutions targeted to high net worth and ultra high net worth clients, as well as customized solutions to meet clients' wealth structuring, investment management, trust and banking needs, including specialty asset management services.Global BankingGlobal Banking provides a wide range of lending-related products and services, integrated working capital management and treasury solutions to clients, and underwriting and advisory services through the Corporation's network of offices and client relationship teams. Global Banking's lending products and services include commercial loans, leases, commitment facilities, trade finance, real estate lending and asset-based lending. Global Banking's treasury solutions business includes treasury management, foreign exchange and short-term investing options. Global Banking also provides investment banking products to clients such as debt and equity underwriting and distribution, and merger-related and other advisory services. The economics of most investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Banking and Global Markets based on the activities performed by each segment. Global Banking clients generally include middle-market companies, commercial real estate firms, auto dealerships, not-for-profit companies, large global corporations, financial institutions, leasing clients, and mid-sized U.S.-based businesses requiring customized and integrated financial advice and solutions.Global MarketsGlobal Markets offers sales and trading services, including research, to institutional clients across fixed-income, credit, currency, commodity and equity businesses. Global Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both the primary and secondary markets. Global Markets provides market-making, financing, securities clearing, settlement and custody services globally to institutional investor clients in support of their investing and trading activities. Global Markets also works with commercial and corporate clients to provide risk management products using interest rate, equity, credit, currency and commodity derivatives, foreign exchange, fixed-income and mortgage-related products. As a result of market-making activities in these products, Global Markets may be required to manage risk in a broad range of financial products including government securities, equity and equity-linked securities, high-grade and high-yield corporate debt securities, syndicated loans, MBS, commodities and ABS. In addition, the economics of most investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Markets and Global Banking based on the activities performed by each segment. 209Table of ContentsLegacy Assets & ServicingLAS is responsible for mortgage servicing activities related to residential first mortgage and home equity loans serviced for others and loans held by the Corporation, including loans that have been designated as the LAS Portfolios, and manages certain legacy exposures related to mortgage originations, sales and servicing activities (e.g., litigation, representations and warranties). LAS also includes the results of MSR activities, including net hedge results. Home equity loans are held on the balance sheet of LAS, and residential mortgage loans are included as part of All Other. The financial results of the on-balance sheet loans are reported in the segment that owns the loans or in All Other.All OtherAll Other consists of ALM activities, equity investments, the international consumer card business, liquidating businesses, residual expense allocations and other. ALM activities encompass residential mortgage securities, interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities including the residual net interest income allocation, the impact of certain allocation methodologies and accounting hedge ineffectiveness. Additionally, certain residential mortgage loans that are managed by LAS are held in All Other. The results of certain ALM activities are allocated to the business segments.Basis of PresentationThe management accounting and reporting process derives segment and business results by utilizing allocation methodologies for revenue and expense. The net income derived for the businesses is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an activity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other methodologies and assumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of the business.Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income. The adjustment of net interest income to an FTE basis results in a corresponding increase in income tax expense. The segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies that are utilized to determine net income. The net interest income of the businesses includes the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. In segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, the Corporation allocates assets to match liabilities. Net interest income of the business segments also includes an allocation of net interest income generated by certain of the Corporation's ALM activities. Further, net interest income on an FTE basis includes market-related adjustments, which include acceleration of premium amortization (or discount accretion) on debt securities as the decline in long-term interest rates shortened the estimated lives of mortgage-related debt securities. Also included in market-related adjustments is hedge ineffectiveness that impacted net interest income.In addition, the business segments are impacted by the migration of customers and clients and their deposit, loan and brokerage balances between client-managed businesses. Subsequent to the date of migration, the associated net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense are recorded in the business to which the customers or clients migrated.The Corporation's ALM activities include an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of various derivatives and cash instruments to manage fluctuations in earnings and capital that are caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation's goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital. The results of a majority of the Corporation's ALM activities are allocated to the business segments and fluctuate based on the performance of the ALM activities. ALM activities include external product pricing decisions including deposit pricing strategies, the effects of the Corporation's internal funds transfer pricing process and the net effects of other ALM activities.Certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific business segment are allocated to the segments. The most significant of these expenses include data and item processing costs and certain centralized or shared functions. Data processing costs are allocated to the segments based on equipment usage. Item processing costs are allocated to the segments based on the volume of items processed for each segment. The costs of certain other centralized or shared functions are allocated based on methodologies that reflect utilization. 210Table of ContentsThe table below presents net income (loss) and the components thereto (with net interest income on an FTE basis) for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, and total assets at March 31, 2015 and 2014 for each business segment, as well as All Other.Results for Business Segments and All Other    At and for the Three Months Ended March 31     Total Corporation (1) Consumer Banking Global Wealth & Investment Management(Dollars in millions)2015 2014 2015 2014 2015 2014Net interest income (FTE basis)$9,670 $10,286 $4,871 $5,071 $1,351 $1,485Noninterest income11,751 12,481 2,579 2,580 3,166 3,062Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis)21,421 22,767 7,450 7,651 4,517 4,547Provision for credit losses765 1,009 716 809 23 23Noninterest expense15,695 22,238 4,389 4,495 3,459 3,359Income (loss) before income taxes (FTE basis)4,961 (480) 2,345 2,347 1,035 1,165Income tax expense (benefit) (FTE basis)1,604 (204) 870 879 384 436Net income (loss)$3,357 $(276) $1,475 $1,468 $651 $729Period-end total assets$2,143,545 $2,149,851 $613,130 $586,472 $272,777 $271,211           Global Banking Global Markets     2015 2014 2015 2014Net interest income (FTE basis)    $2,265 $2,507 $1,004 $1,002Noninterest income    2,024 2,028 3,599 4,015Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis)    4,289 4,535 4,603 5,017Provision for credit losses    96 281 21 19Noninterest expense    2,022 2,190 3,120 3,075Income before income taxes (FTE basis)    2,171 2,064 1,462 1,923Income tax expense (FTE basis)    806 773 517 610Net income    $1,365 $1,291 $945 $1,313Period-end total assets    $368,595 $359,786 $586,737 $594,792             Legacy Assets & Servicing All Other     2015 2014 2015 2014Net interest income (FTE basis)    $428 $377 $(249) $(156)Noninterest income    486 309 (103) 487Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis)    914 686 (352) 331Provision for credit losses    91 12 (182) (135)Noninterest expense    1,201 7,401 1,504 1,718Loss before income taxes (FTE basis)    (378) (6,727) (1,674) (1,252)Income tax benefit (FTE basis)    (140) (1,847) (833) (1,055)Net loss    $(238) $(4,880) $(841) $(197)Period-end total assets    $53,538 $58,605 $248,768 $278,985(1) There were no material intersegment revenues.             211Table of ContentsThe table below presents a reconciliation of the five business segments' total revenue, net of interest expense, on an FTE basis, and net income to the Consolidated Statement of Income, and total assets to the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
