Item 1A. Risk Factors  The following is added to the risk factors set forth under Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in the Corporation’s 2006 Annual Report on Form 10-K:  Certain credit markets experienced difficult conditions and volatility during 2007. These conditions resulted in less liquidity, greater volatility, widening of credit spreads and a lack of price transparency. The Corporation’s GCIB segment operates in these markets, either directly or indirectly, through exposures in securities, loans, derivatives and other commitments. While it is difficult to predict how long these conditions will exist and which markets, products or other businesses of the Corporation will ultimately be affected, these factors could continue to adversely impact the Corporation’s results of operations.    134    Table of Contents       Item 2.
