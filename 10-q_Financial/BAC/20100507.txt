Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on recent or proposed legislative and regulatory initiatives as well as other risks the Corporation is exposed to, including among others enhanced regulatory scrutiny or potential legal liability as a result of the recent financial crisis.    82    Table of Contents     Recent Events On December 9, 2009, we repurchased all shares of the TARP Preferred Stock, that we issued to the U.S. Treasury in 2008 and early 2009, by using $25.7 billion from excess liquidity and $19.3 billion in proceeds from the sale of 1.3 billion units of Common Equivalent Securities (CES) valued at $15.00 per unit. At the time we repurchased the TARP preferred stock, we did not repurchase the warrants that were issued in connection with the TARP preferred stock. The U.S. Treasury auctioned the warrants in March 2010.  The CES, consisting of Common Equivalent Junior Preferred Stock, Series S (Common Equivalent Stock) and contingent warrants, were issued because we did not have a sufficient number of authorized common shares available for issuance at the time we repurchased the TARP preferred stock. The Corporation held a special meeting of shareholders on February 23, 2010 at which we obtained stockholder approval of an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock, and following the effective date of the amendment, on February 24, 2010, the Common Equivalent Stock automatically converted in full into our common stock; the contingent warrants expired without having become exercisable and the CES ceased to exist.  On September 30 2009, the Corporation reached an agreement to sell the long-term asset management business of Columbia to Ameriprise Financial, Inc., for consideration of approximately $900 million to $1.2 billion subject to certain adjustments including, among other factors, assets under management (AUM) net flows. This includes the management of Columbia’s equity and fixed-income mutual funds and separate accounts. The transaction closed on April 30, 2010 and will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.        Recent Accounting Developments On January 1, 2010, the Corporation adopted new Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) accounting guidance on transfers of financial assets and consolidation of variable interest entities (VIEs). This new accounting guidance revises sale accounting criteria for transfers of financial assets, including elimination of the concept of and accounting for qualifying special purpose entities (QSPEs), and significantly changes the criteria for consolidation of a VIE. As described more fully in Note 8 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Corporation routinely transfers mortgage loans, credit card receivables and other financial instruments to special purpose entities (SPEs) that, prior to January 1, 2010, met the definition of a QSPE, which was not previously subject to consolidation by the transferor. Among other things, the new accounting standards eliminated the concept of a QSPE and as a result, former QSPEs are now subject to the consolidation guidance for VIEs. For more information on the new consolidation guidance, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.        Performance Overview Net income was $3.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2010, compared to $4.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2009. Including preferred stock dividends and accretion, net income applicable to common shareholders was $2.8 billion, or $0.28 per diluted common share, for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to $2.8 billion or $0.44 per diluted common share for the three months ended March 31, 2009. Revenue, net of interest expense on a FTE basis, declined $3.8 billion to $32.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2010 representing an 11 percent decrease from $36.1 billion in the same period in 2009.  Net interest income on a FTE basis increased $1.3 billion to $14.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. The increase was driven by the impact of adoption of the new consolidation guidance and deposit pricing, partially offset by lower commercial and consumer loan levels and lower yields on the credit card portfolio. The net interest yield on a FTE basis increased 23 bps to 2.93 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, due to the factors stated above.  Noninterest income decreased $5.1 billion to $18.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. Lower mortgage banking income and decreases in both card income and equity investment income drove the decline. Mortgage banking income decreased due to less favorable MSR results, net of hedges, and lower production volume and margins. Card income declined due to the adoption of new consolidation guidance and the CARD Act, while equity investment income was impacted by the absence of prior year pre-tax gains of $1.9 billion related to the sale of portions of our investment in China Construction Bank (CCB). In addition, other noninterest income declined due to    83    Table of Contents  lower credit valuation gains recorded on certain Merrill Lynch structured notes of $226 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to $2.2 billion in the same period in 2009.  The provision for credit losses decreased $3.6 billion to $9.8 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, reflecting improvement in the economy which drove decreased credit costs in both the consumer and commercial portfolios partially offset by higher net charge-offs due to the adoption of new consolidation guidance.  Noninterest expense increased five percent to $17.8 billion from $17.0 billion a year earlier as personnel costs and other general operating expenses rose. Pre-tax merger and restructuring charges declined to $521 million from $765 million a year earlier.           Segment Results Effective January 1, 2010, management realigned the former Global Banking and Global Markets business segments into Global Commercial Banking and GBAM. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These changes did not have an impact on the previously reported consolidated results of the Corporation. For additional information related to the business segments, see Note 17 – Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2)  For the three months ended March 31, 2009, Global Card Services is presented on a managed basis with a corresponding offset recorded in All Other. For the three months ended March 31, 2010, Global Card Services and All Other are presented in accordance with new consolidation guidance. Accordingly, current period Global Card Services results are comparable to prior period results that are presented on a managed basis. For more information on the new consolidation guidance, see Note 8 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For more information on the reconciliation of Global Card Services and All Other, see Note 17 – Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Deposits net income increased due to higher revenues partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Revenue increased mainly due to growth in deposits as well as improved spreads. Noninterest expense increased as a higher percentage of the retail distribution costs primarily related to banking centers shifted to Deposits from the other consumer segments.  Global Card Services reported net income compared to a net loss a year ago as credit costs declined reflecting continued improvement in the U.S. economy. Net revenue declined due to lower net interest income from a decrease in average loans and lower fee income resulting from the implementation of the CARD Act. Provision for credit losses decreased due to lower delinquencies and lower expected losses from the improved economic outlook which drove reserve reductions during the quarter. Noninterest expense declined as a higher percentage of the retail distribution costs primarily related to banking centers shifted to Deposits.  Home Loans & Insurance net loss widened as lower revenue combined with increased expenses and elevated credit costs negatively impacted results. Net revenue decreased primarily due to less favorable MSR performance and lower loan production income compared to the same period in 2009. The provision for credit losses increased driven by higher    84    Table of Contents  reserve additions due to continued stress in the housing market, the impact of certain modified loans that were written down to the underlying collateral value and higher home equity net charge-offs due to the adoption of new consolidation guidance. Noninterest expense rose due to expenses related to higher litigation costs and default management activities, including loss mitigation efforts.  Global Commercial Banking net income increased driven by lower credit costs and increased revenue primarily from higher net interest income. Net interest income increased as improved loan spreads on new, renewed and amended facilities more than offset the decline in loan balances due to reduced demand. Net interest income also benefited from strong deposit growth as clients remain very liquid, partially offset by narrower spreads on deposits. The provision for credit losses decreased primarily driven by lower credit costs in the retail dealer-related portfolio and stabilization across most commercial portfolios.  GBAM net income increased due to strong performance in sales and trading revenue. Noninterest income increased due to continued strong core trading results and lower write-downs on legacy assets, partially offset by lower gains on derivative liabilities related to our credit spreads. Noninterest expense decreased due to merger-related savings and a change in compensation that delivers a greater portion of incentive pay over time.  GWIM net income increased due to the impact of higher revenue due to increased investment and brokerage services income and the absence of support for cash funds as compared to the same period a year ago. These items were partially offset by lower net interest income due to the impact of the migration of certain deposits and loan balances to Deposits and Home Loans & Insurance.  All Other reported a net loss due to lower net revenue and increases in provision for credit losses and noninterest expense. Net revenue decreased as a result of lower gains related to credit valuation adjustments on Merrill Lynch structured notes compared to the same period a year ago. The increase in the provision for credit losses was driven by the impact of the new consolidation guidance and higher credit costs in the Countrywide purchased credit-impaired discontinued real estate portfolio, partially offset by lower reserve additions related to the residential mortgage portfolio. Noninterest expense increased due to higher personnel, general operating and other expenses.        Financial Highlights     Net Interest Income    Net interest income on a FTE basis increased $1.3 billion to $14.1 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. The increase was due to the impact of adoption of new consolidation guidance which contributed approximately $2.0 billion to the increase from the prior year. Additionally, net interest income benefited from deposit pricing partially offset by lower commercial and consumer loan levels and lower yields on the credit card portfolio. The net interest yield on a FTE basis increased 23 bps to 2.93 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to the factors stated above.    85    Table of Contents   Noninterest Income                   Table 3  Noninterest Income      Three Months Ended March 31   (Dollars in millions)   2010     2009    Card income   $ 1,976     $ 2,865     Service charges     2,566       2,533     Investment and brokerage services     3,025       2,963     Investment banking income     1,240       1,055     Equity investment income     625       1,202     Trading account profits     5,236       5,201     Mortgage banking income     1,500       3,314     Insurance income     715       688     Gains on sales of debt securities     734       1,498     Other income     1,204       2,313     Net impairment losses recognized in earnings on available-for-sale debt securities     (601 )      (371)    Total noninterest income   $ 18,220     $ 23,261  Noninterest income decreased $5.0 billion to $18.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. The following items highlight the significant changes.        •    Card income decreased $889 million primarily due to the impact of adoption of new consolidation guidance coupled with lower fee income from the implementation of the CARD Act and lower cash volumes. These items were partially offset by an increase in interchange income due to higher retail volume.        •    Investment banking income increased $185 million due to higher equity and debt issuance fees.        •    Equity investment income decreased $577 million due to the absence of the $1.9 billion pre-tax CCB related gain recorded during the prior year and a $331 million loss from the sale of our $2.7 billion discretionary equity securities portfolio partially offset by valuation gains related to selected investments in Global Principal Investing.        •    Trading account profits remained relatively flat with an increase of $35 million due to offsetting items including improved market conditions, increased liquidity and reduced write-downs on legacy assets partially offset by reduced credit valuation adjustments on derivative liabilities.        •    Mortgage banking income decreased $1.8 billion due to lower production and servicing income of $969 million and $845 million, respectively. The decrease in production income was primarily driven by lower production volume and margins and lower servicing income was due to less favorable MSR performance, net of hedges.        •    Gains on sales of debt securities decreased $764 million driven by lower sales of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS).        •    Other income decreased by $1.1 billion due to lower credit valuation adjustments recorded on Merrill Lynch structured notes compared to the prior year partially offset by reduced write-downs on legacy assets.        •    Net impairment losses recognized in earnings on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities increased $230 million driven by losses on non-agency collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs).      Provision for Credit Losses    The provision for credit losses decreased $3.6 billion to $9.8 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009.    86    Table of Contents The consumer portion of the provision for credit losses decreased $2.4 billion to $8.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. The decrease was due to reserve reductions in 2010 compared to reserve additions in 2009. The reserve reductions resulted from lower delinquencies and lower losses in the consumer credit card and unsecured consumer lending portfolios resulting from an improving economic outlook. Consumer real estate reserves were increased in the three months ended March 31, 2010 amid continued stress in the housing markets, however, at lower levels than the same period in the prior year. This improvement was partially offset by higher net charge-offs due to the impact of the adoption of new consolidation guidance resulting in the consolidation of certain securitized loan balances in our consumer credit card and home equity portfolios. In the consumer purchased credit-impaired portfolios, the addition to reserves to reflect further reductions in expected principal cash flows was $846 million in the first three months of 2010 compared to $853 million a year earlier.  The commercial portion of the provision for credit losses including the provision for unfunded lending commitments decreased $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. The decrease was due to a reserve reduction in the small business portfolio in 2010 compared to reserve additions in 2009 due to improved credit quality and changes in lending criteria implemented in 2008 and 2009.  Net charge-offs totaled $10.8 billion, or 4.44 percent of average loans and leases for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared with $6.9 billion, or 2.85 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2009. The increase in net charge-offs was due to the impact of adoption of new consolidation guidance resulting in consolidating certain securitized loan balances in our consumer credit card and home equity portfolios and losses on modified consumer real estate loans that were written down to the underlying collateral value.      Noninterest Expense                  Table 4  Noninterest Expense            Three Months Ended March 31   (Dollars in millions)   2010   2009    Personnel   $ 9,158   $ 8,768     Occupancy     1,172     1,128     Equipment     613     622     Marketing     487     521     Professional fees     517     405     Amortization of intangibles     446     520     Data processing     648     648     Telecommunications     330     327     Other general operating     3,883     3,298     Merger and restructuring charges     521     765    Total noninterest expense   $ 17,775   $ 17,002  Noninterest expense increased $773 million to $17.8 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. The increase was driven by higher personnel costs and litigation costs in other general operating expenses partially offset by a decrease in merger and restructuring charges of $244 million.      Income Tax Expense    Income tax expense was $1.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to $1.1 billion for the same period in 2009 and resulted in an effective tax rate of 27.5 percent compared to 21.0 percent in the prior year. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to permanent tax preference items offsetting a lower percentage of pre-tax earnings.  Long-standing deferral provisions applicable to active finance income earned by certain foreign subsidiaries expired for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2010. The impact of the expiration of these provisions, which is dependent upon the amount, composition and geographic mix of our 2010 earnings, resulted in additional income tax expense of $133    87    Table of Contents  million for the three months ended March 31, 2010. If these deferral provisions were to be re-enacted retroactive to January 1, 2010, which we expect to occur, this tax and any additional amounts recorded to date would be reversed. For more information on these provisions, refer to page 21 of the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Impact of Adopting New Consolidation Guidance    On January 1, 2010, the Corporation adopted new consolidation guidance resulting in the consolidation of certain former QSPEs and VIEs that were not recorded on the Corporation’s Consolidated Balance Sheet prior to that date. The adoption of this new consolidation guidance resulted in a net incremental increase in assets of $100.4 billion, including $69.7 billion resulting from consolidation of credit card trusts and $30.7 billion from consolidation of other SPEs including multi-seller conduits, and a net increase of $106.7 billion in total liabilities, including $84.4 billion of long-term debt. These amounts are net of retained interests in securitizations held on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2009 and a $10.8 billion increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses, the majority of which relates to credit card receivables. The Corporation recorded a $6.2 billion charge, net of tax, to retained earnings on January 1, 2010 for the cumulative effect of the adoption of this new consolidation guidance due primarily to the increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses, and a $116 million charge to accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI). The initial recording of these assets, related allowance for loan and lease losses, and liabilities on the Corporation’s Consolidated Balance Sheet had no impact at the date of adoption on consolidated results of operations. For additional detail on the impact of adopting this new consolidation guidance, refer to Note 8 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements.    88    Table of Contents   Assets    At March 31, 2010, total assets were $2.3 trillion, an increase of $115.4 billion from December 31, 2009. Changes from year end were largely attributable to the impact of adopting new consolidation guidance which increased loan balances, primarily in the credit card, commercial – domestic and home equity portfolios, partially offset by an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses. The impact of this new consolidation guidance was offset by lower consumer and commercial loan balances and loans held-for-sale (LHFS). Trading account assets increased as a result of the new consolidation guidance and higher levels of fixed-income securities. In addition, all other assets grew driven by an increase in cash and cash equivalents due to increased liquidity as a result of reduced loan demand.  For the three months ended March 31, 2010, average total assets decreased $9.4 billion compared to the same period in 2009. The decrease was due to lower loan balances, partially offset by the impact of adopting new consolidation guidance and an increase in debt securities driven by asset and liability management (ALM) activities. Changes in trading account assets, and all other assets were due to mark-to-market adjustments.      Liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity    At March 31, 2010, total liabilities were $2.1 trillion, an increase of $117.0 billion from December 31, 2009. The increase in total liabilities was attributable to the impact of adopting new consolidation guidance which increased long-term debt and short-term borrowings. In addition, changes in trading account liabilities reflected trading activity in fixed-income securities, including derivative portfolio hedges.  For the three months ended March 31, 2010, average total liabilities decreased $10.5 billion compared to the same period in 2009. The decrease was due to lower short-term borrowings, substantially offset by the impact of adopting new consolidation guidance and higher noninterest bearing deposits.  As of March 31, 2010, shareholders’ equity was $229.8 billion, a decrease of $1.6 billion from December 31, 2009. The decrease was attributable to the impact of adopting new consolidation guidance as we recorded a $6.2 billion charge to retained earnings due primarily to the increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses. The charge to retained earnings was partially offset by net income recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2010.  For the three months ended March 31, 2010, average shareholders’ equity increased $1.1 billion compared to the same period in 2009 driven by the same factors stated above offset by a reduction in accumulated other comprehensive loss.  Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management functions, primarily involving our portfolios of highly liquid assets, that are designed to ensure the adequacy of capital while enhancing our ability to manage liquidity requirements for the Corporation and for our customers, and to position the balance sheet in accordance with the Corporation’s risk appetite. The execution of these functions requires the use of balance sheet and capital related limits including spot, average and risk-weighted asset limits, particularly in our trading businesses.

Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently.  We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses (i.e., efficiency ratio and net interest yield) on a FTE basis. Although this is a non-GAAP measure, we believe managing the business with net interest income on a FTE basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.  As mentioned above, certain performance measures including the efficiency ratio and net interest yield utilize net interest income (and thus total revenue) on a FTE basis. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield evaluates how many bps we are earning over the cost of funds. During our annual planning process, we set efficiency targets for the Corporation and each line of business. We believe the use of this non-GAAP measure provides additional clarity in assessing our results. Targets vary by year and by business and are based on a variety of factors including maturity of the business, competitive environment, market factors, and other items including our risk appetite.  We evaluate our business based on ratios that utilize tangible equity. Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of common shareholders’ equity plus CES less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTE measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of average shareholders’ equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible common equity ratio represents common shareholders’ equity plus CES less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible equity ratio represents total shareholders’ equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents ending common shareholders’ equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity (i.e., capital). In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use ROTE as key measures to support our overall growth goals. We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation.  The aforementioned performance measures and ratios are presented in Table 6.    91    Table of Contents                   Table 7  Supplemental Financial Data and Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures            Three Months Ended March 31   (Dollars in millions)   2010         2009          Fully taxable-equivalent basis data                           Net interest income   $ 14,070        $ 12,819        Total revenue, net of interest expense     32,290          36,080        Net interest yield     2.93     %     2.70     %    Efficiency ratio     55.05           47.12          Reconciliation of net interest income to net interest income fully taxable-equivalent basis                   Net interest income   $ 13,749        $ 12,497        Fully taxable-equivalent adjustment     321           322         Net interest income fully taxable-equivalent basis   $ 14,070         $ 12,819          Reconciliation of total revenue, net of interest expense to total revenue, net of interest expense fully taxable-equivalent basis                   Total revenue, net of interest expense   $ 31,969        $ 35,758        Fully taxable-equivalent adjustment     321           322         Total revenue fully taxable-equivalent basis   $ 32,290         $ 36,080          Reconciliation of income tax expense to income tax expense fully taxable-equivalent basis                   Income tax expense   $ 1,207        $ 1,129        Fully taxable-equivalent adjustment     321           322         Income tax expense fully taxable-equivalent basis   $ 1,528         $ 1,451          Reconciliation of average common shareholders’ equity to average tangible common shareholders’ equity                   Common shareholders’ equity   $ 200,380        $ 160,739        Common Equivalent Securities     11,760          -        Goodwill     (86,334 )         (84,584 )       Intangible assets (excluding MSRs)     (11,906 )         (9,461 )       Related deferred tax liabilities     3,497           3,977         Tangible common shareholders’ equity   $ 117,397         $ 70,671          Reconciliation of average shareholders’ equity to average tangible shareholders’ equity                   Shareholders’ equity   $ 229,891        $ 228,766        Goodwill     (86,334 )         (84,584 )       Intangible assets (excluding MSRs)     (11,906 )         (9,461 )       Related deferred tax liabilities     3,497           3,977         Tangible shareholders’ equity   $ 135,148         $ 138,698          Reconciliation of period end common shareholders’ equity to period end tangible common shareholders’ equity                   Common shareholders’ equity   $ 211,859        $ 166,272        Goodwill     (86,305 )         (86,910 )       Intangible assets (excluding MSRs)     (11,548 )         (13,703 )       Related deferred tax liabilities     3,396           3,958         Tangible common shareholders’ equity   $ 117,402         $ 69,617          Reconciliation of period end shareholders’ equity to period end tangible shareholders’ equity                   Shareholders’ equity   $ 229,823        $ 239,549        Goodwill     (86,305 )         (86,910 )       Intangible assets (excluding MSRs)     (11,548 )         (13,703 )       Related deferred tax liabilities     3,396           3,958         Tangible shareholders’ equity   $ 135,366         $ 142,894          Reconciliation of period end assets to period end tangible assets                   Assets   $ 2,338,700        $ 2,321,963        Goodwill     (86,305 )         (86,910 )       Intangible assets (excluding MSRs)     (11,548 )         (13,703 )       Related deferred tax liabilities     3,396           3,958         Tangible assets   $ 2,244,243         $ 2,225,308         92    Table of Contents   Core Net Interest Income    We manage core net interest income which is reported net interest income on a FTE basis adjusted for the impact of market-based activities. As discussed in the GBAM business segment section beginning on page 107, we evaluate our market-based results and strategies on a total market-based revenue approach by combining net interest income and noninterest income for GBAM. In addition, prior periods are presented on a managed basis which adjusted for loans that we originated and subsequently sold into credit card securitizations. Noninterest income, rather than net interest income and provision for credit losses, was recorded for securitized assets as we are compensated for servicing the securitized assets and recorded servicing income and gains or losses on securitizations, where appropriate. Current period is presented in accordance with new consolidation guidance. An analysis of core net interest income, core average earning assets and core net interest yield on earning assets, which adjust for the impact of these two non-core items from reported net interest income on a FTE basis, is shown below. We believe the use of this non-GAAP presentation provides additional clarity in managing our results.

(6)  Calculated on an annualized basis.  n/a = not applicable  For the three months ended March 31, 2010, core net interest income decreased approximately $800 million to $12.9 billion compared to core net interest income on a managed basis of $13.7 billion for the same period in 2009. The decrease was driven by lower consumer loan levels compared to managed consumer loan levels for the same period in 2009, lower commercial loan levels and lower yields for the credit card portfolio.  For the three months ended March 31, 2010, core average earning assets decreased $108.5 billion to $1.4 trillion compared to core average earning assets on a managed basis of $1.5 trillion for the same period in 2009 primarily due to lower commercial loan levels and lower consumer loan levels compared to managed consumer loan levels for the same period in 2009.  For the three months ended March 31, 2010, core net interest yield increased six bps to 3.69 percent compared to core net interest yield on a managed basis of 3.63 percent for the same period in 2009 primarily due to improved deposit pricing and a change in the mix of deposits.    93    Table of Contents Table 9  Quarterly Average Balances and Interest Rates – FTE Basis

Deposits, Global Card Services, Home Loans & Insurance, Global Commercial Banking, GBAM and GWIM, with the remaining operations recorded in All Other. Effective January 1, 2010, we realigned the Global Corporate and Investment Banking portion of the former Global Banking segment with the former Global Markets business segment to form GBAM and to reflect Global Commercial Banking as a standalone segment. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.  We prepare and evaluate segment results using certain non-GAAP methodologies and performance measures, many of which are discussed in Supplemental Financial Data beginning on page 91. We begin by evaluating the operating results of the segments which by definition exclude merger and restructuring charges. The segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies which are utilized to determine net income. The net interest income of the business segments includes the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics.  Equity is allocated to business segments and related businesses using a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment’s standalone credit, market, interest rate and operational risk components. The nature of these risks is discussed further beginning on page 120. The Corporation benefits from the diversification of risk across these components which is reflected as a reduction to allocated equity for each segment. Average equity is allocated to the business segments and is affected by the portion of goodwill specifically assigned to them.  For more information on our basis of presentation, selected financial information for the business segments and reconciliations to consolidated total revenue, net income and period-end total assets, see Note 17 – Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.    96    Table of Contents     Deposits                   Three Months Ended March 31     (Dollars in millions)   2010     2009      Net interest income (1)   $ 2,146     $ 1,869      Noninterest income:              Service charges     1,479       1,501      All other income     7       2      Total noninterest income     1,486       1,503      Total revenue, net of interest expense     3,632       3,372          Provision for credit losses     37       88      Noninterest expense     2,505       2,323      Income before income taxes     1,090       961      Income tax expense (1)     407       361      Net income   $ 683     $ 600          Net interest yield (1)     2.11 %      2.02 %     Return on average equity     11.49       10.39      Efficiency ratio (1)     68.97       68.89          Balance Sheet                  Average              Total earning assets (2)   $ 412,371     $ 374,848      Total assets (2)     439,022       400,976      Total deposits     414,167       376,287      Allocated equity     24,110       23,419                 Period end   March 312010     December 312009      Total earning assets (2)   $ 416,160     $ 417,690      Total assets (2)     442,480       444,561      Total deposits     417,539       419,583         (1)  FTE basis        (2)  Total earning assets and total assets include asset allocations to match liabilities (i.e., deposits).  Deposits includes the results of consumer deposit activities which consist of a comprehensive range of products provided to consumers and small businesses. In addition, Deposits includes an allocation of ALM activities. In the U.S., we serve approximately 58 million consumer and small business relationships through a franchise that stretches coast to coast through 32 states and the District of Columbia utilizing our network of more than 5,900 banking centers, more than 18,000 domestic-branded ATMs, nationwide call centers and leading online and mobile banking platforms.  Our deposit products include traditional savings accounts, money market savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, and noninterest- and interest-bearing checking accounts. Deposit products provide a relatively stable source of funding and liquidity. We earn net interest spread revenue from investing this liquidity in earning assets through client-facing lending and ALM activities. The revenue is allocated to the deposit products using our funds transfer pricing process which takes into account the interest rates and maturity characteristics of the deposits. Deposits also generate fees such as account service fees, non-sufficient funds fees, overdraft charges and ATM fees.  During the third quarter of 2009, we announced changes in our overdraft fee policies intended to help customers limit overdraft fees. These changes negatively impacted net revenue beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009. In addition, in November 2009, the Federal Reserve issued amendments to Regulation E, effective July 1, 2010, which will negatively impact future service charge revenue in Deposits. For more information on Regulation E, see Regulatory Initiatives beginning on page 118.  During the three months ended March 31, 2010, our active online banking customer base grew to 29.9 million subscribers, a net increase of 250,000 subscribers from December 31, 2009 reflecting our continued focus on increasing the    97    Table of Contents  use of alternative banking channels. In addition, our active bill pay users paid $75.5 billion of bills online during the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to $76.5 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2009.  Deposits includes the net impact of migrating customers and their related deposit balances between the Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM) business within GWIM and Deposits. During the three months ended March 31, 2010, total deposits of $3.0 billion were migrated from Deposits to MLGWM. Conversely, $6.1 billion was migrated to Deposits from MLGWM during the same period in the prior year. The directional shift was mainly due to client segmentation threshold changes resulting from the Merrill Lynch acquisition. Subsequent to the date of migration, the associated net interest income, service charges and noninterest expense are recorded in the business to which deposits were transferred.  Net income rose $83 million, or 14 percent, to $683 million in the three months ended March 31, 2010 as net revenue rose, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $277 million, or 15 percent, to $2.1 billion as a result of deposit growth as well as improved spreads. Average deposits grew $37.9 billion, or 10 percent, due to the impact of transfers of certain households’ deposits from the MLGWM business within GWIM and strong organic growth. This increase was partially offset by the expected decline in higher-yielding Countrywide deposits.  Noninterest income remained relatively flat at $1.5 billion. The positive impacts of revenue initiatives were offset by the negative impact of the overdraft policy changes implemented effective in the fourth quarter of 2009 aimed at helping customers limit overdraft fees.  Noninterest expense increased $182 million, or eight percent, as a higher percentage of the retail distribution costs, primarily related to banking centers, shifted to Deposits from the other consumer segments. Also included are FDIC charges of $226 million at March 31, 2010 as compared to $171 million during the same period in 2009.    98    Table of Contents     Global Card Services                   Three Months Ended March 31     (Dollars in millions)   2010     2009 (1)      Net interest income (2)   $ 4,818     $ 5,199      Noninterest income:              Card income     1,881       2,114      All other income     105       135      Total noninterest income     1,986       2,249      Total revenue, net of interest expense     6,804       7,448          Provision for credit losses     3,535       8,221      Noninterest expense     1,751       2,039      Income (loss) before income taxes     1,518       (2,812 )     Income tax expense (benefit) (2)     566       (1,060 )     Net income (loss)   $ 952     $ (1,752 )         Net interest yield (2)     10.32 %      9.41 %     Return on average equity     8.94       n/m      Efficiency ratio (2)     25.74       27.38          Balance Sheet                  Average              Total loans and leases   $ 189,307     $ 224,013      Total earning assets     189,353       224,013      Total assets     195,874       242,586      Allocated equity     43,176       39,990                 Period end   March 312010     December 312009      Total loans and leases   $ 181,763     $ 196,289      Total earning assets     182,267       196,046      Total assets     191,027       212,695           (1)  2009 amounts are presented on a managed basis.

(2)  FTE basis         n/m  = not meaningful  Global Card Services provides a broad offering of products including U.S. consumer and business card, consumer lending, international card and debit card to consumers and small businesses. We provide credit card products to customers in the U.S., Canada, Ireland, Spain and the United Kingdom. We offer a variety of co-branded and affinity credit and debit card products and are one of the leading issuers of credit cards through endorsed marketing in the U.S. and Europe. On February 22, 2010, the majority of the provisions in the CARD Act went into effect and negatively affected net interest income during the three months ended March 31, 2010 due to the restrictions on our ability to reprice credit cards based on risk and card income due to restrictions imposed on certain fees. For more information on the CARD Act, see Regulatory Initiatives beginning on page 118.  The Corporation reports its Global Card Services first quarter 2010 results in accordance with new consolidation guidance. Under this new consolidation guidance, we consolidated all credit card trusts. Accordingly, current period results are comparable to prior period results that are presented on a managed basis. For more information on managed basis, refer to Note 23 – Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K and for more information on new consolidation guidance, refer to Impact of Adopting New Accounting Guidance on Consolidation on page 88 and Note 8 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Global Card Services recorded net income of $952 million in the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to a net loss of $1.8 billion for the same period of 2009 as credit costs declined, reflecting continued improvement in the U.S. economy. Net revenue decreased due to lower net interest income from the decline in average loans and lower fee income    99    Table of Contents  resulting from the implementation of the CARD Act. Provision for credit losses decreased as lower delinquencies and lower expected losses from the improved economic outlook drove reserve reductions during the quarter.  Net interest income decreased to $4.8 billion in the three months ended March 31, 2010 from $5.2 billion for the same period of 2009 due to a decrease in average loans of $34.7 billion, or 15 percent, partially offset by increased loan spreads due to the beneficial impact of lower short-term rates on our funding costs.  Noninterest income decreased $263 million, or 12 percent, to $2.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2010 due to decreases in card income of $233 million, or 11 percent. The decrease in card income resulted mainly from a decline in late fees that was driven by the implementation of the CARD Act which reduced fees by $97 million and lower billed fees due to delinquencies of $106 million. In addition, the decrease in card income was driven by lower cash advance fees and overlimit fees. These decreases were partially offset by increased interchange income, primarily due to higher rate and retail volume related to debit card, and the absence of the prior year’s negative valuation adjustment recorded on the interest-only strip.  Provision for credit losses decreased $4.7 billion to $3.5 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to an improved economic outlook, which led to reserve reductions in the consumer card, unsecured consumer lending and small business portfolios in 2010. Reserves were increased for these portfolios during the three months ended March 31, 2009. These items were partially offset by higher net charge-offs, which peaked in the third quarter of 2009 and continue to improve, but remain elevated compared to the same period last year.  Noninterest expense decreased $288 million, or 14 percent, to $1.8 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2010 as a higher percentage of the distribution costs primarily related to banking centers shifted to Deposits from Global Card Services.    100    Table of Contents The table below and the following discussion present selected key indicators for the Global Card Services segment and credit card portfolios.

The increase was due to economic deterioration experienced during 2009, which continued to impact results during the three months ended March 31, 2010 resulting in elevated levels of unemployment and underemployment. Net charge-off ratios were further impacted by lower loan balances partially driven by reduced marketing and revised credit criteria.  Credit card net charge-offs increased $800 million to $4.6 billion, or 12.00 percent, of average credit card outstandings, for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to managed credit card losses of $3.8 billion, or 8.62 percent, in the same period in 2009. These increases were due to the same factors noted above along with a higher level of bankruptcies.    101    Table of Contents                     Home Loans & Insurance                   Three Months Ended March 31     (Dollars in millions)   2010     2009      Net interest income (1)   $ 1,213     $ 1,191      Noninterest income:              Mortgage banking income     1,641       3,420      Insurance income     590       581      All other income     180       43      Total noninterest income     2,411       4,044      Total revenue, net of interest expense     3,624       5,235          Provision for credit losses     3,600       3,372      Noninterest expense     3,328       2,655      Loss before income taxes     (3,304)       (792)      Income tax benefit (1)     (1,233)       (298)      Net loss   $ (2,071)     $ (494)          Net interest yield (1)     2.58 %      2.64 %     Efficiency ratio (1)     91.81       50.72          Balance Sheet                  Average              Total loans and leases   $ 133,745     $ 125,544      Total earning assets     190,805       182,811      Total assets     234,116       219,110      Allocated equity       27,280             14,870         Period end   March 312010     December 312009      Total loans and leases   $ 132,428     $ 131,302      Total earning assets     183,898       188,349      Total assets     224,570       232,588         (1)  FTE basis  Home Loans & Insurance generates revenue by providing an extensive line of consumer real estate products and services to customers nationwide. Home Loans & Insurance products are available to our customers through a retail network of more than 5,900 banking centers, mortgage loan officers in nearly 800 locations and a sales force offering our customers direct telephone and online access to our products. These products are also offered through our correspondent and wholesale loan acquisition channels. Home Loans & Insurance products include fixed and adjustable rate first-lien mortgage loans for home purchase and refinancing needs, reverse mortgages, home equity lines of credit and home equity loans. First mortgage products are either sold into the secondary mortgage market to investors, while retaining MSRs and the Bank of America customer relationships, or are held on our balance sheet in All Other for ALM purposes. Home Loans & Insurance is not impacted by the Corporation’s mortgage production retention decisions as Home Loans & Insurance is compensated for the decision on a management accounting basis with a corresponding offset recorded in All Other. In addition, Home Loans & Insurance offers property, casualty, life, disability and credit insurance.  Home Loans & Insurance includes the impact of transferring customers and their related loan balances between GWIM and Home Loans & Insurance based on client segmentation thresholds. Subsequent to the date of migration, the associated net interest income and noninterest expense are recorded in the business to which the customers were transferred. Total home equity loans of $384 million were transferred from GWIM in the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to $7.6 billion in the same period of 2009.  Home Loans & Insurance recorded a net loss of $2.1 billion in the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to a net loss of $494 million for the same period in 2009, due to a decline in noninterest income, increased noninterest expense and higher credit costs.    102    Table of Contents Net interest income grew $22 million, driven primarily by an increase in average LHFS and home equity loans. The $1.6 billion increase in average LHFS was the result of higher balances carrying into the period. The growth in average home equity loans of $9.0 billion, or seven percent, was due primarily to the migration of home equity loans from GWIM to Home Loans & Insurance in the first quarter of 2009 and the consolidation of $4.5 billion of home equity loan securitization trusts due to the impact of the new consolidation guidance. For further information, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Noninterest income decreased $1.6 billion to $2.4 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2010 due to declines in mortgage banking income as a result of lower production income due to lower volume and margins resulting from declines in the market demand for refinances. The volume impact of the smaller mortgage market was partially offset by an increase in market share. In addition, the decline in mortgage banking income was driven by lower servicing income due to less favorable MSR results, net of hedges.  Provision for credit losses increased $228 million to $3.6 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. This increase was due primarily to higher reserve additions amid continued stress in the housing markets, the impact related to certain modified loans that were written-down to the underlying collateral value and net charge-offs related to home equity VIEs that were consolidated under new consolidation guidance. These items were partially offset by a lower reserve addition in the Countrywide purchased credit-impaired home equity portfolio compared with the same period in the prior year.  Noninterest expense increased $673 million to $3.3 billion due to litigation costs and expenses related to default management staff, including loss mitigation efforts.  Mortgage Banking Income  We categorize Home Loans & Insurance mortgage banking income into production and servicing income. Production income is comprised of revenue from the fair value gains and losses recognized on our interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and LHFS, the related secondary market execution, and costs related to representations and warranties in the sales transactions along with other obligations incurred in the sales of mortgage loans. In addition, production income includes revenue for transfers of mortgage loans from Home Loans & Insurance to the ALM portfolio related to the Corporation’s mortgage production retention decisions which is eliminated in All Other.  Servicing activities primarily include collecting cash for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers, disbursing customer draws for lines of credit and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors and escrow payments to third parties. Our home retention efforts are also part of our servicing activities, along with responding to customer inquiries and supervising foreclosures and property dispositions. Servicing income includes ancillary income earned in connection with these activities such as late fees, and MSR valuation adjustments, net of economic hedge activities.  The following table summarizes the components of mortgage banking income.

Production income of $761 million represented a decrease of $913 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. This decrease was attributable in part to a 15 percent decline in production volume resulting from weaker market demand for refinance transactions partially offset by an increase in our market share. Also    103    Table of Contents  contributing to the decline were lower pricing margins due to increased competition. In addition, representations and warranties expense increased to $526 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010 from $434 million in the same period in 2009 due to increased estimates of defaults reflecting uncertainty in the housing markets combined with a higher rate of repurchase or similar requests. For additional information regarding representations and warranties, see Note 8 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Residential Mortgage beginning on page 133.  Net servicing income decreased $866 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 largely due to lower MSR results, net of hedges, partially offset by a decrease in the impact of customer payments. For additional information on MSRs and the related hedge instruments, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management on page 173.

First mortgage production in Home Loans & Insurance was $67.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to $79.1 billion in the same period of 2009. The decrease of $11.8 billion was driven by weaker market demand for refinance transactions partially offset by an increase in market share. Home equity production was $1.8 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to $2.9 billion in the same period of 2009. The decrease of $1.1 billion was primarily due to more stringent underwriting guidelines for home equity lines of credit and loans as well as lower consumer demand.  At March 31, 2010, the consumer MSR balance was $18.8 billion, which represented 110 bps of the related unpaid principal balance as compared to $19.5 billion, or 113 bps of the related principal balance at December 31, 2009.    104    Table of Contents     Global Commercial Banking                   Three Months Ended March 31      (Dollars in millions)   2010     2009       Net interest income (1)   $ 2,189     $ 1,970      Noninterest income:              Service charges     542       509      All other income     276       204      Total noninterest income     818       713      Total revenue, net of interest expense     3,007       2,683          Provision for credit losses     916       1,765      Noninterest expense     954       961      Income (loss) before income taxes     1,137       (43)      Income tax expense (benefit) (1)     424       (13)       Net income (loss)   $ 713     $ (30)          Net interest yield (1)     3.36 %      3.36 %     Return on average equity     6.82       n/m      Efficiency ratio (1)     31.71       35.77          Balance Sheet                  Average              Total loans and leases   $ 211,683     $ 235,386      Total earning assets (2)     263,988       237,729      Total assets (2)     294,505       270,072      Total deposits     143,357       118,489      Allocated equity     42,410       39,468                 Period end   March 312010     December 312009      Total loans and leases   $ 209,113     $ 213,181      Total earning assets (2)     270,778       264,512      Total assets (2)     301,132       295,607      Total deposits     145,448       146,899         (1)  FTE basis        (2)  Total earning assets and total assets include asset allocations to match liabilities (i.e., deposits).   n/m = not meaningful  Global Commercial Banking provides a wide range of lending-related products and services, integrated working capital management and treasury solutions to clients through our network of offices and client relationship teams along with various product partners. Our clients include business banking and middle-market companies, commercial real estate firms and governments, and are generally defined as companies with sales up to $2 billion. Our lending products and services include commercial loans and commitment facilities, real estate lending, asset-based lending and indirect consumer loans. Our capital management and treasury solutions include treasury management, foreign exchange and short-term investing options.  Global Commercial Banking recorded net income of $713 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to a net loss of $30 million for the same period in 2009, primarily driven by lower provision and increased revenue.  Net interest income increased $219 million, or 11 percent, as improved loan spreads on new, renewed and amended facilities more than offset the $23.7 billion, or 10 percent, decline in average loan balances due to client deleveraging and lower new loan demand. Net interest income also benefited from the growth in average deposits of $24.9 billion, or 21 percent, as clients remain very liquid, however, this increase was muted by narrowing deposit spreads.  Noninterest income increased $105 million, or 15 percent, to $818 million, due to higher service charges and all other income. All other income increased $72 million, or 35 percent, compared to the prior year mainly driven by a valuation adjustment related to our commitment to purchase certain retail automotive loans. Service charges increased $33    105    Table of Contents  million, or six percent, due to an increase in unfunded loan commitment fees partially offset by lower treasury services charges reflecting lower transaction volumes and higher compensating balances.  The provision for credit losses was $916 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to $1.8 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2009. The decrease was primarily driven by lower credit costs in the retail dealer-related portfolio and stabilization across most commercial portfolios.  Global Commercial Banking Revenue  Global Commercial Banking revenues can also be categorized as business lending revenue and treasury services revenue.  Business lending revenue increased $255 million, or 16 percent, to $1.9 billion as improved loan spreads on new, renewed and amended facilities more than offset the decline in average loan balances. Additionally, the increase was attributable to the noninterest income factors described above.  Treasury services revenue increased $69 million, or six percent, to $1.1 billion benefitting from the growth in average deposits as clients remained very liquid. However, this increase was muted by narrowing deposit spreads and lower treasury services charges.    106    Table of Contents      Global Banking & Markets                  Three Months Ended March 31    (Dollars in millions)   2010   2009    Net interest income (1)   $ 2,171    $ 2,794     Noninterest income:           Investment and brokerage services     636      631    Investment banking income     1,217      1,120    Trading account profits     5,072      4,969    All other income (loss)     680      (533)    Total noninterest income     7,605      6,187    Total revenue, net of interest expense     9,776      8,981         Provision for credit losses     256      347     Noninterest expense     4,386      4,724    Income before income taxes     5,134      3,910     Income tax expense (1)     1,916      1,401    Net income   $ 3,218    $ 2,509         Return on average equity     23.64%     22.05%     Efficiency ratio (1)     44.86      52.60         Balance Sheet                Average            Total trading-related assets (2)   $ 509,492    $ 538,443     Total loans and leases     101,185      123,061     Total market-based earning assets     527,319      489,814     Total earning assets     623,863      612,046     Total assets     782,415      836,939     Total deposits     104,126      104,029     Allocated equity       55,211          46,147              Period end    March 31 2010    December 31 2009            Total trading-related assets (2)   $ 441,087    $ 411,562     Total loans and leases     97,729      97,986     Total market-based earning assets     440,305      404,315     Total earning assets     528,693      502,141     Total assets     685,870      654,057     Total deposits     105,126      102,218        (1)  FTE basis        (2)  Includes assets which are not considered earning assets (i.e., derivative assets).

Our corporate clients are generally defined as companies with sales greater than $2 billion. GBAM also includes the results of our merchant processing joint venture, Banc of America Merchant Services, LLC.    107    Table of Contents Net income increased $709 million to $3.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to strong core trading results, increased noninterest income due to reduced write-downs on legacy assets and decreased noninterest expense which were partially offset by lower net interest income. For the three months ended March 31, 2010, net interest income decreased $623 million to $2.2 billion due to lower spreads on trading-related assets and lower average loans and leases, which decreased $21.9 billion, or 18 percent, driven primarily by reduced demand, partially offset by higher earned spreads on deposits. Net interest income is both market-based, which is related to sales and trading, and core, which is related to credit and treasury services. Noninterest income increased $1.4 billion due to increased sales and trading revenue, including decreased write-downs on legacy assets, partially offset by lower gains on derivative liabilities related to our credit spreads. Noninterest expense decreased $338 million attributable to merger-related savings and a change in compensation that delivers a greater portion of incentive pay over time.  GBAM includes sales and trading revenue, investment banking income, business lending revenue and treasury services revenue.  Sales and Trading Revenue  Sales and trading revenue is segregated into fixed-income including investment and noninvestment grade corporate debt obligations, commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and collateralized debt obligations (CDO); currencies including interest rate and foreign exchange contracts; commodities including primarily futures, forwards, swaps and options; and equity income from equity-linked derivatives and cash equity activity.

Sales and trading revenue increased $788 million to $7.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2010, compared to $6.3 billion in the same period in 2009 due to improved market conditions and increased market liquidity. FICC revenue increased $747 million to $5.5 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to credit and structured products which continued to benefit from improved market liquidity, tighter credit spreads and increased demand. Improved results in these businesses and increased demand for mortgage-backed products were partially offset by declines in the rates and currencies businesses. Additionally, we recorded a net credit spread gain on derivative liabilities of $169 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to $1.7 billion in the same period in 2009, due to a smaller increase in our credit spread during 2010 than what was experienced in the prior year. The reduction in our credit spread gain year over year was offset by the decrease in write-downs on legacy assets.  Write-downs on legacy assets were $34 million as compared to $1.7 billion in the same period in 2009. Write-downs on legacy assets consist primarily of the following items, as well as the results of our CDO exposure.        •    For the three months ended March 31, 2010, we incurred $70 million of losses resulting from our monoline exposure, including our CDS hedge positions, compared to $1.2 billion in losses for the same period in 2009, which reflects the stabilizing credit quality of the monolines. For more information on our CDS position with monoline exposure, see page 111.        •    For the three months ended March 31, 2010, we recorded $195 million of losses, net of hedges, on CMBS funded debt and forward finance commitments compared to losses of $174 million in 2009. These losses were concentrated in the more difficult to hedge floating-rate debt. In addition, we recorded $150 million in losses associated with equity investments we made in acquisition-related financing transactions for the three months ended March 31, 2009, but had no such writedowns for the same period in 2010. At March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, we held $4.7 billion and $5.3 billion, of funded and unfunded CMBS exposure of which $3.8 billion and $4.4 billion were primarily floating-rate acquisition-related financings to major, well-known operating companies.        •    We incurred losses in our leveraged loan exposures of $3 million compared to $98 million in the same period in 2009. At March 31, 2010, the carrying value of our leveraged funded positions held for distribution was $2.8 billion, compared to $2.4 billion at December 31, 2009. At March 31, 2010, 98 percent of the carrying value of the leveraged funded positions was senior secured.    108    Table of Contents     •    We recorded a gain of $257 million on structured credit trading products for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to a gain of $268 million in the same period in 2009.        •    We recorded a gain of $141 million on auction rate securities (ARS) for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to a loss of $77 million in the same period in 2009 which reflects overall spread tightening as well as gains from negotiated tenders back to issuers. At March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, we had ARS exposure with a market value of $11.6 billion and $12.8 billion. At March 31, 2010, we had no outstanding buyback commitments to repurchase ARS.  Equity income increased $41 million due to strong derivative demand and stable sales commissions, partially offset by lower financing revenues due to spread tightening.  Investment Banking Income  Product specialists within Global Banking & Markets underwrite and distribute debt and equity securities, and certain other loan products, and provide advisory services. To provide a complete discussion of our consolidated investment banking income, the following table presents total investment banking income for the Corporation, including $1.22 billion of the $1.28 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and $1.12 billion of the $1.14 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2009 recorded in GBAM.                    Three Months Ended March 31    (Dollars in millions)   2010     2009    Investment banking income            Advisory (1)   $ 167     $ 329    Debt issuance     773       655    Equity issuance     344       157        1,284       1,141    Offset for intercompany fees (2)     (44 )      (86)    Total investment banking income   $ 1,240     $ 1,055        (1)  Advisory includes fees on debt and equity advisory and mergers and acquisitions.        (2)  Represents the offset to fees paid on the Corporation’s transactions.  Investment banking income increased $185 million to $1.2 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. The increase was largely due to favorable market conditions for equity and debt issuances, partially offset by reduced mergers and acquisitions activity. Equity issuance fees increased $187 million due to strong deal flows and improved market conditions. Debt issuance fees increased $118 million due primarily to increased leveraged finance and investment grade bond issuances. Advisory fees decreased $162 million attributable to a decline in mergers and acquisitions activity.  Business Lending Revenue  Business lending revenue of $969 million increased $97 million, or 11 percent, primarily due to portfolio optimization and gains on the fair value option book, partially offset by unfavorable hedge results. Net interest income benefited marginally from widening credit spreads and higher earnings on economic capital, partially offset by a decline in loan balances due to subdued credit demand resulting from economic conditions and strengthening of capital markets.  Treasury Services Revenue  Treasury services revenue of $675 million decreased $76 million, or 10 percent, driven primarily by decreased noninterest income. The decline was mainly in card income due to the formation of the merchant services joint venture in the second quarter of 2009, which was partially offset by our share in the earnings from the joint venture. Net interest income increased with an improvement in deposit mix between interest bearing and noninterest bearing, and spreads.  During the second quarter of 2009, we entered into a joint venture agreement with First Data Corporation (First Data) to form Banc of America Merchant Services, LLC. The joint venture provides payment solutions, including credit, debit and prepaid cards, and check and e-commerce payments to merchants ranging from small businesses to corporate and commercial clients worldwide. At March 31, 2010, we owned 46.5 percent of the joint venture and we account for our investment under the equity method of accounting. In addition to Bank of America and First Data Corporation, the remaining stake is held by a third party. Under the terms of the venture, the third party investor has the right to put its interest to the joint venture which would have the effect of increasing the Corporation’s ownership interest to 49 percent.    109    Table of Contents Collateralized Debt Obligation Exposure at March 31, 2010  CDO vehicles hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities and issue multiple tranches of debt securities including commercial paper, mezzanine and equity securities. Our CDO exposure can be divided into funded and unfunded super senior liquidity commitment exposure, other super senior exposure (i.e., cash positions and derivative contracts), warehouse, and sales and trading positions. For more information on our CDO liquidity commitments, see Note 8 – Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Super senior exposure represents the most senior class of commercial paper or notes that are issued by the CDO vehicles. These financial instruments benefit from the subordination of all other securities issued by the CDO vehicles.  For the three months ended March 31, 2010, we incurred $292 million of losses resulting from our CDO exposure which includes our super senior, warehouse, sales and trading positions, hedging activities and counterparty credit risk valuations. This compares to $525 million in CDO-related losses for the same period in 2009. Included in these losses were $94 million and $209 million of losses related to counterparty risk on our CDO-related exposure. Also included in these losses were other-than-temporary impairment charges of $240 million compared to $306 million in the same period in 2009 related to CDOs and retained positions classified as AFS debt securities.  As presented in the following table at March 31, 2010, our hedged and unhedged super senior CDO exposure before consideration of insurance, net of write-downs, was $2.9 billion. For additional information on our CDO positions, including the super senior CDO exposure in the table below, and our maximum exposure to loss, see Note 8 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

(2)  Includes highly rated collateralized loan obligations and CMBS super senior exposure.        (3)  Hedged amounts are presented at carrying value before consideration of the insurance.  We value our CDO structures using market-standard models to model the specific collateral composition and cash flow structure of each deal. Key inputs to the model are prepayment rates, default rates and severities for each collateral type, and other relevant contractual features. Unrealized losses recorded in accumulated OCI on super senior cash positions and retained positions from liquidated CDOs in aggregate increased $54 million to $158 million at March 31, 2010.  At March 31, 2010, total subprime super senior unhedged exposure of $1.2 billion was marked at 13 percent, including $390 million of retained positions from liquidated CDOs, and the $314 million of non-subprime unhedged exposure was marked at 27 percent of the original net exposure amounts. Net hedged subprime super senior exposure of $711 million was marked at 14 percent and the $617 million of hedged non-subprime super senior exposure was marked at 62 percent of its original net exposure.

For the three months    110    Table of Contents  ended March 31, 2010, we recorded $109 million of counterparty credit risk-related write-downs on these positions. At December 31, 2009, the monoline wrap on our super senior CDOs had a notional value of $3.8 billion, with a receivable of $2.8 billion and a counterparty credit valuation adjustment of $1.9 billion, or 66 percent. In addition, we held collateral in the form of cash and marketable securities of $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion at March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 related to our non-monoline purchased insurance.  In addition to the monoline financial guarantor exposure related to super senior CDOs, at March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, we had $37.5 billion and $38.8 billion of notional exposure to monolines that predominantly hedge corporate collateralized loan obligation and CDO exposure as well as CMBS, RMBS and other ABS cash and synthetic exposures. Mark-to-market monoline derivative credit exposure was $7.4 billion at March 31, 2010 compared to $8.3 billion at December 31, 2009. This decrease was driven by positive valuation adjustments on legacy assets and terminated monoline contracts.  At March 31, 2010, the counterparty credit valuation adjustment related to non-super senior CDO monoline derivative exposure was $3.8 billion which reduced our net mark-to-market exposure to $3.6 billion. We do not hold collateral against these derivative exposures. Also, during the three months ended March 31, 2010, we recognized gains of $39 million for counterparty credit risk related to these positions.  With the Merrill Lynch acquisition, we acquired a loan with a carrying value of $4.4 billion as of March 31, 2010 that is collateralized by U.S. super senior ABS CDOs. Merrill Lynch originally provided financing to the borrower for an amount equal to approximately 75 percent of the fair value of the collateral. The loan has full recourse to the borrower and all scheduled payments on the loan have been received. Events of default under the loan are customary events of default, including failure to pay interest when due and failure to pay principal at maturity. Collateral for the loan is excluded from our CDO exposure discussions and the applicable tables.    111    Table of Contents      Global Wealth & Investment Management                                Three Months Ended March 31, 2010   (Dollars in millions)    Total    Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management     U.S.  Trust    Columbia Management     Other     Net interest income (loss) (1)   $ 1,391       $ 1,105      $ 361      $ —    $ (75)     Noninterest income:                                 Investment and brokerage services     2,391         1,586        315        273      217    All other income     627         427         12         4      184    Total noninterest income     3,018         2,013         327         277      401    Total revenue, net of interest expense     4,409         3,118        688        277      326                Provision for credit losses     242         58        184        —      —     Noninterest expense     3,374         2,488         447         218      221    Income before income taxes     793         572        57        59      105     Income tax expense (1)     296         212         21         22      41    Net income   $ 497       $ 360       $ 36       $ 37    $ 64                Net interest yield (1)     2.52   %      2.44   %     2.89   %     n/m      n/m     Return on average equity (2)     8.83         16.02        2.67        13.04      n/m     Efficiency ratio (1)     76.52         79.80        65.07        n/m      n/m     Period end – total assets (3)   $ 261,243       $ 207,683       $ 53,468       $ 2,064      n/m          Three Months Ended March 31, 2009   (Dollars in millions)   Total   Merrill LynchGlobal WealthManagement    U.S. Trust   ColumbiaManagement   Other    Net interest income (loss) (1)   $ 1,662       $ 1,382      $ 357      $ 12    $ (89)     Noninterest income:                                 Investment and brokerage services     2,310         1,538        317        260      195    All other income (loss)     374         400         16         (122)     80    Total noninterest income     2,684         1,938         333         138      275    Total revenue, net of interest expense     4,346         3,320        690        150      186                Provision for credit losses     254         223        31        —      —     Noninterest expense     3,322         2,389         491         217      225    Income (loss) before income taxes     770         708        168        (67)     (39)     Income tax expense (benefit) (1)     291         262         62         (25)     (8)    Net income (loss)   $ 479       $ 446       $ 106       $ (42)   $ (31)                Net interest yield (1)     2.76   %      2.70   %     2.73   %     n/m      n/m     Return on average equity (2)     11.10         25.18        8.80        n/m      n/m     Efficiency ratio (1)     76.45         71.95        71.11        n/m      n/m     Period end – total assets (3)   $ 268,607       $ 215,943       $ 56,419       $ 2,642      n/m       (1)  FTE basis       (2)  Average allocated equity for GWIM was $22.8 billion and $17.5 billion at March 31, 2010 and 2009.

GWIM provides a wide offering of customized banking, investment and brokerage services tailored to meet the changing wealth management needs of our individual and institutional customer base. Our clients have access to a range of services offered through three primary businesses: MLGWM; U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management (U.S. Trust); and Columbia. The results of the Retirement & Philanthropic Services business, the Corporation’s approximate 34 percent economic ownership interest in BlackRock Inc. (BlackRock) and other miscellaneous items are included in Other within GWIM.  Net income increased $18 million, or four percent, to $497 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 as higher total revenue was largely offset by higher noninterest expense.  Net interest income decreased $271 million, or 16 percent, to $1.4 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009, driven by the impact of net migration of customer relationships to Deposits, Home Loans & Insurance and the ALM portfolio, as well as the results from ALM activity. A more detailed discussion regarding migrated customer relationships and related balances is provided in MLGWM beginning on page 114.  Noninterest income increased $334 million, or 12 percent, to $3.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to higher valuations in the equity markets, the absence of further support to certain cash funds, higher equity investment income from our investment in BlackRock and increased transaction activity, partially offset by outflows and fee waivers in cash and money market funds.  Provision for credit losses decreased $12 million, or five percent, to $242 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 as stabilization of the home equity portfolio was largely offset by deterioration in the residential mortgage and commercial portfolios.  Noninterest expense increased $52 million, or two percent, to $3.4 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009, due to increases in revenue-related expenses, partially offset by expense reductions related to the Merrill Lynch acquisition.  Client Assets  The following table presents client assets which consist of AUM, client brokerage assets, assets in custody and client deposits.

The increase in net client assets was due to higher equity markets, inflows in MLGWM’s fee based wrap platforms and higher client deposits, partially offset by outflows in non-fee based brokerage assets and cash and money market assets due to the low rate environment.    113    Table of Contents   Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management    MLGWM provides a high-touch client experience through a network of approximately 15,000 client-facing financial advisors to our affluent customers with a personal wealth profile of at least $250,000 of investable assets. Total client assets in MLGWM were $1.4 trillion at both March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.  MLGWM includes the impact of migrating customers and their related deposit and loan balances to or from Deposits, Home Loans & Insurance and the ALM portfolio. Subsequent to the date of migration, the associated net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense are recorded in the business to which the customers migrated. During the three months ended March 31, 2010, total deposits of $3.0 billion migrated to MLGWM from Deposits. Conversely, during the three months ended March 31, 2009, total deposits of $6.1 billion were migrated to Deposits from MLGWM. During the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009, total loans of $598 million and $10.2 billion were migrated from MLGWM to Home Loans & Insurance and the ALM portfolio.   Net income decreased $86 million, or 19 percent, to $360 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009 as increases in noninterest income and lower credit costs were offset by lower net interest income and higher noninterest expense. Net interest income decreased $277 million, or 20 percent, to $1.1 billion driven by the impact of migration of customer relationships to Deposits, Home Loans & Insurance and the ALM portfolio, as well as the impact of lower net interest income allocation from ALM activities. Noninterest income increased $75 million, or four percent, to $2.0 billion primarily due to higher valuations in equity markets and increased transactional revenue. Provision for credit losses decreased $165 million, or 74 percent, primarily due to lower credit costs on home equity loans. Noninterest expense increased $99 million, or four percent, to $2.5 billion mainly due to higher incentives on increased revenue partially offset by expense reductions related to the Merrill Lynch acquisition.      U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management    U.S. Trust provides comprehensive wealth management solutions to wealthy and ultra-wealthy clients with investable assets of more than $3 million. In addition, U.S. Trust provides resources and customized solutions to meet clients’ wealth structuring, investment management, trust and banking needs as well as specialty asset management services (oil and gas, real estate, farm and ranch, timberland, private businesses and tax advisory). Clients also benefit from access to resources available through the Corporation including capital markets products, large and complex financing solutions, and our extensive banking platform.  Net income decreased $70 million, or 66 percent, to $36 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010 as compared to the same period in 2009, driven by higher provision for credit losses offset by a decline in expenses. Net interest income remained relatively unchanged. Noninterest income also remained relatively unchanged impacted by net outflows and lower transactional revenues, partially offset by higher valuations in the equity markets. Provision for credit losses increased $153 million to $184 million primarily due to higher reserve additions in the residential mortgage and commercial portfolios. Noninterest expense decreased $44 million, or nine percent, to $447 million primarily due to lower personnel costs and lower revenue-related expenses.      Columbia Management    Columbia is an asset management business serving the needs of both institutional clients and individual customers. Columbia provides asset management products and services including mutual funds and separate accounts. Columbia mutual fund offerings provide a broad array of investment strategies and products including equity, fixed-income (taxable and nontaxable) and money market (taxable and nontaxable) funds. Columbia distributes its products and services to institutional clients and individuals through MLGWM, U.S. Trust, Global Commercial Banking, GBAM and nonproprietary channels including other banks and brokerage firms.  During 2009, the Corporation reached an agreement to sell the long-term asset management business of Columbia to Ameriprise Financial, Inc. for consideration of approximately $900 million to $1.2 billion subject to certain adjustments including, among other factors, AUM net flows. This includes the management of Columbia’s equity and fixed-income mutual funds and separate accounts. The transaction closed on April 30, 2010 and will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.  For the three months ended March 31, 2010, Columbia recorded net income of $37 million compared to a net loss of $42 million during the same period in 2009. Net revenue increased $127 million due to the absence of losses of $117    114    Table of Contents  million related to the support provided to certain cash funds in the three months ended March 31, 2009 and the impact of higher valuations in the equity markets partially offset by net outflows primarily in the cash complex. All capital commitments to these cash funds were terminated during 2009. Noninterest expense was unchanged.      Other    Other includes the results of the Retirement & Philanthropic Services business, the Corporation’s approximately 34 percent economic ownership interest in BlackRock and other miscellaneous items. Our investment in BlackRock is accounted for under the equity method of accounting with our proportionate share of income or loss recorded in equity investment income.  Net income increased $95 million to $64 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 driven by higher noninterest income related to our investment in BlackRock as well as higher revenue from our Retirement and Philanthropic Services business.    115    Table of Contents      All Other                          Three Months Ended March 31, 2010        Three Months Ended March 31, 2009   (Dollars in millions)    Reported Basis         Reported Basis (1)   SecuritizationOffset (2)   As Adjusted     Net interest income (3)   $ 142       $ (1,866)   $ 2,391    $ 525     Noninterest income:                      Card income (loss)     —         534      (244)     290    Equity investment income     368         1,326      —      1,326    Gains on sales of debt securities     647         1,471      —      1,471    All other income (loss)     (119)         2,550      35      2,585    Total noninterest income     896          5,881      (209)     5,672    Total revenue, net of interest expense     1,038         4,015      2,182      6,197            Provision for credit losses     1,219         (667)     2,182      1,515     Merger and restructuring charges (4)     521         765      —      765     All other noninterest expense     956          213      —      213    Income (loss) before income taxes     (1,658)        3,704      —      3,704     Income tax expense (benefit) (3)      (848)         769      —      769    Net income (loss)   $ (810)       $ 2,935    $ —    $ 2,935       (1)  Provision for credit losses represents the provision for credit losses in All Other combined with the Global Card Services securitization offset.

For periods prior to 2010, Global Card Services was reported on a managed basis which includes a securitization impact adjustment. All Other’s results included a corresponding securitization offset which removes the impact of these securitized loans in order to present the consolidated results on a GAAP basis (i.e., held basis). The current period is presented in accordance with new consolidation guidance, which was adopted on January 1, 2010. See the Global Card Services section beginning on page 99 for information on the Global Card Services managed results. In addition to the securitization offset discussed above, All Other includes our Equity Investments businesses and Other.  Equity Investments includes Global Principal Investments, Corporate Investments and Strategic Investments. During the first quarter of 2010, the $2.7 billion Corporate Investment equity portfolio was sold as a result of a change in our investment portfolio objectives shifting more to core interest income and reducing our exposure to equity market risk, resulting in a loss of $331 million. On January 1, 2009, Global Principal Investments added Merrill Lynch’s principal investments. The    116    Table of Contents  combined business is comprised of a diversified portfolio of investments in private equity, real estate and other alternative investments. These investments are made either directly in a company or held through a fund with related income recorded in equity investment income. Global Principal Investments had unfunded equity commitments amounting to $2.4 billion at March 31, 2010 related to certain of these investments. For more information on these commitments, see Note 11 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Affiliates of the Corporation may, from time to time, act as general partner, fund manager and/or investment advisor to certain Corporation-sponsored real estate private equity funds. In such capacities, these affiliates manage and/or provide investment advisory services to such real estate private equity funds primarily for the benefit of third-party institutional and private clients. Such activities inherently involve risk to us and to the fund investors, and in certain situations may result in loss.  Strategic Investments includes investments of $9.2 billion in CCB, $5.4 billion in Itaú Unibanco Holding S.A. (Itaú Unibanco), $2.7 billion in Grupo Financiero Santander, S.A. (Santander) and other investments. For more information on these investments, see Note 5 – Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  In 2009, we sold 19.1 billion common shares in CCB for $10.1 billion, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $7.3 billion. We remain a significant shareholder in CCB with an approximate 11 percent ownership interest and intend to continue the important long-term strategic alliance with CCB originally entered into in 2005. As part of this alliance, we expect to continue to provide advice and assistance to CCB.  The following table presents the components of All Other’s equity investment income and reconciliation to the total consolidated equity investment income for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009 and also All Other’s equity investments at March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.

Other also includes certain amounts associated with ALM activities, including the residual impact of funds transfer pricing allocation methodologies, amounts associated with the change in the value of derivatives used as economic hedges of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to revaluation of foreign currency-denominated debt, fair value adjustments on certain structured notes, certain gains (losses) on sales of whole mortgage loans and gains (losses) on sales of debt securities. In addition, Other includes adjustments to net interest income and income tax expense to remove the FTE effect of items (primarily low-income housing tax credits) that are reported on a FTE basis in the business segments. Other also includes a trust services business which is a client-focused business providing trustee services and fund administration to various financial services companies.  First Republic results are also included in Other. First Republic, acquired as part of the Merrill Lynch acquisition, provides personalized, relationship-based banking services including private banking, private business banking, real estate lending, trust, brokerage and investment management. First Republic is a standalone bank that operates primarily on the west coast and in the northeast and caters to high-end customers. On October 21, 2009, we reached an agreement to sell    117    Table of Contents  First Republic to a number of investors, led by First Republic’s existing management, Colony Capital, LLC and General Atlantic, LLC. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2010 subject to regulatory approval.  All Other reported a net loss of $810 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010 compared to net income of $2.9 billion for the same period in 2009 due to lower revenue as well as increases in provision for credit losses and noninterest expense.  Net interest income increased $2.0 billion to $142 million due to the absence of the securitization offset impact in the current period as a result of the adoption of new consolidation guidance.  Noninterest income decreased by $5.0 billion to $896 million due to the absence of a $1.9 billion gain a year earlier on the sale of a portion of our CCB investment and lower gains on the sale of debt securities partially offset by a lower mark-to-market gain mainly related to certain Merrill Lynch structured notes. Further, as a result of new consolidation guidance, there is no longer card income associated with the securitization offset in All Other.  Provision for credit losses increased $1.9 billion to $1.2 billion. This increase was primarily driven by the impact of the new consolidation guidance and higher credit costs in the purchased credit-impaired Countrywide discontinued real estate portfolio, partially offset by lower reserve builds related to the residential mortgage portfolio.  The change in income tax expense (benefit) of $1.6 billion was primarily attributable to the decrease in income before taxes, partially offset by the impact of other residual amounts resulting from the recognition of tax benefits during interim periods.           Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations We have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into a number of off-balance sheet commitments including commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and commercial letters of credit to meet the financing needs of our customers. In the three months ended March 31, 2010, these commitments were impacted by new consolidation guidance which is more fully discussed in Note 8 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information on our obligations and commitments, see Note 10 – Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt and Note 11 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, pages 42 through 43 of the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as Note 13 – Long-term Debt and Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.           Regulatory Initiatives On February 23, 2010, regulators issued clarifying guidance, effective in the first quarter of 2010, on modified consumer real estate loans that specifies criteria required to demonstrate a borrower’s capacity to repay the modified loan. In connection with this guidance, we reviewed our modified consumer real estate loans and determined that a portion of these loans did not meet the criteria and, therefore, were deemed collateral dependent. The guidance requires that modified loans deemed to be collateral dependent be written down to their estimated collateral value which resulted in $813 million of net charge-offs during the three months ended March 31, 2010, of which $643 million were home equity, $161 million were residential mortgage and $9 million were discontinued real estate.  On December 7, 2009, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision released consultative documents on both capital and liquidity. In addition, we began Basel II parallel implementation on April 1, 2010. For more information, see Basel Regulatory Capital Requirements on page 127.  On November 12, 2009, the Federal Reserve issued amendments to Regulation E, which implements the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. The new rules have a compliance date of July 1, 2010. These amendments change, among other things, the way we and other banks may charge overdraft fees by limiting our ability to charge an overdraft fee for non-recurring debit card transactions that overdraw a consumer’s account unless the consumer affirmatively consents to the bank’s payment of overdrafts for those transactions. We have announced plans to not offer customers the opportunity to opt-in to overdraft services related to non-recurring debit card transactions. However, customers will be able to opt-in on a withdrawal-by-withdrawal basis to access cash through the Bank of America ATM network where the bank is able to alert customers that the transaction may overdraw their account and result in a fee if they choose to proceed. In advance of the effective date of the amendment of Regulation E we have made changes to certain of our overdraft policies which have negatively impacted service charge revenue in the first    118    Table of Contents  quarter of 2010. The provisions in Regulation E are also expected to negatively impact 2010 service charge revenue. The 2010 impact related to overdraft policy changes and Regulation E is expected to be approximately $1 billion after-tax.  On May 22, 2009, the CARD Act was signed into law. The majority of the CARD Act provisions became effective in February 2010. The CARD Act legislation contains comprehensive credit card reform related to credit card industry practices including significantly restricting banks’ ability to change interest rates and assess fees to reflect individual consumer risk, changing the way payments are applied and requiring changes to consumer credit card disclosures. Under the CARD Act, banks must give customers 45 days notice prior to a change in terms on their account and the grace period for credit card payments changes from 14 days to 21 days. The CARD Act also requires banks to review any accounts that were repriced since January 1, 2009 for a possible rate reduction. As announced in October 2009, we did not increase interest rates on consumer card accounts in response to provisions in the CARD Act prior to its effective date unless the customer’s account fell past due or was based on a variable interest rate. The provisions in the CARD Act negatively impacted net interest income in the first quarter of 2010 and are expected to negatively impact future net interest income due to the restrictions on our ability to reprice credit cards based on risk, and card income due to restrictions imposed on certain fees. The 2010 revenue impact related to CARD Act provisions net of mitigation efforts is expected to be approximately $900 million after-tax.  In response to the economic downturn, the FDIC implemented the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by allowing the FDIC to guarantee senior unsecured debt (e.g., promissory notes, unsubordinated unsecured notes and commercial paper) up to prescribed limits, issued by participating entities beginning on October 14, 2008, and continuing through October 31, 2009. We participated in this program and at March 31, 2010, we still had FDIC-guaranteed debt outstanding issued under the TLGP of $41.7 billion. The TLGP also offered the Transaction Account Guarantee Program (TAGP) that guaranteed noninterest-bearing deposit accounts held at participating FDIC-insured institutions on balances in excess of $250,000. We elected to opt out of the extension of the TAGP which extends the program to December 31, 2010. We exited the TAGP effective December 31, 2009.  On March 4, 2009, the U.S. Treasury provided details related to the $75 billion Making Home Affordable program (MHA). The MHA is focused on reducing the number of foreclosures and making it easier for customers to refinance loans. The MHA consists of the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) which provides guidelines on first lien loan modifications, and the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) which provides guidelines for loan refinancing. The HAMP is designed to help at-risk homeowners avoid foreclosure by reducing payments. This program provides incentives to lenders to modify all eligible loans that fall under the guidelines of this program. The HARP is available to approximately four to five million homeowners who have a proven payment history on an existing mortgage owned by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC). The HARP is designed to help eligible homeowners refinance their mortgage loans to take advantage of current lower mortgage rates or to refinance adjustable-rate mortgages (ARM) into more stable fixed-rate mortgages.  As part of the MHA program, on April 28, 2009, the U.S. government announced intentions to create the second lien modification program (2MP) that is designed to reduce the monthly payments on qualifying home equity loans and lines of credit under certain conditions, including completion of a HAMP modification on the first mortgage on the property. This program provides incentives to lenders to modify all eligible loans that fall under the guidelines of this program. Additional clarification on government guidelines for the program was announced in the first quarter of 2010. On April 8, 2010, we began early implementation of the 2MP with the mailing of trial modification offers to eligible home equity customers, although U.S. government processes for confirming homeowner eligibility and measuring progress are not expected to be fully implemented for several months. We will modify eligible second liens under this initiative regardless of whether the MHA modified first lien is serviced by Bank of America or another participating servicer.  On April 5, 2010, we implemented the Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives (HAFA) program, which is another addition to the HAMP, that assists borrowers with non-retention options instead of foreclosure. The HAFA program provides incentives to lenders to assist all eligible borrowers that fall under the guidelines of this program. Our first goal is to work with the borrower to determine if a loan modification or other homeownership retention solution is available before pursuing non-retention options such as short sales. Short sales are an important option for homeowners who are facing financial difficulty and do not have a viable option to remain in the home. HAFA’s short sale guidelines are designed to streamline and standardize the process and will be compatible with Bank of America’s new cooperative short sale program.  As of March 31, 2010, approximately 251,000 Bank of America customers were in a trial-period modification under the MHA program. During the first quarter of 2010, 77,000 loan modifications were completed with a total unpaid principal balance of $17.8 billion, including 33,000 customers who were converted from trial-period to permanent modifications under the HAMP. In addition, on March 26, 2010, the U.S. government announced new changes to the MHA program guidelines that    119    Table of Contents  will include principal forgiveness options to the HAMP for a sub-segment of qualified HAMP borrowers. The details around eligibility, forgiveness arrangements, and the incentive structures are still being finalized and are not available at the time of this filing; however, the implementation of these changes is anticipated for Fall of 2010.  In addition to the programs described above, we have implemented several programs designed to help our customers. For information on these programs, refer to Credit Risk Management beginning on page 130. We will continue to help our customers address financial challenges through these government programs and our own home retention programs.           Managing Risk Given our wide range of business activities as well as the competitive dynamics, the regulatory environment and the geographic span of such activities, risk taking is an inherent activity for the Corporation. Our business exposes us to strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. The Corporation’s risk management infrastructure is continually evolving to meet the challenges posed by the increased complexity of the financial services industry and markets, by our increased size and global footprint, and by the rapid and significant financial crisis of the past two years. We have redefined our risk framework, articulated a risk appetite approved by the Board of Directors (the Board), and are implementing our risk plan. While many of these processes, and roles and responsibilities continue to evolve and mature, we continue to enhance our risk management process with a focus on clarity of roles and accountabilities, escalation of issues, aggregation of risk and data across the enterprise, and effective governance characterized by clarity and transparency.  We take a comprehensive approach to risk management. Risk management planning is fully integrated with strategic, financial and customer/client planning so that goals and responsibilities are aligned across the organization. Risk is managed in a systematic manner by focusing on the Corporation as a whole and managing risk across the enterprise and within individual business units, products, services and transactions. We maintain a governance structure that delineates the responsibilities for risk management activities, as well as governance and the oversight of those activities, by executive management and the Board. For a more detailed discussion of our risk management activities, see pages 44 through 87 of the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.           Strategic Risk Management Strategic risk is embedded in every line of business and is part of the other major risk categories (credit, market, liquidity, compliance and operational). It is the risk that results from adverse business decisions, ineffective or inappropriate business plans, or failure to respond to changes in the competitive environment, business cycles, customer preferences, product obsolescence, regulatory environment, business strategy execution, and/or other inherent risks of the business including reputational risk. In the financial services industry, strategic risk is high due to changing customer and regulatory environments. The Corporation’s appetite for strategic risk is continually assessed within the context of the strategic plan, with strategic risks selectively and carefully taken to maintain relevance in the evolving marketplace. Strategic risk is managed in the context of our overall financial condition and assessed, managed and acted on by the Chief Executive Officer and executive management team. Significant strategic actions, such as material acquisitions or capital actions, are reviewed and approved by the Board.  For more information on our Strategic Risk Management activities, refer to page 47 of the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.           Liquidity Risk and Capital Management     Funding and Liquidity Risk Management    We define liquidity risk as the potential inability to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations, on- or off-balance sheet, as they come due. Our primary liquidity objective is to ensure adequate funding for our businesses throughout market cycles, including during periods of financial stress. To achieve that objective we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk, maintain excess liquidity and access diverse funding sources including our stable deposit base. We define excess liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid unencumbered securities, that we can use to meet our funding requirements as those obligations arise.    120    Table of Contents Global funding and liquidity risk management activities are centralized within Corporate Treasury. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity risk management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. For additional information regarding Funding and Liquidity Risk Management, see the discussion that follows and refer to page 47 of the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Global Excess Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets  We maintain excess liquidity available to the parent company and selected subsidiaries in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that together serve as our primary means of liquidity risk mitigation. We call these assets our “Global Excess Liquidity Sources,” and we limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS and a select group of non-U.S. government securities. We believe we can quickly obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed market conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold these assets in entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities.  Our global excess liquidity sources increased $55 billion to $269 billion at March 31, 2010 compared to $214 billion at December 31, 2009 and were maintained as presented in the table below. This increase was due primarily to liquidity generated by our bank subsidiaries through loan repayments combined with lower loan demand and other factors.   Table 10   Global Excess Liquidity Sources             (Dollars in billions)     March 31  2010     December 31  2009    Parent company   $ 98   $ 99     Bank subsidiaries     142     89     Broker/dealers     29     26    Total global excess liquidity sources   $ 269   $ 214  As noted above, the excess liquidity available to the parent company is held in cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities and totaled $98 billion and $99 billion at March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. Typically, parent company cash is deposited overnight with Bank of America, N.A.  Our bank subsidiaries’ excess liquidity sources at March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 consisted of $142 billion and $89 billion in cash on deposit at the Federal Reserve and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. These amounts are distinct from the cash deposited by the parent company, as described above. In addition to their excess liquidity sources, our bank subsidiaries hold significant amounts of other unencumbered securities that we believe we could also use to generate liquidity, such as investment grade ABS and municipal bonds. Another way our bank subsidiaries can generate incremental liquidity is by pledging a range of other unencumbered loans and securities to certain Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained at March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 by borrowing against this pool of specifically identified eligible assets was approximately $192 billion and $187 billion. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loan and securities collateral. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries may only be used to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries and may not be transferred to the parent company or other nonbank subsidiaries.  Our broker/dealer subsidiaries’ excess liquidity sources at March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 consisted of $29 billion and $26 billion in cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Our broker/dealers also held significant amounts of other unencumbered securities we believe we could utilize to generate additional liquidity, including investment grade corporate bonds, ABS and equities. Liquidity held in a broker/dealer subsidiary may only be available to meet the liquidity requirements of that entity and may not be transferred to the parent company or other subsidiaries.  Time to Required Funding and Stress Modeling  We use a variety of metrics to determine the appropriate amounts of excess liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our bank and broker/dealer subsidiaries. The primary metric we use to evaluate the appropriate level of excess liquidity at the parent company is “Time to Required Funding.” This debt coverage measure indicates the number of months that the parent company can continue to meet its unsecured contractual obligations as they come due using only its Global Excess    121    Table of Contents  Liquidity Sources without issuing any new debt or accessing any additional liquidity sources. We define unsecured contractual obligations for purposes of this metric as senior or subordinated debt maturities issued or guaranteed by Bank of America Corporation or Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., including certain unsecured debt instruments, primarily structured notes, which we may be required to settle for cash prior to maturity. The Asset and Liability Market Risk Committee (ALMRC) has established a minimum target for “Time to Required Funding” of 21 months. “Time to Required Funding” was 24 months at March 31, 2010 compared to 25 months at December 31, 2009.  Diversified Funding Sources  We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits and secured and unsecured liabilities through a globally coordinated funding strategy. We diversify our funding globally across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor bases.  We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposit base which was $976 billion and $992 billion at March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. Deposits are primarily generated by our Deposits, Global Commercial Banking and GWIM segments. These deposits are diversified by clients, product types and geography. Domestic deposits may be insured by the FDIC. We consider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of funding. We believe this deposit funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources.  We issue the majority of our unsecured debt at the parent company and Bank of America, N.A. During the first quarter of 2010, we issued $7.1 billion and $3.5 billion of long-term senior unsecured debt at the parent company and Bank of America N.A. The primary benefits of this centralized financing strategy include greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations, time zone differences, or other business considerations make parent company funding impractical, certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt.  We issue unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. While the cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or the Corporation, we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month or quarter.  At March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, our long-term debt was issued in the currencies presented in the following table.

We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For further details on our ALM activities, refer to Interest Rate Risk Management for Nontrading Activities beginning on page 169.  We also diversify our funding sources by issuing various types of debt instruments including structured notes. Structured notes are debt obligations that pay investors with returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these notes with derivative positions    122    Table of Contents  and/or in the underlying instruments so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to immediately settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. We had outstanding structured notes of $57 billion at both March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009.  Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity, or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price.  For additional information on debt funding, see Note 13 – Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information regarding Funding and Liquidity Risk Management, refer to pages 47 through 49 of the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Credit Ratings  Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly impacted by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions including over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. It is our objective to maintain high quality credit ratings.  Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions subject to ongoing review by the ratings agencies and may change from time to time. The ratings agencies regularly evaluate us and our securities, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt and other securities, including asset securitizations. These evaluations are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. In light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the financial markets, there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings. During 2009, the ratings agencies took numerous actions to adjust our credit ratings and outlooks, many of which were negative. The ratings agencies have indicated that our credit ratings currently reflect their expectation that, if necessary, we would receive significant support from the U.S. government. In February 2010, a ratings agency affirmed our current credit ratings but revised the outlook to negative from stable based on their belief that it is less certain whether the U.S. government would be willing to provide extraordinary support. Other factors that influence our credit ratings include the ratings agencies’ assessment of the general operating environment, our relative positions in the markets in which we compete, reputation, liquidity position, the level and volatility of earnings, corporate governance and risk management policies, capital position, capital management practices and current or future regulatory and legislative initiatives.  The credit ratings of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. from the three major credit ratings agencies are the same as those of Bank of America Corporation. The major credit ratings agencies have indicated that the primary drivers of Merrill Lynch’s credit ratings are Bank of America’s credit ratings.  A reduction in our credit ratings or the ratings of certain asset-backed securitizations would likely have an adverse effect on our access to credit markets, the related cost of funds, our businesses and on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where counterparty creditworthiness is critical. If Bank of America Corporation or Bank of America, N.A. commercial paper or short-term credit ratings were downgraded by one or more levels, our incremental cost of funds and potential lost funding would be material. For information regarding the additional collateral and termination payments that would be required in connection with certain OTC derivatives contracts and other trading agreements as a result of a credit ratings downgrade, see Note 4 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.    123    Table of Contents The credit ratings of Bank of America Corporation and Bank of America, N.A. as of May 7, 2010 are reflected in the table below.

With the acquisition of Merrill Lynch on January 1, 2009, we acquired Merrill Lynch Bank USA and Merrill Lynch Bank & Trust Co., FSB. Effective July 1, 2009, Merrill Lynch Bank USA merged into Bank of America, N.A, with Bank of America, N.A. as the surviving entity. Effective November 2, 2009, Merrill Lynch Bank & Trust Co., FSB merged into Bank of America, N.A., with Bank of America, N.A. as the surviving entity.  To meet minimum, adequately capitalized regulatory requirements, an institution must maintain a Tier 1 capital ratio of four percent and a Total capital ratio of eight percent. A “well-capitalized” institution must generally maintain capital ratios 200 bps higher than the minimum guidelines. The risk-based capital rules have been further supplemented by a Tier 1 leverage ratio, defined as Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted quarterly average total assets, after certain adjustments. “Well-capitalized” bank holding companies must have a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of four percent. National banks must maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least five percent to be classified as “well-capitalized.” At March 31, 2010, the Corporation’s Tier 1 capital, Total capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios were 10.23 percent, 14.47 percent, and 6.46 percent, respectively. This classifies the Corporation as “well-capitalized” for regulatory purposes, the highest classification.  Certain corporate-sponsored trust companies which issue trust preferred securities (Trust Securities) are not consolidated. In accordance with Federal Reserve guidance, the Federal Reserve allows the Trust Securities to qualify as Tier 1 capital with revised quantitative limits that will be effective on March 31, 2011. As a result, we include Trust Securities in Tier 1 capital. Current limits restrict core capital elements to 15 percent of total core capital elements for internationally active bank holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve revised the qualitative standards for capital instruments included in regulatory capital. Internationally active bank holding companies are those that have significant activities in non-U.S. markets with consolidated assets greater than $250 billion or on-balance sheet foreign exposure greater than $10 billion. At March 31, 2010, our restricted core capital elements comprised 11.9 percent of total core capital elements. We expect to remain fully compliant with the revised limits prior to implementation date of March 31, 2011.    124    Table of Contents The Corporation calculates Tier 1 common capital as Tier 1 capital including any CES less preferred stock, qualifying trust preferred securities, hybrid securities and qualifying noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries. CES was included in Tier 1 common capital based upon applicable regulatory guidance and our expectation at December 31, 2009 that the underlying Common Equivalent Stock would convert into common stock following stockholder approval of additional authorized shares. Stockholders approved the increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock at the special meeting of shareholders held on February 23, 2010 and the Common Equivalent Stock converted to common stock on February 24, 2010. Tier 1 common capital decreased to $115.5 billion at March 31, 2010 compared to $120.4 billion at December 31, 2009. The Tier 1 common capital ratio decreased 21 bps to 7.60 percent. This decrease was driven by the $6.2 billion charge, net-of-tax, for the cumulative effect of the adoption of the new consolidation guidance primarily related to the increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses as well as a $2.4 billion higher disallowed deferred tax asset resulting from the higher allowance for loan losses, partially offset by $3.2 billion of net income for the first quarter of 2010.

Enterprise-wide Stress Testing    As a part of our core risk management practices, the Corporation conducts enterprise-wide stress tests on a periodic basis to better understand earnings, capital and liquidity sensitivities to certain economic scenarios, including economic conditions that are more severe than anticipated. These enterprise-wide stress tests provide an understanding of the potential impacts to our risk profile, capital and liquidity. Scenarios are selected by a group comprised of senior line of business, risk and finance executives. Impacts to each line of business from each scenario are then analyzed and determined, primarily leveraging the models and processes utilized in everyday management routines. Impacts are assessed along with potential mitigating actions that may be taken. Analysis from such stress scenarios is compiled for and reviewed through our Risk Oversight Committee (ROC), ALMRC and the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Board and serves to inform and be incorporated, along with other core business processes, into decision making by management and the Board. The Corporation continues to invest in and improve stress testing capabilities as a core business process.    126    Table of Contents   Regulatory Capital Impact of Final Rule on Adopting New Consolidation Guidance    On January 21, 2010, the joint agencies issued a final rule regarding risk-based capital and the impact of new consolidation guidance issued by the FASB. The final rule allows for a phase-in period for a maximum of one year for the effect on risk-weighted assets and the regulatory limit on the inclusion of the allowance for loan and lease losses in Tier 2 capital related to the assets that are consolidated. The Corporation elected to forgo the phase-in period and consolidated the amounts for regulatory capital purposes as of January 1, 2010. The incremental impact to the Corporation on January 1, 2010, was an increase in assets of $100.4 billion and risk-weighted assets of $21.3 billion and a reduction in capital of $9.7 billion. The overall effect of the new consolidation guidance and the final rule was a decrease in Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common ratios of 76 bps and 73 bps. For more information on the impact of the new consolidation guidance, refer to Note 8 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements.      Basel Regulatory Capital Requirements    In June 2004, the Basel II Accord was published with the intent of more closely aligning regulatory capital requirements with underlying risks, similar to economic capital. While economic capital is measured to cover unexpected losses, the Corporation also manages regulatory capital to adhere to regulatory standards of capital adequacy.  The Basel II Final Rule (Basel II Rules), which was published on December 7, 2007, establishes requirements for the U.S. implementation and provided detailed capital requirements for credit and operational risk under Pillar 1, supervisory requirements under Pillar 2 and disclosure requirements under Pillar 3. We began Basel II parallel implementation on April 1, 2010.  Financial institutions are required to successfully complete a minimum parallel qualification period before receiving regulatory approval to report regulatory capital using the Basel II methodology. During the parallel period, the resulting capital calculations under both the current (Basel I) rules and the Basel II Rules will be reported to the financial institutions’ regulatory supervisors for at least four consecutive quarterly periods. Once the parallel period is successfully completed, the financial institutions will utilize Basel II as the methodology for calculating regulatory capital. A three-year transitional floor period will follow after which use of Basel I will be discontinued.  In July 2009, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision released a consultative document entitled “Revisions to the Basel II Market Risk Framework” that would significantly increase the capital requirements for trading book activities if adopted as proposed. The proposal recommended implementation by December 31, 2010, but regulatory agencies are currently evaluating the proposed rulemaking and related impacts before establishing final rules. As a result, we cannot determine the implementation date or the final capital impact.  In December 2009, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued a consultative document entitled “Strengthening the Resilience of the Banking Sector.” If adopted as proposed, this could significantly increase the aggregate equity that bank holding companies are required to hold by disqualifying certain instruments that have previously qualified as Tier 1 capital. In addition, it would increase the level of risk-weighted assets. The proposal could also increase the capital charges imposed on certain assets potentially making certain businesses more expensive to conduct. Regulatory agencies have not opined on the proposal for implementation. We continue to monitor the development and potential impact of the proposal.      Common Share Issuances and Repurchases    On February 24, 2010, 1.286 billion shares of common stock were issued through the conversion of Common Equivalent Stock into common stock. For more information regarding this conversion, see the Preferred Stock Conversion discussion below.  In connection with the TARP repayment approval, the Corporation agreed to increase equity by $3.0 billion through asset sales to be approved by the Federal Reserve and contracted for by June 30, 2010. To the extent those asset sales are not completed by the end of 2010, the Corporation must raise a commensurate amount of common equity. We also agreed to raise up to approximately $1.7 billion through the issuance in 2010 of restricted stock in lieu of a portion of incentive cash compensation to certain of the Corporation’s associates as part of their 2009 year-end incentive payments. The restricted stock issuance was completed on February 12, 2010. For more information regarding TARP, refer to page 53 of the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as Note 15 –    127    Table of Contents  Shareholders’ Equity and Earnings Per Common Share to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  There were no common shares repurchased in the first quarter of 2010 except for shares acquired under equity incentive plans, as discussed in Item 2.
