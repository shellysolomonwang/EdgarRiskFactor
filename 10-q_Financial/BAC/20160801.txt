Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any of the Corporation's subsequent Securities and Exchange Commission filings: the Corporation's ability to resolve representations and warranties repurchase and related claims, including claims brought by investors or trustees seeking to distinguish certain aspects of the New York Court of Appeals' ACE Securities Corp v. DB Structured Products, Inc. (ACE) decision or to assert other claims seeking to avoid the impact of the ACE decision; the possibility that the Corporation could face increased servicing, securities, fraud, indemnity, contribution or other claims from one or more counterparties, including trustees, purchasers of loans, underwriters, issuers, other parties involved in securitizations, monolines or private-label and other investors; the possibility that future representations and warranties losses may occur in excess of the Corporation's recorded liability and estimated range of possible loss for its representations and warranties exposures; potential claims, damages, penalties, fines and reputational damage resulting from pending or future litigation and regulatory proceedings, including the possibility that amounts may be in excess of the Corporation's recorded liability and estimated range of possible loss for litigation exposures; the possible outcome of LIBOR, other reference rate, financial instrument and foreign exchange inquiries, investigations and litigation; uncertainties about the financial stability and growth rates of non-U.S. jurisdictions, the risk that those jurisdictions may face difficulties servicing their sovereign debt, and related stresses on financial markets, currencies and trade, and the Corporation's exposures to such risks, including direct, indirect and operational; the impact of U.S. and global interest rates (including negative or continued low interest rates), currency exchange rates and economic conditions; the possibility that future credit losses may be higher than currently expected due to changes in economic assumptions, customer behavior and other uncertainties; the impact on the Corporation's business, financial condition and results of operations of a potential higher interest rate environment; the impact on the Corporation's business, financial condition and results of operations from a protracted period of lower oil prices or ongoing volatility with respect to oil prices; our ability to achieve our expense targets; adverse changes to the Corporation's credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies; estimates of the fair value of certain of the Corporation's assets and liabilities; uncertainty regarding the content, timing and impact of regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, including the potential adoption of total loss-absorbing capacity requirements; the potential for payment protection insurance exposure to increase as a result of Financial Conduct Authority actions; the impact of recent proposed U.K. tax law changes including a further limitation on how much net operating losses can offset annual profits and a reduction to the U.K. corporate tax rate which, if enacted, will result in a tax charge upon enactment; the possible impact of Federal Reserve actions on the Corporation's capital plans; the possible impact of the Corporation's failure to remediate deficiencies identified by banking regulators in the Corporation's Recovery and Resolution plans; the impact of implementation and compliance with U.S. and international laws, regulations and regulatory interpretations, including, but not limited to, recovery and resolution planning requirements, FDIC assessments, the Volcker Rule, and derivatives regulations; a failure in or breach of the Corporation's operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, including as a result of cyber attacks; the impact on the Corporation's business, financial condition and results of operations from the potential exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union; and other similar matters.Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Corporation undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of circumstances or events that arise after the date the forward-looking statement was made.Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements referred to in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) are incorporated by reference into the MD&A. Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. Throughout the MD&A, the Corporation uses certain acronyms and abbreviations which are defined in the Glossary. 3Table of ContentsExecutive Summary Business OverviewThe Corporation is a Delaware corporation, a bank holding company (BHC) and a financial holding company. When used in this report, "the Corporation" may refer to Bank of America Corporation individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation's subsidiaries or affiliates. Our principal executive offices are located in Charlotte, North Carolina. Through our banking and various nonbank subsidiaries throughout the U.S. and in international markets, we provide a diversified range of banking and nonbank financial services and products. We operate our banking activities primarily under the Bank of America, National Association (Bank of America, N.A. or BANA) charter. At June 30, 2016, the Corporation had approximately $2.2 trillion in assets and approximately 211,000 full-time equivalent employees.In the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, we reported our results of operations through five business segments: Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), Global Banking, Global Markets and Legacy Assets & Servicing (LAS), with the remaining operations recorded in All Other. Effective April 1, 2016, to align the segments with how we now manage our businesses, we changed our basis of presentation to eliminate the LAS segment, and following such change, we report our results of operations through the following four business segments: Consumer Banking, GWIM, Global Banking and Global Markets, with the remaining operations recorded in All Other. Consumer real estate loans, including loans previously held in or serviced by LAS, have been designated as either core or non-core based on criteria described in Business Segment Operations on page 24. Following the realignment, core loans owned by the Corporation, which include all loans originated after the realignment, are held in the Consumer Banking and GWIM segments. Non-core loans owned by the Corporation, which are principally run-off portfolios, as well as loans held for asset and liability management (ALM) activities, are held in All Other. Mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) pertaining to core and non-core loans serviced for others are held in Consumer Banking and All Other, respectively. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.As of June 30, 2016, we operated in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and more than 35 countries. Our retail banking footprint covers approximately 80 percent of the U.S. population, and we serve approximately 47 million consumer and small business relationships with approximately 4,700 retail financial centers, approximately 16,000 ATMs, and leading online and mobile banking platforms with approximately 33 million active accounts and more than 20 million mobile active users (www.bankofamerica.com). We offer industry-leading support to approximately three million small business owners. Our wealth management businesses, with client balances of $2.4 trillion, provide tailored solutions to meet client needs through a full set of investment management, brokerage, banking, trust and retirement products. We are a global leader in corporate and investment banking and trading across a broad range of asset classes, serving corporations, governments, institutions and individuals around the world.Second-Quarter 2016 Economic and Business EnvironmentIn the U.S., the economy showed renewed signs of momentum in the second quarter of 2016. Consumer spending accelerated, as retail sales and service spending increased. The housing sector continued to expand, reflecting continued low mortgage rates and growing disposable income, but the pace of expansion slowed from recent quarters. While oil prices slightly rebounded from earlier declines, business spending remained suppressed by the delayed impact on the demand for capital goods in the energy sector. With numerous uncertainties during the quarter, businesses continued to reduce inventory accumulation, restraining the manufacturing sector. As a result, production growth lagged behind strong gains in domestic final sales, which exclude net exports and inventory investments. However, an increase in manufacturing activity late in the quarter signaled a positive business response to strengthening domestic demand.In contrast to the increase in consumer demand, payroll gains slowed further, showing almost no net new job creation earlier in the quarter before rebounding in June. The unemployment rate moved slightly lower, largely as a result of a stagnant labor force as recent gains in participation rates were partially reversed. The split between stronger domestic demand and a softer labor market is expected to be resolved in the second half of the year. Core inflation maintained the momentum gained early in the year, but remained below the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System's (Federal Reserve) longer-term annual target of two percent.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) left its federal funds rate target unchanged in the quarter. Members of the FOMC remained concerned about conditions abroad (including the outcome of the U.K.’s Referendum on exiting the European Union (EU) (U.K. Referendum)) and the slowdown in payroll gains. At the June meeting, members both slowed their projected pace of tightening and lowered the expected longer-run level of the federal funds rate. In response, treasury yields fell during the quarter, especially in the first few days after the U.K. Referendum. Equities rose slightly during the quarter. 4Table of ContentsInternational concerns centered on Europe where the run-up to the U.K. Referendum, as well as the result, increased uncertainty. When the U.K. voted on June 23, 2016 to leave the EU, the British pound fell and market volatility temporarily increased. For more information on the U.K. Referendum, see Executive Summary – Recent Events on page 5. Financial markets settled down in the ensuing days, but the outcome of the U.K. Referendum was generally seen as reducing confidence and is expected to have a negative impact on the British economy in the near term. The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan maintained accommodative conditions during the quarter by expanding the overall monetary supply in order to boost slowed economic growth. International yields fell, with German 10-year Bund yields dropping into negative territory. Among emerging nations, Brazil continued to struggle with a deep recession and high inflation, and Venezuela experienced unrest related to a rapidly shrinking economy and deteriorating political situation. Russia benefited from the recovery in oil prices, with economic growth likely to resume in the second half of the year. The Chinese economy was stable during the quarter. In early July, a coup attempt in Turkey increased political instability, although the current government remained in power and financial market reaction outside of Turkey was minimal.Recent EventsUnited Kingdom Referendum to Exit the European UnionThe U.K. Referendum was held on June 23, 2016, which resulted in a majority vote in favor of exiting the EU. At this time, the ultimate impact of the U.K.'s potential exit from the EU is unknown. The timing of the U.K.'s formal commencement of the exit process is uncertain. Once the exit process begins, negotiations to agree on the terms of the exit are expected to be a multi-year process. During this transition period, the ultimate impact of the U.K.'s potential exit from the EU will remain unclear and economic and market volatility may continue. If uncertainty resulting from the U.K.'s potential exit from the EU negatively impacts economic conditions, financial markets and consumer confidence, our business, results of operations, financial position and/or operational model could be affected. For more information about the potential impact on us of the U.K.'s exit from the EU, see Item 1A. Risk Factors on page 215.Capital ManagementIn April 2016, we submitted our 2016 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) capital plan which included a request to repurchase $5.0 billion of common stock over four quarters beginning in the third quarter of 2016, and to increase the quarterly common stock dividend from $0.05 per share to $0.075 per share. In addition, our capital plan includes the repurchase of common shares to offset the dilution resulting from certain equity compensation. On June 29, 2016, following the Federal Reserve's non-objection to our 2016 CCAR capital plan, the Board of Directors (the Board) authorized the common stock repurchases described above. The common stock repurchase authorization includes both common stock and warrants. On July 27, 2016, the Board declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.075 per share, payable on September 23, 2016 to shareholders of record as of September 2, 2016. For additional information, see the Corporation's Current Report on Form 8-K as filed on June 29, 2016.During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we repurchased $783 million and $1.6 billion of common stock in connection with our 2015 CCAR capital plan, which included a request to repurchase $4.0 billion of common stock over five quarters beginning in the second quarter of 2015. Additionally, on March 18, 2016, the Corporation announced that the Board authorized additional repurchases of common stock up to $800 million outside of the scope of the 2015 CCAR capital plan to offset the share count dilution resulting from equity incentive compensation awarded to retirement-eligible employees, to which the Federal Reserve did not object. In connection with this authorization, the Corporation repurchased $600 million and $800 million of common stock during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016. For additional information, see Capital Management on page 48.  5Table of ContentsSelected Financial DataTable 1 provides selected consolidated financial data for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, and at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Table 1    Selected Financial Data (1)     Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30(Dollars in millions, except per share information)2016 2015 2016 2015Income statement       Revenue, net of interest expense$20,398 $21,956 $39,910 $42,870Net income4,232 5,134 6,912 8,231Diluted earnings per common share0.36 0.43 0.56 0.68Dividends paid per common share0.05 0.05 0.10 0.10Performance ratios       Return on average assets0.78% 0.96% 0.64% 0.77%Return on average common shareholders' equity6.48 8.42 5.14 6.68Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity (2)9.24 12.31 7.34 9.79Efficiency ratio66.14 63.57 70.93 69.48             June 30 2016 December 31 2015Balance sheet       Total loans and leases (3)    $903,153 $896,983Total assets    2,186,609 2,144,316Total deposits    1,216,091 1,197,259Total common shareholders' equity    241,849 233,932Total shareholders' equity    267,069 256,205(1) Certain amounts in the table that have been reported in previous filings using fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis (a non-GAAP financial measure) are now shown on a GAAP basis. See Table 11 for a reconciliation.(2) Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. Other companies may define or calculate this measure differently. For more information and a corresponding reconciliation to GAAP financial measures, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 16.(3) Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, the Corporation classifies certain leases in other assets. Previously these leases were classified in loans and leases. For December 31, 2015, $6.0 billion of these leases were reclassified from loans and leases to other assets to conform to this presentation. 6Table of ContentsFinancial HighlightsNet income was $4.2 billion, or $0.36 per diluted share, and $6.9 billion, or $0.56 per diluted share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $5.1 billion, or $0.43, and $8.2 billion, or $0.68 for the same periods in 2015. The results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior-year periods were primarily driven by declines in net interest income and noninterest income, and higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. Included in net interest income were negative market-related adjustments on debt securities of $974 million and $2.2 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to positive market-related adjustments on debt securities of $669 million and $185 million for the same periods in 2015.Total assets increased $42.3 billion from December 31, 2015 to $2.2 trillion at June 30, 2016 primarily driven by higher securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell due to increased customer financing activity, higher cash and cash equivalents due to strong deposit inflows, and an increase in loans and leases driven by demand for commercial loans outpacing consumer loan sales and run-off. Total liabilities increased $31.4 billion from December 31, 2015 to $1.9 trillion at June 30, 2016 primarily driven by increases in deposits, trading account liabilities and short-term borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in long-term debt. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we returned $4.2 billion in capital to shareholders through common and preferred stock dividends and common stock repurchases. For more information on the balance sheet, see Executive Summary – Balance Sheet Overview on page 11.From a capital management perspective, during the six months ended June 30, 2016, we maintained our strong capital position with Common equity tier 1 capital of $161.8 billion, risk-weighted assets of $1,542 billion and a Common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 10.5 percent at June 30, 2016 as measured under the Basel 3 Advanced approaches, on a fully phased-in basis. The Corporation's fully phased-in supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) was 6.9 percent and 6.4 percent at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, both above the 5.0 percent required minimum (including leverage buffer) effective January 1, 2018. Our Global Excess Liquidity Sources (GELS) were $515 billion with time-to-required funding at 35 months at June 30, 2016 compared to $504 billion and 39 months at December 31, 2015.

See Table 11 for a reconciliation. 7Table of ContentsNet Interest IncomeNet interest income decreased $1.2 billion to $9.2 billion ($9.4 billion on an FTE basis), and $1.5 billion to $18.4 billion ($18.8 billion on an FTE basis) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. The net interest yield decreased 34 basis points (bps) to 1.98 percent (2.03 percent on an FTE basis), and 23 bps to 1.99 percent (2.04 percent on an FTE basis). The decreases for the three- and six-month periods were primarily driven by a negative change in market-related adjustments on debt securities and the impact of lower consumer loan balances, partially offset by growth in commercial loans, the impact of higher short-end interest rates and increased debt securities. Market-related adjustments on debt securities resulted in an expense of $974 million and $2.2 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to a benefit of $669 million and $185 million for the same periods in 2015. Negative market-related adjustments on debt securities were primarily due to the acceleration of premium amortization on debt securities as the decline in long-term interest rates shortened the estimated lives of mortgage-related debt securities. Also included in market-related adjustments is hedge ineffectiveness that impacted net interest income.

The following highlights the significant changes.•Investment and brokerage services income decreased $186 million and $382 million driven by lower advisory fees due to lower market levels and lower transactional revenue.•Investment banking income decreased $118 million and $452 million primarily driven by lower equity issuance fees due to a decline in market fee pools.•Trading account profits increased $371 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 driven by stronger performance in rates products, as well as improved credit market conditions. Trading account profits decreased $214 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 driven by declines in credit-related products due to challenging market conditions during the first quarter of 2016, as well as reduced client activity in equities in Asia and lower revenue in currencies which performed strongly in the same period in 2015. •Mortgage banking income decreased $689 million and $950 million primarily due to less favorable MSR net-of-hedge performance, a provision for representations and warranties in the current-year periods compared to a benefit in the prior-year periods, as well as declines in production income and, to a lesser extent, servicing fees.•Other income increased $212 million and $359 million primarily due to improvements of $172 million and $497 million in debit valuation adjustments (DVA) on structured liabilities, as well as improved results from loan hedging activities in the fair value option portfolio, partially offset by lower gains on asset sales. DVA losses related to structured liabilities were $23 million and $53 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $195 million and $550 million in the same periods in 2015.  8Table of ContentsProvision for Credit LossesTable 4       Credit Quality Data         Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30(Dollars in millions)2016 2015 2016 2015Provision for credit losses        Consumer$733 $553 $1,135 $1,172Commercial243 227 838 373Total provision for credit losses$976 $780 $1,973 $1,545        Net charge-offs (1)$985 $1,068 $2,053 $2,262Net charge-off ratio (2)0.44% 0.49% 0.46% 0.53%(1) Net charge-offs exclude write-offs in the purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loan portfolio.(2) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option.The provision for credit losses increased $196 million to $976 million, and $428 million to $2.0 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. The provision for credit losses in the consumer portfolio increased $180 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the prior-year period due to a slower pace of improvement. The provision for credit losses in the consumer portfolio remained relatively unchanged at $1.1 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio increased $16 million and $465 million compared to the same periods in 2015, with the increase for the six months ended June 30, 2016 primarily driven by an increase in energy sector reserves to increase the allowance coverage for the higher risk sub-sectors. For more information on our energy sector exposure, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Industry Concentrations on page 89. The decreases in net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 were primarily driven by charge-offs related to the consumer relief portion of the settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) in the prior-year periods and credit quality improvement in the consumer portfolio, partially offset by higher energy-related net charge-offs in the commercial portfolio.For the remainder of 2016, we currently expect that provision expense should approximate net charge-offs. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Provision for Credit Losses on page 95.

Personnel expense decreased $168 million and $930 million as we continue to manage headcount and achieve cost savings. Continued expense management, as well as the expiration of fully-amortized advisor retention awards, more than offset the increases in client-facing professionals. Other general operating expense decreased $167 million and $313 million primarily due to lower foreclosed properties expense. 9Table of ContentsThe Corporation has previously announced an annual noninterest expense target of approximately $53 billion for the year 2018. See information about forward-looking statements described in Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis on page 3.Income Tax ExpenseTable 6       Income Tax Expense         Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30(Dollars in millions)2016 2015 2016 2015Income before income taxes$5,929 $7,218 $9,628 $11,540Income tax expense 1,697 2,084 2,716 3,309Effective tax rate28.6% 28.9% 28.2% 28.7%The effective tax rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were driven by our recurring tax preference items. We expect an effective tax rate of approximately 29 percent for the remainder of 2016, absent unusual items.The U.K. Chancellor's Budget 2016 was announced on March 16, 2016 and proposes to further reduce the U.K. corporate income tax rate by one percent to 17 percent effective April 1, 2020. This reduction would favorably affect income tax expense on future U.K. earnings but also would require us to remeasure, in the period of enactment, our U.K. net deferred tax assets using the lower tax rate. Accordingly, upon enactment, we would expect to record a charge to income tax expense of approximately $350 million. In addition, for banking companies, the portion of U.K. taxable income that can be reduced by net operating loss carryforwards would be further restricted from 50 percent to 25 percent retroactive to April 1, 2016.The majority of our U.K. deferred tax assets, which consist primarily of net operating losses, are expected to be realized by certain subsidiaries over a number of years. Significant changes to management's earnings forecasts for those subsidiaries, such as changes caused by a substantial and prolonged worsening of the condition of Europe's capital markets, changes in applicable laws, further changes in tax laws or the ability of our U.K. subsidiaries to conduct business in the EU, could lead management to reassess our ability to realize the U.K. deferred tax assets.

The increase in assets was primarily driven by higher securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell due to increased customer financing activity, higher cash and cash equivalents driven by strong deposit inflows, and an increase in loans and leases driven by demand for commercial loans outpacing consumer loan sales and run-off.Liabilities and Shareholders' EquityAt June 30, 2016, total liabilities were approximately $1.9 trillion, up $31.4 billion from December 31, 2015, primarily driven by increases in deposits, trading account liabilities and short-term borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in long-term debt.Shareholders' equity of $267.1 billion at June 30, 2016 increased $10.9 billion from December 31, 2015 driven by earnings, an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) due to a positive net change in the fair value of available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities as a result of lower interest rates, and preferred stock issuances, partially offset by returns of capital to shareholders of $4.2 billion through common and preferred stock dividends and common stock repurchases. 11Table of ContentsTable 8    Selected Quarterly Financial Data     2016 Quarters 2015 Quarters(In millions, except per share information)Second First Fourth Third SecondIncome statement         Net interest income$9,213 $9,171 $9,756 $9,471 $10,461Noninterest income11,185 10,341 9,911 11,042 11,495Total revenue, net of interest expense20,398 19,512 19,667 20,513 21,956Provision for credit losses976 997 810 806 780Noninterest expense13,493 14,816 14,010 13,940 13,958Income before income taxes5,929 3,699 4,847 5,767 7,218Income tax expense 1,697 1,019 1,511 1,446 2,084Net income4,232 2,680 3,336 4,321 5,134Net income applicable to common shareholders3,871 2,223 3,006 3,880 4,804Average common shares issued and outstanding10,254 10,340 10,399 10,444 10,488Average diluted common shares issued and outstanding11,059 11,100 11,153 11,197 11,238Performance ratios         Return on average assets0.78% 0.50% 0.61% 0.79% 0.96%Four quarter trailing return on average assets (1)0.67 0.71 0.74 0.73 0.52Return on average common shareholders' equity6.48 3.77 5.08 6.65 8.42Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity (2)9.24 5.41 7.32 9.65 12.31Return on average shareholders' equity6.42 4.14 5.15 6.75 8.20Return on average tangible shareholders' equity (2)8.79 5.72 7.15 9.43 11.51Total ending equity to total ending assets12.21 12.02 11.95 11.89 11.71Total average equity to total average assets12.12 11.98 11.79 11.71 11.67Dividend payout13.39 23.23 17.27 13.43 10.90Per common share data         Earnings$0.38 $0.21 $0.29 $0.37 $0.46Diluted earnings0.36 0.21 0.28 0.35 0.43Dividends paid0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05 0.05Book value23.67 23.12 22.54 22.41 21.91Tangible book value (2)16.68 16.17 15.62 15.50 15.02Market price per share of common stock         Closing$13.27 $13.52 $16.83 $15.58 $17.02High closing15.11 16.43 17.95 18.45 17.67Low closing12.18 11.16 15.38 15.26 15.41Market capitalization$135,577 $139,427 $174,700 $162,457 $178,231(1) Calculated as total net income for four consecutive quarters divided by annualized average assets for four consecutive quarters.(2) Tangible equity ratios and tangible book value per share of common stock are non-GAAP financial measures.

We believe managing the business with net interest income on an FTE basis provides a more meaningful picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.Certain performance measures including the efficiency ratio and net interest yield utilize net interest income (and thus total revenue) on an FTE basis. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield measures the bps we earn over the cost of funds.We may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., market-related adjustments on net interest income, DVA, charge-offs related to the settlement with the DoJ) which result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of these non-GAAP financial measures provides additional clarity in understanding our results of operations and trends.We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents an adjusted shareholders' equity or common shareholders' equity amount which has been reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders' equity and return on average tangible shareholders' equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals. These ratios are as follows:•Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted common shareholders' equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders' equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities.•Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders' equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders' equity divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities.•Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders' equity divided by ending common shares outstanding.The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Tables 8 and 9.Table 10 presents certain non-GAAP financial measures and performance measurements on an FTE basis.

Effective April 1, 2016, to align the segments with how we now manage the businesses, we changed our basis of presentation to eliminate the LAS segment, and following such change, we report our results of operations through the following four business segments: Consumer Banking, GWIM, Global Banking and Global Markets, with the remaining operations recorded in All Other.The Corporation, in connection with the aforementioned realignment of our business segments, completed a review of all consumer real estate-secured lending and servicing activities within LAS, Consumer Banking, GWIM and All Other with a view to strategically align the business activities and loans, including loans serviced for others, into core and non-core categories, with core loans reflected on the balance sheet of the appropriate business segment and non-core loans, which are principally run-off portfolios, exclusively on the balance sheet of All Other. The analysis was performed on the basis of loan and customer characteristics such as origination date, product type, loan-to-value (LTV), Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score and delinquency status consistent with our current consumer and mortgage servicing strategy. Generally, loans that were originated after January 1, 2010, qualified under government-sponsored enterprise underwriting guidelines, or otherwise met our underwriting guidelines in place in 2015 are characterized as core loans. Loans held in legacy private-label securitizations, government insured loans originated prior to 2010, loan products no longer originated, and loans originated prior to 2010 and classified as nonperforming or modified in a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) prior to 2016 are generally characterized as non-core loans. The segment realignment resulted in a net $23 billion and $1 billion increase in consumer real estate loans held on the balance sheet of Consumer Banking and All Other, as of April 1, 2016. MSRs pertaining to core and non-core loans serviced for others are held in Consumer Banking and All Other, respectively. Prior period balances and related metrics have been reclassified to conform to these revised classifications.The Corporation periodically reviews capital allocated to its businesses and allocates capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk-based capital models. The Corporation's internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment's credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. For more information on the nature of these risks, see Managing Risk on page 47. For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation utilizes allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying value of its reporting units. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit.

Our customers and clients have access to a franchise network that stretches coast to coast through 33 states and the District of Columbia. The franchise network includes approximately 4,700 financial centers, 16,000 ATMs, nationwide call centers, and online and mobile platforms.Consumer Banking ResultsThree Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2015 Net income for Consumer Banking increased $56 million to $1.7 billion primarily driven by higher net interest income and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by higher provision for credit losses and lower noninterest income. Net interest income increased $233 million to $5.3 billion primarily due to the beneficial impact of an increase in investable assets as a result of higher deposits, as well as loan growth. Noninterest income decreased $126 million to $2.6 billion due to lower mortgage banking income and service charges, as well as the impact on revenue of certain divestitures.The provision for credit losses increased $256 million to $726 million primarily driven by a slower pace of improvement in the U.S. credit card portfolio, as well as the consumer auto and specialty lending portfolio. Noninterest expense decreased $221 million to $4.4 billion primarily driven by lower operating expenses from improved efficiency and automation. 26Table of ContentsThe return on average allocated capital remained unchanged at 20 percent. For more information on capital allocations, see Business Segment Operations on page 24.Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2015 Net income for Consumer Banking increased $329 million to $3.4 billion primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. Net interest income increased $502 million to $10.5 billion due to the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above, partially offset by lower credit card balances. Noninterest income decreased $309 million to $5.1 billion due to lower mortgage banking income and the impact on revenue of certain divestitures, partially offset by higher card income and higher service charges.The provision for credit losses increased $118 million to $1.3 billion and noninterest expense decreased $415 million to $9.0 billion both primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above.The return on average allocated capital was 20 percent, up from 19 percent, reflecting higher net income. DepositsDeposits includes the results of consumer deposit activities which consist of a comprehensive range of products provided to consumers and small businesses. Our deposit products include traditional savings accounts, money market savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, noninterest- and interest-bearing checking accounts, as well as investment accounts and products. The revenue is allocated to the deposit products using our funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. Deposits generates fees such as account service fees, non-sufficient funds fees, overdraft charges and ATM fees, as well as investment and brokerage fees from Merrill Edge accounts.

Merrill Edge provides investment advice and guidance, client brokerage asset services, a self-directed online investing platform and key banking capabilities including access to the Corporation's network of financial centers and ATMs.Deposits includes the net impact of migrating customers and their related deposit and brokerage asset balances between Deposits and GWIM as well as other client-managed businesses. For more information on the migration of customer balances to or from GWIM, see GWIM on page 32.Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2015 Net income for Deposits increased $165 million to $865 million driven by higher revenue. Net interest income increased $311 million to $2.7 billion primarily due to the beneficial impact of an increase in investable assets as a result of higher deposits. Noninterest income decreased $43 million to $1.1 billion primarily driven by lower service charges.The provision for credit losses increased $17 million to $41 million. Noninterest expense of $2.4 billion remained relatively unchanged.Average deposits increased $45.0 billion to $589.3 billion driven by a continuing customer shift to more liquid products in the low rate environment. Growth in checking, traditional savings and money market savings of $51.7 billion was partially offset by a decline in time deposits of $6.8 billion. As a result of our continued pricing discipline and the shift in the mix of deposits, the rate paid on average deposits declined by one bp to four bps.Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2015 Net income for Deposits increased $452 million to $1.7 billion driven by higher revenue.

In addition to earning net interest spread revenue on its lending activities, Consumer Lending generates interchange revenue from credit and debit card transactions, late fees, cash advance fees, annual credit card fees, mortgage banking fee income and other miscellaneous fees. Consumer Lending products are available to our customers through our retail network, direct telephone, and online and mobile channels. Consumer Lending results also include the impact of servicing residential mortgages and home equity loans in the core portfolio, including loans held on the balance sheet of Consumer Lending and loans serviced for others.The Corporation classifies consumer real estate loans as core or non-core based on loan and customer characteristics such as origination date, product type, LTV, FICO score and delinquency status. At June 30, 2016, total owned loans in the core portfolio held in Consumer Lending were $95.4 billion, up $7.6 billion from June 30, 2015 primarily driven by higher residential mortgage balances, partially offset by a decline in home equity balances.

Net interest income decreased $78 million to $2.6 billion primarily driven by lower average credit card balances and higher funding costs, partially offset by an increase in consumer auto lending balances. Noninterest income decreased $83 million to $1.5 billion due to lower mortgage banking income and the impact on revenue of certain divestitures, partially offset by higher card income.The provision for credit losses increased $239 million to $685 million driven by a slower pace of improvement in the U.S. credit card portfolio, as well as the consumer auto and specialty lending portfolio. Noninterest expense decreased $217 million to $2.0 billion primarily driven by lower fraud expenses due to the benefit of the Europay, MasterCard and Visa (EMV) chip implementation, and lower operating expenses from improved efficiency and automation.Average loans increased $12.1 billion to $238.1 billion primarily driven by increases in residential mortgages and consumer vehicle loans, partially offset by lower home equity loans. 28Table of ContentsSix Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2015 Net income for Consumer Lending decreased $123 million to $1.8 billion, net interest income decreased $183 million to $5.2 billion and noninterest income decreased $309 million to $2.9 billion all driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above.The provision for credit losses increased $116 million to $1.2 billion driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above.

Total U.S. credit card purchase volumes increased $691 million to $56.7 billion, and $1.7 billion to $107.8 billion, and debit card purchase volumes increased $1.4 billion to $72.1 billion, and $3.6 billion to $141.3 billion, reflecting higher levels of consumer spending. The increases in total U.S. credit card purchase volumes were partially offset by the impact of certain divestitures. 29Table of ContentsMortgage Banking IncomeMortgage banking income is earned primarily in Consumer Banking and All Other. Total production income within mortgage banking income is comprised primarily of revenue from the fair value gains and losses recognized on our interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and loans held-for-sale (LHFS), the related secondary market execution, and costs related to representations and warranties in the sales transactions along with other obligations incurred in the sales of mortgage loans. Servicing income within mortgage banking income includes income earned in connection with servicing activities and MSR valuation adjustments, net of results from risk management activities used to hedge certain market risks of the MSRs. Servicing income for the core portfolio is recorded in Consumer Banking. Servicing income for the non-core portfolio, including hedge ineffectiveness on MSR hedges, is recorded in All Other. The costs associated with our servicing activities are included in noninterest expense.The table below summarizes the components of mortgage banking income. Amounts for other mortgage banking income are included in this Consumer Banking table to show the components of consolidated mortgage banking income.Mortgage Banking Income        Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30(Dollars in millions)2016 2015 2016 2015Mortgage banking income       Consumer Banking mortgage banking income       Total production income$182 $272 $320 $578Net servicing income       Servicing fees179 208 363 450Amortization of expected cash flows (1)(146) (168) (300) (347)Fair value changes of MSRs, net of risk management activities used to hedge certain market risks (2)52 47 74 146Total net servicing income85 87 137 249Total Consumer Banking mortgage banking income267 359 457 827Other mortgage banking income       Other production income (3)14 25 108 24Representations and warranties provision(22) 204 (66) 114Net servicing income       Servicing fees119 152 237 306Amortization of expected cash flows (1)(19) (19) (37) (38)Fair value changes of MSRs, net of risk management activities used to hedge certain market risks (2)10 146 115 297Total net servicing income110 279 315 565Eliminations (4)(57) 134 (69) 165Total other mortgage banking income45 642 288 868Total consolidated mortgage banking income$312 $1,001 $745 $1,695(1) Represents the net change in fair value of the MSR asset due to the recognition of modeled cash flows.(2) Includes gains (losses) on sales of MSRs.(3) Consists primarily of revenue from sales of repurchased loans that had returned to performing status.(4) Includes the effect of transfers of mortgage loans from Consumer Banking to the ALM portfolio included in All Other and net gains or losses on intercompany trades related to MSR risk management.Total production income for Consumer Banking for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $90 million to $182 million, and $258 million to $320 million compared to the same periods in 2015 due to a decrease in production volume to be sold, resulting from a decision to retain certain residential mortgage loans in Consumer Banking.  30Table of ContentsServicingThe costs associated with servicing activities related to the residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios, including owned loans and loans serviced for others (collectively, the mortgage serviced portfolio) are allocated to the business segment that owns the loans or MSRs, or All Other.Servicing activities include collecting cash for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers, disbursing customer draws for lines of credit, accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors and escrow payments to third parties, and responding to customer inquiries. Our home retention efforts, including single point of contact resources, are also part of our servicing activities, along with supervision of foreclosures and property dispositions. Prior to foreclosure, we evaluate various workout options in an effort to help our customers avoid foreclosure.Consumer Banking servicing income for the three months ended June 30, 2016 of $85 million remained relatively unchanged, as lower servicing fees due to a smaller servicing portfolio were offset by improved MSR net-of-hedge performance. Servicing income for the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $112 million to $137 million compared to the same period in 2015 driven by lower servicing fees due to a smaller servicing portfolio and lower MSR net-of-hedge performance. Servicing fees for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 declined 14 percent to $179 million and 19 percent to $363 million compared to the same periods in 2015 as the size of the servicing portfolio continued to decline.Mortgage Servicing RightsAt June 30, 2016, the balance of consumer MSRs managed within Consumer Lending and All Other, which excludes $481 million of certain non-U.S. residential mortgage MSRs recorded in Global Markets, was $1.8 billion compared to $3.2 billion at June 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by higher expected prepayments resulting from lower interest rates, recognition of modeled cash flows and sales of MSRs, partially offset by new loan originations. The core MSR portfolio, held in Consumer Banking, totaled $1.5 billion and $2.7 billion and the non-core MSR portfolio, held in All Other, totaled $320 million and $486 million at June 30, 2016 and 2015.

The asset management fees charged to clients per year are dependent on various factors, but are generally driven by the breadth of the client's relationship and generally range from 50 to 150 bps on their total AUM. The net client long-term AUM flows represent the net change in clients' long-term AUM balances over a specified period of time, excluding market appreciation/depreciation and other adjustments.Client assets under advisory and/or discretion of GWIM in which the investment strategy seeks current income, while maintaining liquidity and capital preservation, are considered liquidity AUM. The duration of these strategies is primarily less than one year. The change in AUM balances from the prior-year periods is primarily the net client flows for liquidity AUM.On April 6, 2016, the Department of Labor released its final rule regarding fiduciary advice to retirement investors. The rule will require advisors to make investment recommendations with regard to retirement assets that are in their clients’ “best interest,” commonly referred to as the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 fiduciary standard. The final rule and exemptions allow the requirements to be phased in beginning April 2017. We do not expect this to have a material financial impact on the Corporation's results in 2016, and we continue to evaluate the impact, if any, thereafter.Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2015Net income for GWIM increased $53 million to $722 million driven by a decrease in noninterest expense, partially offset by a decrease in revenue. Net interest income increased $82 million to $1.4 billion driven by growth in deposit and loan balances. Noninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage services income, decreased $193 million to $3.0 billion driven by lower market valuations and lower transactional revenue, partially offset by a modest gain on the sale of BofA Global Capital Management's AUM. Noninterest expense decreased $197 million to $3.3 billion primarily due to the expiration of fully amortized advisor retention awards, as well as lower revenue-related incentives.Return on average allocated capital remained unchanged at 22 percent. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 24.Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2015Net income for GWIM increased $149 million to $1.4 billion driven by a decrease in noninterest expense, partially offset by a decrease in revenue. Net interest income increased $227 million to $2.9 billion, noninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage services income, decreased $404 million to $6.0 billion and noninterest expense decreased $411 million to $6.6 billion driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above.Return on average allocated capital remained unchanged at 22 percent. 33Table of ContentsKey Indicators and Metrics      Three Months Ended June 30Six Months Ended June 30(Dollars in millions, except as noted)2016 201520162015Revenue by Business     Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management$3,626 $3,788$7,273$7,531U.S. Trust769 7621,5411,511Other (1)61 178635Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis)$4,456 $4,567$8,900$9,077      Client Balances by Business, at period end     Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management   $2,026,392$2,052,636U.S. Trust   393,089388,829Other (1)   —81,318Total client balances   $2,419,481$2,522,783      Client Balances by Type, at period end     Long-term assets under management    $832,394$849,046Liquidity assets under management    —81,314Assets under management   832,394930,360Brokerage assets   1,070,0141,079,084Assets in custody   120,505138,774Deposits   250,976237,624Loans and leases (2)   145,592136,941Total client balances   $2,419,481$2,522,783      Assets Under Management Rollforward     Assets under management, beginning balance$890,663 $917,257$900,863$902,872Net long-term client flows10,055 8,5939,45623,247Net liquidity client flows(4,170) 6,023(7,990)4,530Market valuation/other(64,154) (1,513)(69,935)(289)Total assets under management, ending balance$832,394 $930,360$832,394$930,360      Associates, at period end (3, 4)     Number of financial advisors   16,66416,313Total wealth advisors, including financial advisors   18,15917,734Total client-facing professionals, including financial advisors and wealth advisors   20,56220,231      Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management Metric (4)     Financial advisor productivity (5) (in thousands)$984 $1,050$984$1,046      U.S. Trust Metric, at period end (4)     Client-facing professionals   2,2292,168(1) Includes the results of BofA Global Capital Management, the cash management division of Bank of America, and certain administrative items.

Net interest income increased $251 million to $2.4 billion driven by the impact of growth in loan and leasing-related balances. Noninterest income increased $203 million to $2.3 billion primarily due to the impact from loans and related loan hedging activities in the fair value option portfolio, higher leasing and treasury-related revenues, as well as higher advisory fees.The provision for credit losses increased $26 million to $203 million. Noninterest expense increased $40 million to $2.1 billion primarily driven by investments in client-facing professionals in Commercial and Business Banking.The return on average allocated capital was 16 percent, up from 14 percent, due to higher net income, partially offset by increased capital allocations. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 24. Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2015Net income for Global Banking of $2.5 billion declined modestly as higher provision for credit losses and noninterest expense were largely offset by higher revenue.Revenue increased $458 million to $9.1 billion primarily due to higher net interest income, partially offset by lower noninterest income. Net interest income increased $531 million to $4.9 billion driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above.

For more information on our energy exposure, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Industry Concentrations on page 89. Noninterest expense of $4.3 billion remained relatively unchanged as investments in client-facing professionals in Commercial and Business Banking and higher severance costs were offset by lower revenue-related expenses.The return on average allocated capital was 14 percent, down from 15 percent, due to increased capital allocations and lower net income. 37Table of ContentsGlobal Corporate, Global Commercial and Business BankingGlobal Corporate, Global Commercial and Business Banking each include Business Lending and Global Transaction Services activities.

Total Corporation investment banking fees of $2.6 billion decreased 15 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 driven by lower fees across all products due to a significant decline in overall market fee pools. 39Table of ContentsGlobal Markets Three Months Ended June 30   Six Months Ended June 30  (Dollars in millions)2016 2015 % Change 2016 2015 % ChangeNet interest income (FTE basis)$1,093 $988 11 % $2,273 $1,961 16 %Noninterest income:           Investment and brokerage services525 556 (6) 1,093 1,129 (3)Investment banking fees603 718 (16) 1,097 1,348 (19)Trading account profits1,872 1,703 10 3,467 3,841 (10)All other income (loss)220 (15) n/m 330 (138) n/mTotal noninterest income3,220 2,962 9 5,987 6,180 (3)Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis)4,313 3,950 9 8,260 8,141 1            Provision for credit losses(5) 6 n/m 4 27 (85)Noninterest expense2,582 2,748 (6) 5,032 5,909 (15)Income before income taxes (FTE basis)1,736 1,196 45 3,224 2,205 46Income tax expense (FTE basis)620 410 51 1,138 755 51Net income $1,116 $786 42 $2,086 $1,450 44            Return on average allocated capital 12% 9%   11% 8%  Efficiency ratio (FTE basis)59.88 69.56   60.93 72.58              Balance Sheet            Three Months Ended June 30   Six Months Ended June 30  Average2016 2015 % Change 2016 2015 % ChangeTrading-related assets:           Trading account securities$178,047 $197,117 (10)% $182,989 $195,313 (6)%Reverse repurchases92,805 109,293 (15) 89,108 112,221 (21)Securities borrowed89,779 81,091 11 85,293 79,909 7Derivative assets50,654 54,674 (7) 52,083 55,540 (6)Total trading-related assets (1)411,285 442,175 (7) 409,473 442,983 (8)Total loans and leases69,620 61,819 13 69,452 59,224 17Total earning assets (1)422,815 433,254 (2) 420,506 432,579 (3)Total assets580,701 599,985 (3) 580,963 597,801 (3)Total deposits34,518 39,051 (12) 35,202 39,169 (10)Allocated capital 37,000 35,000 6 37,000 35,000 6            Period end      June 30 2016 December 31 2015 % ChangeTotal trading-related assets (1)     $405,037 $373,926 8 %Total loans and leases     70,766 73,208 (3)Total earning assets (1)     416,325 384,046 8Total assets     577,428 548,790 5Total deposits      33,506 37,038 (10)(1) Trading-related assets include derivative assets, which are considered non-earning assets.n/m = not meaningful 40Table of ContentsGlobal Markets offers sales and trading services, including research, to institutional clients across fixed-income, credit, currency, commodity and equity businesses.

We also work with our commercial and corporate clients to provide risk management products using interest rate, equity, credit, currency and commodity derivatives, foreign exchange, fixed-income and mortgage-related products. As a result of our market-making activities in these products, we may be required to manage risk in a broad range of financial products including government securities, equity and equity-linked securities, high-grade and high-yield corporate debt securities, syndicated loans, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), commodities and asset-backed securities (ABS). The economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Markets and Global Banking under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement. Global Banking originates certain deal-related transactions with our corporate and commercial clients that are executed and distributed by Global Markets. For more information on investment banking fees on a consolidated basis, see page 39.Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2015 Net income for Global Markets increased $330 million to $1.1 billion. Net DVA losses were $164 million compared to losses of $199 million. Excluding net DVA, net income increased $309 million to $1.2 billion primarily driven by higher sales and trading revenue and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by lower equity capital markets investment banking fees. Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, increased $387 million primarily driven by stronger performance globally across rates and currencies and improved credit market conditions. Noninterest expense decreased $166 million to $2.6 billion largely due to lower operating and support costs.Average earning assets decreased $10.4 billion to $422.8 billion largely driven by a decrease in match book financing activity and trading inventory, partially offset by higher loans.The return on average allocated capital was 12 percent, up from nine percent, reflecting an increase in net income, partially offset by an increase in allocated capital. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 24.Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2015 Net income for Global Markets increased $636 million to $2.1 billion. Net DVA losses were $10 million compared to losses of $600 million. Excluding net DVA, net income increased $270 million to $2.1 billion primarily driven by lower noninterest expense, partially offset by lower sales and trading revenue and investment banking fees. Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, decreased $218 million primarily driven by challenging credit market conditions in early 2016 as well as reduced client activity within equities in Asia. Noninterest expense decreased $877 million to $5.0 billion largely due to lower litigation expense and lower revenue-related expenses.Average earning assets decreased $12.1 billion to $420.5 billion largely driven by a decrease in match book financing activity due to a reduction in client demand and continuing balance sheet optimization efforts across Global Markets. Period-end trading-related assets increased $31.1 billion from December 31, 2015 primarily driven by higher securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell due to increased customer financing activity.The return on average allocated capital was 11 percent, up from eight percent, reflecting an increase in net income, partially offset by an increase in allocated capital. 41Table of ContentsSales and Trading RevenueSales and trading revenue includes unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading and other assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. Sales and trading revenue is segregated into fixed-income (government debt obligations, investment and non-investment grade corporate debt obligations, commercial MBS, residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), interest rate and credit derivative contracts), currencies (interest rate and foreign exchange contracts), commodities (primarily futures, forwards, swaps and options) and equities (equity-linked derivatives and cash equity activity). The table below and related discussion present sales and trading revenue, substantially all of which is in Global Markets, with the remainder in Global Banking. In addition, the table below and related discussion present sales and trading revenue excluding the impact of net DVA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe the use of this non-GAAP financial measure provides clarity in assessing the underlying performance of these businesses. The explanations for period-over-period changes in sales and trading, Fixed-income, currencies and commodities (FICC) and Equities results, as set forth below, are the same whether or not net DVA is included.Sales and Trading Revenue (1, 2)        Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30(Dollars in millions)2016 2015 2016 2015Sales and trading revenue       Fixed-income, currencies and commodities$2,458 $1,942 $4,861 $4,295Equities1,082 1,176 2,119 2,313Total sales and trading revenue$3,540 $3,118 $6,980 $6,608        Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA (3)       Fixed-income, currencies and commodities$2,618 $2,142 $4,881 $4,887Equities1,086 1,175 2,109 2,321Total sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA (3)$3,704 $3,317 $6,990 $7,208(1) Includes FTE adjustments of $45 million and $89 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $47 million and $94 million for the same periods in 2015. For more information on sales and trading revenue, see Note 2 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(2) Includes Global Banking sales and trading revenue of $121 million and $281 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $133 million and $208 million for the same periods in 2015.(3) FICC and Equities sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, is a non-GAAP financial measure. FICC net DVA losses were $160 million and $20 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to net DVA losses of $200 million and $592 million for the same periods in 2015. Equities net DVA losses were $4 million and gains were $10 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to net DVA gains of $1 million and losses of $8 million for the same periods in 2015.Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2015 FICC revenue, excluding net DVA, increased $476 million to $2.6 billion, due to stronger performance globally across rates and currencies products, in particular with increased client activity in shorter dated derivatives, and strong financing activity as well as an improved sentiment in local currency trading in Asia and Latin America. A general rally in credit markets improved performance; in particular, secondary loan trading increased and municipal bond activity benefited from strong retail demand. Mortgage results benefited from higher loan balances and credit spreads tightening in reaction to the overall improvement in interest rates. Equities revenue, excluding net DVA, decreased $89 million to $1.1 billion reflecting lower levels of client activity in Asia compared with a strong year-ago period, which benefited from increased market volumes relating to stock market rallies in the region.Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2015 FICC revenue, excluding net DVA, remained relatively unchanged as rates products improved on increased customer flow, offset by reduced performance in G10 currencies, compared to a particularly favorable trading environment in the first half of 2015. Equities revenue, excluding net DVA, decreased $212 million to $2.1 billion primarily driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above, as well as weaker trading performance in the challenging market conditions in early 2016.  42Table of ContentsAll Other Three Months Ended June 30   Six Months Ended June 30  (Dollars in millions)2016 2015 % Change 2016 2015 % ChangeNet interest income (FTE basis)$(788) $1,131 n/m $(1,823) $1,237 n/mNoninterest income:           Card income55 65 (15)% 99 132 (25)%Mortgage banking income44 639 (93) 286 863 (67)Gains on sales of debt securities267 162 65 493 425 16All other loss(280) (328) (15) (612) (661) (7)Total noninterest income86 538 (84) 266 759 (65)Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis)(702) 1,669 n/m (1,557) 1,996 n/m            Provision (benefit) for credit losses38 112 (66) (83) 68 n/mNoninterest expense1,081 1,002 8 3,463 3,298 5Income (loss) before income taxes (FTE basis)(1,821) 555 n/m (4,937) (1,370) n/mIncome tax benefit (FTE basis)(1,006) (226) n/m (2,325) (1,153) 102Net income (loss)$(815) $781 n/m $(2,612) $(217) n/m            Balance Sheet            Three Months Ended June 30   Six Months Ended June 30  Average2016 2015 % Change 2016 2015 % ChangeTotal loans and leases$115,675 $156,886 (26)% $118,919 $162,791 (27)%Total assets (1)260,621 300,851 (13) 261,569 300,530 (13)Total deposits28,690 26,674 8 27,724 24,824 12            Period end      June 30 2016 December 31 2015 % ChangeTotal loans and leases      $111,923 $126,305 (11)%Total assets (1)      260,485 271,853 (4)Total deposits      27,575 25,334 9(1) In segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, we allocate assets from All Other to those segments to match liabilities (i.e., deposits) and allocated shareholders' equity.

ALM activities encompass certain residential mortgages, debt securities, interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities, the impact of certain allocation methodologies and accounting hedge ineffectiveness. The results of certain ALM activities are allocated to our business segments. For more information on our ALM activities, see Note 18 – Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Equity investments include our merchant services joint venture as well as Global Principal Investments (GPI) which is comprised of a portfolio of equity, real estate and other alternative investments. For more information on our merchant services joint venture, see Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The Corporation classifies consumer real estate loans as core or non-core based on loan and customer characteristics such as origination date, product type, LTV, FICO score and delinquency status. Residential mortgage loans that are held for interest rate or liquidity risk management purposes are presented on the balance sheet of All Other. For more information on our interest rate and liquidity risk management activities, see Liquidity Risk on page 58 and Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 106. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, residential mortgage loans held for ALM activities decreased $5.2 billion to $37.9 billion at June 30, 2016 primarily as a result of sales, payoffs and paydowns. Non-core residential mortgage and home equity loans, which are principally run-off portfolios, including certain loans accounted for under the fair value option and MSRs pertaining to non-core loans serviced for others, are also held in All Other. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, total non-core loans decreased $8.3 billion to $60.4 billion at June 30, 2016 due largely to payoffs and paydowns, as well as loan sales.Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2015Net income for All Other decreased $1.6 billion to a net loss of $815 million due to lower net interest income, lower mortgage banking income, lower gains on sales of consumer real estate loans and an increase in noninterest expense, partially offset by higher gains on sales of debt securities and a decrease in the provision for credit losses. Net interest income decreased $1.9 billion primarily driven by negative market-related adjustments on debt securities. Negative market-related adjustments on debt securities were $974 million compared to a positive $669 million in the prior-year period. Gains on the sales of loans, including nonperforming and other delinquent loans, net of hedges, were $21 million compared to gains of $359 million in the prior-year period.The provision for credit losses decreased $74 million to $38 million primarily driven by continued portfolio improvement within the PCI portfolio. Noninterest expense increased $79 million to $1.1 billion driven by higher litigation expense. The income tax benefit was $1.0 billion compared to a benefit of $226 million, driven by the change in the pretax loss. In addition, both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment in noninterest income of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking. Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2015 The net loss for All Other increased $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion due to lower net interest income, lower mortgage banking income, lower gains on sales of consumer real estate loans and an increase in noninterest expense, partially offset by an improvement in the provision for credit losses. Net interest income decreased $3.1 billion primarily driven by negative market-related adjustments on debt securities. Negative market-related adjustments on debt securities were $2.2 billion compared to a positive $185 million in the prior-year period. Gains on the sales of loans, including nonperforming and other delinquent loans, net of hedges, were $178 million compared to gains of $576 million in the prior-year period.The provision for credit losses improved $151 million to a benefit of $83 million primarily driven by continued portfolio improvement within the PCI portfolio. Noninterest expense increased $165 million to $3.5 billion driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. The income tax benefit was $2.3 billion compared to a benefit of $1.2 billion, driven by the change in the pretax loss. In addition, both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment in noninterest income of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking.     44Table of ContentsOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual ObligationsWe have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties. For more information on obligations and commitments, see Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations on page 46 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as Note 11 – Long-term Debt and Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Representations and WarrantiesWe securitize first-lien residential mortgage loans generally in the form of RMBS guaranteed by the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), which include Freddie Mac (FHLMC) and Fannie Mae (FNMA), or by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) in the case of Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs-guaranteed and Rural Housing Service-guaranteed mortgage loans, and sell pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans in the form of whole loans. In addition, in prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans. In connection with these transactions, we or certain of our subsidiaries or legacy companies made various representations and warranties. Breaches of these representations and warranties have resulted in and may continue to result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage loans or to otherwise make whole or provide other remedies to investors, guarantors, insurers or other parties (collectively, repurchases).We have vigorously contested any request for repurchase where we have concluded that a valid basis for repurchase does not exist and will continue to do so in the future. However, in an effort to resolve legacy mortgage-related issues, we have reached settlements, certain of which have been for significant amounts, in lieu of a loan-by-loan review process, including with the GSEs, four monoline insurers and Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon), as trustee for certain securitization trusts.For more information on accounting for and other information related to representations and warranties, repurchase claims and related exposures, see Note 7 – Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Off-balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations in the MD&A of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Note 7 – Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Unresolved Repurchase ClaimsUnresolved representations and warranties repurchase claims represent the notional amount of repurchase claims made by counterparties, typically the outstanding principal balance or the unpaid principal balance at the time of default. In the case of first-lien mortgages, the claim amount is often significantly greater than the expected loss amount due to the benefit of collateral and, in some cases, mortgage insurance (MI) or mortgage guarantee payments. Claims received from a counterparty remain outstanding until the underlying loan is repurchased, the claim is rescinded by the counterparty, we determine that the applicable statute of limitations has expired, or representations and warranties claims with respect to the applicable trust are settled, and fully and finally released. We do not include duplicate claims in the amounts disclosed. At June 30, 2016, we had $18.3 billion of unresolved repurchase claims, predominantly related to subprime and pay option first-lien loans, and home equity loans, compared to $18.4 billion at December 31, 2015. The notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims at both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 included $3.5 billion of claims related to loans in specific private-label securitization groups or tranches where we own substantially all of the outstanding securities. At both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, for loans originated from 2004 through 2008, the notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims submitted by private-label securitization trustees, whole-loan investors, including third-party securitization sponsors, and others was $16.7 billion. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims submitted by the GSEs for loans originated prior to 2009 was $7 million and $14 million. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we continued to have limited loan-level representations and warranties repurchase claims experience with the monoline insurers due to bulk settlements in prior years and ongoing litigation with a single monoline insurer. For more information on unresolved repurchase claims, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations – Unresolved Repurchase Claims on page 47 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 45Table of ContentsLiability for Representations and Warranties and Corporate GuaranteesThe liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related provision is included in mortgage banking income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the liability for representations and warranties was $2.7 billion and $11.3 billion. The reduction in the liability was primarily the result of an $8.5 billion cash payment in February 2016 to BNY Mellon as part of the settlement with BNY Mellon. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the representations and warranties provision was $17 million and $59 million compared to a benefit of $205 million and $121 million for the same periods in 2015. Our liability for representations and warranties is necessarily dependent on, and limited by, a number of factors including for private-label securitizations, the implied repurchase experience based on the settlement with BNY Mellon, as well as certain other assumptions and judgmental factors. Where relevant, we also consider more recent experience, such as claim activity, notification of potential indemnification obligations, our experience with various counterparties, the New York Court of Appeals' ACE Securities Corp. v. DB Structured Products, Inc. (ACE) decision, other recent court decisions related to the statute of limitations, and other facts and circumstances, such as bulk settlements, as we believe appropriate. Accordingly, future provisions associated with obligations under representations and warranties may be materially impacted if future experiences are different from historical experience or our understandings, interpretations or assumptions. For more information on the settlement with BNY Mellon, and the ACE decision and its impact on unresolved repurchase claims, see Note 7 – Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Estimated Range of Possible LossWe currently estimate that the range of possible loss for representations and warranties exposures could be up to $2 billion over existing accruals at June 30, 2016. We treat claims that are time-barred as resolved and do not consider such claims in the estimated range of possible loss. The estimated range of possible loss reflects principally exposures related to loans in private-label securitization trusts. It represents a reasonably possible loss, but does not represent a probable loss, and is based on currently available information, significant judgment and a number of assumptions that are subject to change.For more information on the methodology used to estimate the representations and warranties liability, the corresponding estimated range of possible loss and the types of losses not considered in such estimates, see Note 7 – Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and, for more information related to the sensitivity of the assumptions used to estimate our liability for representations and warranties, see Complex Accounting Estimates – Representations and Warranties Liability on page 104 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Other Mortgage-related MattersWe continue to be subject to additional borrower and non-borrower litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny and investigations related to our past and current origination, servicing, transfer of servicing and servicing rights, servicing compliance obligations, foreclosure activities, and MI and captive reinsurance practices with mortgage insurers. The ongoing environment of additional regulation, increased regulatory compliance obligations, and enhanced regulatory enforcement, combined with ongoing uncertainty related to the continuing evolution of the regulatory environment, has resulted in increased operational and compliance costs and may limit our ability to continue providing certain products and services. For more information on management's estimate of the aggregate range of possible loss for certain litigation matters and on regulatory investigations, see Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 46Table of ContentsManaging RiskRisk is inherent in all our business activities. The seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risks can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. The Corporation takes a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement which are approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC) and the Board.Our Risk Framework is the foundation for comprehensive management of the risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth clear roles, responsibilities and accountability for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities.Our Risk Appetite Statement is intended to ensure that the Corporation maintains an acceptable risk profile by providing a common framework and a comparable set of measures for senior management and the Board to clearly indicate the level of risk the Corporation is willing to accept. Risk appetite is set at least annually in conjunction with the strategic, capital and financial operating plans to align risk appetite with the Corporation's strategy and financial resources. Our line of business strategies and risk appetite are also similarly aligned. For more information on our risk management activities, including our Risk Framework, see pages 49 through 100 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For information on our strategic, compliance, operational and reputational risk management, see page 53 and pages 99 through 100 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 47Table of ContentsCapital ManagementThe Corporation manages its capital position to ensure capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and to maintain capital, risk and risk appetite commensurate with one another. Additionally, we seek to maintain safety and soundness at all times, even under adverse scenarios, take advantage of organic growth opportunities, ensure obligations to creditors and counterparties are met, maintain ready access to financial markets, continue to serve as a credit intermediary, remain a source of strength for our subsidiaries, and satisfy current and future regulatory capital requirements. Capital management is integrated into our risk and governance processes, as capital is a key consideration in the development of our strategic plan, risk appetite and risk limits.We conduct an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) on a periodic basis. The ICAAP is a forward-looking assessment of our projected capital needs and resources, incorporating earnings, balance sheet and risk forecasts under baseline and adverse economic and market conditions. We utilize periodic stress tests to assess the potential impacts to our balance sheet, earnings, regulatory capital and liquidity under a variety of stress scenarios. We perform qualitative risk assessments to identify and assess material risks not adequately captured in our forecasts or stress tests. We assess the potential capital impacts of proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements. Management evaluates ICAAP results and provides documented quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our capital guidelines and capital position to the Board or its committees.The Corporation periodically reviews capital allocated to its businesses and allocates capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. For additional information, see Business Segment Operations on page 24.CCAR and Capital PlanningThe Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and requests for capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the CCAR capital plan.In April 2016, we submitted our 2016 CCAR capital plan and related supervisory stress tests. The 2016 CCAR capital plan included a request to repurchase $5.0 billion of common stock over four quarters beginning in the third quarter of 2016, and to increase the quarterly common stock dividend from $0.05 per share to $0.075 per share. On June 29, 2016, following the Federal Reserve's non-objection to our 2016 CCAR capital plan, the Board authorized the common stock repurchase beginning July 1, 2016. The common stock repurchase authorization includes both common stock and warrants, and is net of shares awarded under the Corporation's equity-based compensation plans. The timing and amount of common stock repurchases will be subject to various factors, including the Corporation's capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. The common stock repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a "well-capitalized" BHC, we may notify the Federal Reserve of our intention to make additional capital distributions not to exceed one percent of Tier 1 capital and which were not contemplated in our capital plan, subject to the Federal Reserve's non-objection.As of June 30, 2016, in connection with our 2015 CCAR capital plan that began in the second quarter of 2015, we repurchased $4.0 billion of common stock. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we also repurchased $800 million of additional common stock outside of the scope of the 2015 CCAR capital plan to offset share count dilution resulting from equity incentive compensation awarded to retirement-eligible employees.Regulatory CapitalAs a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by U.S. banking regulators. On January 1, 2014, we became subject to Basel 3, which includes certain transition provisions through January 1, 2019. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3.  48Table of ContentsBasel 3 OverviewBasel 3 updated the composition of capital and established a Common equity tier 1 capital ratio. Common equity tier 1 capital primarily includes common stock, retained earnings and accumulated OCI. Basel 3 revised minimum capital ratios and buffer requirements, added a SLR, and addressed the adequately capitalized minimum requirements under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. Finally, Basel 3 established two methods of calculating risk-weighted assets, the Standardized approach and the Advanced approaches. As an Advanced approaches institution, we are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy including under the PCA framework. For additional information, see Capital Management – Standardized Approach and Capital Management – Advanced Approaches on page 50.Regulatory Capital CompositionBasel 3 requires certain deductions from and adjustments to capital, which are primarily those related to goodwill, deferred tax assets, intangibles, MSRs and defined benefit pension fund assets. Also, any assets that are a direct deduction from the computation of capital are excluded from risk-weighted assets and adjusted average total assets. Basel 3 also provides for the inclusion in capital of net unrealized gains and losses on debt and certain marketable equity securities recorded in accumulated OCI. These changes are impacted by, among other factors, fluctuations in interest rates, earnings performance and corporate actions. Under Basel 3 regulatory capital transition provisions, changes to the composition of regulatory capital are generally recognized in 20 percent annual increments, and will be fully recognized as of January 1, 2018.Table 15 summarizes how certain regulatory capital deductions and adjustments have been or will be transitioned from 2014 through 2018 for Common equity tier 1 and Tier 1 capital.Table 15Summary of Certain Basel 3 Regulatory Capital Transition ProvisionsBeginning on January 1 of each year2014 2015 2016 2017 2018Common equity tier 1 capital         Percent of total amount deducted from Common equity tier 1 capital includes:20% 40% 60% 80% 100%Deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards; intangibles, other than mortgage servicing rights and goodwill; defined benefit pension fund net assets; net unrealized cumulative gains (losses) related to changes in own credit risk on liabilities, including derivatives, measured at fair value; direct and indirect investments in our own Common equity tier 1 capital instruments; certain amounts exceeding the threshold by 10 percent individually and 15 percent in aggregatePercent of total amount used to adjust Common equity tier 1 capital includes (1):80% 60% 40% 20% 0%Net unrealized gains (losses) on debt and certain marketable equity securities recorded in accumulated OCI; employee benefit plan adjustments recorded in accumulated OCITier 1 capital         Percent of total amount deducted from Tier 1 capital includes:80% 60% 40% 20% 0%Deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards; defined benefit pension fund net assets; net unrealized cumulative gains (losses) related to changes in own credit risk on liabilities, including derivatives, measured at fair value(1) Represents the phase-out percentage of the exclusion by year (e.g., 60 percent of net unrealized gains (losses) on debt and certain marketable equity securities recorded in accumulated OCI will be included in 2016).Additionally, Basel 3 revised the regulatory capital treatment for Trust Securities, requiring them to be transitioned from Tier 1 capital into Tier 2 capital in 2014 and 2015, until fully excluded from Tier 1 capital in 2016, and transitioned from Tier 2 capital beginning in 2016 with the full exclusion in 2022. As of June 30, 2016, our qualifying Trust Securities were $3.4 billion, approximately 22 bps of the Total capital ratio.Minimum Capital RequirementsMinimum capital requirements and related buffers are being phased in from January 1, 2014 through January 1, 2019. Effective January 1, 2015, the PCA framework was also amended to reflect the requirements of Basel 3. The PCA framework establishes categories of capitalization, including "well capitalized," based on regulatory ratio requirements. U.S. banking regulators are required to take certain mandatory actions depending on the category of capitalization, with no mandatory actions required for "well-capitalized" banking organizations, which included BANA at June 30, 2016.  49Table of ContentsOn January 1, 2016, we became subject to a capital conservation buffer, a countercyclical capital buffer and a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge which will be phased in over a three-year period ending January 1, 2019. Once fully phased in, the Corporation's risk-based capital ratio requirements will include a capital conservation buffer greater than 2.5 percent, plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and G-SIB surcharge in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The buffers and surcharge must be composed solely of Common equity tier 1 capital. Under the phase-in provisions, in 2016 we must maintain a capital conservation buffer greater than 0.625 percent plus a G-SIB surcharge of 0.75 percent. The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set at zero. U.S. banking regulators must jointly decide on any increase in the countercyclical capital buffer, after which time institutions will have up to one year for implementation. The G-SIB surcharge is calculated on an annual basis and determined by using the higher of two scores based on distinct systemic indicator-based methodologies. Method 1 is consistent with the approach prescribed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) and uses indicators for size, complexity, cross-jurisdictional activity, inter-connectedness and substitutability/financial institution infrastructure to determine a score relative to the global banking industry. Method 2 replaces the substitutability/financial institution infrastructure indicator with a measure of short-term wholesale funding and then determines the overall score by applying a fixed multiplier for each of the other systemic indicators. Once fully phased in, we estimate that our G-SIB surcharge will be 3.0 percent under method 2 and 1.5 percent under method 1. The G-SIB surcharge may differ from this estimate over time. Standardized ApproachTotal risk-weighted assets under the Basel 3 Standardized approach consist of credit risk and market risk measures. Credit risk-weighted assets are measured by applying fixed risk weights to on- and off-balance sheet exposures (excluding securitizations), determined based on the characteristics of the exposure, such as type of obligor, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development country risk code and maturity, among others. Off-balance sheet exposures primarily include financial guarantees, unfunded lending commitments, letters of credit and potential future derivative exposures. Market risk applies to covered positions which include trading assets and liabilities, foreign exchange exposures and commodity exposures. Market risk capital is modeled for general market risk and specific risk for products where specific risk regulatory approval has been granted; in the absence of specific risk model approval, standard specific risk charges apply. For securitization exposures, risk-weighted assets are determined using the Simplified Supervisory Formula Approach (SSFA). Under the Standardized approach, no distinction is made for variations in credit quality for corporate exposures, and the economic benefit of collateral is restricted to a limited list of eligible securities and cash.Advanced ApproachesIn addition to the credit risk and market risk measures, Basel 3 Advanced approaches include measures of operational risk and risks related to the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) for over-the-counter (OTC) derivative exposures. The Advanced approaches rely on internal analytical models to measure risk weights for credit risk exposures and allow the use of models to estimate the exposure at default (EAD) for certain exposure types. Market risk capital measurements are consistent with the Standardized approach, except for securitization exposures. For both trading and non-trading securitization exposures, institutions are permitted to use the Supervisory Formula Approach (SFA) and would use the SSFA if the SFA is unavailable for a particular exposure. Non-securitization credit risk exposures are measured using internal ratings-based models to determine the applicable risk weight by estimating the probability of default, loss-given default (LGD) and, in certain instances, EAD. The internal analytical models primarily rely on internal historical default and loss experience. Operational risk is measured using internal analytical models which rely on both internal and external operational loss experience and data. The calculations require management to make estimates, assumptions and interpretations, including with respect to the probability of future events based on historical experience. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. Under the Federal Reserve's reservation of authority, they may require us to hold an amount of capital greater than otherwise required under the capital rules if they determine that our risk-based capital requirement using our internal analytical models is not commensurate with our credit, market, operational or other risks.Supplementary Leverage RatioBasel 3 also requires Advanced approaches institutions to disclose a SLR. The numerator of the SLR is quarter-end Basel 3 Tier 1 capital. The denominator is total leverage exposure based on the daily average of the sum of on-balance sheet exposures less permitted Tier 1 deductions, as well as the simple average of certain off-balance sheet exposures, as of the end of each month in a quarter. Off-balance sheet exposures primarily include undrawn lending commitments, letters of credit, potential future derivative exposures and repo-style transactions. Total leverage exposure includes the effective notional principal amount of credit derivatives and similar instruments through which credit protection is sold. The credit conversion factors (CCFs) applied to certain off-balance sheet exposures conform to the graduated CCF utilized under the Basel 3 Standardized approach, but are subject to a minimum 10 percent CCF. Effective January 1, 2018, the Corporation will be required to maintain a minimum SLR of 3.0 percent, plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent, in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses. Insured depository institution subsidiaries of BHCs, including BANA, will be required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered "well capitalized" under the PCA framework. 50Table of ContentsCapital Composition and RatiosTable 16 presents Bank of America Corporation's transition and fully phased-in capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

As of June 30, 2016, we did not have regulatory approval for the IMM model.(5) Fully phased-in regulatory capital minimums assume a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent and estimated G-SIB surcharge of 3.0 percent. The estimated fully phased-in countercyclical capital buffer is zero. We will be subject to fully phased-in regulatory minimums on January 1, 2019. The fully phased-in SLR minimum assumes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent and is applicable on January 1, 2018.(6) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losses.(7) Reflects adjusted average total assets for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 51Table of ContentsCommon equity tier 1 capital under Basel 3 Advanced – Transition was $166.2 billion at June 30, 2016, an increase of $3.1 billion compared to December 31, 2015 driven by earnings and an increase in accumulated OCI, partially offset by dividends, common stock repurchases and the impact of certain transition provisions under the Basel 3 rules. For more information on Basel 3 transition provisions, see Table 15. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, Total capital increased $6.9 billion primarily driven by the same factors that drove the increase in Common equity tier 1 capital as well as issuances of preferred stock and subordinated debt.Risk-weighted assets decreased $41 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2016 to $1,562 billion primarily due to lower market risk, lower exposures and improved credit quality on retail products.Table 17 presents the capital composition as measured under Basel 3 – Transition at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Table 17Capital Composition under Basel 3 – Transition (1)(Dollars in millions)June 30 2016 December 31 2015Total common shareholders' equity$241,849 $233,932Goodwill(69,194) (69,215)Deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards(5,245) (3,434)Unamortized net periodic benefit costs recorded in accumulated OCI, net-of-tax1,173 1,774Net unrealized (gains) losses on debt and equity securities and net (gains) losses on derivatives recorded in accumulated OCI, net-of-tax(605) 1,220Intangibles, other than mortgage servicing rights and goodwill(1,359) (1,039)DVA related to liabilities and derivatives157 204Other(603) (416)Common equity tier 1 capital166,173 163,026Qualifying preferred stock, net of issuance cost25,220 22,273Deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards(3,496) (5,151)Trust preferred securities— 1,430Defined benefit pension fund assets(378) (568)DVA related to liabilities and derivatives under transition104 307Other(414) (539)Total Tier 1 capital187,209 180,778Long-term debt qualifying as Tier 2 capital23,757 22,579Eligible credit reserves included in Tier 2 capital3,466 3,116Nonqualifying capital instruments subject to phase out from Tier 2 capital3,408 4,448Other(12) (9)Total Basel 3 capital$217,828 $210,912(1) As an Advanced approaches institution, we are required to report regulatory capital risk-weighted assets and ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches.

Under the proposal, U.S. G-SIBs would be required to maintain a minimum external TLAC of the greater of: (1) 16 percent of risk-weighted assets in 2019, increasing to 18 percent of risk-weighted assets in 2022 (plus additional TLAC equal to enough Common equity tier 1 capital as a percentage of risk-weighted assets to cover the capital conservation buffer, any applicable countercyclical capital buffer plus the applicable method 1 G-SIB surcharge), or (2) 9.5 percent of the denominator of the SLR. In addition, U.S. G-SIBs must meet a minimum long-term debt requirement equal to the greater of: (1) 6.0 percent of risk-weighted assets plus the applicable method 2 G-SIB surcharge, or (2) 4.5 percent of the denominator of the SLR.Revisions to Approaches for Measuring Risk-weighted AssetsThe Basel Committee has several open proposals to revise key methodologies for measuring risk-weighted assets. The proposals include a standardized approach for credit risk, standardized approach for operational risk, revisions to the CVA risk framework and constraints on the use of internal models. The Basel Committee has also finalized a revised standardized model for counterparty credit risk, revisions to the securitization framework and its fundamental review of the trading book, which updates both modeled and standardized approaches for market risk measurement. These revisions are to be coupled with a proposed capital floor framework to limit the extent to which banks can reduce risk-weighted asset levels through the use of internal models, both at the input parameter and aggregate risk-weighted asset level. The Basel Committee expects to finalize the outstanding proposals by the end of 2016. Once the proposals are finalized, U.S. banking regulators may update the U.S. Basel 3 rules to incorporate the Basel Committee revisions.Single-Counterparty Credit LimitsOn March 4, 2016, the Federal Reserve issued an NPR to establish Single-Counterparty Credit Limits (SCCL) for large U.S. BHCs. The SCCL rule is designed to complement and serve as a backstop to risk-based capital requirements to ensure that the maximum possible loss that a bank could incur due to a single counterparty's default would not endanger the bank's survival. Under the proposal, U.S. BHCs must calculate SCCL by dividing the net aggregate credit exposure to a given counterparty by a bank's eligible Tier 1 capital base, ensuring that exposure to G-SIBs and other nonbank systemically important financial institutions do not breach 15 percent and exposures to other counterparties do not breach 25 percent. 55Table of ContentsBroker-dealer Regulatory Capital and Securities RegulationThe Corporation's principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc. (MLPF&S) and Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp (MLPCC). MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of MLPF&S and provides clearing and settlement services. Both entities are subject to the net capital requirements of SEC Rule 15c3-1. Both entities are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Regulation 1.17.MLPF&S has elected to compute the minimum capital requirement in accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirement as permitted by SEC Rule 15c3-1. At June 30, 2016, MLPF&S's regulatory net capital as defined by Rule 15c3-1 was $11.4 billion and exceeded the minimum requirement of $1.5 billion by $9.9 billion. MLPCC's net capital of $3.1 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $534 million by $2.6 billion.In accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirements, MLPF&S is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion, net capital in excess of $500 million and notify the Securities and Exchange Commission in the event its tentative net capital is less than $5.0 billion. At June 30, 2016, MLPF&S had tentative net capital and net capital in excess of the minimum and notification requirements.Merrill Lynch International (MLI), a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority, and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At June 30, 2016, MLI's capital resources were $35.0 billion which exceeded the minimum requirement of $16.4 billion. 56Table of ContentsCommon and Preferred Stock DividendsFor a summary of our declared quarterly cash dividends on common stock during the second quarter of 2016 and through August 1, 2016, see Note 11 – Shareholders' Equity to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet all contractual and contingent financial obligations at all times, including during periods of stress. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks.We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as those obligations arise. We manage our liquidity position through line of business and asset-liability management activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management within Corporate Treasury enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. For more information regarding global funding and liquidity risk management, see Liquidity Risk – Funding and Liquidity Risk Management on page 60 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Global Excess Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered AssetsWe maintain liquidity available to Bank of America Corporation, including the parent company and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Our liquidity buffer, or GELS, is comprised of assets that are readily available to the parent company and selected subsidiaries, including bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, even during stressed market conditions. Our cash is primarily on deposit with the Federal Reserve and, to a lesser extent, central banks outside of the U.S. We limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS and a select group of non-U.S. government and supranational securities. We believe we can quickly obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold our GELS in legal entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses, and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities. Our GELS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. For more information on the final rules, see Liquidity Risk – Basel 3 Liquidity Standards on page 60. 58Table of ContentsOur GELS were $515 billion and $504 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and were as shown in Table 22.Table 22Global Excess Liquidity Sources(Dollars in billions)June 30 2016 December 31 2015 Average for Three Months Ended June 30, 2016Parent company$85 $96 $88Bank subsidiaries386 361 384Other regulated entities44 47 46Total Global Excess Liquidity Sources$515 $504 $518As shown in Table 22, parent company GELS totaled $85 billion and $96 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The decrease in parent company liquidity was primarily due to the BNY Mellon settlement payment in the first quarter of 2016. Typically, parent company liquidity is in the form of cash deposited with BANA.GELS available to our bank subsidiaries totaled $386 billion and $361 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The increase in bank subsidiaries' liquidity was primarily due to deposit inflows. GELS at bank subsidiaries exclude the cash deposited by the parent company. Our bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs) and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $282 billion and $252 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries and can only be transferred to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries with prior regulatory approval.GELS available to our other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, totaled $44 billion and $47 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Our other regulated entities also held unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity. Liquidity held in an other regulated entity is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity and transfers to the parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements.Table 23 presents the composition of GELS at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Table 23Global Excess Liquidity Sources Composition (Dollars in billions)June 30 2016 December 31 2015Cash on deposit$133 $119U.S. Treasury securities36 38U.S. agency securities and mortgage-backed securities329 327Non-U.S. government and supranational securities17 20Total Global Excess Liquidity Sources$515 $504Time-to-required Funding and Stress ModelingWe use a variety of metrics to determine the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company, our bank subsidiaries and other regulated entities. One metric we use to evaluate the appropriate level of liquidity at the parent company is "time-to-required funding." This debt coverage measure indicates the number of months the parent company can continue to meet its unsecured contractual obligations as they come due using only the parent company's liquidity sources without issuing any new debt or accessing any additional liquidity sources. We define unsecured contractual obligations for purposes of this metric as maturities of senior or subordinated debt issued or guaranteed by Bank of America Corporation. These include certain unsecured debt instruments, primarily structured liabilities, which we may be required to settle for cash prior to maturity. Our time-to-required funding was 35 months at June 30, 2016. We also utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company, our bank subsidiaries and other regulated entities. The liquidity stress testing process is an integral part of analyzing our potential  59Table of Contentscontractual and contingent cash outflows beyond the outflows considered in the time-to-required funding analysis. We evaluate the liquidity requirements under a range of scenarios with varying levels of severity and time horizons. The scenarios we consider and utilize incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific events, including potential credit rating downgrades for the parent company and our subsidiaries, and are based on historical experience, regulatory guidance, and both expected and unexpected future events.The types of potential contractual and contingent cash outflows we consider in our scenarios may include, but are not limited to, upcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt and reductions in new debt issuance; diminished access to secured financing markets; potential deposit withdrawals; increased draws on loan commitments, liquidity facilities and letters of credit; additional collateral that counterparties could call if our credit ratings were downgraded; collateral and margin requirements arising from market value changes; and potential liquidity required to maintain businesses and finance customer activities. Changes in certain market factors including, but not limited to, credit rating downgrades, could negatively impact potential contractual and contingent outflows and the related financial instruments, and in some cases these impacts could be material to our financial results.We consider all sources of funds that we could access during each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available sources with corresponding liquidity requirements by legal entity. We also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset-liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses.Basel 3 Liquidity StandardsThere are two liquidity risk-related standards that are considered part of the Basel 3 liquidity standards: the LCR and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR).The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution's unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. An initial minimum LCR of 80 percent was required as of January 2015, increased to 90 percent as of January 2016 and will increase to 100 percent in January 2017. These minimum requirements are applicable to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. As of June 30, 2016, we estimate that the consolidated Corporation was above the 2017 LCR requirements. The Corporation's LCR may fluctuate from period to period due to normal business flows from customer activity.In 2014, the Basel Committee issued a final standard for the NSFR, the standard that is intended to reduce funding risk over a longer time horizon. The NSFR is designed to ensure an appropriate amount of stable funding, generally capital and liabilities maturing beyond one year, given the mix of assets and off-balance sheet items. In April 2016, U.S. banking regulators issued a proposal for an NSFR requirement applicable to U.S. financial institutions. The U.S. NSFR would apply to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions beginning on January 1, 2018. We expect to meet the NSFR requirement within the regulatory timeline.Diversified Funding SourcesWe fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding strategy. We diversify our funding globally across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups.The primary benefits of our centralized funding strategy include greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations, time zone differences or other business considerations make parent company funding impractical, certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt.We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.22 trillion and $1.20 trillion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Deposits are primarily generated by our Consumer Banking, GWIM and Global Banking segments. These deposits are diversified by clients, product type and geography, and the majority of our U.S. deposits are insured by the FDIC. We consider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of funding. We believe this deposit funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources. Our lending activities may also be financed through secured borrowings, including credit card securitizations and securitizations with GSEs, the FHA and private-label investors, as well as FHLB loans. 60Table of ContentsOur trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. We believe funding these activities in the secured financing markets is more cost-efficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing. Repurchase agreements are generally short-term and often overnight. Disruptions in secured financing markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant reductions in the availability of such financing. We manage the liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding globally from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when appropriate. For more information on secured financing agreements, see Note 9 – Federal Funds Sold or Purchased, Securities Financing Agreements and Short-term Borrowings to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We issue long-term unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. While the cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or the Corporation, we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month or quarter.During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we issued $9.6 billion and $15.9 billion of long-term debt, consisting of $7.3 billion and $11.6 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $885 million and $931 million for Bank of America, N.A. and $1.4 billion and $3.4 billion of other debt.Table 24 presents the carrying value of aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt as of June 30, 2016. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we had total long-term debt maturities and purchases of $27.9 billion consisting of $13.9 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $8.5 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $5.5 billion of other debt.Table 24Long-term Debt By Maturity Remainder of            (Dollars in millions)2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Thereafter TotalBank of America Corporation             Senior notes$9,012 $18,375 $20,150 $16,961 $11,630 $48,945 $125,073Senior structured notes1,682 3,460 2,697 1,407 975 7,797 18,018Subordinated notes1,774 5,026 2,753 1,494 3 21,605 32,655Junior subordinated notes— — — — — 5,850 5,850Total Bank of America Corporation12,468 26,861 25,600 19,862 12,608 84,197 181,596Bank of America, N.A.

These impacts were substantially offset through derivative hedge transactions. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity and other factors. In addition, our other regulated entities may make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. For more information on long-term debt funding, see Note 11 – Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and for more information regarding funding and liquidity risk management, see page 60 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For further details on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 106.We may also issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes for client purposes. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we issued $1.5 billion and $3.4 billion of structured notes, a majority of which was issued by Bank of America Corporation. Structured notes are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price.Contingency PlanningWe maintain contingency funding plans that outline our potential responses to liquidity stress events at various levels of severity. These policies and plans are based on stress scenarios and include potential funding strategies and communication and notification procedures that we would implement in the event we experienced stressed liquidity conditions. We periodically review and test the contingency funding plans to validate efficacy and assess readiness.Our U.S. bank subsidiaries can access contingency funding through the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries have access to central bank facilities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. While we do not rely on these sources in our liquidity modeling, we maintain the policies, procedures and governance processes that would enable us to access these sources if necessary. 62Table of ContentsCredit RatingsOur borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are impacted by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including OTC derivatives. Thus, it is our objective to maintain high-quality credit ratings, and management maintains an active dialogue with the major rating agencies.Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies, and they consider a number of factors, including our own financial strength, performance, prospects and operations, as well as factors not under our control. The rating agencies could make adjustments to our ratings at any time, and they provide no assurances that they will maintain our ratings at current levels.Other factors that influence our credit ratings include changes to the rating agencies' methodologies for our industry or certain security types; the rating agencies' assessment of the general operating environment for financial services companies; our relative positions in the markets in which we compete; our various risk exposures and risk management policies and activities; pending litigation and other contingencies or potential tail risks; our reputation; our liquidity position, diversity of funding sources and funding costs; the current and expected level and volatility of our earnings; our capital position and capital management practices; our corporate governance; the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government; current or future regulatory and legislative initiatives; and the agencies' views on whether the U.S. government would provide meaningful support to the Corporation or its subsidiaries in a crisis.Table 26 presents the Corporation's current long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies. These ratings have not changed from those disclosed in the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information on credit ratings, see Liquidity Risk – Credit Ratings on page 63 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Table 26Senior Debt Ratings  Moody's Investors Service Standard & Poor's Fitch Ratings Long-term Short-term Outlook Long-term Short-term (1) Outlook Long-term Short-term OutlookBank of America CorporationBaa1 P-2 Stable BBB+ A-2 Stable A F1 StableBank of America, N.A.A1 P-1 Stable A A-1 CreditWatch Positive A+ F1 StableMerrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.NR NR NR A A-1 CreditWatch Positive A+ F1 StableMerrill Lynch InternationalNR NR NR A A-1 CreditWatch Positive A F1 Positive(1) Standard & Poor's Ratings Services short-term ratings are not on CreditWatch.NR = not ratedA reduction in certain of our credit ratings or the ratings of certain asset-backed securitizations may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, potential loss of access to credit markets, the related cost of funds, our businesses and on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where counterparty creditworthiness is critical. In addition, under the terms of certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, in the event of downgrades of our or our rated subsidiaries' credit ratings, the counterparties to those agreements may require us to provide additional collateral, or to terminate these contracts or agreements, which could cause us to sustain losses and/or adversely impact our liquidity. If the short-term credit ratings of our parent company, bank or broker-dealer subsidiaries were downgraded by one or more levels, the potential loss of access to short-term funding sources such as repo financing and the effect on our incremental cost of funds could be material.While certain potential impacts are contractual and quantifiable, the full scope of the consequences of a credit rating downgrade to a financial institution is inherently uncertain, as it depends upon numerous dynamic, complex and inter-related factors and assumptions, including whether any downgrade of a company's long-term credit ratings precipitates downgrades to its short-term credit ratings, and assumptions about the potential behaviors of various customers, investors and counterparties. For more information on potential impacts of credit rating downgrades, see Liquidity Risk – Time-to-required Funding and Stress Modeling on page 59.For more information on the additional collateral and termination payments that could be required in connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements as a result of such a credit rating downgrade, see Note 2 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein and Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 63Table of ContentsCredit Risk ManagementOverall credit quality remained strong in the second quarter of 2016. Consumer portfolios continued to improve driven by lower U.S. unemployment and improving home prices. Overall, commercial portfolios, outside of the energy sector, remained strong. Additionally, our proactive credit risk management activities positively impacted our credit portfolio as nonperforming loans and leases and delinquencies continued to improve. For additional information, see Executive Summary – Second Quarter 2016 Economic and Business Environment on page 4.We proactively refine our underwriting and credit risk management practices as well as credit standards to meet the changing economic environment. To mitigate losses and enhance customer support in our consumer businesses, we have in place collection programs and loan modification and customer assistance infrastructures. We utilize a number of actions to mitigate losses in the commercial businesses including increasing the frequency and intensity of portfolio monitoring, hedging activity and our practice of transferring management of deteriorating commercial exposures to independent special asset officers as credits enter criticized categories.We have non-U.S. exposure largely in Europe and Asia Pacific. For more information on our exposures and related risks in non-U.S. countries, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 93 and Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Utilized energy exposure represents approximately two percent of total loans and leases, and we continue to proactively monitor energy and energy-related exposures as well as any ancillary impacts on our customers and clients. For more information on our exposures and related risks in the energy sector, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Industry Concentrations on page 89 as well as Table 51.For more information on our credit risk management activities, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 65, Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 81, Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 93, Provision for Credit Losses on page 95, Allowance for Credit Losses on page 95, and Note 4 – Outstanding Loans and Leases and Note 5 – Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 64Table of ContentsConsumer Portfolio Credit Risk ManagementCredit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower's credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience. These models are a component of our consumer credit risk management process and are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk.Consumer Credit PortfolioImprovement in the U.S. unemployment rate and home prices continued during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 resulting in improved credit quality and lower credit losses across most major consumer portfolios compared to the same periods in 2015. The 30 and 90 days or more past due balances declined across nearly all consumer loan portfolios during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as a result of improved delinquency trends.Improved credit quality, continued loan balance run-off and sales across the consumer portfolio drove an $842 million decrease in the consumer allowance for loan and lease losses during the six months ended June 30, 2016 to $6.5 billion at June 30, 2016. For additional information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 95.For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, charge-offs and TDRs for the consumer portfolio, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Nonperforming loans do not include past due consumer credit card loans, other unsecured loans and in general, consumer non-real estate-secured loans (loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy are included) as these loans are typically charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. Real estate-secured past due consumer loans that are insured by the FHA or individually insured under long-term standby agreements with FNMA and FHLMC (collectively, the fully-insured loan portfolio) are reported as accruing as opposed to nonperforming since the principal repayment is insured. Fully-insured loans included in accruing past due 90 days or more are primarily from our repurchases of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA. Additionally, nonperforming loans and accruing balances past due 90 days or more do not include the PCI loan portfolio or loans accounted for under the fair value option even though the customer may be contractually past due.Table 28Consumer Credit Quality Nonperforming Accruing Past Due 90 Days or More(Dollars in millions)June 30 2016 December 31 2015 June 30 2016 December 31 2015Residential mortgage (1)$3,592 $4,803 $5,659 $7,150Home equity3,085 3,337 — —U.S. credit cardn/a n/a 693 789Non-U.S. credit cardn/a n/a 69 76Direct/Indirect consumer27 24 26 39Other consumer1 1 2 3Total (2)$6,705 $8,165 $6,449 $8,057Consumer loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans and leases (2)1.49% 1.80% 1.43% 1.77%Consumer loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding loans and leases, excluding PCI and fully-insured loan portfolios (2)1.66 2.04 0.20 0.23(1) Residential mortgage loans accruing past due 90 days or more are fully-insured loans.

Net charge-off ratios, excluding the PCI and fully-insured loan portfolios, were 0.52 percent and 0.55 percent for residential mortgage, 0.78 percent and 0.83 percent for home equity, and 1.00 percent and 1.05 percent for the total consumer portfolio for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. These are the only product classifications that include PCI and fully-insured loans for these periods.Net charge-offs, as shown in Tables 29 and 30, exclude write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio of $37 million and $76 million in residential mortgage for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $264 million and $452 million for the same periods in 2015. Net charge-offs, as shown in Tables 29 and 30, exclude write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio of $45 million and $111 million in home equity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $26 million and $126 million for the same periods in 2015. Net charge-off ratios including the PCI write-offs were 0.15 percent and 0.22 percent for residential mortgage for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 0.86 percent and 0.80 percent for the same periods in 2015. Net charge-off ratios including the PCI write-offs were 0.95 percent for home equity for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 0.86 percent and 1.08 percent for the same periods in 2015. For more information on PCI write-offs, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 76.Table 30 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances, net charge-offs, allowance for loan and lease losses and provision for loan and lease losses for the core and non-core portfolio within the consumer real estate portfolio. Following the realignment of our business segments effective April 1, 2016, we now categorize consumer real estate loans as core and non-core on the basis of loan and customer characteristics such as origination date, product type, LTV, FICO score and delinquency status consistent with our current consumer and mortgage servicing strategy. Generally, loans that were originated after January 1, 2010, qualified under government-sponsored enterprise underwriting guidelines, or otherwise met our underwriting guidelines in place in 2015 are characterized as core loans. Loans held in legacy private-label securitizations, government-insured loans originated prior to 2010, loan products no longer originated, and loans originated prior to 2010 and classified as nonperforming or modified in a TDR prior to 2016 are generally characterized as non-core loans, and are principally run-off portfolios. Core loans as reported within Table 30 include loans held in the Consumer Banking and GWIM segments, as well as loans held for ALM activities in All Other. For more information on core and non-core loans, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 4 – Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 68Table of ContentsTable 30    Consumer Real Estate Portfolio (1)     Outstandings Nonperforming Net Charge-offs (2) June 30 2016 December 31 2015 June 30 2016 December 31 2015 Three Months EndedJune 30 Six Months EndedJune 30(Dollars in millions)    2016 2015 2016 2015Core portfolio               Residential mortgage$146,100 $141,795 $1,492 $1,825 $7 $21 $(11) $66Home equity52,477 54,917 937 974 28 45 46 80Total core portfolio198,577 196,712 2,429 2,799 35 66 35 146Non-core portfolio               Residential mortgage39,843 46,116 2,100 2,978 27 156 136 308Home equity19,110 21,031 2,148 2,363 98 106 192 243Total non-core portfolio58,953 67,147 4,248 5,341 125 262 328 551Consumer real estate portfolio               Residential mortgage185,943 187,911 3,592 4,803 34 177 125 374Home equity71,587 75,948 3,085 3,337 126 151 238 323Total consumer real estate portfolio$257,530 $263,859 $6,677 $8,140 $160 $328 $363 $697                     Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Provision for Loan and Lease Losses     June 30 2016 December 31 2015 Three Months EndedJune 30 Six Months EndedJune 30       2016 2015 2016 2015Core portfolio               Residential mortgage    $281 $319 $— $(21) $(53) $(4)Home equity    626 664 8 23 8 4Total core portfolio  907 983 8 2 (45) —Non-core portfolio               Residential mortgage    911 1,181 (50) 33 (54) (73)Home equity    1,391 1,750 37 73 (56) 153Total non-core portfolio  2,302 2,931 (13) 106 (110) 80Consumer real estate portfolio               Residential mortgage    1,192 1,500 (50) 12 (107) (77)Home equity    2,017 2,414 45 96 (48) 157Total consumer real estate portfolio    $3,209 $3,914 $(5) $108 $(155) $80(1) Outstandings and nonperforming loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option.

For more information on the fair value option, see Note 15 – Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(2) Net charge-offs exclude write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio. For more information on PCI write-offs, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 76.We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we provide information that excludes the impact of the PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option in certain credit quality statistics. We separately disclose information on the PCI loan portfolio on page 76. 69Table of ContentsResidential MortgageThe residential mortgage portfolio makes up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 41 percent of consumer loans and leases at June 30, 2016. Approximately 42 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio is in All Other and is comprised of originated loans, purchased loans used in our overall ALM activities, delinquent FHA loans repurchased pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA as well as loans repurchased related to our representations and warranties. Approximately 32 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio is in GWIM and represents residential mortgages originated for the home purchase and refinancing needs of our wealth management clients and the remaining portion of the portfolio is primarily in Consumer Banking.Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, decreased $2.0 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2016 due to loan sales of $4.5 billion and runoff, partially offset by the retention of new originations. Loan sales primarily included $2.7 billion of loans in consolidated agency residential mortgage securitization vehicles and $1.3 billion of nonperforming and other delinquent loans.At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the residential mortgage portfolio included $31.5 billion and $37.1 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans. On this portion of the residential mortgage portfolio, we are protected against principal loss as a result of either FHA insurance or long-term standby agreements that provide for the transfer of credit risk to FNMA and FHLMC. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $26.4 billion and $33.4 billion had FHA insurance with the remainder protected by long-term standby agreements. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $8.8 billion and $11.2 billion of the FHA-insured loan population were repurchases of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA.Table 31 presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, and excluding the PCI loan portfolio, our fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. Additionally, in the "Reported Basis" columns in the table below, accruing balances past due and nonperforming loans do not include the PCI loan portfolio, in accordance with our accounting policies, even though the customer may be contractually past due. As such, the following discussion presents the residential mortgage portfolio excluding the PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, these vintages accounted for $9 million, or 26 percent, and $16 million, or 13 percent of total residential mortgage net charge-offs. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, these vintages accounted for $71 million, or 40 percent, and $118 million, or 32 percent of total residential mortgage net charge-offs.(3) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option. 70Table of ContentsNonperforming residential mortgage loans decreased $1.2 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as outflows, including sales of $951 million, outpaced new inflows. Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at June 30, 2016, $1.2 billion, or 32 percent, were current on contractual payments. Nonperforming loans that are contractually current primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, as well as loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR. In addition, $1.6 billion, or 45 percent of nonperforming residential mortgage loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due decreased $104 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016.Net charge-offs decreased $143 million to $34 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, or 0.10 percent of total average residential mortgage loans, compared to net charge-offs of $177 million, or 0.52 percent, for the same period in 2015. Net charge-offs decreased $249 million to $125 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, or 0.18 percent of total average residential mortgage loans, compared to net charge-offs of $374 million, or 0.55 percent, for the same period in 2015. These decreases in net charge-offs were primarily driven by charge-offs related to the consumer relief portion of the settlement with the DoJ of $145 million and $330 million in the prior-year periods, partially offset by charge-offs of $0 and $42 million related to nonperforming loan sales during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to recoveries of $22 million and $62 million for the same periods in 2015. Excluding these items, net charge-offs declined driven by favorable portfolio trends and decreased write-downs on loans greater than 180 days past due, which were written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell, due in part to improvement in home prices and the U.S. economy.Residential mortgage loans with a greater than 90 percent but less than or equal to 100 percent refreshed LTV represented four percent and five percent of the residential mortgage portfolio at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent represented four percent of the residential mortgage loan portfolio at both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Of the loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent, 98 percent were performing at both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where the outstanding carrying value of the loan is greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. The majority of these loans have a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent primarily due to home price deterioration since 2006, partially offset by subsequent appreciation. Loans to borrowers with refreshed FICO scores below 620 represented five percent and six percent of the residential mortgage portfolio at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Of the $143.4 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at June 30, 2016, as shown in Table 32, 39 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $11.6 billion, or 21 percent, at June 30, 2016. Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally have experienced a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At June 30, 2016, $215 million, or two percent of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $1.5 billion, or one percent for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at June 30, 2016, $581 million, or five percent of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $287 million were contractually current, compared to $3.6 billion, or three percent for the entire residential mortgage portfolio, of which $1.2 billion were contractually current. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three to ten years. More than 75 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2019 or later. 71Table of ContentsTable 32 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 15 percent and 14 percent of outstandings at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, loans within this MSA contributed net charge-offs of $2 million and net recoveries of $1 million within the residential mortgage portfolio compared to net recoveries of $0 and $5 million for the same periods in 2015. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 11 percent of outstandings at both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, loans within this MSA contributed net charge-offs of $5 million and $27 million within the residential mortgage portfolio compared to net charge-offs of $34 million and $73 million for the same periods in 2015.Table 32    Residential Mortgage State Concentrations     Outstandings (1) Nonperforming (1) Net Charge-offs (2) June 30 2016 December 31 2015 June 30 2016 December 31 2015 Three Months EndedJune 30 Six Months EndedJune 30(Dollars in millions)    2016 2015 2016 2015California$52,883 $48,865 $710 $977 $(7) $2 $(30) $(7)New York (3)13,084 12,696 344 399 4 22 18 35Florida (3)9,969 10,001 377 534 2 22 17 46Texas6,328 6,208 150 185 2 4 8 9Massachusetts4,955 4,799 87 118 1 — 4 —Other U.S./Non-U.S.56,138 56,199 1,924 2,590 32 127 108 291Residential mortgage loans (4)$143,357 $138,768 $3,592 $4,803 $34 $177 $125 $374Fully-insured loan portfolio31,479 37,077            Purchased credit-impaired residential mortgage loan portfolio (5)11,107 12,066            Total residential mortgage loan portfolio$185,943 $187,911            (1) Outstandings and nonperforming loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option.(2) Net charge-offs exclude $37 million and $76 million of write-offs in the residential mortgage PCI loan portfolio for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $264 million and $452 million for the same periods in 2015. For more information on PCI write-offs, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 76.(3) In these states, foreclosure requires a court order following a legal proceeding (judicial states).(4) Amounts exclude the PCI residential mortgage and fully-insured loan portfolios.(5) At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, 48 percent and 47 percent of PCI residential mortgage loans were in California. There were no other significant single state concentrations.The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) encourages banks to meet the credit needs of their communities for housing and other purposes, particularly in neighborhoods with low or moderate incomes. Our CRA portfolio was $7.8 billion and $8.0 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, or six percent of the residential mortgage portfolio. The CRA portfolio included $403 million and $552 million of nonperforming loans at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, representing 11 percent of total nonperforming residential mortgage loans. Net charge-offs in the CRA portfolio were $21 million and $71 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, or 17 percent and 19 percent of total net charge-offs for the residential mortgage portfolio.Home EquityAt June 30, 2016, the home equity portfolio made up 16 percent of the consumer portfolio and is comprised of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages.At June 30, 2016, our HELOC portfolio had an outstanding balance of $62.5 billion, or 87 percent of the total home equity portfolio compared to $66.1 billion, or 87 percent, at December 31, 2015. HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years and the borrowers typically are only required to pay the interest due on the loans on a monthly basis. After the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15-year amortizing loans.  72Table of ContentsAt June 30, 2016, our home equity loan portfolio had an outstanding balance of $7.1 billion, or 10 percent of the total home equity portfolio compared to $7.9 billion, or 10 percent, at December 31, 2015. Home equity loans are almost all fixed-rate loans with amortizing payment terms of 10 to 30 years and of the $7.1 billion at June 30, 2016, 55 percent have 25- to 30-year terms. At both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our reverse mortgage portfolio had an outstanding balance, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, of $2.0 billion, or three percent of the total home equity portfolio. We no longer originate reverse mortgages.At June 30, 2016, approximately 66 percent of the home equity portfolio was included in Consumer Banking, 27 percent was included in All Other and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM. Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, decreased $4.4 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2016 primarily due to paydowns and charge-offs outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. Of the total home equity portfolio at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $20.2 billion and $20.3 billion, or 28 percent and 27 percent, were in first-lien positions (30 percent and 28 percent excluding the PCI home equity portfolio). At June 30, 2016, outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $11.9 billion, or 18 percent of our total home equity portfolio excluding the PCI loan portfolio.Unused HELOCs totaled $48.8 billion at June 30, 2016 compared to $50.3 billion at December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to customers choosing to close accounts, as well as accounts reaching the end of their draw period, which automatically eliminates open line exposure. Both of these more than offset customer paydowns of principal balances and the impact of new production. The HELOC utilization rate was 56 percent at June 30, 2016 compared to 57 percent at December 31, 2015.Table 33 presents certain home equity portfolio key credit statistics on both a reported basis excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, and excluding the PCI loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. Additionally, in the "Reported Basis" columns in the table below, accruing balances past due 30 days or more and nonperforming loans do not include the PCI loan portfolio, in accordance with our accounting policies, even though the customer may be contractually past due. As such, the following discussion presents the home equity portfolio excluding the PCI loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. For more information on the PCI loan portfolio, see page 76.Table 33Home Equity – Key Credit Statistics         Reported Basis (1) Excluding Purchased Credit-impaired Loans(Dollars in millions)        June 30 2016 December 31 2015 June 30 2016 December 31 2015Outstandings        $71,587 $75,948 $67,466 $71,329Accruing past due 30 days or more (2)     555 613 555 613Nonperforming loans (2)     3,085 3,337 3,085 3,337Percent of portfolio               Refreshed CLTV greater than 90 but less than or equal to 100 6% 6% 5% 6%Refreshed CLTV greater than 100   11 12 10 11Refreshed FICO score below 620     7 7 6 72006 and 2007 vintages (3)     40 43 38 41                 Reported Basis  Excluding Purchased Credit-impaired Loans Three Months EndedJune 30 Six Months EndedJune 30 Three Months EndedJune 30 Six Months EndedJune 30 2016 2015 2016 2015 2016 2015 2016 2015Net charge-off ratio (4)0.70% 0.73% 0.65% 0.78% 0.74% 0.78% 0.69% 0.83%(1)Outstandings, accruing past due, nonperforming loans and percentages of the portfolio exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option.(2) Accruing past due 30 days or more includes $75 million and $89 million and nonperforming loans include $345 million and $396 million of loans where we serviced the underlying first-lien at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.(3) These vintages of loans have higher refreshed combined LTV ratios and accounted for 46 percent and 45 percent of nonperforming home equity loans at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and 44 percent and 42 percent of net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 57 percent and 58 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015.(4) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option. 73Table of ContentsNonperforming outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $252 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as outflows, including sales of $143 million, outpaced new inflows. Of the nonperforming home equity portfolio at June 30, 2016, $1.5 billion, or 49 percent, were current on contractual payments. Nonperforming loans that are contractually current primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, junior-lien loans where the underlying first-lien is 90 days or more past due, as well as loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR. In addition, $1.1 billion, or 34 percent of nonperforming home equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due decreased $58 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016.In some cases, the junior-lien home equity outstanding balance that we hold is performing, but the underlying first-lien is not. For outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio on which we service the first-lien loan, we are able to track whether the first-lien loan is in default. For loans where the first-lien is serviced by a third party, we utilize credit bureau data to estimate the delinquency status of the first-lien. Given that the credit bureau database we use does not include a property address for the mortgages, we are unable to identify with certainty whether a reported delinquent first-lien mortgage pertains to the same property for which we hold a junior-lien loan. For certain loans, we utilize a third-party vendor to combine credit bureau and public record data to better link a junior-lien loan with the underlying first-lien mortgage. At June 30, 2016, we estimate that $1.1 billion of current and $139 million of 30 to 89 days past due junior-lien loans were behind a delinquent first-lien loan. We service the first-lien loans on $181 million of these combined amounts, with the remaining $1.0 billion serviced by third parties. Of the $1.2 billion of current to 89 days past due junior-lien loans, based on available credit bureau data and our own internal servicing data, we estimate that approximately $449 million had first-lien loans that were 90 days or more past due.Net charge-offs decreased $25 million to $126 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, or 0.74 percent of the total average home equity portfolio, compared to $151 million, or 0.78 percent for the same period in 2015. Net charge-offs decreased $85 million to $238 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, or 0.69 percent of the total average home equity portfolio, compared to $323 million, or 0.83 percent for the same period in 2015. These decreases in net charge-offs were primarily driven by charge-offs of $21 million and $66 million related to the consumer relief portion of the settlement with the DoJ in the prior-year period, and favorable portfolio trends due in part to improvement in home prices and the U.S. economy.Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio with greater than 90 percent but less than or equal to 100 percent refreshed combined loan-to-value (CLTV) comprised five percent and six percent of the home equity portfolio at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Outstanding balances with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent comprised 10 percent and 11 percent of the home equity portfolio at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where our loan and available line of credit combined with any outstanding senior liens against the property are equal to or greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. Depending on the value of the property, there may be collateral in excess of the first-lien that is available to reduce the severity of loss on the second-lien. Of those outstanding balances with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent, 96 percent of the customers were current on their home equity loan and 92 percent of second-lien loans with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent were current on both their second-lien and underlying first-lien loans at June 30, 2016. Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio to borrowers with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented six percent and seven percent of the home equity portfolio at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Of the $67.5 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at June 30, 2016, as shown in Table 34, 61 percent require interest-only payments, almost all of which were HELOCs that had not yet entered the amortization period. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that have entered the amortization period was $12.4 billion, or 20 percent of total HELOCs at June 30, 2016. The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At June 30, 2016, $250 million, or two percent of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $511 million, or one percent for the entire HELOC portfolio. In addition, at June 30, 2016, $1.6 billion, or 13 percent of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $767 million were contractually current, compared to $2.8 billion, or five percent for the entire HELOC portfolio, of which $1.3 billion were contractually current. Loans in our HELOC portfolio generally have an initial draw period of 10 years and 40 percent of these loans will enter the amortization period in the remainder of 2016 and 2017 and will be required to make fully-amortizing payments. We communicate to contractually current customers more than a year prior to the end of their draw period to inform them of the potential change to the payment structure before entering the amortization period, and provide payment options to customers prior to the end of the draw period.Although we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and that is still in its revolving period (i.e., customers may draw on and repay their line of credit, but are generally only required to pay interest on a monthly basis). During the three months ended June 30, 2016, approximately 47 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs. 74Table of ContentsTable 34 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, loans within this MSA contributed 18 percent and 16 percent of net charge-offs within the home equity portfolio compared to 12 percent of net charge-offs for the same periods in 2015. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 11 percent and 12 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, loans within this MSA contributed zero percent and one percent of net charge-offs within the home equity portfolio compared to three percent and four percent of net charge-offs for the same periods in 2015.Table 34    Home Equity State Concentrations     Outstandings (1) Nonperforming (1) Net Charge-offs (2) June 30 2016 December 31 2015 June 30 2016 December 31 2015 Three Months EndedJune 30 Six Months EndedJune 30(Dollars in millions)    2016 2015 2016 2015California$19,134 $20,356 $877 $902 $(1) $13 $9 $37Florida (3)7,884 8,474 470 518 24 32 41 62New Jersey (3)5,392 5,570 206 230 14 12 25 25New York (3)4,995 5,249 284 316 16 13 26 25Massachusetts3,277 3,378 104 115 5 4 8 9Other U.S./Non-U.S.26,784 28,302 1,144 1,256 68 77 129 165Home equity loans (4)$67,466 $71,329 $3,085 $3,337 $126 $151 $238 $323Purchased credit-impaired home equity portfolio (5)4,121 4,619            Total home equity loan portfolio$71,587 $75,948            (1)Outstandings and nonperforming loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option.(2) Net charge-offs exclude $45 million and $111 million of write-offs in the home equity PCI loan portfolio for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $26 million and $126 million for the same periods in 2015. For more information on PCI write-offs, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 76.(3) In these states, foreclosure requires a court order following a legal proceeding (judicial states).(4) Amount excludes the PCI home equity portfolio.(5) At both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, 29 percent of PCI home equity loans were in California. There were no other significant single state concentrations. 75Table of ContentsPurchased Credit-impaired Loan PortfolioLoans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination and for which it is probable at purchase that we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments are accounted for under the accounting guidance for PCI loans, which addresses accounting for differences between contractual and expected cash flows to be collected from the purchaser's initial investment in loans if those differences are attributable, at least in part, to credit quality. For more information on PCI loans, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Table 35 presents the unpaid principal balance, carrying value, related valuation allowance and the net carrying value as a percentage of the unpaid principal balance for the PCI loan portfolio.Table 35Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio June 30, 2016(Dollars in millions)UnpaidPrincipalBalance Gross CarryingValue RelatedValuationAllowance CarryingValue Net ofValuationAllowance Percent of UnpaidPrincipalBalanceResidential mortgage$11,342 $11,107 $223 $10,884 95.96%Home equity4,192 4,121 305 3,816 91.03Total purchased credit-impaired loan portfolio$15,534 $15,228 $528 $14,700 94.63           December 31, 2015Residential mortgage$12,350 $12,066 $338 $11,728 94.96%Home equity4,650 4,619 466 4,153 89.31Total purchased credit-impaired loan portfolio$17,000 $16,685 $804 $15,881 93.42The total PCI unpaid principal balance decreased $1.5 billion, or nine percent, during the six months ended June 30, 2016 primarily driven by payoffs, sales, paydowns and write-offs. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we sold PCI loans with a carrying value of $324 million compared to sales of $987 million for the same period in 2015.Of the unpaid principal balance of $15.5 billion at June 30, 2016, $13.7 billion, or 88 percent, was current based on the contractual terms, $1.0 billion, or six percent, was in early stage delinquency, and $662 million was 180 days or more past due, including $573 million of first-lien mortgages and $89 million of home equity loans.During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded a provision benefit of $12 million for the PCI loan portfolio which included an expense of $9 million for home equity and a benefit of $21 million for residential mortgage. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded a provision benefit of $89 million for the PCI loan portfolio which included a benefit of $50 million for home equity and $39 million for residential mortgage. This compared to a total provision expense of $78 million and $28 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. The provision benefit for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was primarily driven by lower default estimates on second-lien loans and continued home price improvement. The PCI valuation allowance declined $276 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016 due to write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio of $76 million in residential mortgage and $111 million in home equity, combined with a provision benefit of $89 million.Purchased Credit-impaired Residential Mortgage Loan PortfolioThe PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio represented 73 percent of the total PCI loan portfolio at June 30, 2016. Those loans to borrowers with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 29 percent of the PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio at June 30, 2016. Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 90 percent, after consideration of purchase accounting adjustments and the related valuation allowance, represented 27 percent of the PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio and 31 percent based on the unpaid principal balance at June 30, 2016.    Pay option adjustable-rate mortgages, which are included in the PCI residential mortgage portfolio, have interest rates that adjust monthly and minimum required payments that adjust annually. During an initial five- or ten-year period, minimum required payments may increase by no more than 7.5 percent. If payments are insufficient to pay all of the monthly interest charges, unpaid interest is added to the loan balance (i.e., negative amortization) until the loan balance increases to a specified limit at which time a new monthly payment amount adequate to repay the loan over its remaining contractual life is established. 76Table of ContentsAt June 30, 2016, the unpaid principal balance and carrying value of pay option loans was $2.1 billion, including $1.8 billion of loans that were credit-impaired upon acquisition. The total unpaid principal balance of pay option loans with accumulated negative amortization was $394 million, including $21 million of negative amortization. We believe the majority of borrowers that are now making scheduled payments are able to do so primarily because the low rate environment has caused the fully indexed rates to be affordable to more borrowers. We continue to evaluate our exposure to payment resets on the acquired negative-amortizing loans and have taken into consideration several assumptions including prepayment and default rates. Of the loans in the pay option portfolio at June 30, 2016, $185 million have not experienced a payment reset, of which 23 percent are 90 days or more past due. Purchased Credit-impaired Home Equity Loan PortfolioThe PCI home equity portfolio represented 27 percent of the total PCI loan portfolio at June 30, 2016. Those loans with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 15 percent of the PCI home equity portfolio at June 30, 2016. Loans with a refreshed CLTV greater than 90 percent, after consideration of purchase accounting adjustments and the related valuation allowance, represented 56 percent of the PCI home equity portfolio and 59 percent based on the unpaid principal balance at June 30, 2016.    U.S. Credit CardAt June 30, 2016, 97 percent of the U.S. credit card portfolio was managed in Consumer Banking with the remainder in GWIM. Outstandings in the U.S. credit card portfolio decreased $1.5 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2016 due to a seasonal decline in retail transaction volume. Net charge-offs decreased $11 million to $573 million and $45 million to $1.2 billion during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 due to improvements in delinquencies and bankruptcies as a result of an improved economic environment and the impact of higher credit quality originations. U.S. credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $187 million while loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $96 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as a result of the factors mentioned above that contributed to lower net charge-offs.Unused lines of credit for U.S. credit card totaled $319.8 billion and $312.5 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The $7.3 billion increase was driven by account growth, lines of credit increases and a seasonal decrease in line utilization due to a decrease in transaction volume.Table 36 presents certain key credit statistics for the U.S. credit card portfolio.Table 36       U.S. Credit Card – Key Credit Statistics(Dollars in millions)    June 30 2016 December 31 2015Outstandings    $88,103 $89,602Accruing past due 30 days or more    1,388 1,575Accruing past due 90 days or more    693 789         Three Months EndedJune 30 Six Months EndedJune 30 2016 2015 2016 2015Net charge-offs$573$584 $1,160 $1,205Net charge-off ratios (1)2.66%2.68% 2.68% 2.76%(1)Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans. 77Table of ContentsTable 37 presents certain state concentrations for the U.S. credit card portfolio.Table 37    U.S. Credit Card State Concentrations     Outstandings Accruing Past Due90 Days or More Net Charge-offs June 30 2016 December 31 2015 June 30 2016 December 31 2015 Three Months EndedJune 30 Six Months EndedJune 30(Dollars in millions)    2016 2015 2016 2015California$13,547 $13,658 $104 $115 $91 $89 $183 $183Florida7,330 7,420 72 81 60 61 124 128Texas6,608 6,620 53 58 41 39 82 80New York5,425 5,547 51 57 41 41 81 83Washington3,915 3,907 17 19 15 16 29 31Other U.S.51,278 52,450 396 459 325 338 661 700Total U.S. credit card portfolio$88,103 $89,602 $693 $789 $573 $584 $1,160 $1,205Non-U.S. Credit CardOutstandings in the non-U.S. credit card portfolio, which are recorded in All Other, decreased $595 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016 driven by weakening of the British Pound against the U.S. Dollar. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, net charge-offs decreased $5 million to $46 million and $4 million to $91 million compared to the same periods in 2015.Unused lines of credit for non-U.S. credit card totaled $26.2 billion and $27.9 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The $1.7 billion decrease was driven by weakening of the British Pound against the U.S. Dollar, partially offset by account growth and lines of credit increases.Table 38 presents certain key credit statistics for the non-U.S. credit card portfolio.Table 38       Non-U.S. Credit Card – Key Credit Statistics(Dollars in millions)    June 30 2016 December 31 2015Outstandings    $9,380 $9,975Accruing past due 30 days or more    129 146Accruing past due 90 days or more    69 76         Three Months EndedJune 30 Six Months EndedJune 30 2016 2015 2016 2015Net charge-offs$46$51 $91 $95Net charge-off ratios (1)1.85%2.03% 1.85% 1.91%(1)Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans.Direct/Indirect ConsumerAt June 30, 2016, approximately 51 percent of the direct/indirect portfolio was included in Consumer Banking (consumer auto and specialty lending – automotive, marine, aircraft, recreational vehicle loans, and consumer personal loans), 48 percent was included in GWIM (principally securities-based lending loans) and the remainder was primarily student loans in All Other.Outstandings in the direct/indirect portfolio increased $4.0 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2016 primarily in the consumer auto loan portfolio, partially offset by lower outstandings in the securities-based lending and the unsecured consumer lending portfolios.For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, net charge-offs decreased $1 million to $23 million, and $1 million to $57 million, or 0.10 percent and 0.13 percent of total average direct/indirect loans, compared to 0.11 percent and 0.14 percent for the same periods in 2015. 78Table of ContentsDirect/indirect loans that were past due 30 days or more and still accruing interest declined $40 million to $288 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016 due to decreases in the consumer auto and specialty lending portfolios.Table 39 presents certain state concentrations for the direct/indirect consumer loan portfolio.Table 39    Direct/Indirect State Concentrations     Outstandings Accruing Past Due90 Days or More Net Charge-offs June 30 2016 December 31 2015 June 30 2016 December 31 2015 Three Months EndedJune 30 Six Months EndedJune 30(Dollars in millions)    2016 2015 2016 2015California$11,274 $10,735 $2 $3 $1 $1 $5 $4Texas9,218 8,514 3 4 4 4 8 8Florida9,057 8,835 2 3 6 4 13 8New York5,323 5,077 1 1 — — 1 1Georgia3,059 2,869 4 4 1 1 3 3Other U.S./Non-U.S.54,815 52,765 14 24 11 14 27 34Total direct/indirect loan portfolio$92,746 $88,795 $26 $39 $23 $24 $57 $58Other ConsumerAt June 30, 2016, approximately 69 percent of the $2.3 billion other consumer portfolio was consumer auto leases included in Consumer Banking. The remainder is primarily associated with certain consumer finance businesses that we previously exited.Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties ActivityTable 40 presents nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. Nonperforming LHFS are excluded from nonperforming loans as they are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. Nonperforming loans do not include past due consumer credit card loans, other unsecured loans and in general, consumer non-real estate-secured loans (loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy are included) as these loans are typically charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. The charge-offs on these loans have no impact on nonperforming activity and, accordingly, are excluded from this table. The fully-insured loan portfolio is not reported as nonperforming as principal repayment is insured. Additionally, nonperforming loans do not include the PCI loan portfolio or loans accounted for under the fair value option. For more information on nonperforming loans, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, nonperforming consumer loans declined $1.5 billion to $6.7 billion primarily driven by loan sales of $1.1 billion. Excluding these sales, nonperforming loans declined as outflows outpaced new inflows.The outstanding balance of a real estate-secured loan that is in excess of the estimated property value less costs to sell is charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due unless repayment of the loan is fully insured. At June 30, 2016, $3.1 billion, or 44 percent of nonperforming consumer real estate loans and foreclosed properties had been written down to their estimated property value less costs to sell, including $2.7 billion of nonperforming loans 180 days or more past due and $416 million of foreclosed properties. In addition, at June 30, 2016, $2.7 billion, or 38 percent of nonperforming consumer loans were modified and are now current after successful trial periods, or are current loans classified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable policies.Foreclosed properties decreased $28 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as liquidations outpaced additions. PCI loans are excluded from nonperforming loans as these loans were written down to fair value at the acquisition date; however, once the underlying real estate is acquired by the Corporation upon foreclosure of the delinquent PCI loan, it is included in foreclosed properties. PCI-related foreclosed properties decreased $67 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016. Not included in foreclosed properties at June 30, 2016 was $1.3 billion of real estate that was acquired upon foreclosure of certain delinquent government-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans). We exclude these amounts from our nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties activity as we expect we will be reimbursed once the property is conveyed to the guarantor for principal and, up to certain limits, costs incurred during the foreclosure process and interest incurred during the holding period. 79Table of ContentsNonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. These concessions typically result from the Corporation's loss mitigation activities and could include reductions in the interest rate, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions. Certain TDRs are classified as nonperforming at the time of restructuring and may only be returned to performing status after considering the borrower's sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period, generally six months. Nonperforming TDRs, excluding those modified loans in the PCI loan portfolio, are included in Table 40.Table 40    Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity (1)     Three Months EndedJune 30 Six Months EndedJune 30(Dollars in millions)2016 2015 2016 2015Nonperforming loans and leases, beginning of period$7,247 $10,209 $8,165 $10,819Additions to nonperforming loans and leases:       New nonperforming loans and leases799 1,424 1,750 2,893Reductions to nonperforming loans and leases:       Paydowns and payoffs(252) (289) (385) (542)Sales(271) (542) (1,094) (913)Returns to performing status (2)(396) (631) (837) (1,498)Charge-offs(334) (484) (729) (944)Transfers to foreclosed properties (3)(88) (112) (165) (240)Total net reductions to nonperforming loans and leases(542) (634) (1,460) (1,244)Total nonperforming loans and leases, June 30 (4)6,705 9,575 6,705 9,575Foreclosed properties, beginning of period421 632 444 630Additions to foreclosed properties:       New foreclosed properties (3)130 157 240 353Reductions to foreclosed properties:       Sales(117) (202) (236) (370)Write-downs(18) (34) (32) (60)Total net reductions to foreclosed properties(5) (79) (28) (77)Total foreclosed properties, June 30 (5)416 553 416 553Nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties, June 30$7,121 $10,128 $7,121 $10,128Nonperforming consumer loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans and leases (6)1.49% 2.06%    Nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties (6)1.58 2.17    (1)Balances do not include nonperforming LHFS of $20 million and $8 million and nonaccruing TDRs removed from the PCI loan portfolio prior to January 1, 2010 of $38 million and $72 million at June 30, 2016 and 2015 as well as loans accruing past due 90 days or more as presented in Table 28 and Note 4 – Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(2) Consumer loans may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection.(3) New foreclosed properties represents transfers of nonperforming loans to foreclosed properties net of charge-offs taken during the first 90 days after transfer of a loan to foreclosed properties. New foreclosed properties also includes properties obtained upon foreclosure of delinquent PCI loans, properties repurchased due to representations and warranties exposure and properties acquired with newly consolidated subsidiaries.(4) At June 30, 2016, 40 percent of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due.(5) Foreclosed property balances do not include properties insured by certain government-guaranteed loans, principally FHA-insured loans, of $1.3 billion at both June 30, 2016 and 2015.(6) Outstanding consumer loans and leases exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option.Our policy is to record any losses in the value of foreclosed properties as a reduction in the allowance for loan and lease losses during the first 90 days after transfer of a loan to foreclosed properties. Thereafter, further losses in value as well as gains and losses on sale are recorded in noninterest expense. New foreclosed properties included in Table 40 are net of $24 million and $42 million of charge-offs and write-offs of PCI loans for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $44 million and $76 million for the same periods in 2015, recorded during the first 90 days after transfer. 80Table of ContentsWe classify junior-lien home equity loans as nonperforming when the first-lien loan becomes 90 days past due even if the junior-lien loan is performing. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $449 million and $484 million of such junior-lien home equity loans were included in nonperforming loans and leases.Table 41 presents TDRs for the consumer real estate portfolio. Performing TDR balances are excluded from nonperforming loans and leases in Table 40.Table 41Consumer Real Estate Troubled Debt Restructurings June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions)Total Nonperforming Performing Total Nonperforming PerformingResidential mortgage (1, 2)$15,086 $2,361 $12,725 $18,372 $3,284 $15,088Home equity (3)2,756 1,644 1,112 2,686 1,649 1,037Total consumer real estate troubled debt restructurings$17,842 $4,005 $13,837 $21,058 $4,933 $16,125(1)Residential mortgage TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $3.9 billion and $4.9 billion, and included $1.9 billion and $2.7 billion of loans classified as nonperforming and $2.0 billion and $2.2 billion of loans classified as performing at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.(2)Residential mortgage performing TDRs included $6.9 billion and $8.7 billion of loans that were fully-insured at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.(3)Home equity TDRs deemed collateral dependent totaled $1.6 billion and included $1.3 billion of loans classified as nonperforming at both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Loans classified as performing totaled $298 million and $290 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.In addition to modifying consumer real estate loans, we work with customers who are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying credit card and other consumer loans. Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the customer's interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months, all of which are considered TDRs (the renegotiated TDR portfolio). In addition, the accounts of non-U.S. credit card customers who do not qualify for a fixed payment plan may have their interest rates reduced, as required by certain local jurisdictions. These modifications, which are also TDRs, tend to experience higher payment default rates given that the borrowers may lack the ability to repay even with the interest rate reduction. In all cases, the customer's available line of credit is canceled.Modifications of credit card and other consumer loans are primarily made through internal renegotiation programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external renegotiation programs. The renegotiated TDR portfolio is excluded in large part from Table 40 as substantially all of the loans remain on accrual status until either charged off or paid in full. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our renegotiated TDR portfolio was $672 million and $779 million, of which $555 million and $635 million were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. The decline in the renegotiated TDR portfolio was primarily driven by paydowns and charge-offs as well as lower program enrollments. For more information on the renegotiated TDR portfolio, see Note 4 – Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk ManagementCommercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure do not result in undesirable levels of risk. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 46, 51 and 56 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our industry concentrations, including our utilized exposure to the energy sector which was four percent of total commercial utilized exposure at both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Industry Concentrations on page 89 and Table 51. For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and net charge-offs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 81Table of ContentsCommercial Credit PortfolioDuring the six months ended June 30, 2016, other than in the energy sector, credit quality among large corporate borrowers was strong. While we experienced some deterioration in the energy sector in the three months ended March 31, 2016, oil prices stabilized during the three months ended June 30, 2016 which contributed to a modest improvement in energy-related exposure. Credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers continued to be strong with market rents continuing to rise and vacancy rates remaining low.Outstanding commercial loans and leases increased $10.5 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2016, primarily in U.S. commercial. Nonperforming commercial loans and leases increased $499 million during the six months ended June 30, 2016. Nonperforming commercial loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding loans and leases, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, increased during the six months ended June 30, 2016 to 0.37 percent from 0.28 percent at December 31, 2015. Reservable criticized balances increased $2.2 billion to $18.1 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2016 as a result of downgrades outpacing paydowns and upgrades. The increase in nonperforming loans and reservable criticized balances was primarily due to our energy exposure. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio increased $445 million to $5.3 billion at June 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015. For additional information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 95.Table 42 presents our commercial loans and leases portfolio, and related credit quality information at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Table 42Commercial Loans and Leases Outstandings Nonperforming Accruing Past Due 90Days or More(Dollars in millions)June 30 2016 December 31 2015 June 30 2016 December 31 2015 June 30 2016 December 31 2015U.S. commercial$263,467 $252,771 $1,349 $867 $55 $113Commercial real estate (1)57,612 57,199 84 93 6 3Commercial lease financing21,203 21,352 13 12 29 15Non-U.S. commercial89,048 91,549 144 158 1 1 431,330 422,871 1,590 1,130 91 132U.S. small business commercial (2)13,120 12,876 69 82 61 61Commercial loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option444,450 435,747 1,659 1,212 152 193Loans accounted for under the fair value option (3)6,816 5,067 65 13 — —Total commercial loans and leases$451,266 $440,814 $1,724 $1,225 $152 $193(1) Includes U.S. commercial real estate loans of $54.3 billion and $53.6 billion and non-U.S. commercial real estate loans of $3.3 billion and $3.5 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.(2) Includes card-related products.(3) Commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option include U.S. commercial loans of $2.7 billion and $2.3 billion and non-U.S. commercial loans of $4.1 billion and $2.8 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

The increase in net charge-offs of $162 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to higher energy sector related losses.Table 43        Commercial Net Charge-offs and Related Ratios         Net Charge-offs Net Charge-off Ratios (1) Three Months EndedJune 30 Six Months EndedJune 30 Three Months EndedJune 30 Six Months EndedJune 30(Dollars in millions)2016 2015 2016 2015 2016 2015 2016 2015U.S. commercial$28 $(1) $93 $6 0.04 % — % 0.07 % 0.01%Commercial real estate(2) (4) (8) 1 (0.01) (0.03) (0.03) 0.01Commercial lease financing15 — 13 5 0.30 — 0.13 0.05Non-U.S. commercial45 2 87 — 0.20 0.01 0.19 — 86 (3) 185 12 0.08 — 0.09 0.01U.S. small business commercial50 51 102 113 1.55 1.56 1.59 1.73Total commercial$136 $48 $287 $125 0.12 0.05 0.13 0.06(1) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option.Table 44 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, bankers' acceptances and commercial letters of credit for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions, during a specified time period. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes. Total commercial utilized credit exposure increased $18.1 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2016 primarily driven by growth in loans and leases. The utilization rate for loans and leases, SBLCs and financial guarantees, commercial letters of credit and bankers' acceptances, in the aggregate, was 58 percent and 56 percent at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Table 44Commercial Credit Exposure by Type Commercial Utilized (1) Commercial Unfunded (2, 3, 4) Total Commercial Committed(Dollars in millions)June 30 2016 December 31 2015 June 30 2016 December 31 2015 June 30 2016 December 31 2015Loans and leases (5)$456,877 $446,832 $353,998 $376,478 $810,875 $823,310Derivative assets (6)55,264 49,990 — — 55,264 49,990Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees34,748 33,236 624 690 35,372 33,926Debt securities and other investments22,699 21,709 5,372 4,173 28,071 25,882Loans held-for-sale5,544 5,456 823 1,203 6,367 6,659Commercial letters of credit1,968 1,725 145 390 2,113 2,115Bankers' acceptances262 298 — — 262 298Other334 317 — — 334 317Total$577,696 $559,563 $360,962 $382,934 $938,658 $942,497(1) Total commercial utilized exposure includes loans of $6.8 billion and $5.1 billion and issued letters of credit with a notional amount of $321 million and $290 million accounted for under the fair value option at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.(2) Total commercial unfunded exposure includes loan commitments accounted for under the fair value option with a notional amount of $7.8 billion and $10.6 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.(3) Excludes unused business card lines which are not legally binding.(4) Includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments net of amounts distributed (e.g., syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions of $13.9 billion and $14.3 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

Not reflected in utilized and committed exposure is additional non-cash derivative collateral held of $24.5 billion and $23.3 billion which consists primarily of other marketable securities. 83Table of ContentsTable 45 presents commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure by loan type. Criticized exposure corresponds to the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful asset categories as defined by regulatory authorities. Total commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure increased $2.2 billion, or 14 percent, during the six months ended June 30, 2016 driven by downgrades primarily related to our energy exposure outpacing paydowns and upgrades. Approximately 77 percent and 78 percent of commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure was secured at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Table 45Commercial Utilized Reservable Criticized Exposure June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions)Amount (1) Percent (2) Amount (1) Percent (2)U.S. commercial$12,332 4.21% $9,965 3.56%Commercial real estate444 0.75 513 0.87Commercial lease financing832 3.93 708 3.31Non-U.S. commercial3,727 3.92 3,944 4.04 17,335 3.70 15,130 3.30U.S. small business commercial752 5.73 766 5.95Total commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure$18,087 3.76 $15,896 3.38(1) Total commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure includes loans and leases of $16.6 billion and $14.5 billion and commercial letters of credit of $1.5 billion and $1.4 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.(2) Percentages are calculated as commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure divided by total commercial utilized reservable exposure for each exposure category.U.S. CommercialAt June 30, 2016, 70 percent of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small business, was managed in Global Banking, 17 percent in Global Markets, 10 percent in GWIM (generally business-purpose loans for high net worth clients) and the remainder primarily in Consumer Banking. U.S. commercial loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, increased $10.7 billion, or four percent, during the six months ended June 30, 2016 due to growth across all of the commercial businesses. Energy exposure largely drove increases in reservable criticized balances of $2.4 billion, or 24 percent, and nonperforming loans and leases of $482 million, or 56 percent, during the six months ended June 30, 2016, as well as increases in net charge-offs of $29 million and $87 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015.Commercial Real EstateCommercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans and leases secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 23 percent and 21 percent of the commercial real estate loans and leases portfolio at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms. Outstanding loans increased $413 million, or one percent, during the six months ended June 30, 2016 due to new originations primarily in major metropolitan markets.For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we continued to see low default rates and solid credit quality in both the residential and non-residential portfolios. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio including transfers of deteriorating exposures to management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation.Nonperforming commercial real estate loans and foreclosed properties decreased $5 million, or five percent, and reservable criticized balances decreased $69 million, or 13 percent, during the six months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in reservable criticized balances was primarily due to loan resolutions and strong commercial real estate fundamentals in most sectors. Net recoveries were $2 million and $8 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to net recoveries of $4 million and net charge-offs of $1 million for the same periods in 2015. 84Table of ContentsTable 46 presents outstanding commercial real estate loans by geographic region, based on the geographic location of the collateral, and by property type.Table 46Outstanding Commercial Real Estate Loans(Dollars in millions)June 30 2016 December 31 2015By Geographic Region   California$13,113 $12,063Northeast10,145 10,292Southwest7,546 7,789Southeast6,169 6,066Midwest4,184 3,780Florida3,013 3,330Illinois2,580 2,536Midsouth2,526 2,435Northwest2,118 2,327Non-U.S. 3,321 3,549Other (1)2,897 3,032Total outstanding commercial real estate loans$57,612 $57,199By Property Type   Non-residential   Office$15,823 $15,246Multi-family rental9,199 8,956Shopping centers/retail8,968 8,594Hotels/motels5,353 5,415Industrial/warehouse5,172 5,501Multi-use3,015 3,003Unsecured1,686 2,056Land and land development374 539Other5,859 5,791Total non-residential55,449 55,101Residential2,163 2,098Total outstanding commercial real estate loans$57,612 $57,199(1) Includes unsecured loans to real estate investment trusts and national home builders whose portfolios of properties span multiple geographic regions and properties in the states of Colorado, Utah, Hawaii, Wyoming and Montana. 85Table of ContentsTables 47 and 48 present commercial real estate credit quality data by non-residential and residential property types.

Non-residential nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties decreased $2 million, or two percent, to $92 million at June 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 primarily due to decreases across most property types. The non-residential nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties represented 0.16 percent and 0.17 percent of total non-residential loans and foreclosed properties at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Non-residential utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased $66 million, or 13 percent, to $436 million at June 30, 2016 compared to $502 million at December 31, 2015, which represented 0.77 percent and 0.89 percent of non-residential utilized reservable exposure. For the non-residential portfolio, net recoveries decreased $5 million to $1 million and increased $6 million to $7 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015.At June 30, 2016, total committed residential exposure was $4.2 billion compared to $4.1 billion at December 31, 2015, of which $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion were funded secured loans. Residential nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties and residential utilized reservable criticized exposure remained relatively unchanged for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties and the utilized reservable criticized ratios for the residential portfolio were 0.52 percent and 0.36 percent at June 30, 2016 compared to 0.66 percent and 0.52 percent at December 31, 2015.At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the commercial real estate loan portfolio included $6.9 billion and $7.6 billion of funded construction and land development loans that were originated to fund the construction and/or rehabilitation of commercial properties. Reservable criticized construction and land development loans totaled $116 million and $108 million, and nonperforming construction and land development loans and foreclosed properties totaled $37 million and $44 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. During a property's construction phase, interest income is typically paid from interest reserves that are established at the inception of the loan. As construction is completed and the property is put into service, these interest reserves are depleted and interest payments from operating cash flows begin. We do not recognize interest income on nonperforming loans regardless of the existence of an interest reserve.Non-U.S. CommercialAt June 30, 2016, 79 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking and 21 percent in Global Markets. Outstanding loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, decreased $2.5 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2016 primarily due to increased payoffs. Net charge-offs increased $43 million and $87 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015, primarily due to higher energy sector related losses. For more information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 93.U.S. Small Business CommercialThe U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of small business card loans and small business loans managed in Consumer Banking. Credit card-related products were 47 percent and 45 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Net charge-offs decreased $1 million to $50 million and $11 million to $102 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015, primarily driven by portfolio improvement. Of the U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs, 87 percent and 88 percent were credit card-related products for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to 93 percent and 84 percent for the same periods in 2015. 87Table of ContentsNonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties ActivityTable 49 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, nonperforming commercial loans and leases increased $56 million and $447 million to $1.7 billion primarily due to energy sector related exposure. Approximately 94 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were secured and approximately 68 percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans were carried at approximately 83 percent of their unpaid principal balance before consideration of the allowance for loan and lease losses as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated property value less costs to sell.Table 49       Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity (1, 2) Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months EndedJune 30(Dollars in millions)2016 2015 2016 2015Nonperforming loans and leases, beginning of period$1,603 $996 $1,212 $1,113Additions to nonperforming loans and leases:       New nonperforming loans and leases489 419 1,186 706Advances2 15 11 17Reductions to nonperforming loans and leases:       Paydowns(211) (103) (331) (213)Sales(87) (65) (93) (81)Returns to performing status (3)(29) (27) (76) (51)Charge-offs (106) (56) (248) (107)Transfers to foreclosed properties (4)(2) (7) (2) (212)Total net additions to nonperforming loans and leases56 176 447 59Total nonperforming loans and leases, June 301,659 1,172 1,659 1,172Foreclosed properties, beginning of period10 264 15 67Additions to foreclosed properties:       New foreclosed properties (4)22 7 22 207Reductions to foreclosed properties:       Sales(13) (5) (18) (7)Write-downs— (1) — (2)Total net additions to foreclosed properties9 1 4 198Total foreclosed properties, June 3019 265 19 265Nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties, June 30$1,678 $1,437 $1,678 $1,437Nonperforming commercial loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans and leases (5)0.37% 0.28%    Nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties (5)0.38 0.35    (1) Balances do not include nonperforming LHFS of $203 million and $298 million at June 30, 2016 and 2015.(2) Includes U.S. small business commercial activity.

TDRs are generally classified as performing after a sustained period of demonstrated payment performance.(4) New foreclosed properties represents transfers of nonperforming loans to foreclosed properties net of charge-offs recorded during the first 90 days after transfer of a loan to foreclosed properties.(5) Outstanding commercial loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. 88Table of ContentsTable 50 presents our commercial TDRs by product type and performing status. U.S. small business commercial TDRs are comprised of renegotiated small business card loans and small business loans. The renegotiated small business card loans are not classified as nonperforming as they are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. For more information on TDRs, see Note 4 – Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Table 50Commercial Troubled Debt Restructurings June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions)Total Non-performing Performing Total Non-performing PerformingU.S. commercial$1,980 $827 $1,153 $1,225 $394 $831Commercial real estate110 39 71 118 27 91Commercial lease financing3 3 — — — —Non-U.S. commercial273 59 214 363 136 227 2,366 928 1,438 1,706 557 1,149U.S. small business commercial18 3 15 29 10 19Total commercial troubled debt restructurings$2,384 $931 $1,453 $1,735 $567 $1,168Industry ConcentrationsTable 51 presents commercial committed and utilized credit exposure by industry and the total net credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portions of certain credit exposures. Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial committed credit exposure decreased $3.8 billion, during the six months ended June 30, 2016 to $938.7 billion. Decreases in commercial committed exposure were concentrated in diversified financials, technology hardware and equipment, banking, and energy, partially offset by higher exposure to healthcare equipment and services, and capital goods. Industry limits are used internally to manage industry concentrations and are based on committed exposures and capital usage that are allocated on an industry-by-industry basis. A risk management framework is in place to set and approve industry limits as well as to provide ongoing monitoring. The Management Risk Committee (MRC) oversees industry limit governance.Diversified financials, our largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $122.5 billion, decreased $5.9 billion, or five percent, during the six months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in bridge financing exposure and cancellation of a commitment.Real estate, our second largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $84.5 billion, decreased $3.1 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2016. Real estate construction and land development exposure represented 13 percent and 14 percent of the total real estate industry committed exposure at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. For more information on the commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Commercial Real Estate on page 84.The decline in oil prices has impacted and may continue to impact the financial performance of energy producers as well as energy equipment and service providers within the energy sector. Our energy-related committed exposure decreased $3.3 billion to $40.5 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2016. Within the higher risk sub-sectors of exploration and production and oil field services, total committed exposure declined $2.0 billion to $16.1 billion, or 40 percent of total committed energy exposure, during the six months ended June 30, 2016. Total utilized exposure to these sub-sectors declined approximately $800 million to $7.6 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2016, and represents less than one percent of total loans and leases. Of the total utilized exposure to the higher risk sub-sectors, 57 percent was criticized at June 30, 2016. Energy sector net charge-offs increased $178 million to $181 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and energy sector reservable criticized exposure increased $1.6 billion to $6.2 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2016 due to sustained low oil prices. The energy allowance for credit losses increased to $1.0 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2016 primarily due to increased allowance coverage for the higher risk sub-sectors. 89Table of ContentsOur committed state and municipal exposure of $46.5 billion at June 30, 2016 consisted of $38.6 billion of commercial utilized exposure (including $18.7 billion of funded loans, $7.4 billion of SBLCs and $4.1 billion of derivative assets) and $7.9 billion of unfunded commercial exposure (primarily unfunded loan commitments) and is reported in the government and public education industry in Table 51. While historical default rates have been low, as part of our overall and ongoing risk management processes, we continually monitor these exposures through a rigorous review process.Table 51Commercial Credit Exposure by Industry (1) CommercialUtilized Total CommercialCommitted (2)(Dollars in millions)June 30 2016 December 31 2015 June 30 2016 December 31 2015Diversified financials$78,799 $79,496 $122,504 $128,436Real estate (3)61,539 61,759 84,543 87,650Healthcare equipment and services37,483 35,134 67,494 57,901Retailing39,934 37,675 63,589 63,975Capital goods34,866 30,790 63,171 58,583Government and public education45,956 44,835 55,019 53,133Banking44,002 45,952 50,437 53,825Materials23,373 24,012 44,607 46,013Food, beverage and tobacco20,594 18,316 41,495 43,164Energy21,220 21,257 40,467 43,811Consumer services25,656 24,084 40,132 37,058Commercial services and supplies21,335 19,552 33,818 32,045Utilities12,868 11,396 28,426 27,849Transportation20,117 19,369 27,392 27,371Media13,137 12,833 25,101 24,194Individuals and trusts16,397 17,992 21,638 23,176Technology hardware and equipment7,492 6,337 19,185 24,734Software and services7,990 6,617 18,380 18,362Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology6,389 6,302 16,202 16,472Automobiles and components5,414 4,804 12,447 11,329Telecommunication services5,352 4,717 12,092 10,645Insurance, including monolines5,395 5,095 10,670 10,728Consumer durables and apparel5,635 6,053 10,390 11,165Food and staples retailing4,827 4,351 8,890 9,439Religious and social organizations4,619 4,526 6,373 5,929Other 7,307 6,309 14,196 15,510Total commercial credit exposure by industry$577,696 $559,563 $938,658 $942,497Net credit default protection purchased on total commitments (4)    $(5,396) $(6,677)(1) Includes U.S. small business commercial exposure.(2) Includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments net of amounts distributed (e.g., syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions of $13.9 billion and $14.3 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. (3) Industries are viewed from a variety of perspectives to best isolate the perceived risks. For purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined based on the borrowers' or counterparties' primary business activity using operating cash flows and primary source of repayment as key factors.(4) Represents net notional credit protection purchased. For additional information, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Risk Mitigation on page 91. 90Table of ContentsRisk MitigationWe purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection.At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $5.4 billion and $6.7 billion. We recorded net losses of $125 million and $328 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to net losses of $42 million and $113 million for the same periods in 2015 on these positions. The gains and losses on these instruments were offset by gains and losses on the related exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) results for these exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio information in Table 59. For additional information, see Trading Risk Management on page 101.Tables 52 and 53 present the maturity profiles and the credit exposure debt ratings of the net credit default protection portfolio at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Table 52Net Credit Default Protection by Maturity June 30 2016 December 31 2015Less than or equal to one year52% 39%Greater than one year and less than or equal to five years45 59Greater than five years3 2Total net credit default protection100% 100%Table 53Net Credit Default Protection by Credit Exposure Debt Rating(Dollars in millions)June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015Ratings (1, 2)NetNotional (3) Percent ofTotal NetNotional (3) Percent ofTotalA$(713) 13.2% $(752) 11.3%BBB(2,656) 49.2 (3,030) 45.4BB(1,190) 22.1 (2,090) 31.3B(794) 14.7 (634) 9.5CCC and below(14) 0.3 (139) 2.1NR (4)(29) 0.5 (32) 0.4Total net credit default protection$(5,396) 100.0% $(6,677) 100.0%(1) Ratings are refreshed on a quarterly basis.(2) Ratings of BBB- or higher are considered to meet the definition of investment grade.(3) Represents net credit default protection purchased.(4) NR is comprised of index positions held and any names that have not been rated.In addition to our net notional credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain credit exposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making activities for clients and establishing positions intended to profit from directional or relative value changes. We execute the majority of our credit derivative trades in the OTC market with large, multinational financial institutions, including broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of other investors. Because these transactions are executed in the OTC market, we are subject to settlement risk. We are also subject to credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to perform under the terms of these contracts. In most cases, credit derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit downgrade, depending on the ultimate rating level, or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required by the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades. 91Table of ContentsTable 54 presents the total contract/notional amount of credit derivatives outstanding and includes both purchased and written credit derivatives. The credit risk amounts are measured as net asset exposure by counterparty, taking into consideration all contracts with the counterparty. For more information on our written credit derivatives, see Note 2 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The credit risk amounts discussed above and presented in Table 54 take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements while amounts disclosed in Note 2 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements are shown on a gross basis. Credit risk reflects the potential benefit from offsetting exposure to non-credit derivative products with the same counterparties that may be netted upon the occurrence of certain events, thereby reducing our overall exposure.Table 54Credit Derivatives June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions)Contract/Notional Credit Risk Contract/Notional Credit RiskPurchased credit derivatives:       Credit default swaps$856,588 $3,081 $928,300 $3,677Total return swaps/other37,428 423 26,427 1,596Total purchased credit derivatives$894,016 $3,504 $954,727 $5,273Written credit derivatives:       Credit default swaps$844,003 n/a $924,143 n/aTotal return swaps/other41,506 n/a 39,658 n/aTotal written credit derivatives$885,509 n/a $963,801 n/an/a = not applicableCounterparty Credit Risk Valuation AdjustmentsWe record counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments on certain derivative assets, including our credit default protection purchased, in order to properly reflect the credit risk of the counterparty, as presented in Table 55. We calculate CVA based on a modeled expected exposure that incorporates current market risk factors including changes in market spreads and non-credit related market factors that affect the value of a derivative. The exposure also takes into consideration credit mitigants such as legally enforceable master netting agreements and collateral. For additional information, see Note 2 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We enter into risk management activities to offset market driven exposures. We often hedge the counterparty spread risk in CVA with credit default swaps (CDS). We hedge other market risks in CVA primarily with currency and interest rate swaps. In certain instances, the net-of-hedge amounts in the table below move in the same direction as the gross amount or may move in the opposite direction. This is a consequence of the complex interaction of the risks being hedged resulting in limitations in the ability to perfectly hedge all of the market exposures at all times.Table 55                       Credit Valuation Gains and LossesGains (Losses)Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 2016 2015 2016 2015(Dollars in millions)Gross Hedge Net Gross Hedge Net Gross Hedge Net Gross Hedge NetCredit valuation$(26) $59 $33 $215 $(232) $(17) $(235) $320 $85 $223 $(116) $107 92Table of ContentsNon-U.S. PortfolioOur non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance, rather than through country risk governance.Table 56 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at June 30, 2016. These exposures accounted for 87 percent and 85 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $25.8 billion from December 31, 2015 primarily driven by increases in Germany, Canada, France, and the United Kingdom. On a product basis, the increase was driven by an increase in funded loans and loan equivalents in Germany and the United Kingdom, primarily in the form of central bank placements in preparation of potential liquidity needs following the U.K. Referendum, higher securities in France, Germany, Canada and Netherlands, and higher net counterparty exposure in Canada and Luxembourg. These increases were partially offset by reductions in unfunded commitments in the United Kingdom and Germany.Non-U.S. exposure is presented on an internal risk management basis and includes sovereign and non-sovereign credit exposure, securities and other investments issued by or domiciled in countries other than the U.S. The risk assignments by country can be adjusted for external guarantees and certain collateral types. Exposures that are subject to external guarantees are reported under the country of the guarantor. Exposures with tangible collateral are reflected in the country where the collateral is held. For securities received, other than cross-border resale agreements, outstandings are assigned to the domicile of the issuer of the securities.Funded loans and loan equivalents include loans, leases, and other extensions of credit and funds, including letters of credit and due from placements, which have not been reduced by collateral, hedges or credit default protection. Funded loans and loan equivalents are reported net of charge-offs but prior to any allowance for loan and lease losses. Unfunded commitments are the undrawn portion of legally binding commitments related to loans and loan equivalents.Net counterparty exposure includes the fair value of derivatives, including the counterparty risk associated with CDS, and secured financing transactions. Derivatives exposures are presented net of collateral, which is predominantly cash, pledged under legally enforceable master netting agreements. Secured financing transaction exposures are presented net of eligible cash or securities pledged as collateral.Securities and other investments are carried at fair value and long securities exposures are netted against short exposures with the same underlying issuer to, but not below, zero (i.e., negative issuer exposures are reported as zero). Other investments include our GPI portfolio and strategic investments.Net country exposure represents country exposure less hedges and credit default protection purchased, net of credit default protection sold. We hedge certain of our country exposures with credit default protection primarily in the form of single-name, as well as indexed and tranched CDS. The exposures associated with these hedges represent the amount that would be realized upon the isolated default of an individual issuer in the relevant country assuming a zero recovery rate for that individual issuer, and are calculated based on the CDS notional amount adjusted for any fair value receivable or payable. Changes in the assumption of an isolated default can produce different results in a particular tranche. 93Table of ContentsTable 56Top 20 Non-U.S. Countries Exposure(Dollars in millions)Funded Loans and Loan Equivalents Unfunded Loan Commitments Net Counterparty Exposure Securities/OtherInvestments Country Exposure at June 30 2016 Hedges and Credit Default Protection Net Country Exposure at June 30 2016 Increase (Decrease) from December 31 2015United Kingdom$34,260 $13,922 $9,752 $2,207 $60,141 $(3,831) $56,310 $3,064Germany13,368 5,394 2,256 4,410 25,428 (4,109) 21,319 7,915Canada7,220 6,751 4,024 3,811 21,806 (1,437) 20,369 5,637Brazil9,518 280 1,268 4,385 15,451 (217) 15,234 (416)Japan13,901 599 1,600 750 16,850 (2,073) 14,777 413France3,474 4,699 2,234 7,074 17,481 (3,462) 14,019 5,333China8,483 534 1,486 1,618 12,121 (392) 11,729 1,255India6,467 258 356 3,376 10,457 (257) 10,200 (154)Australia4,771 2,190 1,043 1,472 9,476 (348) 9,128 (417)Netherlands3,018 2,868 729 2,653 9,268 (1,235) 8,033 399Hong Kong5,829 202 936 595 7,562 (9) 7,553 (36)South Korea4,110 729 904 1,728 7,471 (406) 7,065 207Switzerland3,390 3,121 417 603 7,531 (1,179) 6,352 89Mexico3,210 995 231 1,294 5,730 (263) 5,467 413Singapore2,516 285 822 1,717 5,340 (49) 5,291 562Italy2,876 888 800 1,032 5,596 (772) 4,824 (484)United Arab Emirates2,132 231 1,139 49 3,551 (58) 3,493 467Luxembourg433 742 2,613 77 3,865 (392) 3,473 1,319Turkey3,181 86 64 24 3,355 (60) 3,295 155Israel205 2,405 138 88 2,836 — 2,836 86Total top 20 non-U.S. countries exposure$132,362 $47,179 $32,812 $38,963 $251,316 $(20,549) $230,767 $25,807Weakening of commodity prices, signs of slowing growth in China, a recession in Brazil and recent political events in Turkey are driving risk aversion in emerging markets. At June 30, 2016, net exposure to China was $11.7 billion, concentrated in large state-owned companies, subsidiaries of multinational corporations and commercial banks. At June 30, 2016, net exposure to Brazil was $15.2 billion, concentrated in sovereign securities, oil and gas companies and commercial banks. At June 30, 2016, net exposure to Turkey was $3.3 billion, concentrated in commercial banks.The U.K. Referendum has led to political and economic uncertainty that may continue over the next several years. At June 30, 2016, net exposure to the U.K. was $56.3 billion, concentrated in multinational corporations and sovereign clients. For additional information, see Executive Summary – Recent Events on page 5 and Item 1A. Risk Factors on page 215.Certain European countries, including Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal, have experienced varying degrees of financial stress in recent years. While market uncertainty increased in Europe due to the results of the U.K. Referendum to leave the European Union, policymakers continue to address fundamental challenges of competitiveness, growth, deflation and high unemployment. A return of political stress or financial instability in these countries could disrupt financial markets and have a detrimental impact on global economic conditions and sovereign and non-sovereign debt in these countries. At June 30, 2016, net exposure to Italy was $4.8 billion as presented in Table 56. At June 30, 2016, net exposure to Spain, Greece and Portugal was $2.6 billion, $261 million and $10 million, respectively. We expect to continue to support client activities in the region and our exposures may vary over time as we monitor the situation and manage our risk profile. 94Table of ContentsProvision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses increased $196 million to $976 million, and $428 million to $2.0 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. The provision for credit losses was $9 million and $80 million lower than net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses. This compared to a reduction of $288 million and $717 million in the allowance for credit losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. For the remainder of 2016, we currently expect that provision expense should approximate net charge-offs. The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio increased $180 million to $733 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due to a slower pace of improvement. The provision for credit losses remained relatively unchanged at $1.1 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Included in the provision is a benefit of $12 million and $89 million related to the PCI loan portfolio for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to an expense of $78 million and $28 million for the same periods in 2015.The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, increased $16 million to $243 million, and $465 million to $838 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015, with the increase for the six months ended June 30, 2016 primarily driven by an increase in energy sector reserves to increase the allowance coverage for the higher risk sub-sectors. The decline in oil prices has impacted and may continue to impact the financial performance of energy producers as well as energy equipment and service providers within the energy sector with the magnitude of the impact over time depending in part on the level and duration of future oil prices. Allowance for Credit Losses Allowance for Loan and Lease LossesThe allowance for loan and lease losses is comprised of two components. The first component covers nonperforming commercial loans and TDRs. The second component covers loans and leases on which there are incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable, as well as incurred losses that may not be represented in the loss forecast models. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the total of these two components, each of which is described in more detail below. The allowance for loan and lease losses excludes LHFS and loans accounted for under the fair value option as the fair value reflects a credit risk component.The first component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers both nonperforming commercial loans and all TDRs within the consumer and commercial portfolios. These loans are subject to impairment measurement based on the present value of projected future cash flows discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate, or in certain circumstances, impairment may also be based upon the collateral value or the loan's observable market price if available. Impairment measurement for the renegotiated consumer credit card, small business credit card and unsecured consumer TDR portfolios is based on the present value of projected cash flows discounted using the average portfolio contractual interest rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring. For purposes of computing this specific loss component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool using historical experience for the respective product types and risk ratings of the loans.The second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers the remaining consumer and commercial loans and leases that have incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable. The allowance for consumer and certain homogeneous commercial loan and lease products is based on aggregated portfolio evaluations, generally by product type. Loss forecast models are utilized that consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, estimated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends, delinquencies, economic trends and credit scores. Our consumer real estate loss forecast model estimates the portion of loans that will default based on individual loan attributes, the most significant of which are refreshed LTV or CLTV, and borrower credit score as well as vintage and geography, all of which are further broken down into current delinquency status. Additionally, we incorporate the delinquency status of underlying first-lien loans on our junior-lien home equity portfolio in our allowance process. Incorporating refreshed LTV and CLTV into our probability of default allows us to factor the impact of changes in home prices into our allowance for loan and lease losses. These loss forecast models are updated on a quarterly basis to incorporate information reflecting the current economic environment. As of June 30, 2016, the loss forecast process resulted in reductions in the allowance for most major consumer portfolios compared to December 31, 2015. 95Table of ContentsThe allowance for commercial loan and lease losses is established by product type after analyzing historical loss experience, internal risk rating, current economic conditions, industry performance trends, geographic and obligor concentrations within each portfolio and any other pertinent information. The statistical models for commercial loans are generally updated annually and utilize our historical database of actual defaults and other data, including external default data. The loan risk ratings and composition of the commercial portfolios used to calculate the allowance are updated quarterly to incorporate the most recent data reflecting the current economic environment. For risk-rated commercial loans, we estimate the probability of default and the LGD based on our historical experience of defaults and credit losses. Factors considered when assessing the internal risk rating include the value of the underlying collateral, if applicable, the industry in which the obligor operates, the obligor's liquidity and other financial indicators, and other quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the obligor's credit risk. As of June 30, 2016, the allowance increased for the U.S. commercial and non-U.S. commercial portfolios and decreased for the commercial real estate and commercial leasing portfolios compared to December 31, 2015.Also included within the second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses are reserves to cover losses that are incurred but, in our assessment, may not be adequately represented in the historical loss data used in the loss forecast models. For example, factors that we consider include, among others, changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in economic and business conditions, changes in the nature and size of the portfolio, changes in portfolio concentrations, changes in the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements. We also consider factors that are applicable to unique portfolio segments. For example, we consider the risk of uncertainty in our loss forecasting models related to junior-lien home equity loans that are current, but have first-lien loans that we do not service that are 30 days or more past due. In addition, we consider the increased risk of default associated with our interest-only loans that have yet to enter the amortization period. Further, we consider the inherent uncertainty in mathematical models that are built upon historical data.During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the factors that impacted the allowance for loan and lease losses included overall improvements in the credit quality of the portfolios driven by continuing improvements in the U.S. economy and labor markets, continuing proactive credit risk management initiatives and the impact of recent higher credit quality originations. Additionally, the resolution of uncertainties through current recognition of net charge-offs has impacted the amount of reserve needed in certain portfolios. Evidencing the improvements in the U.S. economy and labor markets are modest growth in consumer spending, improvements in unemployment levels, increases in home prices and a decrease in the absolute level and our share of national consumer bankruptcy filings. In addition to these improvements, in the consumer portfolio, loan sales, returns to performing status, paydowns and charge-offs continued to outpace new nonaccrual loans. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, the allowance for loan and lease losses in the commercial portfolio reflected increased coverage for the energy sector due to sustained low oil prices which impacted the financial performance of energy clients and contributed to an increase in reservable criticized balances.We monitor differences between estimated and actual incurred loan and lease losses. This monitoring process includes periodic assessments by senior management of loan and lease portfolios and the models used to estimate incurred losses in those portfolios.Additions to, or reductions of, the allowance for loan and lease losses generally are recorded through charges or credits to the provision for credit losses. Credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses. Recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses. 96Table of ContentsThe allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumer portfolio, as presented in Table 58, was $6.5 billion at June 30, 2016, a decrease of $842 million from December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily in the home equity, residential mortgage and credit card portfolios. Reductions in the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios were due to improved home prices, lower delinquencies and a decrease in consumer loan balances, as well as write-offs in our PCI loan portfolio. The decrease in the allowance related to the U.S. credit card and unsecured consumer lending portfolios in Consumer Banking was primarily due to improvement in delinquencies and more generally in unemployment levels. For example, in the U.S. credit card portfolio, accruing loans 30 days or more past due decreased to $1.4 billion at June 30, 2016 from $1.6 billion (to 1.58 percent from 1.76 percent of outstanding U.S. credit card loans) at December 31, 2015, and accruing loans 90 days or more past due decreased to $693 million at June 30, 2016 from $789 million (to 0.79 percent from 0.88 percent of outstanding U.S. credit card loans) at December 31, 2015. See Tables 28, 29, 36 and 38 for additional details on key credit statistics for the credit card and other unsecured consumer lending portfolios.The allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio, as presented in Table 58, was $5.3 billion at June 30, 2016, an increase of $445 million from December 31, 2015 driven by increased allowance coverage for the higher risk energy sub-sectors as a result of sustained low oil prices. Commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure increased to $18.1 billion at June 30, 2016 from $15.9 billion (to 3.76 percent from 3.38 percent of total commercial utilized reservable exposure) at December 31, 2015, largely due to downgrades in the energy portfolio. Nonperforming commercial loans increased to $1.7 billion at June 30, 2016 from $1.2 billion (to 0.37 percent from 0.28 percent of outstanding commercial loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option) at December 31, 2015 with the increase primarily in the energy sector. Commercial loans and leases outstanding increased to $451.3 billion at June 30, 2016 from $440.8 billion at December 31, 2015. See Tables 42, 43 and 45 for additional details on key commercial credit statistics.The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 1.32 percent at June 30, 2016 compared to 1.37 percent at December 31, 2015. The decrease in the ratio was primarily due to improved credit quality in the consumer portfolios driven by improved economic conditions and write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio. The June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 ratios above include the PCI loan portfolio. Excluding the PCI loan portfolio, the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 1.29 percent and 1.31 percent at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 97Table of ContentsTable 57 presents a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments,

Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option included residential mortgage loans of $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion and home equity loans of $354 million and $250 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option included U.S. commercial loans of $2.7 billion and $2.3 billion and non-U.S. commercial loans of $4.1 billion and $2.8 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.(2) Includes allowance for loan and lease losses for U.S. small business commercial loans of $466 million and $507 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.(3) Includes allowance for loan and lease losses for impaired commercial loans of $238 million and $217 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.(4) Includes $528 million and $804 million of valuation allowance presented with the allowance for loan and lease losses related to PCI loans at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Reserve for Unfunded Lending CommitmentsIn addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers' acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option. Unfunded lending commitments are subject to the same assessment as funded loans, including estimates of probability of default and LGD. Due to the nature of unfunded commitments, the estimate of probable losses must also consider utilization. To estimate the portion of these undrawn commitments that is likely to be drawn by a borrower at the time of estimated default, analyses of the Corporation's historical experience are applied to the unfunded commitments to estimate the funded EAD. The expected loss for unfunded lending commitments is the product of the probability of default, the LGD and the EAD, adjusted for any qualitative factors including economic uncertainty and inherent imprecision in models.The reserve for unfunded lending commitments was $750 million at June 30, 2016, an increase of $104 million from December 31, 2015, with the increase attributable primarily to the reclassification of allowance for loan losses to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the commercial portfolio. 100Table of ContentsMarket Risk ManagementMarket risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities, or otherwise negatively impact earnings. This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations, primarily within our Global Markets segment. We are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities). In the event of market stress, these risks could have a material impact on the results of the Corporation. For additional information, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 106.Our traditional banking loan and deposit products are non-trading positions and are generally reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities (historical cost). However, these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions, with one of the primary risks being changes in the levels of interest rates. The risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our non-trading positions arising from changes in interest rates is managed through our ALM activities. We have elected to account for certain assets and liabilities under the fair value option.Our trading positions are reported at fair value with changes reflected in income. Trading positions are subject to various changes in market-based risk factors. The majority of this risk is generated by our activities in the interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity and commodities markets. In addition, the values of assets and liabilities could change due to market liquidity, correlations across markets and expectations of market volatility. We seek to manage these risk exposures by using a variety of techniques that encompass a broad range of financial instruments. The key risk management techniques are discussed in more detail in the Trading Risk Management section.Global Risk Management is responsible for providing senior management with a clear and comprehensive understanding of the trading risks to which the Corporation is exposed. These responsibilities include ownership of market risk policy, developing and maintaining quantitative risk models, calculating aggregated risk measures, establishing and monitoring position limits consistent with risk appetite, conducting daily reviews and analysis of trading inventory, approving material risk exposures and fulfilling regulatory requirements.Quantitative risk models, such as VaR, are an essential component in evaluating the market risks within a portfolio. A subcommittee of the MRC is responsible for providing management oversight and approval of model risk management and governance (Risk Management, or RM subcommittee). The RM subcommittee defines model risk standards, consistent with the Corporation's risk framework and risk appetite, prevailing regulatory guidance and industry best practice. Models must meet certain validation criteria, including effective challenge of the model development process and a sufficient demonstration of developmental evidence incorporating a comparison of alternative theories and approaches. The RM subcommittee ensures model standards are consistent with model risk requirements and monitors the effective challenge in the model validation process across the Corporation. In addition, the relevant stakeholders must agree on any required actions or restrictions to the models and maintain a stringent monitoring process to ensure continued compliance.For more information on the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, see Note 14 – Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For more information on our market risk management process, see page 92 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Trading Risk ManagementTo evaluate risk in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. Various techniques and procedures are utilized to enable the most complete understanding of these risks. Quantitative measures of market risk are evaluated on a daily basis from a single position to the portfolio of the Corporation. These measures include sensitivities of positions to various market risk factors, such as the potential impact on revenue from a one basis point change in interest rates, and statistical measures utilizing both actual and hypothetical market moves, such as VaR and stress testing. Periods of extreme market stress influence the reliability of these techniques to varying degrees. Qualitative evaluations of market risk utilize the suite of quantitative risk measures while understanding each of their respective limitations. Additionally, risk managers independently evaluate the risk of the portfolios under the current market environment and potential future environments. 101Table of ContentsVaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk as it allows the aggregation of market risk factors, including the effects of portfolio diversification. A VaR model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss a portfolio is not expected to exceed more than a certain number of times per period, based on a specified holding period, confidence level and window of historical data. We use one VaR model consistently across the trading portfolios and it uses a historical simulation approach based on a three-year window of historical data. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level. This means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days.Within any VaR model, there are significant and numerous assumptions that will differ from company to company. The accuracy of a VaR model depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the risk factors in the portfolio. A VaR model may require additional modeling assumptions for new products that do not have the necessary historical market data or for less liquid positions for which accurate daily prices are not consistently available. For positions with insufficient historical data for the VaR calculation, the process for establishing an appropriate proxy is based on fundamental and statistical analysis of the new product or less liquid position. This analysis identifies reasonable alternatives that replicate both the expected volatility and correlation to other market risk factors that the missing data would be expected to experience.VaR may not be indicative of realized revenue volatility as changes in market conditions or in the composition of the portfolio can have a material impact on the results. In particular, the historical data used for the VaR calculation might indicate higher or lower levels of portfolio diversification than will be experienced. In order for the VaR model to reflect current market conditions, we update the historical data underlying our VaR model on a weekly basis, or more frequently during periods of market stress, and regularly review the assumptions underlying the model. A relatively minor portion of risks related to our trading positions is not included in VaR. These risks are reviewed as part of our ICAAP. For more information regarding ICAAP, see Capital Management on page 48. Global Risk Management continually reviews, evaluates and enhances our VaR model so that it reflects the material risks in our trading portfolio. Changes to the VaR model are reviewed and approved prior to implementation and any material changes are reported to management through the appropriate management committees.Trading limits on quantitative risk measures, including VaR, are independently set by Global Markets Risk Management and reviewed on a regular basis to ensure they remain relevant and within our overall risk appetite for market risks. Trading limits are reviewed in the context of market liquidity, volatility and strategic business priorities. Trading limits are set at both a granular level to ensure extensive coverage of risks as well as at aggregated portfolios to account for correlations among risk factors. All trading limits are approved at least annually. Approved trading limits are stored and tracked in a centralized limits management system. Trading limit excesses are communicated to management for review. Certain quantitative market risk measures and corresponding limits have been identified as critical in the Corporation's Risk Appetite Statement. These risk appetite limits are reported on a daily basis and are approved at least annually by the ERC and the Board. In periods of market stress, Global Markets senior leadership communicates daily to discuss losses, key risk positions and any limit excesses. As a result of this process, the businesses may selectively reduce risk.Table 59 presents the total market-based trading portfolio VaR which is the combination of the covered positions trading portfolio and the impact from less liquid trading exposures. Covered positions are defined by regulatory standards as trading assets and liabilities, both on- and off-balance sheet, that meet a defined set of specifications. These specifications identify the most liquid trading positions which are intended to be held for a short-term horizon and where the Corporation is able to hedge the material risk elements in a two-way market. Positions in less liquid markets, or where there are restrictions on the ability to trade the positions, typically do not qualify as covered positions. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, except for structural foreign currency positions that we choose to exclude with prior regulatory approval. In addition, Table 59 presents our fair value option portfolio, which includes the funded and unfunded exposures for which we elect the fair value option and their corresponding hedges. The fair value option portfolio combined with the total market-based trading portfolio VaR represents the Corporation's total market-based portfolio VaR. Additionally, market risk VaR for trading activities as presented in Table 59 differs from VaR used for regulatory capital calculations due to the holding period being used. The holding period for VaR used for regulatory capital calculations is 10 days, while for the market risk VaR presented below, it is one day. Both measures utilize the same process and methodology.The total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 59 include market risk from all business segments to which the Corporation is exposed, excluding CVA and DVA. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment. 102Table of ContentsTable 59 presents period-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for the three months ended June 30, 2016, March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2015, as well as average daily trading VaR for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, using a 99 percent confidence level.Table 59   Market Risk VaR for Trading Activities          Six Months Three Months Ended Ended June 30, 2016 March 31, 2016 June 30, 2015 June 30(Dollars in millions)Period EndAverageHigh (1)Low (1) Period EndAverageHigh (1)Low (1) Period EndAverageHigh (1)Low (1) 2016 Average2015 AverageForeign exchange$7$9$11$7 $10$11$16$7 $11$8$23$6 $10$9Interest rate22202815 18233016 19263816 2228Credit28313427 31313527 31364231 3139Equity21203012 15192713 1313189 2013Commodity8684 5573 4684 66Portfolio diversification(42)(46)—— (44)(50)—— (32)(45)—— (49)(46)Total covered positions trading portfolio44404930 35395029 46446535 4049Impact from less liquid exposures46—— 53—— 911—— 410Total market-based trading portfolio48465835 40425834 55557447 4459Fair value option loans21252921 28354028 19212817 3026Fair value option hedges11121510 15182214 109148 1513Fair value option portfolio diversification(20)(23)—— (31)(38)—— (17)(18)—— (30)(25)Total fair value option portfolio12141712 12152011 12121610 1514Portfolio diversification(3)(6)—— (4)(7)—— (5)(6)—— (7)(7)Total market-based portfolio$57$54$70$44 $48$50$69$40 $62$61$80$52 $52$66(1) The high and low for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the high and low for the components. Therefore the impact from less liquid exposures and the amount of portfolio diversification, which is the difference between the total portfolio and the sum of the individual components, are not relevant.The average total market-based trading portfolio VaR decreased for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to reduced exposure to the credit and interest rate markets. The graph below presents the daily total market-based trading portfolio VaR for the previous five quarters, corresponding to the data in Table 59. 103Table of ContentsAdditional VaR statistics produced within the Corporation's single VaR model are provided in Table 60 at the same level of detail as in Table 59. Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution. Table 60 presents average trading VaR statistics for 99 percent and 95 percent confidence levels for the three months ended June 30, 2016, March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2015.Table 60Average Market Risk VaR for Trading Activities – 99 Percent and 95 Percent VaR Statistics Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 March 31, 2016 June 30, 2015(Dollars in millions)99 percent95 percent 99 percent95 percent 99 percent95 percentForeign exchange$9$5 $11$6 $8$5Interest rate2012 2314 2615Credit3119 3118 3620Equity2013 1912 137Commodity63 52 63Portfolio diversification(46)(31) (50)(31) (45)(31)Total covered positions trading portfolio4021 3921 4419Impact from less liquid exposures63 32 114Total market-based trading portfolio4624 4223 5523Fair value option loans2514 3519 2112Fair value option hedges128 1811 96Fair value option portfolio diversification(23)(14) (38)(21) (18)(11)Total fair value option portfolio148 159 127Portfolio diversification(6)(5) (7)(5) (6)(5)Total market-based portfolio$54$27 $50$27 $61$25BacktestingThe accuracy of the VaR methodology is evaluated by backtesting, which compares the daily VaR results, utilizing a one-day holding period, against a comparable subset of trading revenue. A backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss exceeds the VaR for the corresponding day. These excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss and to ensure that the VaR methodology accurately represents those losses. As our primary VaR statistic used for backtesting is based on a 99 percent confidence level and a one-day holding period, we expect one trading loss in excess of VaR every 100 days, or between two to three trading losses in excess of VaR over the course of a year. The number of backtesting excesses observed can differ from the statistically expected number of excesses if the current level of market volatility is materially different than the level of market volatility that existed during the three years of historical data used in the VaR calculation.The trading revenue used for backtesting is defined by regulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the VaR component of the regulatory capital calculation. This revenue differs from total trading-related revenue in that it excludes revenue from trading activities that either do not generate market risk or the market risk cannot be included in VaR. Some examples of the types of revenue excluded for backtesting are fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intraday trading revenues.We conduct daily backtesting on our portfolios, ranging from the total market-based portfolio to individual trading areas. Additionally, we conduct daily backtesting on the VaR results used for regulatory capital calculations as well as the VaR results for key legal entities, regions and risk factors. These results are reported to senior market risk management. Senior management regularly reviews and evaluates the results of these tests.During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, there were no days in which there was a backtesting excess for our total market-based portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period. The backtesting results for our total market-based portfolio VaR differ from the backtesting results used for regulatory capital calculations. 104Table of ContentsTotal Trading-related RevenueTotal trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and FVA gains (losses), represent the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. Trading account assets and liabilities are reported at fair value. For more information on fair value, see Note 14 – Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Trading-related revenue can be volatile and is largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Also, trading-related revenue is dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. Significant daily revenue by business is monitored and the primary drivers of these are reviewed.The histogram below is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 95 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. This compares to the three months ended March 31, 2016, where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 98 percent of the trading days, of which 75 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million and the largest loss was $14 million.Trading Portfolio Stress TestingBecause the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements.A set of scenarios, categorized as either historical or hypothetical, are computed daily for the overall trading portfolio and individual businesses. These scenarios include shocks to underlying market risk factors that may be well beyond the shocks found in the historical data used to calculate VaR. Historical scenarios simulate the impact of the market moves that occurred during a period of extended historical market stress. Generally, a multi-week period representing the most severe point during a crisis is selected for each historical scenario. Hypothetical scenarios provide simulations of the estimated portfolio impact from potential future market stress events. Scenarios are reviewed and updated in response to changing positions and new economic or political information. In addition, new or ad hoc scenarios are developed to address specific potential market events or particular vulnerabilities in the portfolio. The stress tests are reviewed on a regular basis and the results are presented to senior management.Stress testing for the trading portfolio is integrated with enterprise-wide stress testing and incorporated into the limits framework. The macroeconomic scenarios used for enterprise-wide stress testing purposes differ from the typical trading portfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and the results are forecasted over multiple periods for use in consolidated capital and liquidity planning. For additional information, see Managing Risk on page 47. 105Table of ContentsInterest Rate Risk Management for the Banking BookThe following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities.Interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our banking book balance sheet. Our banking book balance sheet includes all on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments of the Corporation except for those positions that are held for trading purposes. Interest rate risk in our banking book is measured as the potential change in net interest income caused by movements in market interest rates and excludes positions held for trading purposes. Client-facing activities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet.We prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income. The baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future business growth, ALM positioning and the direction of interest rate movements as implied by the market-based forward curve. We then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The net interest income forecast is frequently updated for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends, market conditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually monitor our balance sheet position in order to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes.The interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate balance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing and maturity characteristics. Our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital.Table 61 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Table 61Forward Rates June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015 Federal Funds Three-monthLIBOR 10-Year Swap Federal Funds Three-monthLIBOR 10-Year SwapSpot rates0.50% 0.65% 1.36% 0.50% 0.61% 2.19%12-month forward rates0.50 0.72 1.52 1.00 1.22 2.39 106Table of ContentsTable 62 shows the pretax dollar impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented to ensure that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. In the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet increased, primarily driven by lower long-end rates and an increase in projected deposit growth. We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel move in interest rates with the majority of that benefit coming from the long end of the yield curve, including the impact of market-related adjustments for bond premium amortization which results from the Corporation's application of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 310-20-35-26, "Estimating Principal Prepayments" (formerly known as FAS 91). Additionally, higher interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as AFS, may adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital is reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income. For more information on the transition provisions of Basel 3, see Capital Management – Regulatory Capital on page 48.Table 62       Estimated Banking Book Net Interest Income Sensitivity(Dollars in millions)Curve ChangeShort Rate (bps) Long Rate (bps) June 30 2016 December 31 2015Parallel shifts        +100 bps instantaneous shift (1)+100 +100 $7,461 $4,306 -50 bps instantaneous shift (1)-50 -50 (5,076) (3,903)Flatteners       Short-end instantaneous change+100 — 3,118 2,417Long-end instantaneous change (1)— -50 (2,045) (2,212)Steepeners       Short-end instantaneous change -50 — (3,016) (1,671)Long-end instantaneous change (1)— +100 4,454 1,919(1) As of June 30, 2016, market-related adjustments for bond premium amortization from the application of ASC 310-20-35-26 with respect to a +100 bps instantaneous change or shift in long-end interest rates were approximately $2.5 billion, and with respect to a -50 bps instantaneous change or shift in long-end interest rates, approximately $(1.0) billion.The sensitivity analysis in Table 62 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity.The behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis in Table 62 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher-yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce the Corporation's benefit in those scenarios.Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative ContractsInterest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components. For more information on our hedging activities, see Note 2 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Our interest rate contracts are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards. In addition, we use foreign exchange contracts, including cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and options to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities.Changes to the composition of our derivatives portfolio during the six months ended June 30, 2016 reflect actions taken for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk management. The decisions to reposition our derivatives portfolio are based on the current assessment of economic and financial conditions including the interest rate and foreign currency environments, balance sheet composition and trends, and the relative mix of our cash and derivative positions. 107Table of ContentsTable 63 presents derivatives utilized in our ALM activities including those designated as accounting and economic hedging instruments and shows the notional amount, fair value, weighted-average receive-fixed and pay-fixed rates, expected maturity and average estimated durations of our open ALM derivatives at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

Amounts shown as negative reflect a net short position.(7) The notional amount of foreign exchange contracts of $(27.6) billion at June 30, 2016 was comprised of $21.0 billion in foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed swaps, $(43.6) billion in net foreign currency forward rate contracts, $(6.3) billion in foreign currency-denominated pay-fixed swaps and $1.3 billion in net foreign currency futures contracts. Foreign exchange contracts of $(25.4) billion at December 31, 2015 were comprised of $21.3 billion in foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed swaps, $(40.3) billion in net foreign currency forward rate contracts, $(7.6) billion in foreign currency-denominated pay-fixed swaps and $1.2 billion in foreign currency futures contracts. 108Table of ContentsWe use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities and other forecasted transactions (collectively referred to as cash flow hedges). The net losses on both open and terminated cash flow hedge derivative instruments recorded in accumulated OCI were $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion, on a pretax basis, at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. These net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged cash flows. Assuming no change in open cash flow derivative hedge positions and no changes in prices or interest rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at June 30, 2016, the pretax net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings as follows: $515 million, or 35 percent within the next year, 33 percent in years two through five, and 20 percent in years six through ten, with the remaining 12 percent thereafter. For more information on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see Note 2 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We hedge our net investment in non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar using forward foreign exchange contracts that typically settle in less than 180 days, cross-currency basis swaps and foreign exchange options. We recorded net after-tax losses on derivatives in accumulated OCI associated with net investment hedges which were offset by gains on our net investments in consolidated non-U.S. entities at June 30, 2016.Mortgage Banking Risk ManagementWe originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held-for-investment or held-for-sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate.Interest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. Fluctuations in interest rates drive consumer demand for new mortgages and the level of refinancing activity which, in turn, affects total origination and servicing income. Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage banking is a complex process that requires complex modeling and ongoing monitoring. Typically, an increase in mortgage interest rates will lead to a decrease in mortgage originations and related fees. IRLCs and the related residential first-mortgage LHFS are subject to interest rate risk between the date of the IRLC and the date the loans are sold to the secondary market, as an increase in mortgage interest rates will typically lead to a decrease in the value of these instruments.MSRs are nonfinancial assets created when the underlying mortgage loan is sold to investors and we retain the right to service the loan. Typically, an increase in mortgage rates will lead to an increase in the value of the MSRs driven by lower prepayment expectations. This increase in value from increases in mortgage rates is opposite of, and therefore offsets, the risk described for IRLCs and LHFS. Because the interest rate risks of these two hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio.Interest rate and certain market risks of IRLCs and residential mortgage LHFS are economically hedged in combination with MSRs. To hedge these combined assets, we use certain derivatives such as interest rate options, interest rate swaps, forward sale commitments, eurodollar and U.S. Treasury futures, and mortgage TBAs, as well as other securities including agency MBS, principal-only and interest-only MBS and U.S. Treasury securities. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded gains in mortgage banking income of $51 million and $182 million related to the change in fair value of the derivative contracts and other securities used to hedge the market risks of the MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of gains and losses due to changes in fair value of these hedged items, compared to gains of $114 million and $222 million for the same periods in 2015. For more information on MSRs, see Note 17 – Mortgage Servicing Rights to the Consolidated Financial Statements and for more information on mortgage banking income, see Consumer Banking on page 25.Complex Accounting EstimatesOur significant accounting principles, as described in Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, are essential in understanding the MD&A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments.The more judgmental estimates impacting results for the six months ended June 30, 2016 are summarized in the following discussion. We have identified and described the development of the variables most important in the estimation processes that involve mathematical models to derive the estimates. In many cases, there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs to the models. Where alternatives exist, we have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs. Actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could impact our results of operations. Separate from the possible future impact to our results of operations from input and model variables, the value of our lending portfolio and market-sensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet date, often significantly, due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions. Such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and  109Table of Contentsthe resulting volatility could have a significant, negative effect on future operating results. These fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs.For additional information, see Complex Accounting Estimates on page 100 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsWe classify the fair values of financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established under applicable accounting guidance which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Applicable accounting guidance establishes three levels of inputs used to measure fair value.

Level 3 financial assets and liabilities include certain loans, MBS, ABS, collateralized debt obligations, CLOs, structured liabilities and highly structured, complex or long-dated derivative contracts and MSRs. The fair value of these Level 3 financial assets and liabilities and MSRs is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.Table 64Recurring Level 3 Asset and Liability Summary June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions)Level 3Fair Value As a %of TotalLevel 3Assets As a %of TotalAssets Level 3Fair Value As a %of TotalLevel 3Assets As a %of TotalAssetsTrading account assets$5,025 30.64% 0.23% $5,634 31.13% 0.26%Derivative assets5,169 31.52 0.24 5,134 28.37 0.24AFS debt securities1,410 8.60 0.06 1,432 7.91 0.07Loans and leases1,459 8.90 0.07 1,620 8.95 0.08Mortgage servicing rights2,269 13.84 0.10 3,087 17.06 0.14All other Level 3 assets at fair value1,066 6.50 0.05 1,191 6.58 0.05Total Level 3 assets at fair value (1)$16,398 100.00% 0.75% $18,098 100.00% 0.84%             Level 3Fair Value As a %of TotalLevel 3Liabilities As a %of TotalLiabilities Level 3Fair Value As a %of TotalLevel 3Liabilities As a %of TotalLiabilitiesDerivative liabilities$5,817 69.91% 0.30% $5,575 74.50% 0.30%Long-term debt2,156 25.91 0.11 1,513 20.22 0.08All other Level 3 liabilities at fair value348 4.18 0.02 395 5.28 0.02Total Level 3 liabilities at fair value (1)$8,321 100.00% 0.43% $7,483 100.00% 0.40%(1) Level 3 total assets and liabilities are shown before the impact of cash collateral and counterparty netting related to derivative positions.Level 3 financial instruments may be hedged with derivatives classified as Level 1 or 2; therefore, gains or losses associated with Level 3 financial instruments may be offset by gains or losses associated with financial instruments classified in other levels of the fair value hierarchy. The Level 3 gains and losses recorded in earnings did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or capital. We conduct a review of our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of Level 3 are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable, respectively, in the current marketplace. These transfers are considered to be effective as of the beginning of the quarter in which they occur. For more  110Table of Contentsinformation on the significant transfers into and out of Level 3 during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, see Note 14 – Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsBackgroundThe nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets are discussed in Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 8 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as Complex Accounting Estimates on page 100 of the MD&A of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis, which for the Corporation is as of June 30, and in interim periods if events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below. As reporting units are determined after an acquisition or evolve with changes in business strategy, goodwill is assigned to reporting units and it no longer retains its association with a particular acquisition. All of the revenue streams and related activities of a reporting unit, whether acquired or organic, are available to support the value of the goodwill.2016 Annual Goodwill Impairment TestingEstimating the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments, particularly related to cash flows, the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium. We determined the fair values of the reporting units using a combination of valuation techniques consistent with the market approach and the income approach and also utilized independent valuation specialists.The market approach we used estimates the fair value of the individual reporting units by incorporating any combination of the book capital, tangible capital and earnings multiples from comparable publicly-traded companies in industries similar to the reporting unit. The relative weight assigned to these multiples varies among the reporting units based on qualitative and quantitative characteristics, primarily the size and relative profitability of the reporting unit as compared to the comparable publicly-traded companies. Since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of a noncontrolling interest, we added a control premium to arrive at the reporting units' estimated fair values on a controlling basis.For purposes of the income approach, we calculated discounted cash flows by taking the net present value of estimated future cash flows and an appropriate terminal value. Our discounted cash flow analysis employs a capital asset pricing model in estimating the discount rate (i.e., cost of equity financing) for each reporting unit. The inputs to this model include the risk-free rate of return, beta, which is a measure of the level of non-diversifiable risk associated with comparable companies for each specific reporting unit, market equity risk premium and in certain cases an unsystematic (company-specific) risk factor. The unsystematic risk factor is the input that specifically addresses uncertainty related to our projections of earnings and growth, including the uncertainty related to loss expectations. We utilized discount rates that we believe adequately reflect the risk and uncertainty in the financial markets generally and specifically in our internally developed forecasts. We estimated expected rates of equity returns based on historical market returns and risk/return rates for industries similar to each reporting unit. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and actual results may differ from forecasted results.During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2016 for all of our reporting units that had goodwill. In performing the first step of the annual goodwill impairment analysis, we compared the fair value of each reporting unit to its estimated carrying value as measured by allocated equity, which includes goodwill. We also evaluated the U.K. Card business within All Other, as the U.K. Card business comprises substantially all of the goodwill included in All Other. To determine fair value, we utilized a combination of the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, we compared earnings and equity multiples of the individual reporting units to multiples of public companies comparable to the individual reporting units. The control premium used in the June 30, 2016 annual goodwill impairment test was 30 percent, based upon observed comparable premiums paid for change in control transactions for financial institutions, for all reporting units. Under the income approach, we updated our assumptions to reflect the current market environment. The discount rates used in the June 30, 2016 annual goodwill impairment test ranged from 8.9 percent to 12.7 percent depending on the relative risk of a reporting unit. Cumulative average growth rates developed by management for revenues and expenses in each reporting unit ranged from negative 3.2 percent to positive 5.9 percent. The Corporation's market capitalization remained below our recorded book value during the first six months of 2016. As none of our reporting units are publicly traded, individual reporting unit fair value determinations may not directly correlate to the Corporation's market capitalization. We considered the comparison of the aggregate fair value of the reporting units with assigned goodwill to the Corporation's market capitalization as of June 30, 2016. We do not believe that our current market capitalization reflects the aggregate fair value of our individual reporting units with assigned goodwill as our market capitalization does not include consideration of individual  111Table of Contentsreporting unit control premiums. Additionally, while the impact of recent regulatory changes has been considered in the reporting units' forecasts and valuations, overall regulatory and market uncertainties persist that we believe further impact the Corporation's stock price.Effective April 1, 2016, the Corporation realigned its business segments. As part of the realignment, the Corporation completed a review of all consumer real estate-secured lending and servicing activities within LAS, Consumer Banking, GWIM and All Other with a view to strategically align the business activities and loans into core and non-core categories, with core loans reflected on the balance sheet of the appropriate business segment and non-core loans on the balance sheet of All Other. There was no goodwill in LAS. Following the segment realignment, the Corporation combined the Card Services, Consumer Vehicle Lending and Home Loans reporting units within the Consumer Banking segment into a single Consumer Lending reporting unit, effective June 30, 2016. This combination of reporting units triggered a test for goodwill impairment, which was performed both immediately before and after the combination of reporting units. We performed this analysis in conjunction with our annual impairment test as of June 30, 2016. Based on the results of step one of the annual goodwill impairment test, we determined that step two was not required for any of the reporting units as their fair value exceeded their carrying value indicating there was no impairment. Table 65 shows goodwill assigned to the individual reporting units and the fair value as a percentage of the carrying value as of our June 30, 2016 annual goodwill impairment test.Table 65   Goodwill by Reporting Unit    June 30, 2016(Dollars in millions)Estimated Fair Value as a Percent of Allocated Carrying Value GoodwillConsumer Banking   Deposits147.9% $18,414Consumer Lending (1)147.5 11,709Global Wealth & Investment Management   U.S. Trust158.0 2,917Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management223.2 6,764Global Banking   Global Commercial Banking140.9 16,146Global Corporate and Investment Banking146.9 6,231Business Banking147.0 1,546Global Markets113.3 5,197All Other (2)193.6 775(1) As of June 30, 2016, prior to the combination of Card Services, Consumer Vehicle Lending, and Home Loans reporting units into a single Consumer Lending reporting unit, the fair value as a percentage of carrying value for Card Services and Consumer Vehicle Lending was 246.5 percent and 128.1 percent, with Home Loans having no goodwill.(2)  Reflects the goodwill and fair value as a percent of allocated carrying value assigned to the U.K. Card business within All Other. The total amount of goodwill in All Other was $820 million at June 30, 2016. In estimating the fair value of the reporting units in step one of the annual goodwill impairment analysis, the fair values can be sensitive to changes in the projected cash flows and assumptions. In some instances, minor changes in the assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value. Furthermore, a prolonged decrease or increase in a particular assumption could eventually lead to the fair value of a reporting unit being less than its carrying value. The U.K. Referendum introduced additional complexities and variables in estimating the fair values of the reporting units and we considered these impacts on market data utilized in the analysis through the test date noting a slight adverse impact reflective of market uncertainty. Future impacts of the U.K. Referendum and continued regulatory pressures could have an adverse impact on reporting unit valuations, which we will continue to monitor.Also, under step two of the annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was not required for any of our reporting units at June 30, 2016, changes in the estimated fair values of the individual assets and liabilities may result in a different amount of implied goodwill, and ultimately the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. 112Table of ContentsItem 3.

of ContentsBank of America Corporation and SubsidiariesNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNOTE 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting PrinciplesBank of America Corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the Corporation), a bank holding company and a financial holding company, provides a diverse range of financial services and products throughout the U.S. and in certain international markets. The term "the Corporation" as used herein may refer to Bank of America Corporation individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation's subsidiaries or affiliates.Principles of Consolidation and Basis of PresentationThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries, and those variable interest entities (VIEs) where the Corporation is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Results of operations of acquired companies are included from the dates of acquisition and for VIEs, from the dates that the Corporation became the primary beneficiary. Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Corporation accounts for investments in companies for which it owns a voting interest and for which it has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financing decisions using the equity method of accounting. These investments are included in other assets. Equity method investments are subject to impairment testing and the Corporation's proportionate share of income or loss is included in other income.In the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, the Corporation reported its results of operations through five business segments: Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), Global Banking, Global Markets and Legacy Assets & Servicing (LAS), with the remaining operations recorded in All Other. Effective April 1, 2016, to align the segments with how the Corporation now manages the businesses, the Corporation changed its basis of presentation to eliminate the LAS segment, and following such change, the Corporation reports its results of operations through the following four business segments: Consumer Banking, GWIM, Global Banking and Global Markets, with the remaining operations recorded in All Other. Consumer real estate loans, including loans previously held in or serviced by LAS, have been designated as either core or non-core based on criteria described in Note 4 – Outstanding Loans and Leases and Note 18 – Business Segment Information. Following the realignment, core loans owned by the Corporation, which include all loans originated after the realignment, are held in the Consumer Banking and GWIM segments. Non-core loans owned by the Corporation, which are principally run-off portfolios, as well as loans held for asset and liability management (ALM) activities are held in All Other. Mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) pertaining to core and non-core loans serviced for others are held in Consumer Banking and All Other, respectively. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Realized results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The nature of the Corporation's business is such that the results of any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which consist of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the interim period results have been made. The Corporation evaluates subsequent events through the date of filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, the Corporation classifies certain leases in other assets. Previously these leases were classified in loans and leases. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. In the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the six months ended June 30, 2015, as included herein, the Corporation made certain corrections related to non-cash activity which are not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements taken as a whole, do not impact the Consolidated Statement of Income or Consolidated Balance Sheet, and have no impact on the Corporation's cash and cash equivalents balance. Certain non-cash transactions involving the sale of loans and receipt of debt securities as proceeds were incorrectly classified between operating activities and investing activities. The corrections resulted in a $9.3 billion increase in net cash provided by operating activities, offset by a $9.3 billion increase in net cash used in investing activities when compared to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in the Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2015. 120Table of ContentsFor information on certain non-cash transactions, which are not reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, see Note 4 – Outstanding Loans and Leases and Note 6 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities.New Accounting PronouncementsIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance that will require the earlier recognition of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments based on an expected loss model, replacing the incurred loss model that is currently in use. Under the new guidance, an entity will measure all expected credit losses for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The expected loss model will apply to loans and leases, unfunded lending commitments, held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities and other debt instruments measured at amortized cost. The impairment model for available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities will require the recognition of credit losses through a valuation allowance when fair value is less than amortized cost, regardless of whether the impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary. The new guidance is effective on January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted on January 1, 2019. The Corporation is in the process of evaluating the impact of the provisions of this new accounting guidance, which will increase the allowance for credit losses with a resulting negative adjustment to retained earnings.In March 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that simplifies certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The new guidance is effective on January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Corporation does not expect the provisions of this new accounting guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.In February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that requires substantially all leases to be recorded as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. This new accounting guidance is effective on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, the Corporation will record a right of use asset and a lease payment obligation associated with arrangements previously accounted for as operating leases. The Corporation is in the process of evaluating the impact of the provisions of this new accounting guidance on its consolidated financial position, but does not expect the new accounting guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.In January 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance on recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The new guidance makes targeted changes to existing GAAP including, among other provisions, requiring certain equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings and requiring changes in instrument-specific credit risk (i.e., debit valuation adjustments (DVA)) for financial liabilities recorded at fair value under the fair value option to be reported in other comprehensive income (OCI). The accounting for DVA related to other financial liabilities, for example, derivatives, does not change. The new guidance is effective on January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted for the provisions related to DVA. In 2015, the Corporation early adopted, retrospective to January 1, 2015, the provisions of this new accounting guidance related to DVA on financial liabilities accounted for under the fair value option. The Corporation does not expect the provisions of this new accounting guidance other than those related to DVA, as described above, to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.In February 2015, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that amends the criteria for determining whether limited partnerships and similar entities are VIEs, clarifies when a general partner or asset manager should consolidate an entity and eliminates the indefinite deferral of certain aspects of VIE accounting guidance for investments in certain investment funds. Money market funds registered under Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act and similar funds are exempt from consolidation under the new guidance. This new accounting guidance was effective on January 1, 2016, and only affected the Corporation's disclosures. For additional disclosures under this new guidance, see Note 6 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities.In August 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that provides a measurement alternative for entities that consolidate a collateralized financing entity (CFE). The new guidance allows an entity to measure both the financial assets and financial liabilities of a CFE using the fair value of either the financial assets or financial liabilities, whichever is more observable. This alternative is available for CFEs where the financial assets and financial liabilities are carried at fair value and changes in fair value are reported in earnings. This new accounting guidance was effective on January 1, 2016, and did not have a material impact on the Corporation's consolidated financial position or results of operations. For additional disclosures under this new guidance, see Note 6 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities and Note 14 – Fair Value Measurements.In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. This new accounting guidance, which does not apply to financial instruments, is effective on January 1, 2018. The Corporation does not expect the provisions of this new accounting guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. 121Table of ContentsNOTE 2 – Derivatives Derivative BalancesDerivatives are entered into on behalf of customers, for trading, or to support risk management activities. Derivatives used in risk management activities include derivatives that may or may not be designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships. Derivatives that are not designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships are referred to as other risk management derivatives. For more information on the Corporation's derivatives and hedging activities, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following tables present derivative instruments included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in derivative assets and liabilities at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting. Total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and have been reduced by the cash collateral received or paid.

(ISDA) master netting agreements or similar agreements with substantially all of the Corporation's derivative counterparties. Where legally enforceable, these master netting agreements give the Corporation, in the event of default by the counterparty, the right to liquidate securities held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty. For purposes of the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation offsets derivative assets and liabilities and cash collateral held with the same counterparty where it has such a legally enforceable master netting agreement.The Offsetting of Derivatives table presents derivative instruments included in derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 by primary risk (e.g., interest rate risk) and the platform, where applicable, on which these derivatives are transacted. Exchange-traded derivatives include listed options transacted on an exchange. Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives include bilateral transactions between the Corporation and a particular counterparty. OTC-cleared derivatives include bilateral transactions between the Corporation and a counterparty where the transaction is cleared through a clearinghouse. Balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting. Total gross derivative assets and liabilities  123Table of Contentsare adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements which includes reducing the balance for counterparty netting and cash collateral received or paid.Other gross derivative assets and liabilities in the table represent derivatives entered into under master netting agreements where uncertainty exists as to the enforceability of these agreements under bankruptcy laws in some countries or industries and, accordingly, receivables and payables with counterparties in these countries or industries are reported on a gross basis.Also included in the table is financial instruments collateral related to legally enforceable master netting agreements that represents securities collateral received or pledged and customer cash collateral held at third-party custodians. These amounts are not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but are shown as a reduction to total derivative assets and liabilities in the table to derive net derivative assets and liabilities.For more information on offsetting of securities financing agreements, see Note 9 – Federal Funds Sold or Purchased, Securities Financing Agreements and Short-term Borrowings.Offsetting of Derivatives        June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015(Dollars in billions)DerivativeAssets DerivativeLiabilities DerivativeAssets DerivativeLiabilitiesInterest rate contracts       Over-the-counter$391.3 $380.5 $309.3 $297.2Exchange-traded0.1 — — —Over-the-counter cleared293.6 292.9 197.0 201.7Foreign exchange contracts       Over-the-counter141.7 144.6 103.2 107.5Over-the-counter cleared0.2 0.2 0.1 0.1Equity contracts       Over-the-counter15.8 13.9 16.6 14.0Exchange-traded 12.7 11.7 10.0 9.2Commodity contracts       Over-the-counter4.8 5.9 7.3 8.9Exchange-traded (1)1.7 1.6 1.8 1.8Over-the-counter cleared— — 0.1 0.1Credit derivatives       Over-the-counter19.9 19.6 24.6 22.9Over-the-counter cleared5.1 5.2 6.5 6.4Total gross derivative assets/liabilities, before netting     Over-the-counter573.5 564.5 461.0 450.5Exchange-traded (1)14.5 13.3 11.8 11.0Over-the-counter cleared298.9 298.3 203.7 208.3Less: Legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral received/paid       Over-the-counter(536.8) (531.9) (426.6) (425.7)Exchange-traded (1)(10.8) (10.8) (8.7) (8.7)Over-the-counter cleared(298.3) (298.2) (203.3) (208.2)Derivative assets/liabilities, after netting41.0 35.2 37.9 27.2Other gross derivative assets/liabilities 14.3 12.4 12.1 11.3Total derivative assets/liabilities55.3 47.6 50.0 38.5Less: Financial instruments collateral (2)(14.9) (14.1) (13.9) (6.5)Total net derivative assets/liabilities$40.4 $33.5 $36.1 $32.0(1) The notional amount for certain commodity derivatives has been reduced to reflect the impact of legally closed positions, which had no impact on the net fair value.(2) These amounts are limited to the derivative asset/liability balance and, accordingly, do not include excess collateral received/pledged. 124Table of ContentsALM and Risk Management DerivativesThe Corporation's ALM and risk management activities include the use of derivatives to mitigate risk to the Corporation including derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships and derivatives used in other risk management activities. Interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, commodity and credit contracts are utilized in the Corporation's ALM and risk management activities.The Corporation maintains an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts, which are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation's goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity and volatility so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings or capital. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in fair value. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are linked to the hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this unrealized appreciation or depreciation.Market risk, including interest rate risk, can be substantial in the mortgage business. Market risk is the risk that values of mortgage assets or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as interest rate movements. To mitigate the interest rate risk in mortgage banking production income, the Corporation utilizes forward loan sale commitments and other derivative instruments, including purchased options, and certain debt securities. The Corporation also utilizes derivatives such as interest rate options, interest rate swaps, forward settlement contracts and eurodollar futures to hedge certain market risks of MSRs. For more information on MSRs, see Note 17 – Mortgage Servicing Rights.The Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities, as well as the Corporation's investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Foreign exchange contracts, which include spot and forward contracts, represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon settlement date. Exposure to loss on these contracts will increase or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange and interest rates fluctuate.The Corporation enters into derivative commodity contracts such as futures, swaps, options and forwards as well as non-derivative commodity contracts to provide price risk management services to customers or to manage price risk associated with its physical and financial commodity positions. The non-derivative commodity contracts and physical inventories of commodities expose the Corporation to earnings volatility. Fair value accounting hedges provide a method to mitigate a portion of this earnings volatility.The Corporation purchases credit derivatives to manage credit risk related to certain funded and unfunded credit exposures. Credit derivatives include credit default swaps (CDS), total return swaps and swaptions. These derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income. 125Table of ContentsDerivatives Designated as Accounting HedgesThe Corporation uses various types of interest rate, commodity and foreign exchange derivative contracts to protect against changes in the fair value of its assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates, commodity prices and exchange rates (fair value hedges). The Corporation also uses these types of contracts and equity derivatives to protect against changes in the cash flows of its assets and liabilities, and other forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges). The Corporation hedges its net investment in consolidated non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar using forward exchange contracts and cross-currency basis swaps, and by issuing foreign currency-denominated debt (net investment hedges).Fair Value HedgesThe table below summarizes information related to fair value hedges for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, including hedges of interest rate risk on long-term debt that were acquired as part of a business combination and redesignated at that time. At redesignation, the fair value of the derivatives was positive. As the derivatives mature, the fair value will approach zero. As a result, ineffectiveness will occur and the fair value changes in the derivatives and the long-term debt being hedged may be directionally the same in certain scenarios. Based on a regression analysis, the derivatives continue to be highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value of the long-term debt attributable to interest rate risk.Derivatives Designated as Fair Value Hedges      Gains (Losses)Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 2016 2016(Dollars in millions)Derivative HedgedItem HedgeIneffectiveness Derivative HedgedItem HedgeIneffectivenessInterest rate risk on long-term debt (1)$1,263 $(1,380) $(117) $3,924 $(4,234) $(310)Interest rate and foreign currency risk on long-term debt (1)(495) 487 (8) 344 (359) (15)Interest rate risk on available-for-sale securities (2)(215) 198 (17) (366) 330 (36)Price risk on commodity inventory (3)(8) 8 — (6) 6 —Total$545 $(687) $(142) $3,896 $(4,257) $(361)             2015 2015Interest rate risk on long-term debt (1)$(2,293) $2,041 $(252) $(1,197) $749 $(448)Interest rate and foreign currency risk on long-term debt (1)388 (402) (14) (1,256) 1,186 (70)Interest rate risk on available-for-sale securities (2)2 (3) (1) 45 (48) (3)Price risk on commodity inventory (3)2 (2) — 13 (9) 4Total$(1,901) $1,634 $(267) $(2,395) $1,878 $(517)(1) Amounts are recorded in interest expense on long-term debt and in other income.(2) Amounts are recorded in interest income on debt securities.(3) Amounts relating to commodity inventory are recorded in trading account profits. 126Table of ContentsCash Flow and Net Investment HedgesThe table below summarizes certain information related to cash flow hedges and net investment hedges for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. Of the $927 million net loss (after-tax) on derivatives in accumulated OCI at June 30, 2016, $322 million (after-tax) is expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months. These net losses reclassified into earnings are expected to primarily reduce net interest income related to the respective hedged items. Amounts related to price risk on restricted stock awards reclassified from accumulated OCI are recorded in personnel expense. For terminated cash flow hedges, the time period over which substantially all of the forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately seven years, with a maximum length of time for certain forecasted transactions of 20 years.Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges       Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 2016 2016(Dollars in millions, amounts pretax)Gains (Losses) Recognized in Accumulated OCI on Derivatives Gains (Losses) in Income Reclassified from Accumulated OCI Hedge Ineffectiveness and Amounts Excluded from Effectiveness Testing (1) Gains (Losses) Recognized in Accumulated OCI on Derivatives Gains (Losses) in Income Reclassified from Accumulated OCI Hedge Ineffectiveness and Amounts Excluded from Effectiveness Testing (1)Cash flow hedges           Interest rate risk on variable-rate portfolios$19 $(164) $— $58 $(328) $6Price risk on restricted stock awards (2)(1) (19) — (199) (53) —Total$18 $(183) $— $(141) $(381) $6Net investment hedges           Foreign exchange risk$592 $1 $(23) $(41) $1 $(166)             2015 2015Cash flow hedges           Interest rate risk on variable-rate portfolios$(19) $(259) $— $5 $(514) $(1)Price risk on restricted stock awards (2)181 28 — (29) 27 —Total$162 $(231) $— $(24) $(487) $(1)Net investment hedges           Foreign exchange risk$(992) $84 $11 $990 $84 $(87)(1) Amounts related to cash flow hedges represent hedge ineffectiveness and amounts related to net investment hedges represent amounts excluded from effectiveness testing.(2) The hedge gain (loss) recognized in accumulated OCI is primarily related to the change in the Corporation's stock price for the period. 127Table of ContentsOther Risk Management DerivativesOther risk management derivatives are used by the Corporation to reduce certain risk exposures. These derivatives are not qualifying accounting hedges because either they did not qualify for or were not designated as accounting hedges. The table below presents gains (losses) on these derivatives for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. These gains (losses) are largely offset by the income or expense that is recorded on the hedged item.Other Risk Management Derivatives    Gains (Losses)Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30(Dollars in millions)2016 2015 2016 2015Interest rate risk on mortgage banking income (1)$279 $(390) $825 $(94)Credit risk on loans (2)(31) (31) (96) (58)Interest rate and foreign currency risk on ALM activities (3)(824) 585 (1,708) 266Price risk on restricted stock awards (4)(27) 226 (768) (244)Other14 (20) 40 (7)(1) Net gains (losses) on these derivatives are recorded in mortgage banking income as they are used to mitigate the interest rate risk related to MSRs, interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS), all of which are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in mortgage banking income. The net gains on IRLCs related to the origination of mortgage loans that are held-for-sale, which are not included in the table but are considered derivative instruments, were $177 million and $329 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $167 million and $427 million for the same periods in 2015.(2) Primarily related to derivatives that are economic hedges of credit risk on loans.

Gains (losses) on these derivatives and the related hedged items are recorded in other income.(4) Gains (losses) on these derivatives are recorded in personnel expense.Transfers of Financial Assets with Risk Retained through DerivativesThe Corporation enters into certain transactions involving the transfer of financial assets that are accounted for as sales where substantially all of the economic exposure to the transferred financial assets is retained by the Corporation through a derivative agreement with the initial transferee. These transactions are accounted for as sales because the Corporation does not retain control over the assets transferred.Through June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Corporation transferred $7.2 billion and $7.9 billion of primarily non-U.S. government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to a third-party trust. The Corporation received gross cash proceeds of $7.2 billion and $7.9 billion at the transfer dates. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair value of these securities was $7.0 billion and $7.2 billion. The Corporation simultaneously entered into derivatives with those counterparties whereby the Corporation retained certain economic exposures to those securities (e.g., interest rate and/or credit risk). A derivative asset of $44 million and $24 million and a liability of $35 million and $29 million were recorded at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and are included in credit derivatives in the derivative instruments table on page 122. The economic exposure retained by the Corporation is typically hedged with interest rate swaps and interest rate swaptions.Sales and Trading RevenueThe Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate client transactions and to manage risk exposures arising from trading account assets and liabilities. It is the Corporation's policy to include these derivative instruments in its trading activities which include derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments. The resulting risk from these derivatives is managed on a portfolio basis as part of the Corporation's Global Markets business segment. The related sales and trading revenue generated within Global Markets is recorded in various income statement line items including trading account profits and net interest income as well as other revenue categories.Sales and trading revenue includes changes in the fair value and realized gains and losses on the sales of trading and other assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. Revenue is generated by the difference in the client price for an instrument and the price at which the trading desk can execute the trade in the dealer market. For equity securities, commissions related to purchases and sales are recorded in the "Other" column in the Sales and Trading Revenue table. Changes in the fair value of these securities are included in trading account profits. For debt securities, revenue, with the exception of interest associated with the debt securities, is typically included in trading account profits. Unlike commissions for equity securities, the initial revenue related to broker-dealer services for debt securities is typically included in the pricing of the instrument rather than being charged through separate fee arrangements. Therefore, this revenue is recorded in trading account profits as part of the initial mark to fair value. For derivatives,  128Table of Contentsthe majority of revenue is included in trading account profits. In transactions where the Corporation acts as agent, which include exchange-traded futures and options, fees are recorded in other income.The table below, which includes both derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments, identifies the amounts in the respective income statement line items attributable to the Corporation's sales and trading revenue in Global Markets, categorized by primary risk, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. The difference between total trading account profits in the table below and in the Consolidated Statement of Income represents trading activities in business segments other than Global Markets. This table includes debit valuation and funding valuation adjustment (DVA/FVA) gains (losses). Global Markets results in Note 18 – Business Segment Information are presented on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis.

Credit derivatives derive value based on an underlying third-party referenced obligation or a portfolio of referenced obligations and generally require the Corporation, as the seller of credit protection, to make payments to a buyer upon the occurrence of a pre-defined credit event. Such credit events generally include bankruptcy of the referenced credit entity and failure to pay under the obligation, as well as acceleration of indebtedness and payment repudiation or moratorium. For credit derivatives based on a portfolio of referenced credits or credit indices, the Corporation may not be required to make payment until a specified amount of loss has occurred and/or may only be required to make payment up to a specified amount.Credit derivative instruments where the Corporation is the seller of credit protection and their expiration are summarized in the table below. These instruments are classified as investment and non-investment grade based on the credit quality of the underlying referenced obligation. The Corporation considers ratings of BBB- or higher as investment grade. Non-investment grade includes non-rated credit derivative instruments. The Corporation discloses internal categorizations of investment grade and non-investment grade consistent with how risk is managed for these instruments. 129Table of ContentsCredit Derivative Instruments   June 30, 2016 Carrying Value(Dollars in millions)Less thanOne Year One to Three Years Three toFive Years Over FiveYears TotalCredit default swaps:         Investment grade$24 $139 $1,019 $832 $2,014Non-investment grade846 2,087 1,927 4,022 8,882Total870 2,226 2,946 4,854 10,896Total return swaps/other:         Investment grade8 — — — 8Non-investment grade360 31 3 3 397Total368 31 3 3 405Total credit derivatives$1,238 $2,257 $2,949 $4,857 $11,301Credit-related notes:         Investment grade$— $112 $588 $1,614 $2,314Non-investment grade89 57 72 1,074 1,292Total credit-related notes$89 $169 $660 $2,688 $3,606 Maximum Payout/NotionalCredit default swaps:         Investment grade$160,451 $223,978 $155,750 $22,013 $562,192Non-investment grade96,893 110,174 56,060 18,684 281,811Total257,344 334,152 211,810 40,697 844,003Total return swaps/other:         Investment grade10,634 — — — 10,634Non-investment grade24,622 5,264 749 237 30,872Total35,256 5,264 749 237 41,506Total credit derivatives$292,600 $339,416 $212,559 $40,934 $885,509           December 31, 2015 Carrying ValueCredit default swaps:         Investment grade$84 $481 $2,203 $680 $3,448Non-investment grade672 3,035 2,386 3,583 9,676Total756 3,516 4,589 4,263 13,124Total return swaps/other:         Investment grade5 — — — 5Non-investment grade171 236 8 2 417Total176 236 8 2 422Total credit derivatives$932 $3,752 $4,597 $4,265 $13,546Credit-related notes:         Investment grade$267 $57 $444 $2,203 $2,971Non-investment grade61 118 117 1,264 1,560Total credit-related notes$328 $175 $561 $3,467 $4,531 Maximum Payout/NotionalCredit default swaps:         Investment grade$149,177 $280,658 $178,990 $26,352 $635,177Non-investment grade81,596 135,850 53,299 18,221 288,966Total230,773 416,508 232,289 44,573 924,143Total return swaps/other:         Investment grade9,758 — — — 9,758Non-investment grade20,917 6,989 1,371 623 29,900Total30,675 6,989 1,371 623 39,658Total credit derivatives$261,448 $423,497 $233,660 $45,196 $963,801 130Table of ContentsThe notional amount represents the maximum amount payable by the Corporation for most credit derivatives. However, the Corporation does not monitor its exposure to credit derivatives based solely on the notional amount because this measure does not take into consideration the probability of occurrence. As such, the notional amount is not a reliable indicator of the Corporation's exposure to these contracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and establish limits to help ensure that certain credit risk-related losses occur within acceptable, predefined limits.The Corporation manages its market risk exposure to credit derivatives by entering into a variety of offsetting derivative contracts and security positions. For example, in certain instances, the Corporation may purchase credit protection with identical underlying referenced names to offset its exposure. The carrying value and notional amount of written credit derivatives for which the Corporation held purchased credit derivatives with identical underlying referenced names and terms were $7.6 billion and $647.6 billion at June 30, 2016, and $8.2 billion and $706.0 billion at December 31, 2015.Credit-related notes in the table on page 130 include investments in securities issued by collateralized debt obligation (CDO), collateralized loan obligation (CLO) and credit-linked note vehicles. These instruments are primarily classified as trading securities. The carrying value of these instruments equals the Corporation's maximum exposure to loss. The Corporation is not obligated to make any payments to the entities under the terms of the securities owned.Credit-related Contingent Features and CollateralThe Corporation executes the majority of its derivative contracts in the OTC market with large, international financial institutions, including broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of non-financial companies. A significant majority of the derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit rating downgrade (depending on the ultimate rating level) or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required of the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow the Corporation to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades. Further, as previously discussed on page 122, the Corporation enters into legally enforceable master netting agreements which reduce risk by permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of certain events.A majority of the Corporation's derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features, primarily in the form of ISDA master netting agreements and credit support documentation that enhance the creditworthiness of these instruments compared to other obligations of the respective counterparty with whom the Corporation has transacted. These contingent features may be for the benefit of the Corporation as well as its counterparties with respect to changes in the Corporation's creditworthiness and the mark-to-market exposure under the derivative transactions. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Corporation held cash and securities collateral of $90.2 billion and $78.9 billion, and posted cash and securities collateral of $72.8 billion and $62.7 billion in the normal course of business under derivative agreements. This excludes cross-product margining agreements where clients are permitted to margin on a net basis for both derivative and secured financing arrangements.In connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, the Corporation can be required to provide additional collateral or to terminate transactions with certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade of the senior debt ratings of the Corporation or certain subsidiaries. The amount of additional collateral required depends on the contract and is usually a fixed incremental amount and/or the market value of the exposure.At June 30, 2016, the amount of collateral, calculated based on the terms of the contracts, that the Corporation and certain subsidiaries could be required to post to counterparties but had not yet posted to counterparties was approximately $3.3 billion, including $1.8 billion for Bank of America, N.A. (BANA).Some counterparties are currently able to unilaterally terminate certain contracts, or the Corporation or certain subsidiaries may be required to take other action such as find a suitable replacement or obtain a guarantee. At June 30, 2016, the current liability recorded for these derivative contracts was $50 million. 131Table of ContentsThe table below presents the amount of additional collateral that would have been contractually required by derivative contracts and other trading agreements at June 30, 2016 if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch and by an additional second incremental notch.Additional Collateral Required to Be Posted Upon Downgrade June 30, 2016(Dollars in millions)One incremental notch Second incremental notchBank of America Corporation$869 $2,141Bank of America, N.A. and subsidiaries (1)678 1,695(1) Included in Bank of America Corporation collateral requirements in this table.The table below presents the derivative liabilities that would be subject to unilateral termination by counterparties and the amounts of collateral that would have been contractually required at June 30, 2016 if the long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries had been lower by one incremental notch and by an additional second incremental notch.Derivative Liabilities Subject to Unilateral Termination Upon Downgrade June 30, 2016(Dollars in millions)One incremental notch Second incremental notchDerivative liabilities$1,064 $4,114Collateral posted724 3,440 132Table of ContentsValuation Adjustments on DerivativesThe Corporation records credit risk valuation adjustments on derivatives in order to properly reflect the credit quality of the counterparties and its own credit quality. The Corporation calculates valuation adjustments on derivatives based on a modeled expected exposure that incorporates current market risk factors. The exposure also takes into consideration credit mitigants such as enforceable master netting agreements and collateral. CDS spread data is used to estimate the default probabilities and severities that are applied to the exposures. Where no observable credit default data is available for counterparties, the Corporation uses proxies and other market data to estimate default probabilities and severity.Valuation adjustments on derivatives are affected by changes in market spreads, non-credit related market factors such as interest rate and currency changes that affect the expected exposure, and other factors like changes in collateral arrangements and partial payments. Credit spreads and non-credit factors can move independently. For example, for an interest rate swap, changes in interest rates may increase the expected exposure, which would increase the counterparty credit valuation adjustment (CVA). Independently, counterparty credit spreads may tighten, which would result in an offsetting decrease to CVA.The Corporation enters into risk management activities to offset market driven exposures. The Corporation often hedges the counterparty spread risk in CVA with CDS. The Corporation hedges other market risks in CVA, FVA and DVA primarily with currency swaps and interest rate products. In certain instances, the net-of-hedge amounts in the table below move in the same direction as the gross amount or may move in the opposite direction. This is a consequence of the complex interaction of the risks being hedged resulting in limitations in the ability to perfectly hedge all of the market exposures at all times.The table below presents CVA, DVA and FVA gains (losses) on derivatives, which are recorded in trading account profits, on a gross and net of hedge basis for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. CVA gains reduce the cumulative CVA thereby increasing the derivative assets balance. DVA gains increase the cumulative DVA thereby decreasing the derivative liabilities balance. CVA and DVA losses have the opposite impact. FVA gains related to net derivative assets reduce the cumulative FVA thereby increasing the derivative assets balance.

Substantially all OTTI losses in the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 consisted of credit losses on non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) and were recorded in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. A debt security is impaired when its fair value is less than its amortized cost. If the Corporation intends or will more-likely-than-not be required to sell a debt security prior to recovery, the entire impairment loss is recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income. For AFS debt securities the Corporation does not intend or will not more-likely-than-not be required to sell, an analysis is performed to determine if any of the impairment is due to credit or whether it is due to other factors (e.g., interest rate). Credit losses are considered unrecoverable and, accordingly, are recorded  136Table of Contentsin the Consolidated Statement of Income with the remaining unrealized losses recorded in OCI. In certain instances, the credit loss on a debt security may exceed the total impairment, in which case, the excess of the credit loss over the total impairment is recorded as an unrealized gain in OCI.Net Credit-related Impairment Losses Recognized in Earnings     Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30(Dollars in millions)2016 2015 2016 2015Total OTTI losses$(15) $(11) $(31) $(82)Less: non-credit portion of total OTTI losses recognized in OCI10 6 19 7Net credit-related impairment losses recognized in earnings$(5) $(5) $(12) $(75)The table below presents a rollforward of the credit losses recognized in earnings for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 on AFS debt securities that the Corporation does not have the intent to sell or will not more-likely-than-not be required to sell.Rollforward of OTTI Credit Losses Recognized     Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30(Dollars in millions)2016 2015 2016 2015Balance, beginning of period$269 $256 $266 $200Additions for credit losses recognized on AFS debt securities that had no previous impairment losses1 2 2 49Additions for credit losses recognized on AFS debt securities that had previously incurred impairment losses4 3 10 26Reductions for AFS debt securities matured, sold or intended to be sold(28) — (32) (14)Balance, June 30$246 $261 $246 $261The Corporation estimates the portion of a loss on a security that is attributable to credit using a discounted cash flow model and estimates the expected cash flows of the underlying collateral using internal credit, interest rate and prepayment risk models that incorporate management's best estimate of current key assumptions such as default rates, loss severity and prepayment rates. Assumptions used for the underlying loans that support the MBS can vary widely from loan to loan and are influenced by such factors as loan interest rate, geographic location of the borrower, borrower characteristics and collateral type. Based on these assumptions, the Corporation then determines how the underlying collateral cash flows will be distributed to each MBS issued from the applicable special purpose entity. Expected principal and interest cash flows on an impaired AFS debt security are discounted using the effective yield of each individual impaired AFS debt security.Significant assumptions used in estimating the expected cash flows for measuring credit losses on non-agency RMBS were as follows at June 30, 2016.Significant Assumptions   Range (1) Weighted-average 10th Percentile (2) 90th Percentile (2)Annual prepayment speed12.7% 1.9% 27.3%Loss severity31.3 15.5 29.1Life default rate20.5 0.6 78.3(1) Represents the range of inputs/assumptions based upon the underlying collateral.(2) The value of a variable below which the indicated percentile of observations will fall.Annual constant prepayment speed and loss severity rates are projected considering collateral characteristics such as loan-to-value (LTV), creditworthiness of borrowers as measured using Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores, and geographic concentrations. The weighted-average severity by collateral type was 26.0 percent for prime, 27.6 percent for Alt-A and 38.9 percent for subprime at June 30, 2016. Additionally, default rates are projected by considering collateral characteristics including, but not limited to, LTV, FICO score and geographic concentration. Weighted-average life default rates by collateral type were 15.3 percent for prime, 23.3 percent for Alt-A and 23.2 percent for subprime at June 30, 2016. 137Table of ContentsThe expected maturity distribution and yields of the Corporation's debt securities carried at fair value and HTM debt securities at June 30, 2016 are summarized in the table below. Actual maturities may differ from the contractual or expected maturities since borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties.Maturities of Debt Securities Carried at Fair Value and Held-to-maturity Debt Securities June 30, 2016 Due in OneYear or Less Due after One Yearthrough Five Years Due after FiveYears through Ten Years Due afterTen Years Total(Dollars in millions)AmountYield (1) AmountYield (1) AmountYield (1) AmountYield (1) AmountYield (1)Amortized cost of debt securities carried at fair value             Mortgage-backed securities:              Agency$454.41% $180,4462.24% $23,1892.67% $—— $203,6802.29%Agency-collateralized mortgage obligations971.24 8,4752.47 8842.72 —— 9,4562.48Commercial876.02 1,1382.04 9,8582.36 —— 11,0832.36Non-agency residential1785.66 7415.63 8405.64 3,5888.48% 5,3477.55Total mortgage-backed securities4074.54 190,8002.26 34,7712.66 3,5888.48 229,5662.42U.S. Treasury and agency securities5010.36 24,3961.26 8953.39 —— 25,7921.32Non-U.S. securities20,8130.95 2,0412.14 662.06 —— 22,9201.06Other taxable securities, substantially all asset-backed securities2,2251.39 4,9301.63 2,2032.87 7044.18 10,0622.03Total taxable securities23,9461.04 222,1672.14 37,9352.68 4,2927.78 288,3402.20Tax-exempt securities1,5400.76 5,8401.01 5,9931.50 1,9081.15 15,2811.20Total amortized cost of debt securities carried at fair value$25,4861.02 $228,0072.11 $43,9282.52 $6,2005.74 $303,6212.15Amortized cost of HTM debt securities (2)$—— $82,8032.06 $19,3802.67 $963.49 $102,2792.18               Debt securities carried at fair value              Mortgage-backed securities:              Agency$46  $184,891  $23,751  $—  $208,688 Agency-collateralized mortgage obligations98  8,743  926  —  9,767 Commercial87  1,169  10,141  —  11,397 Non-agency residential222  720  922  3,483  5,347 Total mortgage-backed securities453  195,523  35,740  3,483  235,199 U.S. Treasury and agency securities502  24,699  942  —  26,143 Non-U.S. securities20,824  2,053  66  —  22,943 Other taxable securities, substantially all asset-backed securities2,226  4,856  2,254  687  10,023 Total taxable securities24,005  227,131  39,002  4,170  294,308 Tax-exempt securities1,540  5,849  6,080  1,893  15,362 Total debt securities carried at fair value$25,545  $232,980  $45,082  $6,063  $309,670 Fair value of HTM debt securities (2)$—  $84,451  $19,829  $95  $104,375 (1) Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security at the end of the period, weighted based on the amortized cost of each security.

This amount is not included in the parenthetical disclosure of loans and leases pledged as collateral on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as there were no related outstanding borrowings.Following the realignment of its business segments effective April 1, 2016, the Corporation now categorizes consumer real estate loans as core and non-core on the basis of loan and customer characteristics such as origination date, product type, LTV, FICO score and delinquency status consistent with its current consumer and mortgage servicing strategy. Generally, loans that were originated after January 1, 2010, qualified under government-sponsored enterprise underwriting guidelines, or otherwise met the Corporation's underwriting guidelines in place in 2015 are characterized as core loans. Loans held in legacy private-label securitizations, government-insured loans originated prior to 2010, loan products no longer originated, and loans originated prior to 2010 and classified as nonperforming or modified in a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) prior to 2016 are generally characterized as non-core loans, and are principally run-off portfolios. Core loans as reported within this Note include loans held in the Consumer Banking and GWIM segments, as well as loans held for ALM activities in All Other. 140Table of ContentsThe Corporation has entered into long-term credit protection agreements with FNMA and FHLMC on loans totaling $5.1 billion and $3.7 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, providing full credit protection on residential mortgage loans that become severely delinquent. All of these loans are individually insured and therefore the Corporation does not record an allowance for credit losses related to these loans.Nonperforming Loans and LeasesThe Corporation classifies junior-lien home equity loans as nonperforming when the first-lien loan becomes 90 days past due even if the junior-lien loan is performing. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $449 million and $484 million of such junior-lien home equity loans were included in nonperforming loans.The Corporation classifies consumer real estate loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower as TDRs, irrespective of payment history or delinquency status, even if the repayment terms for the loan have not been otherwise modified. The Corporation continues to have a lien on the underlying collateral. At June 30, 2016, nonperforming loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy with no change in repayment terms were $682 million of which $402 million were current on their contractual payments, while $245 million were 90 days or more past due. Of the contractually current nonperforming loans, approximately 82 percent were discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy more than 12 months ago, and approximately 67 percent were discharged 24 months or more ago. As subsequent cash payments are received on these nonperforming loans that are contractually current, the interest component of the payments is generally recorded as interest income on a cash basis and the principal component is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the loan.During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Corporation sold nonperforming and other delinquent consumer real estate loans with a carrying value of $417 million and $1.4 billion, including $150 million and $324 million of PCI loans, compared to $1.0 billion and $1.9 billion, including $401 million and $987 million of PCI loans, for the same periods in 2015. The Corporation recorded net charge-offs of $5 million and $45 million related to these sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to net recoveries of $27 million and $67 million for the same periods in 2015. Gains related to these sales of $13 million and $44 million were recorded in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to gains of $40 million and $75 million for the same periods in 2015. 141Table of ContentsThe table below presents the Corporation's nonperforming loans and leases including nonperforming TDRs, and loans accruing past due 90 days or more at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Nonperforming LHFS are excluded from nonperforming loans and leases as they are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value.

For more information on the portfolio segments, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment, the primary credit quality indicators are refreshed LTV and refreshed FICO score. Refreshed LTV measures the carrying value of the loan as a percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. Home equity loans are evaluated using combined loan-to-value (CLTV) which measures the carrying value of the Corporation's loan and available line of credit combined with any outstanding senior liens against the property as a percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. FICO score measures the creditworthiness of the borrower based on the financial obligations of the borrower and the borrower's credit history. At a minimum, FICO scores are refreshed quarterly, and in many cases, more frequently. FICO scores are also a primary credit quality indicator for the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment and the business card portfolio within U.S. small business commercial. Within the Commercial portfolio segment, loans are evaluated using the internal classifications of pass rated or reservable criticized as the primary credit quality indicators. The term reservable criticized refers to those commercial loans that are internally classified or listed by the Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful, which are asset quality categories defined by regulatory authorities. These assets have an elevated level of risk and may have a high probability of default or total loss. Pass rated refers to all loans not considered reservable criticized. In addition to these primary credit quality indicators, the Corporation uses other credit quality indicators for certain types of loans. 142Table of ContentsThe following tables present certain credit quality indicators for the Corporation's Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio segments, by class of financing receivables, at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Consumer Real Estate – Credit Quality Indicators (1)       June 30, 2016(Dollars in millions)Core Portfolio Residential Mortgage (2)Non-core Residential Mortgage (2)ResidentialMortgage PCI (3)Core Portfolio Home Equity (2)Non-core Home Equity (2)Home Equity PCIRefreshed LTV (4)      Less than or equal to 90 percent$117,311$14,990$8,087$49,186$8,178$1,821Greater than 90 percent but less than or equal to 100 percent4,0361,8591,2151,6291,925741Greater than 100 percent2,3942,7671,8051,6624,8861,559Fully-insured loans (5)22,3599,120————Total consumer real estate$146,100$28,736$11,107$52,477$14,989$4,121Refreshed FICO score      Less than 620$2,789$3,716$3,177$1,276$3,040$617Greater than or equal to 620 and less than 6805,2783,1642,4373,0443,501735Greater than or equal to 680 and less than 74022,3724,9323,10311,0423,3321,210Greater than or equal to 74093,3027,8042,39037,1155,1161,559Fully-insured loans (5)22,3599,120————Total consumer real estate$146,100$28,736$11,107$52,477$14,989$4,121(1) Excludes $1.8 billion of loans accounted for under the fair value option.(2) Excludes PCI loans.(3) Includes $1.8 billion of pay option loans.

Impaired loans include nonperforming commercial loans and all consumer and commercial TDRs. Impaired loans exclude nonperforming consumer loans and nonperforming commercial leases unless they are classified as TDRs. Loans accounted for under the fair value option are also excluded. PCI loans are excluded and reported separately on page 157. For additional information, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Consumer Real EstateImpaired consumer real estate loans within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment consist entirely of TDRs. Excluding PCI loans, most modifications of consumer real estate loans meet the definition of TDRs when a binding offer is extended to a borrower. Modifications of consumer real estate loans are done in accordance with the government's Making Home Affordable Program (modifications under government programs) or the Corporation's proprietary programs (modifications under proprietary programs). These modifications are considered to be TDRs if concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Concessions may include reductions in interest rates, capitalization of past due amounts, principal and/or interest forbearance, payment extensions, principal and/or interest forgiveness, or combinations thereof.Prior to permanently modifying a loan, the Corporation may enter into trial modifications with certain borrowers under both government and proprietary programs. Trial modifications generally represent a three- to four-month period during which the borrower makes monthly payments under the anticipated modified payment terms. Upon successful completion of the trial period, the Corporation and the borrower enter into a permanent modification. Binding trial modifications are classified as TDRs when the trial offer is made and continue to be classified as TDRs regardless of whether the borrower enters into a permanent modification.Consumer real estate loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy with no change in repayment terms and not reaffirmed by the borrower of $1.6 billion were included in TDRs at June 30, 2016, of which $682 million were classified as nonperforming and $631 million were loans fully-insured by the FHA. For more information on loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, see Nonperforming Loans and Leases in this Note.A consumer real estate loan, excluding PCI loans which are reported separately, is not classified as impaired unless it is a TDR. Once such a loan has been designated as a TDR, it is then individually assessed for impairment. Consumer real estate TDRs are measured primarily based on the net present value of the estimated cash flows discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate, as discussed in the following paragraph. If the carrying value of a TDR exceeds this amount, a specific allowance is recorded as a component of the allowance for loan and lease losses. Alternatively, consumer real estate TDRs that are considered to be dependent solely on the collateral for repayment (e.g., due to the lack of income verification) are measured based on the estimated fair value of the collateral and a charge-off is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the collateral. Consumer real estate loans that reached 180 days past due prior to modification had been charged off to their net realizable value, less costs to sell, before they were modified as TDRs in accordance with established policy. Therefore, modifications of consumer real estate loans that are 180 or more days past due as TDRs do not have an impact on the allowance for loan and lease losses nor are additional charge-offs required at the time of modification. Subsequent declines in the fair value of the collateral after a loan has reached 180 days past due are recorded as charge-offs. Fully-insured loans are protected against principal loss, and therefore, the Corporation does not record an allowance for loan and lease losses on the outstanding principal balance, even after they have been modified in a TDR. 145Table of ContentsThe net present value of the estimated cash flows used to measure impairment is based on model-driven estimates of projected payments, prepayments, defaults and loss-given-default (LGD). Using statistical modeling methodologies, the Corporation estimates the probability that a loan will default prior to maturity based on the attributes of each loan. The factors that are most relevant to the probability of default are the refreshed LTV, or in the case of a subordinated lien, refreshed CLTV, borrower credit score, months since origination (i.e., vintage) and geography. Each of these factors is further broken down by present collection status (whether the loan is current, delinquent, in default or in bankruptcy). Severity (or LGD) is estimated based on the refreshed LTV for first mortgages or CLTV for subordinated liens. The estimates are based on the Corporation's historical experience as adjusted to reflect an assessment of environmental factors that may not be reflected in the historical data, such as changes in real estate values, local and national economies, underwriting standards and the regulatory environment. The probability of default models also incorporate recent experience with modification programs including redefaults subsequent to modification, a loan's default history prior to modification and the change in borrower payments post-modification.At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, remaining commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose terms have been modified in a consumer real estate TDR were immaterial. Consumer real estate foreclosed properties totaled $416 million and $444 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The carrying value of consumer real estate loans, including fully-insured and PCI loans, for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process as of June 30, 2016 was $4.7 billion. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Corporation reclassified $392 million and $808 million of consumer real estate loans to foreclosed properties or, for properties acquired upon foreclosure of certain government-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans), to other assets. This compared to reclassifications of $474 million and $1.1 billion for the same periods in 2015. The reclassifications represent non-cash investing activities and, accordingly, are not reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.The table below provides the unpaid principal balance, carrying value and related allowance at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and the average carrying value and interest income recognized for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 for impaired loans in the Corporation's Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment. Certain impaired consumer real estate loans do not have a related allowance as the current valuation of these impaired loans exceeded the carrying value, which is net of previously recorded charge-offs.Impaired Loans – Consumer Real Estate     June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions)    UnpaidPrincipalBalance CarryingValue RelatedAllowance UnpaidPrincipalBalance CarryingValue RelatedAllowanceWith no recorded allowance               Residential mortgage    $12,619 $9,929 $— $14,888 $11,901 $—Home equity    3,691 1,921 — 3,545 1,775 —With an allowance recorded               Residential mortgage    $5,281 $5,157 $296 $6,624 $6,471 $399Home equity    939 835 146 1,047 911 235Total               Residential mortgage    $17,900 $15,086 $296 $21,512 $18,372 $399Home equity    4,630 2,756 146 4,592 2,686 235                 Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 2016 2015 2016 2015 AverageCarryingValue InterestIncomeRecognized (1) AverageCarryingValue InterestIncomeRecognized (1) AverageCarryingValue InterestIncomeRecognized (1) AverageCarryingValue InterestIncomeRecognized (1)With no recorded allowance               Residential mortgage$10,345 $100 $14,401 $105 $10,925 $194 $14,897 $213Home equity1,870 17 1,805 20 1,843 30 1,748 45With an allowance recorded               Residential mortgage$5,387 $46 $7,706 $61 $5,737 $97 $7,646 $125Home equity873 5 744 5 882 11 729 12Total               Residential mortgage$15,732 $146 $22,107 $166 $16,662 $291 $22,543 $338Home equity2,743 22 2,549 25 2,725 41 2,477 57(1) Interest income recognized includes interest accrued and collected on the outstanding balances of accruing impaired loans as well as interest cash collections on nonaccruing impaired loans for which the principal is considered collectible. 146Table of ContentsThe table below presents the June 30, 2016 and 2015 unpaid principal balance, carrying value, and average pre- and post-modification interest rates on consumer real estate loans that were modified in TDRs during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, and net charge-offs recorded during the period in which the modification occurred.

and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 that were modified in a TDR during the 12 months preceding payment default. A payment default for consumer real estate TDRs is recognized when a borrower has missed three monthly payments (not necessarily consecutively) since modification. Payment defaults on a trial modification where the borrower has not yet met the terms of the agreement are included in the table below if the borrower is 90 days or more past due three months after the offer to modify is made.Consumer Real Estate – TDRs Entering Payment Default That Were Modified During the Preceding 12 Months Three Months Ended June 30, 2016(Dollars in millions) Residential Mortgage HomeEquity Total Carrying ValueModifications under government programs$85 $1 $86Modifications under proprietary programs35 5 40Loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy (1)31 6 37Trial modifications184 29 213Total modifications$335 $41 $376       Three Months Ended June 30, 2015Modifications under government programs$99 $1 $100Modifications under proprietary programs38 6 44Loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy (1)61 10 71Trial modifications (2)468 27 495Total modifications$666 $44 $710       Six Months Ended June 30, 2016Modifications under government programs$178 $1 $179Modifications under proprietary programs78 27 105Loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy (1)71 11 82Trial modifications421 66 487Total modifications$748 $105 $853       Six Months Ended June 30, 2015Modifications under government programs$206 $2 $208Modifications under proprietary programs78 18 96Loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy (1)132 20 152Trial modifications (2)2,236 51 2,287Total modifications$2,652 $91 $2,743(1) Includes loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy with no change in repayment terms that are classified as TDRs.(2) Includes $116 million and $1.5 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 of trial modification offers made in connection with the August 2014 U.S. Department of Justice settlement to which the customer did not respond.Credit Card and Other ConsumerImpaired loans within the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment consist entirely of loans that have been modified in TDRs (the renegotiated credit card and other consumer TDR portfolio, collectively referred to as the renegotiated TDR portfolio). The Corporation seeks to assist customers that are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying loans while ensuring compliance with federal, local and international laws and guidelines. Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months, all of which are considered TDRs. In addition, the accounts of non-U.S. credit card customers who do not qualify for a fixed payment plan may have their interest rates reduced, as required by certain local jurisdictions. These modifications, which are also TDRs, tend to experience higher payment default rates given that the borrowers may lack the ability to repay even with the interest rate reduction. In substantially all cases, the customer's available line of credit is canceled. The Corporation makes loan modifications directly with borrowers for debt held only by the Corporation (internal programs). Additionally, the Corporation makes loan modifications for borrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies that provide solutions to customers' entire unsecured debt structures (external programs). The Corporation classifies other secured consumer loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy as TDRs which are written down to collateral value and placed on  150Table of Contentsnonaccrual status no later than the time of discharge. For more information on the regulatory guidance on loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, see Nonperforming Loans and Leases in this Note.All credit card and substantially all other consumer loans that have been modified in TDRs remain on accrual status until the loan is either paid in full or charged off, which occurs no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due or generally at 120 days past due for a loan that has been placed on a fixed payment plan.The allowance for impaired credit card and substantially all other consumer loans is based on the present value of projected cash flows, which incorporates the Corporation's historical payment default and loss experience on modified loans, discounted using the portfolio's average contractual interest rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring. Credit card and other consumer loans are included in homogeneous pools which are collectively evaluated for impairment. For these portfolios, loss forecast models are utilized that consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, delinquency status, economic trends and credit scores.The table below provides the unpaid principal balance, carrying value and related allowance at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and the average carrying value and interest income recognized for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 on the Corporation's renegotiated TDR portfolio in the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment.Impaired Loans – Credit Card and Other

plan.Credit card and other consumer loans are deemed to be in payment default during the quarter in which a borrower misses the second of two consecutive payments. Payment defaults are one of the factors considered when projecting future cash flows in the calculation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for impaired credit card and other consumer loans. Based on historical experience, the Corporation estimates that 14 percent of new U.S. credit card TDRs, 89 percent of new non-U.S. credit card TDRs and 14 percent of new direct/indirect consumer TDRs may be in payment default within 12 months after modification. Loans that entered into payment default during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 that had been modified in a TDR during the preceding 12 months were $7 million and $16 million for U.S. credit card, $30 million and $64 million for non-U.S. credit card, and $1 million and $2 million for direct/indirect consumer. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, loans that entered into payment default that had been modified in a TDR during the preceding 12 months were $10 million and $22 million for U.S. credit card, $39 million and $80 million for non-U.S. credit card, and $1 million and $2 million for direct/indirect consumer.  153Table of ContentsCommercial LoansImpaired commercial loans, which include nonperforming loans and TDRs (both performing and nonperforming), are primarily measured based on the present value of payments expected to be received, discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate. Commercial impaired loans may also be measured based on observable market prices or, for loans that are solely dependent on the collateral for repayment, the estimated fair value of collateral, less costs to sell. If the carrying value of a loan exceeds this amount, a specific allowance is recorded as a component of the allowance for loan and lease losses.Modifications of loans to commercial borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty are designed to reduce the Corporation's loss exposure while providing the borrower with an opportunity to work through financial difficulties, often to avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy. Each modification is unique and reflects the individual circumstances of the borrower. Modifications that result in a TDR may include extensions of maturity at a concessionary (below market) rate of interest, payment forbearances or other actions designed to benefit the customer while mitigating the Corporation's risk exposure. Reductions in interest rates are rare. Instead, the interest rates are typically increased, although the increased rate may not represent a market rate of interest. Infrequently, concessions may also include principal forgiveness in connection with foreclosure, short sale or other settlement agreements leading to termination or sale of the loan.At the time of restructuring, the loans are remeasured to reflect the impact, if any, on projected cash flows resulting from the modified terms. If there was no forgiveness of principal and the interest rate was not decreased, the modification may have little or no impact on the allowance established for the loan. If a portion of the loan is deemed to be uncollectible, a charge-off may be recorded at the time of restructuring. Alternatively, a charge-off may have already been recorded in a previous period such that no charge-off is required at the time of modification. For more information on modifications for the U.S. small business commercial portfolio, see Credit Card and Other Consumer in this Note.At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, remaining commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose terms have been modified in a commercial loan TDR were immaterial. Commercial foreclosed properties totaled $19 million and $15 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 154Table of ContentsThe table below provides the unpaid principal balance, carrying value and related allowance at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and the average carrying value and interest income recognized for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 for impaired loans in the Corporation's Commercial loan portfolio segment. Certain impaired commercial loans do not have a related allowance as the valuation of these impaired loans exceeded the carrying value, which is net of previously recorded charge-offs.Impaired Loans – Commercial             June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions)    UnpaidPrincipalBalance CarryingValue RelatedAllowance UnpaidPrincipalBalance CarryingValue RelatedAllowanceWith no recorded allowance               U.S. commercial    $779 $771 $— $566 $541 $—Commercial real estate    53 53 — 82 77 —Non-U.S. commercial    29 29 — 4 4 —With an allowance recorded               U.S. commercial    $2,147 $1,731 $167 $1,350 $1,157 $115Commercial real estate    289 102 11 328 107 11Commercial lease financing    5 3 — — — —Non-U.S. commercial    493 329 31 531 381 56U.S. small business commercial (1)    96 84 29 105 101 35Total               U.S. commercial    $2,926 $2,502 $167 $1,916 $1,698 $115Commercial real estate    342 155 11 410 184 11Commercial lease financing    5 3 — — — —Non-U.S. commercial    522 358 31 535 385 56U.S. small business commercial (1)    96 84 29 105 101 35                 Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30 2016 2015 2016 2015 AverageCarryingValue InterestIncomeRecognized (2) AverageCarryingValue InterestIncomeRecognized (2) AverageCarryingValue InterestIncomeRecognized (2) AverageCarryingValue InterestIncomeRecognized (2)With no recorded allowance               U.S. commercial$656 $3 $710 $5 $619 $5 $669 $8Commercial real estate65 — 83 — 71 — 77 1Non-U.S. commercial17 — 34 1 11 — 19 1With an allowance recorded               U.S. commercial$1,646 $16 $904 $12 $1,544 $30 $862 $25Commercial real estate96 1 232 2 100 2 282 5Commercial lease financing1 — — — 1 — — —Non-U.S. commercial349 3 118 — 359 6 92 1U.S. small business commercial (1)92 — 108 — 97 — 114 —Total               U.S. commercial$2,302 $19 $1,614 $17 $2,163 $35 $1,531 $33Commercial real estate161 1 315 2 171 2 359 6Commercial lease financing1 — — — 1 — — —Non-U.S. commercial366 3 152 1 370 6 111 2U.S. small business commercial (1)92 — 108 — 97 — 114 —(1) Includes U.S. small business commercial renegotiated TDR loans and related allowance.(2) Interest income recognized includes interest accrued and collected on the outstanding balances of accruing impaired loans as well as interest cash collections on nonaccruing impaired loans for which the principal is considered collectible. 155Table of ContentsThe table below presents the June 30, 2016 and 2015 unpaid principal balance and carrying value of commercial loans that were modified as TDRs during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, and net charge-offs that were recorded during the period in which the modification occurred.

U.S. small business commercial TDRs are deemed to be in payment default during the quarter in which a borrower misses the second of two consecutive payments. Payment defaults are one of the factors considered when projecting future cash flows, along with observable market prices or fair value of collateral when measuring the allowance for loan and lease losses. TDRs that were in payment default had a carrying value of $90 million and $132 million for U.S. commercial and $17 million and $28 million for commercial real estate at June 30, 2016 and 2015. 156Table of ContentsPurchased Credit-impaired LoansThe table below shows activity for the accretable yield on PCI loans, which include the Countrywide Financial Corporation (Countrywide) portfolio and loans repurchased in connection with the 2013 settlement with FNMA. The amount of accretable yield is affected by changes in credit outlooks, including metrics such as default rates and loss severities, prepayment speeds, which can change the amount and period of time over which interest payments are expected to be received, and the interest rates on variable rate loans. The reclassifications from nonaccretable difference in the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 were primarily due to an increase in the expected principal and interest cash flows due to lower default estimates.Rollforward of Accretable Yield  (Dollars in millions)Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Six Months Ended June 30, 2016Accretable yield, beginning of period$4,250 $4,569Accretion(185) (377)Disposals/transfers(124) (235)Reclassifications from nonaccretable difference101 85Accretable yield, June 30, 2016$4,042 $4,042During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Corporation sold PCI loans with a carrying value of $150 million and $324 million, which excludes the related allowance of $19 million and $39 million.

Write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio totaled $82 million and $187 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $290 million and $578 million for the same periods in 2015. Write-offs included $19 million and $39 million associated with the sale of PCI loans during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $65 million and $175 million for the same periods in 2015. The valuation allowance associated with the PCI loan portfolio was $528 million and $804 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.The table below presents the allowance and the carrying value of outstanding loans and leases by portfolio segment at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Allowance and Carrying Value by Portfolio Segment        June 30, 2016(Dollars in millions)Consumer Real Estate Credit Cardand OtherConsumer Commercial TotalImpaired loans and troubled debt restructurings (1)       Allowance for loan and lease losses (2)$442 $189 $238 $869Carrying value (3)17,842 672 3,102 21,616Allowance as a percentage of carrying value2.48% 28.13% 7.67% 4.02%Loans collectively evaluated for impairment       Allowance for loan and lease losses$2,239 $3,145 $5,056 $10,440Carrying value (3, 4)224,460 191,841 441,348 857,649Allowance as a percentage of carrying value (4)1.00% 1.64% 1.15% 1.22%Purchased credit-impaired loans       Valuation allowance$528 n/a n/a $528Carrying value gross of valuation allowance15,228 n/a n/a 15,228Valuation allowance as a percentage of carrying value3.47% n/a n/a 3.47%Total       Allowance for loan and lease losses$3,209 $3,334 $5,294 $11,837Carrying value (3, 4)257,530 192,513 444,450 894,493Allowance as a percentage of carrying value (4)1.25% 1.73% 1.19% 1.32%         December 31, 2015Impaired loans and troubled debt restructurings (1)       Allowance for loan and lease losses (2)$634 $250 $217 $1,101Carrying value (3)21,058 779 2,368 24,205Allowance as a percentage of carrying value3.01% 32.09% 9.16% 4.55%Loans collectively evaluated for impairment       Allowance for loan and lease losses$2,476 $3,221 $4,632 $10,329Carrying value (3, 4)226,116 189,660 433,379 849,155Allowance as a percentage of carrying value (4)1.10% 1.70% 1.07% 1.22%Purchased credit-impaired loans       Valuation allowance$804 n/a n/a $804Carrying value gross of valuation allowance16,685 n/a n/a 16,685Valuation allowance as a percentage of carrying value4.82% n/a n/a 4.82%Total       Allowance for loan and lease losses$3,914 $3,471 $4,849 $12,234Carrying value (3, 4)263,859 190,439 435,747 890,045Allowance as a percentage of carrying value (4)1.48% 1.82% 1.11% 1.37%(1) Impaired loans include nonperforming commercial loans and all TDRs, including both commercial and consumer TDRs.

The Corporation routinely securitizes loans and debt securities using VIEs as a source of funding for the Corporation and as a means of transferring the economic risk of the loans or debt securities to third parties. The assets are transferred into a trust or other securitization vehicle such that the assets are legally isolated from the creditors of the Corporation and are not available to satisfy its obligations. These assets can only be used to settle obligations of the trust or other securitization vehicle. The Corporation also administers, structures or invests in other VIEs including CDOs, investment vehicles and other entities. For more information on the Corporation's utilization of VIEs, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 6 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The tables in this Note present the assets and liabilities of consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, in situations where the Corporation has continuing involvement with transferred assets or if the Corporation otherwise has a variable interest in the VIE. The tables also present the Corporation's maximum loss exposure at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 resulting from its involvement with consolidated VIEs and unconsolidated VIEs in which the Corporation holds a variable interest. The Corporation's maximum loss exposure is based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and incorporates not only potential losses associated with assets recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but also potential losses associated with off-balance sheet commitments such as unfunded liquidity commitments and other contractual arrangements. The Corporation's maximum loss exposure does not include losses previously recognized through write-downs of assets. As a result of new accounting guidance issued by the FASB, which was effective on January 1, 2016, the Corporation identified certain limited partnerships and similar entities that are now considered to be VIEs and are included in the unconsolidated VIE tables in this Note at June 30, 2016. The Corporation had a maximum loss exposure of $4.6 billion related to these VIEs, which had total assets of $12.9 billion.The Corporation invests in asset-backed securities (ABS) issued by third-party VIEs with which it has no other form of involvement and enters into certain commercial lending arrangements that may also incorporate the use of VIEs to hold collateral. These securities and loans are included in Note 3 – Securities or Note 4 – Outstanding Loans and Leases. In addition, the Corporation uses VIEs such as trust preferred securities trusts in connection with its funding activities. For additional information, see Note 11 – Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Corporation uses VIEs, such as common trust funds managed within GWIM, to provide investment opportunities for clients. These VIEs, which are generally not consolidated by the Corporation, as applicable, are not included in the tables in this Note.Except as described below and in Note 6 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Corporation did not provide financial support to consolidated or unconsolidated VIEs during the six months ended June 30, 2016 or the year ended December 31, 2015 that it was not previously contractually required to provide, nor does it intend to do so.First-lien Mortgage SecuritizationsFirst-lien MortgagesAs part of its mortgage banking activities, the Corporation securitizes a portion of the first-lien residential mortgage loans it originates or purchases from third parties, generally in the form of RMBS guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises, FNMA and FHLMC (collectively the GSEs), or Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) primarily in the case of FHA-insured and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed mortgage loans. Securitization usually occurs in conjunction with or shortly after origination or purchase and the Corporation may also securitize loans held in its residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, the Corporation may, from time to time, securitize commercial mortgages it originates or purchases from other entities. The Corporation typically services the loans it securitizes. Further, the Corporation may retain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts including senior and subordinate securities and equity tranches issued by the trusts. Except as described below and in Note 7 – Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees, the Corporation does not provide guarantees or recourse to the securitization trusts other than standard representations and warranties. 160Table of ContentsThe table below summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage securitizations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.First-lien Mortgage Securitizations   Three Months Ended June 30 Residential Mortgage   Agency Commercial Mortgage(Dollars in millions)20162015 20162015Cash proceeds from new securitizations (1)$4,375$5,619 $732$2,732Gain (loss) on securitizations (2)70184 (6)39       Six Months Ended June 30 20162015 20162015Cash proceeds from new securitizations (1)$11,449$12,953 $1,979$4,888Gain (loss) on securitizations (2)233357 (9)32(1) The Corporation transfers residential mortgage loans to securitizations sponsored by the GSEs or GNMA in the normal course of business and receives RMBS in exchange which may then be sold into the market to third-party investors for cash proceeds.(2) A majority of the first-lien residential and commercial mortgage loans securitized are initially classified as LHFS and accounted for under the fair value option. Gains recognized on these LHFS prior to securitization, which totaled $92 million and $200 million, net of hedges, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $262 million and $431 million for the same periods in 2015, are not included in the table above.In addition to cash proceeds as reported in the table above, the Corporation received securities with an initial fair value of $1.0 billion and $1.9 billion in connection with first-lien mortgage securitizations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $7.3 billion and $13.0 billion for the same periods in 2015. The receipt of these securities represents non-cash operating and investing activities and, accordingly, is not reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. All of these securities were initially classified as Level 2 assets within the fair value hierarchy. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no changes to the initial classification.The Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization of first-lien mortgage loans. Servicing fee and ancillary fee income on consumer mortgage loans serviced, including securitizations where the Corporation has continuing involvement, were $292 million and $588 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $353 million and $741 million for the same periods in 2015. Servicing advances on consumer mortgage loans, including securitizations where the Corporation has continuing involvement, were $7.0 billion and $7.8 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Corporation may have the option to repurchase delinquent loans out of securitization trusts, which reduces the amount of servicing advances it is required to make. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, $645 million and $1.4 billion of loans were repurchased from first-lien securitization trusts primarily as a result of loan delinquencies or to perform modifications compared to $775 million and $1.9 billion for the same periods in 2015. The majority of these loans repurchased were FHA-insured mortgages collateralizing GNMA securities. For more information on MSRs, see Note 17 – Mortgage Servicing Rights.During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Corporation deconsolidated agency residential mortgage securitization vehicles with total assets of $42 million and $2.8 billion following the sale of retained interests to third parties, after which the Corporation no longer had the unilateral ability to liquidate the vehicles. Gains on sale of $1 million and $114 million were recorded in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. 161Table of ContentsThe table below summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage securitization trusts in which the Corporation held a variable interest at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.First-lien Mortgage VIEs        Residential Mortgage      Non-agency   Agency Prime Subprime Alt-A Commercial Mortgage(Dollars in millions)June 30 2016December 31 2015 June 30 2016December 31 2015 June 30 2016December 31 2015 June 30 2016December 31 2015 June 30 2016December 31 2015Unconsolidated VIEs              Maximum loss exposure (1)$25,595$28,188 $854$1,027 $2,681$2,905 $564$622 $327$326On-balance sheet assets              Senior securities held (2):              Trading account assets$1,137$1,297 $21$42 $67$94 $107$99 $29$59Debt securities carried at fair value20,47624,369 517613 2,2882,479 313340 ——Held-to-maturity securities3,9682,507 —— —— —— 3837Subordinate securities held (2):              Trading account assets—— 11 4037 12 3222Debt securities carried at fair value—— 912 23 2628 5454Held-to-maturity securities—— —— —— —— 1313Residual interests held—— —— 6— —— 2748All other assets (3)1415 3340 —— 117153 ——Total retained positions$25,595$28,188 $581$708 $2,403$2,613 $564$622 $193$233Principal balance outstanding (4)$296,116$313,613 $14,548$16,087 $25,329$27,854 $37,861$40,848 $26,205$34,243               Consolidated VIEs              Maximum loss exposure (1)$21,246$26,878 $52$65 $181$232 $—$— $—$—On-balance sheet assets              Trading account assets$402$1,101 $—$— $—$188 $—$— $—$—Loans and leases (5)20,38625,328 83111 608675 —— ——All other assets459449 3— 4554 —— ——Total assets$21,247$26,878 $86$111 $653$917 $—$— $—$—On-balance sheet liabilities              Long-term debt$1$— $34$46 $623$840 $—$— $—$—All other liabilities31 —— —— —— ——Total liabilities$4$1 $34$46 $623$840 $—$— $—$—(1) Maximum loss exposure includes obligations under loss-sharing reinsurance and other arrangements for non-agency residential mortgage and commercial mortgage securitizations, but excludes the liability for representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees and also excludes servicing advances and other servicing rights and obligations.

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no OTTI losses recorded on those securities classified as AFS debt securities.(3) Not included in the table above are all other assets of $214 million and $222 million, representing the unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans eligible for repurchase from unconsolidated residential mortgage securitization vehicles, principally guaranteed by GNMA, and all other liabilities of $214 million and $222 million, representing the principal amount that would be payable to the securitization vehicles if the Corporation was to exercise the repurchase option, at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.(4) Principal balance outstanding includes loans the Corporation transferred with which it has continuing involvement, which may include servicing the loans.(5) Balance at June 30, 2016 includes $691 million from consolidated collateralized financing entities that were measured using the fair value of the financial liabilities of those entities as the measurement basis. 162Table of ContentsOther Asset-backed SecuritizationsThe table below summarizes select information related to home equity loan, credit card and other asset-backed VIEs in which the Corporation held a variable interest at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Home Equity Loan, Credit Card and Other Asset-backed VIEs        Home Equity Loan (1) Credit Card (2, 3) Resecuritization Trusts Municipal Bond Trusts Automobile and Other Securitization Trusts(Dollars in millions)June 30 2016December 31 2015 June 30 2016December 31 2015 June 30 2016December 31 2015 June 30 2016December 31 2015 June 30 2016December 31 2015Unconsolidated VIEs              Maximum loss exposure$3,585$3,988 $—$— $11,460$13,043 $1,508$1,572 $50$63On-balance sheet assets              Senior securities held (4, 5):              Trading account assets$—$— $—$— $1,496$1,248 $11$2 $—$—Debt securities carried at fair value5157 —— 2,8354,341 —— 5053Held-to-maturity securities—— —— 7,0087,367 —— ——Subordinate securities held (4, 5):              Trading account assets—— —— 5117 —— ——Debt securities carried at fair value—— —— 7070 —— ——All other assets—— —— —— —— —10Total retained positions$51$57 $—$— $11,460$13,043 $11$2 $50$63Total assets of VIEs (6)$5,325$5,883 $—$— $36,190$35,362 $2,286$2,518 $184$314               Consolidated VIEs              Maximum loss exposure$176$231 $25,708$32,678 $224$354 $1,860$1,973 $—$—On-balance sheet assets              Trading account assets$—$— $—$— $616$771 $1,862$1,984 $—$—Loans and leases284321 35,58743,194 —— —— ——Allowance for loan and lease losses(17)(18) (1,101)(1,293) —— —— ——All other assets820 287342 —— 181 ——Total assets$275$323 $34,773$42,243 $616$771 $1,880$1,985 $—$—On-balance sheet liabilities              Short-term borrowings$—$— $—$— $—$— $639$681 $—$—Long-term debt140183 9,0449,550 392417 1212 ——All other liabilities—— 2115 —— 8— ——Total liabilities$140$183 $9,065$9,565 $392$417 $659$693 $—$—(1) For unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs, the maximum loss exposure includes outstanding trust certificates issued by trusts in rapid amortization, net of recorded reserves. For both consolidated and unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs, the maximum loss exposure excludes the liability for representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees. For additional information, see Note 7 – Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees.(2) At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, loans and leases in the consolidated credit card trust included $17.9 billion and $24.7 billion of seller's interest.(3) At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, all other assets in the consolidated credit card trust included restricted cash, certain short-term investments, and unbilled accrued interest and fees.(4) As a holder of these securities, the Corporation receives scheduled principal and interest payments. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no OTTI losses recorded on those securities classified as AFS or HTM debt securities.(5) The retained senior and subordinate securities were valued using quoted market prices or observable market inputs (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy).(6) Total assets include loans the Corporation transferred with which the Corporation has continuing involvement, which may include servicing the loan.Home Equity LoansThe Corporation retains interests in home equity securitization trusts to which it transferred home equity loans. These retained interests include senior and subordinate securities and residual interests. In addition, the Corporation may be obligated to provide subordinate funding to the trusts during a rapid amortization event. The Corporation typically services the loans in the trusts. Except as described below and in Note 7 – Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees, the Corporation does not provide guarantees or recourse to the securitization trusts other than standard representations and warranties. There were no securitizations of home equity loans during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, and all of the home equity trusts that hold revolving home equity lines of credit have entered the rapid amortization phase.The maximum loss exposure in the table above includes the Corporation's obligation to provide subordinate funding to the consolidated and unconsolidated home equity loan securitizations that have entered the rapid amortization phase. During this period, cash payments from borrowers are accumulated to repay outstanding debt securities and the Corporation continues to make advances to borrowers when  163Table of Contentsthey draw on their lines of credit. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, home equity loan securitizations in rapid amortization for which the Corporation has a subordinate funding obligation, including both consolidated and unconsolidated trusts, had $3.6 billion and $4.0 billion of trust certificates outstanding. This amount is significantly greater than the amount the Corporation expects to fund. The charges that will ultimately be recorded as a result of the rapid amortization events depend on the undrawn available credit on the home equity lines, which totaled $5 million and $7 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, as well as performance of the loans, the amount of subsequent draws and the timing of related cash flows.Credit Card SecuritizationsThe Corporation securitizes originated and purchased credit card loans. The Corporation's continuing involvement with the securitization trust includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided interest (seller's interest) in the receivables, and holding certain retained interests including senior and subordinate securities, subordinate interests in accrued interest and fees on the securitized receivables, and cash reserve accounts. The seller's interest in the trust, which is pari passu to the investors' interest, is classified in loans and leases.For both the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, $750 million of new senior debt securities were issued to third-party investors from the credit card securitization trust compared to $1.2 billion and $2.3 billion for the same periods in 2015.The Corporation held subordinate securities issued by the credit card securitization trust with a notional principal amount of $7.5 billion at both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. These securities serve as a form of credit enhancement to the senior debt securities and have a stated interest rate of zero percent. There were $121 million of these subordinate securities issued for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $194 million and $371 million for the same periods in 2015.Resecuritization TrustsThe Corporation transfers existing securities, typically MBS, into resecuritization vehicles at the request of customers seeking securities with specific characteristics. The Corporation may also resecuritize securities within its investment portfolio for purposes of improving liquidity and capital, and managing credit or interest rate risk. Generally, there are no significant ongoing activities performed in a resecuritization trust and no single investor has the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust.The Corporation resecuritized $8.1 billion and $14.7 billion of securities during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $6.9 billion and $13.0 billion for the same periods in 2015. There were no resecuritizations of AFS debt securities during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. Other securities transferred into resecuritization vehicles during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 were measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in trading account profits or other income prior to the resecuritization and no gain or loss on sale was recorded. Resecuritization proceeds included securities with an initial fair value of $1.1 billion and $2.2 billion during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $973 million and $1.6 billion for the same periods in 2015. All of these securities were classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Municipal Bond TrustsThe Corporation administers municipal bond trusts that hold highly-rated, long-term, fixed-rate municipal bonds. The trusts obtain financing by issuing floating-rate trust certificates that reprice on a weekly or other short-term basis to third-party investors. The Corporation may transfer assets into the trusts and may also serve as remarketing agent and/or liquidity provider for the trusts. The floating-rate investors have the right to tender the certificates at specified dates. Should the Corporation be unable to remarket the tendered certificates, it may be obligated to purchase them at par under standby liquidity facilities. The Corporation also provides credit enhancement to investors in certain municipal bond trusts whereby the Corporation guarantees the payment of interest and principal on floating-rate certificates issued by these trusts in the event of default by the issuer of the underlying municipal bond.The Corporation's liquidity commitments to unconsolidated municipal bond trusts, including those for which the Corporation was transferor, totaled $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The weighted-average remaining life of bonds held in the trusts at June 30, 2016 was 6.9 years. There were no material write-downs or downgrades of assets or issuers during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.Automobile and Other Securitization TrustsThe Corporation transfers automobile and other loans into securitization trusts, typically to improve liquidity or manage credit risk. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Corporation serviced assets or otherwise had continuing involvement with automobile and other securitization trusts with outstanding balances of $184 million and $314 million, including trusts collateralized by other loans of $184 million and $189 million, and automobile loans of $0 and $125 million. 164Table of ContentsOther Variable Interest EntitiesThe table below summarizes select information related to other VIEs in which the Corporation held a variable interest at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Other VIEs            June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions)Consolidated Unconsolidated Total Consolidated Unconsolidated TotalMaximum loss exposure$6,876 $17,244 $24,120 $6,295 $12,916 $19,211On-balance sheet assets           Trading account assets$3,060 $466 $3,526 $2,300 $366 $2,666Debt securities carried at fair value— 101 101 — 126 126Loans and leases3,436 3,331 6,767 3,317 3,389 6,706Allowance for loan and lease losses(10) (28) (38) (9) (23) (32)Loans held-for-sale256 631 887 284 1,025 1,309All other assets635 11,143 11,778 664 6,925 7,589Total$7,377 $15,644 $23,021 $6,556 $11,808 $18,364On-balance sheet liabilities           Long-term debt (1)$1,217 $— $1,217 $3,025 $— $3,025All other liabilities3 2,595 2,598 5 2,697 2,702Total$1,220 $2,595 $3,815 $3,030 $2,697 $5,727Total assets of VIEs$7,377 $63,585 $70,962 $6,556 $49,190 $55,746(1)Includes $719 million and $2.8 billion of long-term debt at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 issued by other consolidated VIEs, which has recourse to the general credit of the Corporation.Customer VehiclesCustomer vehicles include credit-linked, equity-linked and commodity-linked note vehicles, repackaging vehicles, and asset acquisition vehicles, which are typically created on behalf of customers who wish to obtain market or credit exposure to a specific company, index, commodity or financial instrument. The Corporation may transfer assets to and invest in securities issued by these vehicles. The Corporation typically enters into credit, equity, interest rate, commodity or foreign currency derivatives to synthetically create or alter the investment profile of the issued securities.The Corporation's maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated customer vehicles totaled $4.2 billion and $3.9 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, including the notional amount of derivatives to which the Corporation is a counterparty, net of losses previously recorded, and the Corporation's investment, if any, in securities issued by the vehicles. The maximum loss exposure has not been reduced to reflect the benefit of offsetting swaps with the customers or collateral arrangements. The Corporation also had liquidity commitments, including written put options and collateral value guarantees, with certain unconsolidated vehicles of $693 million and $691 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, that are included in the table above.Collateralized Debt Obligation VehiclesThe Corporation receives fees for structuring CDO vehicles, which hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities, typically corporate debt or ABS, which the CDO vehicles fund by issuing multiple tranches of debt and equity securities. Synthetic CDOs enter into a portfolio of CDS to synthetically create exposure to fixed-income securities. CLOs, which are a subset of CDOs, hold pools of loans, typically corporate loans. CDOs are typically managed by third-party portfolio managers. The Corporation typically transfers assets to these CDOs, holds securities issued by the CDOs and may be a derivative counterparty to the CDOs, including a CDS counterparty for synthetic CDOs. The Corporation has also entered into total return swaps with certain CDOs whereby the Corporation absorbs the economic returns generated by specified assets held by the CDO.The Corporation's maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated CDOs totaled $780 million and $543 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. This exposure is calculated on a gross basis and does not reflect any benefit from insurance purchased from third parties.At June 30, 2016, the Corporation had $179 million of aggregate liquidity exposure, included in the Other VIEs table net of previously recorded losses, to unconsolidated CDOs which hold senior CDO debt securities or other debt securities on the Corporation's behalf. For additional information, see Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies. 165Table of ContentsInvestment VehiclesThe Corporation sponsors, invests in or provides financing, which may be in connection with the sale of assets, to a variety of investment vehicles that hold loans, real estate, debt securities or other financial instruments and are designed to provide the desired investment profile to investors or the Corporation. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Corporation's consolidated investment vehicles had total assets of $727 million and $397 million. The Corporation also held investments in unconsolidated vehicles with total assets of $18.3 billion and $14.7 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Corporation's maximum loss exposure associated with both consolidated and unconsolidated investment vehicles totaled $5.7 billion and $5.1 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 comprised primarily of on-balance sheet assets less non-recourse liabilities.In prior periods, the Corporation transferred servicing advance receivables to independent third parties in connection with the sale of MSRs. Portions of the receivables were transferred into unconsolidated securitization trusts. The Corporation retained senior interests in such receivables with a maximum loss exposure and funding obligation of $150 million and $150 million, including a funded balance of $99 million and $122 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, which were classified in other debt securities carried at fair value.Leveraged Lease TrustsThe Corporation's net investment in consolidated leveraged lease trusts totaled $2.7 billion and $2.8 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The trusts hold long-lived equipment such as rail cars, power generation and distribution equipment, and commercial aircraft. The Corporation structures the trusts and holds a significant residual interest. The net investment represents the Corporation's maximum loss exposure to the trusts in the unlikely event that the leveraged lease investments become worthless. Debt issued by the leveraged lease trusts is non-recourse to the Corporation.Tax Credit VehiclesThe Corporation holds investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships and similar entities that construct, own and operate affordable housing, wind and solar projects. An unrelated third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the vehicle. The Corporation earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure included in the table above was $10.7 billion at June 30, 2016 which includes the impact of the adoption of the new accounting guidance on determining whether limited partnerships and similar entities are VIEs. The maximum loss exposure included in the table above was $6.5 billion at December 31, 2015 which primarily relates to affordable housing. The Corporation's risk of loss is generally mitigated by policies requiring that the project qualify for the expected tax credits prior to making its investment. The Corporation's investments in affordable housing partnerships, which are reported in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, totaled $6.9 billion and $7.1 billion, including unfunded commitments to provide capital contributions of $2.2 billion and $2.4 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The unfunded commitments are expected to be paid over the next five years. The Corporation recognized tax credits and other tax benefits from investments in affordable housing partnerships of $289 million and $482 million, and reported pretax losses in other noninterest income of $198 million and $396 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016. For the same periods in 2015, the Corporation recognized tax credits and other benefits of $271 million and $488 million, and pretax losses of $175 million and $355 million. Tax credits are recognized as part of the Corporation's annual effective tax rate, used to determine tax expense in a given quarter. This has resulted in the recognition in the six months ended June 30, 2016 of less than 50 percent of the expected tax benefits for the full year 2016. The Corporation may from time to time be asked to invest additional amounts to support a troubled affordable housing project. Such additional investments have not been and are not expected to be significant. 166Table of ContentsNOTE 7 – Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees BackgroundThe Corporation securitizes first-lien residential mortgage loans generally in the form of RMBS guaranteed by the GSEs or by GNMA in the case of FHA-insured, VA-guaranteed and Rural Housing Service-guaranteed mortgage loans, and sells pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans in the form of whole loans. In addition, in prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans. In connection with these transactions, the Corporation or certain of its subsidiaries or legacy companies made various representations and warranties. These representations and warranties, as set forth in the agreements, related to, among other things, the ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing the loan, the absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property securing the loan, the process used to select the loan for inclusion in a transaction, the loan's compliance with any applicable loan criteria, including underwriting standards, and the loan's compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws. Breaches of these representations and warranties have resulted in and may continue to result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage loans or to otherwise make whole or provide other remedies to investors, guarantors, insurers or other parties (collectively, repurchases).The liability for representations and warranties exposures and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss are based upon currently available information, significant judgment, and a number of factors and assumptions, including those discussed in Liability for Representations and Warranties and Corporate Guarantees and Estimated Range of Possible Loss in this Note, that are subject to change. Changes to any one of these factors could significantly impact the liability for representations and warranties exposures and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss and could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation's results of operations for any particular period.Settlement ActionsThe Corporation has vigorously contested any request for repurchase where it has concluded that a valid basis for repurchase does not exist and will continue to do so in the future. However, in an effort to resolve legacy mortgage-related issues, the Corporation has reached bulk settlements, certain of which have been for significant amounts, in lieu of a loan-by-loan review process, including settlements with the GSEs, four monoline insurers and Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon), as trustee for certain securitization trusts. These bulk settlements generally did not cover all transactions with the relevant counterparties or all potential claims that may arise, including in some instances securities law, fraud and servicing claims, which may be addressed separately. The Corporation's liability in connection with the transactions and claims not covered by these settlements could be material to the Corporation's results of operations or liquidity for any particular reporting period. The Corporation may reach other settlements in the future if opportunities arise on terms it believes to be advantageous. However, there can be no assurance that the Corporation will reach future settlements or, if it does, that the terms of past settlements can be relied upon to predict the terms of future settlements.Unresolved Repurchase ClaimsUnresolved representations and warranties repurchase claims represent the notional amount of repurchase claims made by counterparties, typically the outstanding principal balance or the unpaid principal balance at the time of default. In the case of first-lien mortgages, the claim amount is often significantly greater than the expected loss amount due to the benefit of collateral and, in some cases, mortgage insurance (MI) or mortgage guarantee payments. Claims received from a counterparty remain outstanding until the underlying loan is repurchased, the claim is rescinded by the counterparty, the Corporation determines that the applicable statute of limitations has expired, or representations and warranties claims with respect to the applicable trust are settled, and fully and finally released. The Corporation does not include duplicate claims in the amounts disclosed. 167Table of ContentsThe table below presents unresolved repurchase claims at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The unresolved repurchase claims include only claims where the Corporation believes that the counterparty has the contractual right to submit claims. The unresolved repurchase claims predominantly relate to subprime and pay option first-lien loans, and home equity loans. For additional information, see Private-label Securitizations and Whole-loan Sales Experience in this Note and Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Unresolved Repurchase Claims by Counterparty, net of duplicate claims   (Dollars in millions)June 30 2016 December 31 2015By counterparty    Private-label securitization trustees, whole-loan investors, including third-party securitization sponsors and other (1)$16,720 $16,748Monolines1,591 1,599GSEs8 17Total unresolved repurchase claims by counterparty, net of duplicate claims $18,319 $18,364(1) Includes $11.9 billion of claims based on individual file reviews and $4.8 billion of claims submitted without individual file reviews at both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Corporation received $542 million and $594 million in new repurchase claims, including $439 million and $440 million that are deemed time-barred. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, $528 million and $639 million in claims were resolved, including $476 million and $477 million that are deemed time-barred. Of the remaining unresolved monoline claims, substantially all of the claims pertain to second-lien loans and are currently the subject of litigation with a single monoline insurer. There may be additional claims or file requests in the future.In addition to the unresolved repurchase claims in the Unresolved Repurchase Claims by Counterparty, net of duplicate claims table, the Corporation has received notifications from sponsors of third-party securitizations with whom the Corporation engaged in whole-loan transactions indicating that the Corporation may have indemnity obligations with respect to loans for which the Corporation has not received a repurchase request. These outstanding notifications totaled $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.The presence of repurchase claims on a given trust, receipt of notices of indemnification obligations and receipt of other communications, as discussed above, are among the factors that inform the Corporation's liability for representations and warranties and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss.Experience with Government-sponsored Enterprises and Monoline InsurersAs a result of various bulk settlements with the GSEs, the Corporation has resolved substantially all outstanding and potential representations and warranties repurchase claims on whole loans sold by legacy Bank of America and Countrywide to FNMA and FHLMC through June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2009, respectively. As of June 30, 2016, the notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims submitted by the GSEs for loans originated prior to 2009 was $7 million.For a description of the Corporation's experience with monoline insurers, see Note 7 – Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees and Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Private-label Securitizations and Whole-loan Sales ExperiencePrior to 2009, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans. In connection with these transactions, the Corporation or certain of its subsidiaries or legacy companies made various representations and warranties. When the Corporation provided representations and warranties in connection with the sale of whole loans, the whole-loan investors may retain the right to make repurchase claims even when the loans were aggregated with other collateral into private-label securitizations sponsored by the whole-loan investors. In other third-party securitizations, the whole-loan investors' rights to enforce the representations and warranties were transferred to the securitization trustees. Private-label securitization investors generally do not have the contractual right to demand repurchase of loans directly or the right to access loan files directly. 168Table of ContentsAt both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, for loans originated between 2004 and 2008, the notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims submitted by private-label securitization trustees, whole-loan investors, including third-party securitization sponsors, and others was $16.7 billion. The notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims at both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 included $3.5 billion of claims related to loans in specific private-label securitization groups or tranches where the Corporation owns substantially all of the outstanding securities.The notional amount of outstanding unresolved repurchase claims remained relatively unchanged for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015. Outstanding repurchase claims remained unresolved primarily due to (1) the level of detail, support and analysis accompanying such claims, which impact overall claim quality and, therefore, claims resolution, and (2) the lack of an established process to resolve disputes related to these claims.The Corporation reviews properly presented repurchase claims on a loan-by-loan basis. For time-barred claims, the counterparty is informed that the claim is denied on the basis of the statute of limitations and the claim is treated as resolved. For timely claims, if the Corporation, after review, does not believe a claim is valid, it will deny the claim and generally indicate a reason for the denial. If the counterparty agrees with the Corporation's denial of the claim, the counterparty may rescind the claim. If there is disagreement as to the resolution of the claim, meaningful dialogue and negotiation between the parties are generally necessary to reach a resolution on an individual claim. When a claim is denied and the Corporation does not hear from the counterparty for six months, the Corporation views the claim as inactive; however, such claims remain in the outstanding claims balance until resolution. In the case of private-label securitization trustees and third-party sponsors, there is currently no established process in place for the parties to reach a conclusion on an individual loan if there is a disagreement on the resolution of the claim. The Corporation has performed an initial review with respect to substantially all outstanding claims and, although the Corporation does not believe a valid basis for repurchase has been established by the claimant, it considers such claims activity in the computation of its liability for representations and warranties.Liability for Representations and Warranties and Corporate Guarantees and Estimated Range of Possible LossThe liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related provision is included in mortgage banking income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The liability for representations and warranties is established when those obligations are both probable and reasonably estimable.The Corporation's representations and warranties liability and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss at June 30, 2016 considers, among other things, the repurchase experience implied in the settlement with BNY Mellon. Since the securitization trusts that were included in the settlement with BNY Mellon differ from other securitization trusts where the possibility of timely claims exists, the Corporation adjusted the repurchase experience implied in the settlement in order to determine the representations and warranties liability and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss.The table below presents a rollforward of the liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees.Representations and Warranties and Corporate Guarantees        Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30(Dollars in millions)2016 2015 2016 2015Liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees, beginning of period$2,812 $11,992 $11,326 $12,081Additions for new sales1 2 2 3Net reductions(107) (233) (8,664) (407)Provision (benefit)17 (205) 59 (121)Liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees, June 30 (1)$2,723 $11,556 $2,723 $11,556(1) In February 2016, the Corporation made an $8.5 billion cash payment as part of the settlement with BNY Mellon.The representations and warranties liability represents the Corporation's best estimate of probable incurred losses as of June 30, 2016. However, it is reasonably possible that future representations and warranties losses may occur in excess of the amounts recorded for these exposures. 169Table of ContentsThe Corporation currently estimates that the range of possible loss for representations and warranties exposures could be up to $2 billion over existing accruals at June 30, 2016. The Corporation treats claims that are time-barred as resolved and does not consider such claims in the estimated range of possible loss. The estimated range of possible loss reflects principally exposures related to loans in private-label securitization trusts. It represents a reasonably possible loss, but does not represent a probable loss, and is based on currently available information, significant judgment and a number of assumptions that are subject to change.The liability for representations and warranties exposures and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss do not consider certain losses related to servicing, including foreclosure and related costs, fraud, indemnity, or claims (including for RMBS) related to securities law or monoline insurance litigation. Losses with respect to one or more of these matters could be material to the Corporation's results of operations or liquidity for any particular reporting period.Future provisions and/or ranges of possible loss for representations and warranties may be significantly impacted if actual experiences are different from the Corporation's assumptions in predictive models, including, without limitation, the actual repurchase rates on loans in trusts not settled as part of the settlement with BNY Mellon which may be different than the implied repurchase experience, estimated MI rescission rates, economic conditions, estimated home prices, consumer and counterparty behavior, the applicable statute of limitations, potential indemnity obligations to third parties to whom the Corporation has sold loans subject to representations and warranties and a variety of other judgmental factors. Adverse developments with respect to one or more of the assumptions underlying the liability for representations and warranties and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss could result in significant increases to future provisions and/or the estimated range of possible loss.For more information on the settlement with BNY Mellon, see Note 7 – Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 170Table of ContentsNOTE 8 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets GoodwillThe table below presents goodwill balances by business segment and All Other at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

As part of the realignment, the Corporation completed a review of all consumer real estate-secured lending and servicing activities within LAS, Consumer Banking, GWIM and All Other with a view to strategically align the business activities and loans into core and non-core categories, with core loans reflected on the balance sheet of the appropriate business segment and non-core on the balance sheet of All Other. There was no goodwill in LAS at December 31, 2015 and therefore, this realignment had no impact on the allocation of goodwill to the Corporation's reporting units.During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Corporation completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2016 for all applicable reporting units. Following the realignment, the Corporation combined the Card Services, Consumer Vehicle Lending and Home Loans reporting units within the Consumer Banking segment into a single Consumer Lending reporting unit, effective June 30, 2016. This combination of reporting units triggered a test for goodwill impairment, which was performed both immediately before and after the combination of reporting units. The Corporation performed this analysis in conjunction with its annual impairment test as of June 30, 2016. Based on the results of the annual goodwill impairment test, the Corporation determined there was no impairment. For more information regarding annual goodwill impairment testing, see Note 8 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Intangible AssetsThe table below presents the gross and net carrying values and accumulated amortization for intangible assets at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Intangible Assets (1, 2)   June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions)GrossCarrying Value AccumulatedAmortization Net Carrying Value GrossCarrying Value AccumulatedAmortization Net Carrying ValuePurchased credit card and affinity relationships$6,905 $6,167 $738 $7,006 $6,111 $895Core deposit and other intangibles (3)3,838 1,994 1,844 3,922 1,986 1,936Customer relationships3,887 3,117 770 3,927 2,990 937Total intangible assets$14,630 $11,278 $3,352 $14,855 $11,087 $3,768(1) Excludes fully amortized intangible assets.(2) At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, none of the intangible assets were impaired.(3) Includes intangible assets associated with trade names that have an indefinite life and, accordingly, are not amortized. 171Table of ContentsThe table below presents intangible asset amortization expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.Amortization Expense     Three Months EndedJune 30 Six Months EndedJune 30(Dollars in millions)2016 2015 2016 2015Purchased credit card and affinity relationships$74 $89 $148 $178Core deposit and other intangibles29 36 59 73Customer relationships83 87 166 174Total amortization expense$186 $212 $373 $425The table below presents estimated future intangible asset amortization expense as of June 30, 2016.Estimated Future Amortization Expense(Dollars in millions)Remainder of2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021Purchased credit card and affinity relationships$149 $236 $176 $117 $57 $3Core deposit and other intangibles54 95 82 1 — —Customer relationships159 309 302 — — —Total estimated future amortization expense$362 $640 $560 $118 $57 $3 172Table of ContentsNOTE 9 – Federal Funds Sold or Purchased, Securities Financing Agreements and Short-term BorrowingsThe table below presents federal funds sold or purchased, securities financing agreements, which include securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, and short-term borrowings.

The Corporation offsets securities financing transactions with the same counterparty on the Consolidated Balance Sheet where it has such a legally enforceable master netting agreement and the transactions have the same maturity date.The Securities Financing Agreements table presents securities financing agreements included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, and in federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty netting. Gross assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements. For more information on the offsetting of derivatives, see Note 2 – Derivatives.The "Other" amount in the table, which is included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accrued expenses and other liabilities, relates to transactions where the Corporation acts as the lender in a securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged as collateral or sold. In these transactions, the Corporation recognizes an asset at fair value, representing the securities received, and a liability, representing the obligation to return those securities.Gross assets and liabilities in the table include activity where uncertainty exists as to the enforceability of certain master netting agreements under bankruptcy laws in some countries or industries and, accordingly, these are reported on a gross basis.The column titled "Financial Instruments" in the table includes securities collateral received or pledged under repurchase or securities lending agreements where there is a legally enforceable master netting agreement. These amounts are not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, but are shown as a reduction to the net balance sheet amount in this table to derive a net asset or liability. Securities collateral received or pledged where the legal enforceability of the master netting agreements is not certain is not included.Securities Financing Agreements June 30, 2016(Dollars in millions)Gross Assets/Liabilities Amounts Offset Net Balance Sheet Amount Financial Instruments Net Assets/LiabilitiesSecurities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell (1)$345,379 $(131,642) $213,737 $(163,091) $50,646          Securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase$309,691 $(131,642) $178,049 $(149,338) $28,711Other12,956 — 12,956 (12,956) —Total$322,647 $(131,642) $191,005 $(162,294) $28,711           December 31, 2015Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell (1)$347,281 $(154,799) $192,482 $(144,332) $48,150          Securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase$329,078 $(154,799) $174,279 $(135,737) $38,542Other13,235 — 13,235 (13,235) —Total$342,313 $(154,799) $187,514 $(148,972) $38,542(1) Excludes repurchase activity of $10.1 billion and $9.3 billion reported in loans and leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 174Table of ContentsRepurchase Agreements and Securities Loaned Transactions Accounted for as Secured BorrowingsThe tables below present securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities loaned by remaining contractual term to maturity and class of collateral pledged. Included in "Other" are transactions where the Corporation acts as the lender in a securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged as collateral or sold. Certain agreements contain a right to substitute collateral and/or terminate the agreement prior to maturity at the option of the Corporation or the counterparty. Such agreements are included in the table below based on the remaining contractual term to maturity. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Corporation had no outstanding repurchase-to-maturity transactions.Remaining Contractual Maturity June 30, 2016(Dollars in millions)Overnight and Continuous 30 Days or Less After 30 Days Through 90 Days Greater than 90 Days (1) TotalSecurities sold under agreements to repurchase$126,298 $84,943 $44,351 $31,804 $287,396Securities loaned17,203 1,277 1,838 1,977 22,295Other12,956 — — — 12,956Total$156,457 $86,220 $46,189 $33,781 $322,647           December 31, 2015Securities sold under agreements to repurchase$126,694 $86,879 $43,216 $27,514 $284,303Securities loaned39,772 363 2,352 2,288 44,775Other13,235 — — — 13,235Total$179,701 $87,242 $45,568 $29,802 $342,313(1) No agreements have maturities greater than three years.Class of Collateral Pledged        June 30, 2016(Dollars in millions)Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase Securities Loaned Other TotalU.S. government and agency securities$162,644 $— $60 $162,704Corporate securities, trading loans and other10,154 1,749 488 12,391Equity securities20,218 11,218 12,351 43,787Non-U.S. sovereign debt84,505 9,328 57 93,890Mortgage trading loans and ABS9,875 — — 9,875Total$287,396 $22,295 $12,956 $322,647         December 31, 2015U.S. government and agency securities$142,572 $— $27 $142,599Corporate securities, trading loans and other11,767 265 278 12,310Equity securities32,323 13,350 12,929 58,602Non-U.S. sovereign debt87,849 31,160 1 119,010Mortgage trading loans and ABS9,792 — — 9,792Total$284,303 $44,775 $13,235 $342,313The Corporation is required to post collateral with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount borrowed under repurchase agreements. For securities loaned transactions, the Corporation receives collateral in the form of cash, letters of credit or other securities. To ensure that the market value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient, collateral is generally valued daily and the Corporation may be required to deposit additional collateral or may receive or return collateral pledged when appropriate. Repurchase agreements and securities loaned transactions are generally either overnight, continuous (i.e., no stated term) or short-term. The Corporation manages liquidity risks related to these agreements by sourcing funding from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when appropriate. 175Table of ContentsNOTE 10 – Commitments and ContingenciesIn the normal course of business, the Corporation enters into a number of off-balance sheet commitments. These commitments expose the Corporation to varying degrees of credit and market risk and are subject to the same credit and market risk limitation reviews as those instruments recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For more information on commitments and contingencies, see Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Credit Extension CommitmentsThe Corporation enters into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and commercial letters of credit to meet the financing needs of its customers. The table below includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments net of amounts distributed (e.g., syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions of $13.9 billion and $14.3 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. At June 30, 2016, the carrying value of these commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option, was $767 million, including deferred revenue of $17 million and a reserve for unfunded lending commitments of $750 million. At December 31, 2015, the comparable amounts were $664 million, $18 million and $646 million, respectively. The carrying value of these commitments is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.The table below also includes the notional amount of commitments of $8.1 billion and $10.9 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 that are accounted for under the fair value option. However, the table below excludes cumulative net fair value of $347 million and $658 million on these commitments, which is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities. For more information regarding the Corporation's loan commitments accounted for under the fair value option, see Note 15 – Fair Value Option.Credit Extension Commitments   June 30, 2016(Dollars in millions)Expire in One Year or Less Expire After One Year ThroughThree Years Expire After Three Years ThroughFive Years Expire After Five Years TotalNotional amount of credit extension commitments         Loan commitments$78,341 $122,261 $149,771 $24,486 $374,859Home equity lines of credit7,978 14,789 3,495 22,561 48,823Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees (1)20,022 10,908 3,645 1,075 35,650Letters of credit1,836 102 126 39 2,103Legally binding commitments108,177 148,060 157,037 48,161 461,435Credit card lines (2)376,457 — — — 376,457Total credit extension commitments$484,634 $148,060 $157,037 $48,161 $837,892           December 31, 2015Notional amount of credit extension commitments         Loan commitments$84,884 $119,272 $158,920 $37,112 $400,188Home equity lines of credit7,074 18,438 5,126 19,697 50,335Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees (1)19,584 9,903 3,385 1,218 34,090Letters of credit1,650 165 258 54 2,127Legally binding commitments113,192 147,778 167,689 58,081 486,740Credit card lines (2)370,127 — — — 370,127Total credit extension commitments$483,319 $147,778 $167,689 $58,081 $856,867(1) The notional amounts of SBLCs and financial guarantees classified as investment grade and non-investment grade based on the credit quality of the underlying reference name within the instrument were $26.8 billion and $8.6 billion at June 30, 2016, and $25.5 billion and $8.4 billion at December 31, 2015. Amounts in the table include consumer SBLCs of $278 million and $164 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.(2) Includes business card unused lines of credit.Legally binding commitments to extend credit generally have specified rates and maturities. Certain of these commitments have adverse change clauses that help to protect the Corporation against deterioration in the borrower's ability to pay. 176Table of ContentsOther CommitmentsAt June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Corporation had commitments to purchase loans (e.g., residential mortgage and commercial real estate) of $1.4 billion and $729 million, which upon settlement will be included in loans or LHFS.At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Corporation had commitments to purchase commodities, primarily liquefied natural gas of $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion, which upon settlement will be included in trading account assets.At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Corporation had commitments to enter into resale and forward-dated resale and securities borrowing agreements of $62.1 billion and $88.6 billion, and commitments to enter into forward-dated repurchase and securities lending agreements of $43.1 billion and $53.7 billion. These commitments expire within the next 12 months.The Corporation has entered into agreements to purchase retail automotive loans from certain auto loan originators. These agreements provide for stated purchase amounts and contain cancellation provisions that allow the Corporation to terminate its commitment to purchase at any time, with a minimum notification period. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Corporation's maximum purchase commitment, was $1.9 billion and $1.2 billion. In addition, the Corporation has a commitment to originate or purchase auto loans and leases from a strategic partner of $3.0 billion over the remainder of 2016, and $4.0 billion in 2017. This commitment expires on December 31, 2017.The Corporation is a party to operating leases for certain of its premises and equipment. Commitments under these leases are approximately $1.2 billion, $2.2 billion, $1.9 billion, $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion for the remainder of 2016 and the years through 2020, respectively, and $5.2 billion in the aggregate for all years thereafter.Other GuaranteesBank-owned Life Insurance Book Value ProtectionThe Corporation sells products that offer book value protection to insurance carriers who offer group life insurance policies to corporations, primarily banks. The book value protection is provided on portfolios of intermediate investment-grade fixed-income securities and is intended to cover any shortfall in the event that policyholders surrender their policies and market value is below book value. These guarantees are recorded as derivatives and carried at fair value in the trading portfolio. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the notional amount of these guarantees totaled $13.9 billion and $13.8 billion, and the Corporation's maximum exposure related to these guarantees totaled $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion, with estimated maturity dates between 2031 and 2039. The net fair value including the fee receivable associated with these guarantees was $10 million and $12 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and reflects the probability of surrender as well as the multiple structural protection features in the contracts.Merchant ServicesIn accordance with credit and debit card association rules, the Corporation sponsors merchant processing servicers that process credit and debit card transactions on behalf of various merchants. In connection with these services, a liability may arise in the event of a billing dispute between the merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately resolved in the cardholder's favor. If the merchant defaults on its obligation to reimburse the cardholder, the cardholder, through its issuing bank, generally has until six months after the date of the transaction to present a chargeback to the merchant processor, which is primarily liable for any losses on covered transactions. However, if the merchant processor fails to meet its obligation to reimburse the cardholder for disputed transactions, then the Corporation, as the sponsor, could be held liable for the disputed amount. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the sponsored entities processed and settled $178.4 billion and $337.8 billion of transactions and recorded losses of $8 million and $14 million. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, the sponsored entities processed and settled $171.0 billion and $325.6 billion of transactions and recorded losses of $6 million and $10 million. A significant portion of this activity was processed by a joint venture in which the Corporation holds a 49 percent ownership. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the sponsored merchant processing servicers held as collateral $194 million and $181 million of merchant escrow deposits which may be used to offset amounts due from the individual merchants.The Corporation believes the maximum potential exposure for chargebacks would not exceed the total amount of merchant transactions processed through Visa and MasterCard for the last six months, which represents the claim period for the cardholder, plus any outstanding delayed-delivery transactions. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the maximum potential exposure for sponsored transactions totaled $272.4 billion and $277.1 billion. However, the Corporation believes that the maximum potential exposure is not representative of the actual potential loss exposure and does not expect to make material payments in connection with these guarantees. 177Table of ContentsOther Derivative ContractsThe Corporation funds selected assets, including securities issued by CDOs and CLOs, through derivative contracts, typically total return swaps, with third parties and VIEs that are not consolidated by the Corporation. The total notional amount of these derivative contracts was $301 million and $371 million with commercial banks and $179 million and $922 million with VIEs at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The underlying securities are senior securities and substantially all of the Corporation's exposures are insured. Accordingly, the Corporation's exposure to loss consists principally of counterparty risk to the insurers. In certain circumstances, generally as a result of ratings downgrades, the Corporation may be required to purchase the underlying assets, which would not result in additional gain or loss to the Corporation as such exposure is already reflected in the fair value of the derivative contracts.Other GuaranteesThe Corporation has entered into additional guarantee agreements and commitments, including sold risk participation swaps, liquidity facilities, lease-end obligation agreements, partial credit guarantees on certain leases, real estate joint venture guarantees, divested business commitments and sold put options that require gross settlement. The maximum potential future payment under these agreements was approximately $6.1 billion and $6.0 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The estimated maturity dates of these obligations extend up to 2040. The Corporation has made no material payments under these guarantees.In the normal course of business, the Corporation periodically guarantees the obligations of its affiliates in a variety of transactions including ISDA-related transactions and non-ISDA related transactions such as commodities trading, repurchase agreements, prime brokerage agreements and other transactions.Other ContingenciesPayment Protection Insurance Claims MatterIn the U.K., the Corporation previously sold payment protection insurance (PPI) through its international card services business to credit card customers and consumer loan customers. PPI covers a consumer's loan or debt repayment if certain events occur such as loss of job or illness. In response to an elevated level of customer complaints across the industry, heightened media coverage and pressure from consumer advocacy groups, the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) investigated and raised concerns about the way some companies have handled complaints related to the sale of these insurance policies. In November 2015, the FCA issued proposed guidance on the treatment of certain PPI claims. The reserve for PPI claims was $246 million and $360 million at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Corporation recorded expense of $13 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $16 million for the same periods in 2015. It is possible that the Corporation will incur additional expense related to PPI claims; however, the amount of such additional expense cannot be reasonably estimated.FDICDeposits placed at U.S. domiciled banks (U.S. banks) are insured by the FDIC, subject to limits and conditions of applicable law and the FDIC's regulations. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Financial Reform Act), FDIC insurance coverage limits were permanently increased to $250,000 per customer. All insured depository institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC in order to fund the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF).The FDIC is required to maintain at least a designated minimum ratio of the DIF to insured deposits in the U.S. The Financial Reform Act requires the FDIC to assess insured depository institutions to achieve a DIF ratio of at least 1.35 percent by September 30, 2020. The DIF ratio is currently below the required targets and the FDIC has adopted a restoration plan that may result in increased deposit insurance assessments. In March 2016, the FDIC issued a final rule imposing a surcharge of 4.5 cents per $100 of their assessment base, after making certain adjustments, on insured depository institutions, with total assets of $10 billion or more. The surcharges will begin in the first quarter after the DIF ratio reaches 1.15 percent. As of the July 1, 2016 effectiveness date of the final rule, the DIF ratio of 1.15 percent has not been reached. The FDIC expects the surcharge to be in effect for approximately two years. If the DIF reserve ratio does not reach 1.35 percent by December 31, 2018, the FDIC will impose a shortfall assessment on any bank subject to the surcharge. The Corporation expects the surcharge to increase the deposit insurance assessment by $100 million per quarter. The FDIC has also adopted regulations that establish a long-term target DIF ratio of greater than two percent. Deposit insurance assessment rates are subject to change by the FDIC, and can be impacted by the overall economy, the stability of the banking industry as a whole, and regulations or regulatory interpretations. 178Table of ContentsLitigation and Regulatory MattersThe following supplements the disclosure in Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2016 (the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure).In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to many pending and threatened legal, regulatory and governmental actions and proceedings. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties, the Corporation generally cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the matters will be, what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be, or what the expense, eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each matter may be.In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Corporation establishes an accrued liability when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. As a matter develops, the Corporation, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates on an ongoing basis whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and estimable. Once the loss contingency is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Corporation will establish an accrued liability and record a corresponding amount of litigation-related expense. The Corporation continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established. Excluding expenses of internal and external legal service providers, litigation-related expense of $270 million and $658 million was recognized for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $175 million and $545 million for the same periods in 2015.For a limited number of the matters disclosed in this Note, and in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure, for which a loss, whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, is reasonably possible in future periods, the Corporation is able to estimate a range of possible loss. In determining whether it is possible to estimate a range of possible loss, the Corporation reviews and evaluates its matters on an ongoing basis, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. In cases in which the Corporation possesses sufficient appropriate information to estimate a range of possible loss, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed below. There may be other disclosed matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but such an estimate of the range of possible loss may not be possible. For those matters where an estimate of the range of possible loss is possible, management currently estimates the aggregate range of possible loss is $0 to $1.1 billion in excess of the accrued liability (if any) related to those matters. This estimated range of possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions, and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. Therefore, this estimated range of possible loss represents what the Corporation believes to be an estimate of possible loss only for certain matters meeting these criteria. It does not represent the Corporation's maximum loss exposure.Information is provided below, or in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure, regarding the nature of all of these contingencies and, where specified, the amount of the claim associated with these loss contingencies. Based on current knowledge, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters, including the matters described herein and in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the Corporation. However, in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters, some of which are beyond the Corporation's control, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to the Corporation's results of operations or liquidity for any particular reporting period.Bond Insurance LitigationAmbac Countrywide Litigation On June 24, 2016, in The Segregated Account of Ambac Assurance Corporation and Ambac Assurance Corporation v.

The requested capital actions included a request to repurchase $5.0 billion in common stock over four quarters beginning in the third quarter of 2016, and to increase the quarterly common stock dividend from $0.05 per share to $0.075 per share.During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Corporation repurchased and retired 55.2 million and 113.2 million shares of common stock in connection with the 2015 CCAR capital plan, which reduced shareholders' equity by $783 million and $1.6 billion. On March 18, 2016, the Corporation announced that the Board of Directors authorized additional repurchases of common stock up to $800 million outside of the scope of the 2015 CCAR capital plan to offset the share count dilution resulting from equity incentive compensation awarded to retirement-eligible employees, to which the Federal Reserve did not object. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Corporation repurchased and retired 40.8 million and 55.3 million shares of common stock in connection with this additional authorization, which reduced shareholders' equity by $600 million and $800 million. 180Table of ContentsDuring the six months ended June 30, 2016, in connection with employee stock plans, the Corporation issued approximately 9 million shares and repurchased approximately 4 million shares of its common stock to satisfy tax withholding obligations. At June 30, 2016, the Corporation had reserved 1.6 billion unissued shares of common stock for future issuances under employee stock plans, common stock warrants, convertible notes and preferred stock. The Corporation has certain warrants outstanding and exercisable to purchase 150 million shares of its common stock, expiring on January 16, 2019 and warrants outstanding and exercisable to purchase 122 million shares of its common stock, expiring on October 28, 2018. These warrants were originally issued in connection with preferred stock issuances to the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2009 and 2008, and are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The exercise price of the warrants expiring on January 16, 2019 is subject to continued adjustment each time the quarterly cash dividend is in excess of $0.01 per common share to compensate the holders of the warrants for dilution resulting from an increased dividend. As a result of the Corporation's second-quarter 2016 dividend of $0.05 per common share, the exercise price of these warrants was adjusted to $13.032. The warrants expiring on October 28, 2018 also contain this anti-dilution provision except the adjustment is triggered only when the Corporation declares quarterly dividends at a level greater than $0.32 per common share. 181Table of ContentsPreferred StockDuring the three months ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Corporation declared $457 million and $361 million of cash dividends on preferred stock, or a total of $818 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016.On April 25, 2016, the Corporation issued 36,000 shares of its 6.000% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series EE for $900 million. Dividends are paid quarterly commencing on July 25, 2016. Series EE preferred stock has a liquidation preference of $25,000 per share and is subject to certain restrictions in the event that the Corporation fails to declare and pay full dividends.Restricted Stock UnitsDuring the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Corporation granted 163 million restricted stock unit (RSU) awards to certain employees under the Bank of America Corporation Key Employee Equity Plan. Generally, one-third of the RSUs vest on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date provided that the employee remains continuously employed with the Corporation during that time. The RSUs are authorized to settle predominantly in shares of common stock of the Corporation, and are expensed ratably over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures, for non-retirement eligible employees based on the grant-date fair value of the shares. Certain RSUs will be settled in cash or contain settlement provisions that subject these awards to variable accounting whereby compensation expense is adjusted to fair value based on changes in the fair value of the Corporation's common stock up to the settlement date. Awards granted in prior years were predominantly cash settled. For RSUs granted to employees who are retirement eligible or will become retirement eligible during the vesting period, the RSUs are expensed as of the grant date or ratably over the period from the grant date to the date the employee becomes retirement eligible, net of estimated forfeitures.

The warrant may be exercised, at the option of the holder, through tendering the Series T Preferred Stock or paying cash. For both the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the 700 million average dilutive potential common shares were included in the diluted share count under the "if-converted" method.For both the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, 62 million average dilutive potential common shares associated with the 7.25% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, Series L were not included in the diluted share count because the result would have been antidilutive under the "if-converted" method. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, average options to purchase 42 million and 48 million shares of common stock were outstanding but not included in the computation of EPS because the result would have been antidilutive under the treasury stock method compared to 64 million and 68 million for the same periods in 2015. For both the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, average warrants to purchase 122 million shares of common stock were outstanding but not included in the computation of EPS because the result would have been antidilutive under the treasury stock method and average warrants to purchase 150 million shares of common stock were included in the diluted EPS calculation using the treasury stock method. 185Table of ContentsNOTE 14 – Fair Value MeasurementsUnder applicable accounting guidance, fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Corporation determines the fair values of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established under applicable accounting guidance which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs used to measure fair value. The Corporation conducts a review of its fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of fair value hierarchy classifications are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable, respectively, in the current marketplace. These transfers are considered to be effective as of the beginning of the quarter in which they occur. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy and how the Corporation measures fair value, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 20 – Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Corporation accounts for certain financial instruments under the fair value option. For additional information, see Note 15 – Fair Value Option.Valuation Processes and TechniquesThe Corporation has various processes and controls in place to ensure that fair value is reasonably estimated. A model validation policy governs the use and control of valuation models used to estimate fair value. This policy requires review and approval of models by personnel who are independent of the front office, and periodic reassessments of models to ensure that they are continuing to perform as designed. In addition, detailed reviews of trading gains and losses are conducted on a daily basis by personnel who are independent of the front office. A price verification group, which is also independent of the front office, utilizes available market information including executed trades, market prices and market-observable valuation model inputs to ensure that fair values are reasonably estimated. The Corporation performs due diligence procedures over third-party pricing service providers in order to support their use in the valuation process. Where market information is not available to support internal valuations, independent reviews of the valuations are performed and any material exposures are escalated through a management review process.While the Corporation believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.During the six months ended June 30, 2016, there were no changes to the valuation techniques that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on the Corporation's consolidated financial position or results of operations.Level 1, 2 and 3 Valuation TechniquesFinancial instruments are considered Level 1 when the valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 financial instruments are valued using quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or models using inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Financial instruments are considered Level 3 when their values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques, and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable and when determination of the fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. 186Table of ContentsRecurring Fair ValueAssets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, including financial instruments which the Corporation accounts for under the fair value option, are summarized in the following tables.

Commercial loans, debt securities and other include corporate CLOs and CDOs, commercial loans and bonds, and securities backed by non-real estate assets. Structured liabilities primarily include equity-linked notes that are accounted for under the fair value option.The Corporation uses multiple market approaches in valuing certain of its Level 3 financial instruments. For example, market comparables and discounted cash flows are used together. For a given product, such as corporate debt securities, market comparables may be used to estimate some of the unobservable inputs and then these inputs are incorporated into a discounted cash flow model. Therefore, the balances disclosed encompass both of these techniques.The level of aggregation and diversity within the products disclosed in the tables result in certain ranges of inputs being wide and unevenly distributed across asset and liability categories. For more information on the inputs and techniques used in the valuation of MSRs, see Note 17 – Mortgage Servicing Rights.Sensitivity of Fair Value Measurements to Changes in Unobservable InputsLoans and SecuritiesFor instruments backed by residential real estate assets, commercial real estate assets and commercial loans, debt securities and other, a significant increase in market yields, default rates, loss severities or duration would result in a significantly lower fair value for long positions. Short positions would be impacted in a directionally opposite way. The impact of changes in prepayment speeds would have differing impacts depending on the seniority of the instrument and, in the case of CLOs, whether prepayments can be reinvested.For instruments backed by commercial real estate assets and auction rate securities, a significant increase in price would result in a significantly higher fair value.Structured Liabilities and DerivativesFor credit derivatives, a significant increase in market yield, upfront points (i.e., a single upfront payment made by a protection buyer at inception), credit spreads, default rates or loss severities would result in a significantly lower fair value for protection sellers and higher fair value for protection buyers. The impact of changes in prepayment speeds would have differing impacts depending on the seniority of the instrument and, in the case of CLOs, whether prepayments can be reinvested.Structured credit derivatives, which include tranched portfolio CDS and derivatives with derivative product company (DPC) and monoline counterparties, are impacted by credit correlation, including default and wrong-way correlation. Default correlation is a parameter that describes the degree of dependence among credit default rates within a credit portfolio that underlies a credit derivative instrument. The sensitivity of this input on the fair value varies depending on the level of subordination of the tranche. For senior tranches that are net purchases of protection, a significant increase in default correlation would result in a significantly higher fair value. Net short protection positions would be impacted in a directionally opposite way. Wrong-way correlation is a parameter that describes the probability that as exposure to a counterparty increases, the credit quality of the counterparty decreases. A significantly higher degree of wrong-way correlation between a DPC counterparty and underlying derivative exposure would result in a significantly lower fair value.For equity derivatives, commodity derivatives, interest rate derivatives and structured liabilities, a significant change in long-dated rates and volatilities and correlation inputs (e.g., the degree of correlation between an equity security and an index, between two different commodities, between two different interest rates, or between interest rates and foreign exchange rates) would result in a significant impact to the fair value; however, the magnitude and direction of the impact depends on whether the Corporation is long or short the exposure. For structured liabilities, a significant decrease in duration would result in a significantly higher fair value. For structured liabilities, a significant increase in yield or decrease in price would result in a significant reduction in fair value. A significant decrease in duration may result in a significantly higher fair value. 199Table of ContentsNonrecurring Fair ValueThe Corporation holds certain assets that are measured at fair value, but only in certain situations (e.g., impairment) and these measurements are referred to herein as nonrecurring.

The Corporation accounts for certain loan commitments under the fair value option.The carrying values and fair values of the Corporation's commercial unfunded lending commitments were $1.1 billion and $5.7 billion at June 30, 2016, and $1.3 billion and $6.3 billion at December 31, 2015. Commercial unfunded lending commitments are primarily classified as Level 3. The carrying value of these commitments is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities.The Corporation does not estimate the fair values of consumer unfunded lending commitments because, in many instances, the Corporation can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing notice to the borrower. For more information on commitments, see Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies. 204Table of ContentsNOTE 17 – Mortgage Servicing RightsThe Corporation accounts for consumer MSRs at fair value with changes in fair value primarily recorded in mortgage banking income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The Corporation manages the risk in these MSRs with derivatives such as options and interest rate swaps, which are not designated as accounting hedges, as well as securities including MBS and U.S. Treasury securities. The securities used to manage the risk in the MSRs are classified in other assets with changes in the fair value of the securities and the related interest income recorded in mortgage banking income.The table below presents activity for residential mortgage and home equity MSRs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.Rollforward of Mortgage Servicing Rights        Three Months EndedJune 30 Six Months EndedJune 30(Dollars in millions)2016 2015 2016 2015Balance, beginning of period$2,631 $3,394 $3,087 $3,530Additions72 204 208 383Sales(1) (312) (2) (312)Amortization of expected cash flows (1)(205) (223) (416) (453)Impact of changes in interest rates and other market factors (2)(243) 468 (619) 292Model and other cash flow assumption changes (3)15 (10) 11 81Balance, June 30 (4)$2,269 $3,521 $2,269 $3,521Mortgage loans serviced for investors (in billions)$371 $425 $371 $425(1) Represents the net change in fair value of the MSR asset due to the recognition of modeled cash flows.(2) These amounts reflect the changes in modeled MSR fair value primarily due to observed changes in interest rates, volatility, spreads and the shape of the forward swap curve and periodic adjustments to valuation based on third-party discovery.(3) These amounts reflect periodic adjustments to the valuation model to reflect changes in the modeled relationship between inputs and their impact on projected cash flows as well as changes in certain cash flow assumptions such as cost to service and ancillary income per loan.(4) At June 30, 2016, includes $1.8 billion of U.S. and $481 million of non-U.S. consumer MSR balances compared to $3.2 billion and $320 million at June 30, 2015.The Corporation primarily uses an option-adjusted spread (OAS) valuation approach which factors in prepayment risk to determine the fair value of MSRs. This approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using risk-adjusted discount rates. In addition to updating the valuation model for interest, discount and prepayment rates, periodic adjustments are made to recalibrate the valuation model for factors used to project cash flows. The changes to the factors capture the effect of variances related to actual versus estimated servicing proceeds. 205Table of ContentsSignificant economic assumptions in estimating the fair value of MSRs at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are presented below. The change in fair value as a result of changes in OAS rates is included within "Model and other cash flow assumption changes" in the Rollforward of Mortgage Servicing Rights table. The weighted-average life is not an input in the valuation model but is a product of both changes in market rates of interest and changes in model and other cash flow assumptions. The weighted-average life represents the average period of time that the MSRs' cash flows are expected to be received. Absent other changes, an increase (decrease) to the weighted-average life would generally result in an increase (decrease) in the fair value of the MSRs.Significant Economic Assumptions June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015 Fixed Adjustable Fixed AdjustableWeighted-average OAS4.88% 7.85% 4.62% 7.61%Weighted-average life, in years3.38 3.05 4.46 3.43The table below presents the sensitivity of the weighted-average lives and fair value of MSRs to changes in modeled assumptions. These sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. As the amounts indicate, changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of MSRs that continue to be held by the Corporation is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities. The below sensitivities do not reflect any hedge strategies that may be undertaken to mitigate such risk.Sensitivity Impacts June 30, 2016 Change in Weighted-average Lives  (Dollars in millions)Fixed Adjustable Change inFair ValuePrepayment rates         Impact of 10% decrease0.29 years 0.23 years $175Impact of 20% decrease0.63   0.49   377          Impact of 10% increase(0.25)   (0.20)   (152)Impact of 20% increase(0.47)   (0.38)   (286)OAS level         Impact of 100 bps decrease        $79Impact of 200 bps decrease        165          Impact of 100 bps increase        (74)Impact of 200 bps increase        (142) 206Table of ContentsNOTE 18 – Business Segment InformationEffective April 1, 2016, to align the segments with how the Corporation now manages its businesses, the Corporation changed its basis of presentation, and following such change, reports its results of operations through the following four business segments: Consumer Banking, GWIM, Global Banking and Global Markets, with the remaining operations recorded in All Other. For more information on the business segments and All Other, see Note 24 – Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information on the Corporation’s segment realignment, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles.Basis of PresentationThe management accounting and reporting process derives segment and business results by utilizing allocation methodologies for revenue and expense. The net income derived for the businesses is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an activity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other methodologies and assumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of the business.Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income. The adjustment of net interest income to an FTE basis results in a corresponding increase in income tax expense. The segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies that are utilized to determine net income. The net interest income of the businesses includes the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. In segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, the Corporation allocates assets to match liabilities. Net interest income of the business segments also includes an allocation of net interest income generated by certain of the Corporation's ALM activities. Beginning in 2016, this allocation excludes any adjustments to the accumulated premium or discount amortization of MBS that are made as a result of a change in the estimated lives of these securities.In addition, the business segments are impacted by the migration of customers and clients and their deposit, loan and brokerage balances between businesses. Subsequent to the date of migration, the associated net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense are recorded in the business to which the customers or clients migrated.The Corporation's ALM activities include an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of various derivatives and cash instruments to manage fluctuations in earnings and capital that are caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation's goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital. The results of a majority of the Corporation's ALM activities are allocated to the business segments and fluctuate based on the performance of the ALM activities. ALM activities include external product pricing decisions including deposit pricing strategies, the effects of the Corporation's internal funds transfer pricing process and the net effects of other ALM activities.Certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific business segment are allocated to the segments. The most significant of these expenses include data and item processing costs and certain centralized or shared functions. Data processing costs are allocated to the segments based on equipment usage. Item processing costs are allocated to the segments based on the volume of items processed for each segment. The costs of certain other centralized or shared functions are allocated based on methodologies that reflect utilization. 207Table of ContentsThe table below presents net income (loss) and the components thereto (with net interest income on an FTE basis) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, and total assets at June 30, 2016 and 2015 for each business segment, as well as All Other.Results for Business Segments and All Other    At and for the Three Months Ended June 30     Total Corporation (1) Consumer Banking(Dollars in millions)2016 2015 2016 2015Net interest income (FTE basis)$9,436 $10,684 $5,276 $5,043Noninterest income11,185 11,495 2,588 2,714Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis)20,621 22,179 7,864 7,757Provision for credit losses976 780 726 470Noninterest expense13,493 13,958 4,416 4,637Income before income taxes (FTE basis)6,152 7,441 2,722 2,650Income tax expense (FTE basis)1,920 2,307 1,004 988Net income$4,232 $5,134 $1,718 $1,662Period-end total assets$2,186,609 $2,149,034 $668,470 $621,883       Global Wealth & Investment Management Global Banking 2016 2015 2016 2015Net interest income (FTE basis)$1,434 $1,352 $2,421 $2,170Noninterest income3,022 3,215 2,269 2,066Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis)4,456 4,567 4,690 4,236Provision for credit losses14 15 203 177Noninterest expense3,288 3,485 2,126 2,086Income before income taxes (FTE basis)1,154 1,067 2,361 1,973Income tax expense (FTE basis)432 398 870 737Net income $722 $669 $1,491 $1,236Period-end total assets$286,846 $267,099 $393,380 $367,052       Global Markets All Other 2016 2015 2016 2015Net interest income (FTE basis)$1,093 $988 $(788) $1,131Noninterest income3,220 2,962 86 538Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis)4,313 3,950 (702) 1,669Provision for credit losses(5) 6 38 112Noninterest expense2,582 2,748 1,081 1,002Income (loss) before income taxes (FTE basis)1,736 1,196 (1,821) 555Income tax expense (benefit) (FTE basis)620 410 (1,006) (226)Net income (loss)$1,116 $786 $(815) $781Period-end total assets$577,428 $578,052 $260,485 $314,948(1) There were no material intersegment revenues. 208Table of ContentsResults of Business Segments and All Other    At and for the Six Months Ended June 30     Total Corporation (1) Consumer Banking(Dollars in millions)2016 2015 2016 2015Net interest income (FTE basis)$18,822 $20,310 $10,548 $10,046Noninterest income21,526 22,998 5,117 5,426Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis)40,348 43,308 15,665 15,472Provision for credit losses1,973 1,545 1,257 1,139Noninterest expense28,309 29,785 8,954 9,369Income before income taxes (FTE basis)10,066 11,978 5,454 4,964Income tax expense (FTE basis)3,154 3,747 2,007 1,846Net income$6,912 $8,231 $3,447 $3,118Period-end total assets$2,186,609 $2,149,034 $668,470 $621,883       Global Wealth &Investment Management Global Banking 2016 2015 2016 2015Net interest income (FTE basis)$2,922 $2,695 $4,902 $4,371Noninterest income5,978 6,382 4,178 4,251Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis)8,900 9,077 9,080 8,622Provision for credit losses39 38 756 273Noninterest expense6,563 6,974 4,297 4,235Income before income taxes (FTE basis)2,298 2,065 4,027 4,114Income tax expense (FTE basis)852 768 1,482 1,531Net income$1,446 $1,297 $2,545 $2,583Period-end total assets$286,846 $267,099 $393,380 $367,052       Global Markets All Other 2016 2015 2016 2015Net interest income (FTE basis)$2,273 $1,961 $(1,823) $1,237Noninterest income5,987 6,180 266 759Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis)8,260 8,141 (1,557) 1,996Provision for credit losses4 27 (83) 68Noninterest expense5,032 5,909 3,463 3,298Income (loss) before income taxes (FTE basis)3,224 2,205 (4,937) (1,370)Income tax expense (benefit) (FTE basis)1,138 755 (2,325) (1,153)Net income (loss)$2,086 $1,450 $(2,612) $(217)Period-end total assets$577,428 $578,052 $260,485 $314,948(1) There were no material intersegment revenues. 209Table of ContentsThe table below presents a reconciliation of the four business segments' total revenue, net of interest expense, on an FTE basis, and net income to the Consolidated Statement of Income, and total assets to the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Alt-A interest rates, which are determined by credit risk, therefore tend to be between those of prime and subprime consumer real estate loans. Typically, Alt-A mortgages are characterized by borrowers with less than full documentation, lower credit scores and higher LTVs.Assets in Custody – Consist largely of custodial and non-discretionary trust assets excluding brokerage assets administered for clients. Trust assets encompass a broad range of asset types including real estate, private company ownership interest, personal property and investments.Assets Under Management (AUM) – The total market value of assets under the investment advisory and/or discretion of GWIM which generate asset management fees based on a percentage of the assets' market values. AUM reflects assets that are generally managed for institutional, high net worth and retail clients, and are distributed through various investment products including mutual funds, other commingled vehicles and separate accounts. AUM is classified in two categories, Liquidity AUM and Long-term AUM. Liquidity AUM are assets under advisory and discretion of GWIM in which the investment strategy seeks current income, while maintaining liquidity and capital preservation. The duration of these strategies is primarily less than one year. Long-term AUM are assets under advisory and/or discretion of GWIM in which the duration of investment strategy is longer than one year.Banking Book – All on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments of the Corporation except for those positions that are held for trading purposes.Carrying Value (with respect to loans) – The amount at which a loan is recorded on the balance sheet. For loans recorded at amortized cost, carrying value is the unpaid principal balance net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and costs, and unamortized purchase premium or discount. For loans that are or have been on nonaccrual status, the carrying value is also reduced by any net charge-offs that have been recorded and the amount of interest payments applied as a reduction of principal under the cost recovery method. For PCI loans, the carrying value equals fair value upon acquisition adjusted for subsequent cash collections and yield accreted to date. For credit card loans, the carrying value also includes interest that has been billed to the customer. For loans classified as held-for-sale, carrying value is the lower of carrying value as described in the sentences above, or fair value. For loans for which we have elected the fair value option, the carrying value is fair value.Client Brokerage Assets – Include client assets which are held in brokerage accounts. This includes non-discretionary brokerage and fee-based assets which generate brokerage income and asset management fee revenue.Committed Credit Exposure – Includes any funded portion of a facility plus the unfunded portion of a facility on which the lender is legally bound to advance funds during a specified period under prescribed conditions.Credit Derivatives – Contractual agreements that provide protection against a credit event on one or more referenced obligations. The nature of a credit event is established by the protection purchaser and the protection seller at the inception of the transaction, and such events generally include bankruptcy or insolvency of the referenced credit entity, failure to meet payment obligations when due, as well as acceleration of indebtedness and payment repudiation or moratorium. The purchaser of the credit derivative pays a periodic fee in return for a payment by the protection seller upon the occurrence, if any, of such a credit event. A credit default swap is a type of a credit derivative.Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) – A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the counterparty credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments.Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) – A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the Corporation's own credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments and/or structured liabilities.Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA) – A portfolio adjustment required to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives.Interest Rate Lock Commitment (IRLC) – Commitment with a loan applicant in which the loan terms, including interest rate and price, are guaranteed for a designated period of time subject to credit approval.Letter of Credit – A document issued on behalf of a customer to a third party promising to pay the third party upon presentation of specified documents. A letter of credit effectively substitutes the issuer's credit for that of the customer. 211Table of ContentsLoan-to-value (LTV) – A commonly used credit quality metric that is reported in terms of ending and average LTV. Ending LTV is calculated as the outstanding carrying value of the loan at the end of the period divided by the estimated value of the property securing the loan. An additional metric related to LTV is combined loan-to-value (CLTV) which is similar to the LTV metric, yet combines the outstanding balance on the residential mortgage loan and the outstanding carrying value on the home equity loan or available line of credit, both of which are secured by the same property, divided by the estimated value of the property. A LTV of 100 percent reflects a loan that is currently secured by a property valued at an amount exactly equal to the carrying value or available line of the loan. Estimated property values are generally determined through the use of automated valuation models (AVMs) or the CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index. An AVM is a tool that estimates the value of a property by reference to large volumes of market data including sales of comparable properties and price trends specific to the MSA in which the property being valued is located. CoreLogic Case-Shiller is a widely used index based on data from repeat sales of single family homes. CoreLogic Case-Shiller indexed-based values are reported on a three-month or one-quarter lag.Margin Receivable – An extension of credit secured by eligible securities in certain brokerage accounts.Market-related Adjustments – Include adjustments to premium amortization or discount accretion on debt securities when a decrease in long-term rates shortens (or an increase extends) the estimated lives of mortgage-related debt securities. Also included in market-related adjustments is hedge ineffectiveness that impacts net interest income.Matched Book – Repurchase and resale agreements or securities borrowed and loaned transactions where the overall asset and liability position is similar in size and/or maturity. Generally, these are entered into to accommodate customers where the Corporation earns the interest rate spread.Mortgage Servicing Right (MSR) – The right to service a mortgage loan when the underlying loan is sold or securitized. Servicing includes collections for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors.Net Interest Yield – Net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets.Nonperforming Loans and Leases – Include loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status, including nonaccruing loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties (TDRs). Loans accounted for under the fair value option, PCI loans and LHFS are not reported as nonperforming loans and leases. Consumer credit card loans, business card loans, consumer loans secured by personal property (except for certain secured consumer loans, including those that have been modified in a TDR), and consumer loans secured by real estate that are insured by the FHA or through long-term credit protection agreements with FNMA and FHLMC (fully-insured loan portfolio) are not placed on nonaccrual status and are, therefore, not reported as nonperforming loans and leases.Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) – A framework established by the U.S. banking regulators requiring banks to maintain certain levels of regulatory capital ratios, comprised of five categories of capitalization: "well capitalized," "adequately capitalized," "undercapitalized," "significantly undercapitalized" and "critically undercapitalized." Insured depository institutions that fail to meet these capital levels are subject to increasingly strict limits on their activities, including their ability to make capital distributions, pay management compensation, grow assets and take other actions.Purchased Credit-impaired (PCI) Loan – A loan purchased as an individual loan, in a portfolio of loans or in a business combination with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination for which it is probable, upon acquisition, that the investor will be unable to collect all contractually required payments. These loans are recorded at fair value upon acquisition.Subprime Loans – Although a standard industry definition for subprime loans (including subprime mortgage loans) does not exist, the Corporation defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers, including individuals with one or a combination of high credit risk factors, such as low FICO scores, high debt to income ratios and inferior payment history. 212Table of ContentsTroubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) – Loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Certain consumer loans for which a binding offer to restructure has been extended are also classified as TDRs. Concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate to a rate that is below market on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance, loans discharged in bankruptcy or other actions intended to maximize collection. Secured consumer loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not been reaffirmed by the borrower are classified as TDRs at the time of discharge from bankruptcy. TDRs are generally reported as nonperforming loans and leases while on nonaccrual status. Nonperforming TDRs may be returned to accrual status when, among other criteria, payment in full of all amounts due under the restructured terms is expected and the borrower has demonstrated a sustained period of repayment performance, generally six months. TDRs that are on accrual status are reported as performing TDRs through the end of the calendar year in which the restructuring occurred or the year in which they are returned to accrual status. In addition, if accruing TDRs bear less than a market rate of interest at the time of modification, they are reported as performing TDRs throughout their remaining lives unless and until they cease to perform in accordance with their modified contractual terms, at which time they would be placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming TDRs.Value-at-Risk (VaR) – VaR is a model that simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss the portfolio is expected to experience with a given confidence level based on historical data. A VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios. 213Table of ContentsAcronyms   ABS Asset-backed securitiesAFS Available-for-saleALM Asset and liability managementAUM Assets under managementAVM Automated valuation modelBANA Bank of America, National AssociationBHC Bank holding companybps basis pointsCCAR Comprehensive Capital Analysis and ReviewCCF Credit conversion factorCDO Collateralized debt obligationCDS Credit default swapCFE Collateralized financing entityCLO Collateralized loan obligationCLTV Combined loan-to-valueCRA Community Reinvestment ActCVA Credit valuation adjustmentDoJ U.S. Department of JusticeDPC Derivative product companyDVA Debit valuation adjustmentEAD Exposure at defaultEMV Europay, Mastercard and VisaEPS Earnings per common shareERC Enterprise Risk CommitteeFASB Financial Accounting Standards BoardFCA Financial Conduct AuthorityFDIC Federal Deposit Insurance CorporationFHA Federal Housing AdministrationFHLB Federal Home Loan BankFHLMC Freddie MacFICC Fixed-income, currencies and commoditiesFICO Fair Isaac Corporation (credit score)FNMA Fannie MaeFOMC Federal Open Market CommitteeFTE Fully taxable-equivalentFVA Funding valuation adjustmentGAAP Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of AmericaGELS Global Excess Liquidity SourcesGNMA Government National Mortgage AssociationGPI Global Principal InvestmentsGSE Government-sponsored enterpriseG-SIB Global systemically important bankGWIM Global Wealth & Investment ManagementHELOC Home equity line of credit HQLA High Quality Liquid Assets       HTM Held-to-maturityICAAP Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment ProcessIMM Internal models methodologyIRLC Interest rate lock commitmentISDA International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.LAS Legacy Assets & ServicingLCR Liquidity Coverage RatioLGD Loss-given defaultLHFS Loans held-for-saleLIBOR London InterBank Offered RateLTV Loan-to-valueMBS Mortgage-backed securitiesMD&A Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsMI Mortgage insuranceMLGWM Merrill Lynch Global Wealth ManagementMLI  Merrill Lynch InternationalMLPCC Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing CorpMLPF&S Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.MRC Management Risk CommitteeMSA Metropolitan Statistical AreaMSR Mortgage servicing rightNPR Notice of proposed rulemakingNSFR Net Stable Funding RatioOAS Option-adjusted spreadOCI Other comprehensive incomeOTC Over-the-counterOTTI Other-than-temporary impairmentPCA Prompt Corrective ActionPCI Purchased credit-impairedPPI Payment protection insuranceRMBS Residential mortgage-backed securitiesRSU Restricted stock unit SBLC Standby letter of creditSCCL Single-Counterparty Credit LimitsSEC Securities and Exchange CommissionSFA Supervisory Formula ApproachSLR Supplementary leverage ratioSSFA Simplified Supervisory Formula Approach TDR Troubled debt restructuringTLAC Total loss-absorbing capacityVA U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs VaR Value-at-RiskVIE Variable interest entity 214Table of ContentsPart II.

Risk FactorsThe United Kingdom (U.K.) Referendum, and the potential exit of the U.K. from the European Union, could adversely affect us.We conduct business in Europe primarily through our U.K. subsidiaries. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our operations in Europe, Middle East and Africa, including the U.K., represented approximately seven percent of our total revenue, net of interest expense. A referendum was held in the U.K. on June 23, 2016, which resulted in a majority vote in favor of exiting the European Union (EU). The vote increased global economic and market uncertainty and volatility, and resulted in significant declines in the value of the British Pound. Market volatility has since reduced but the Pound has continued to show weakness. The timing of the U.K.'s formal commencement of the exit process is uncertain. Once the exit process begins, negotiations to agree on the terms of the exit are expected to be a multi-year process. During this transition period, the ultimate impact of the U.K.'s exit from the EU may remain unclear and economic and market volatility may continue to occur. If uncertainty resulting from the U.K.'s potential exit from the EU negatively impacts economic conditions, financial markets and consumer confidence, our business, results of operations, financial position and/or operational model could be adversely affected. In addition, if the terms of the exit limit the ability of our U.K. entities to conduct business in the EU or otherwise result in a significant increase in economic barriers between the U.K. and the EU, these changes could impose additional costs on us, and could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operational model. There are no other material changes from the risk factors set forth under Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 215Table of ContentsItem 2.
