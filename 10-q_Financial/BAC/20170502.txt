Following a pronounced deceleration in economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2016, there was little sign of a first quarter acceleration to start 2017. Consumer spending softened, as vehicle sales flattened at high levels and utility consumption was restrained by warmer than normal temperatures. Partially offsetting slower consumer spending, business investment (including energy-related equipment and infrastructure) strengthened on stabilizing energy costs and a lift in business confidence. Domestic final sales growth may have declined slightly below two percent on an annualized basis despite solid growth in housing construction. The labor market remained healthy, with sustained strong non-farm payroll gains in excess of 200,000 in both January and February. With signs of gradually firming inflation, the Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate target range by 25 basis points (bps) to a range of 0.75 percent to one percent in March, in line with market expectations. Consumer and business attitudes on the economy improved markedly, continuing trends that began with the Presidential election last November. Financial markets also responded to several ongoing developments: first, in response to the March rate hike and the potential for several additional hikes over 2017, the treasury yield curve flattened as short-term yields rose while longer term rates remained relatively unchanged. Second, with expectations of more expansionary fiscal policy and regulatory relief from the new Presidential Administration, equity markets rallied, with the S&P 500 index gaining over five percent in the first quarter of 2017. Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar weakened, erasing some of the previous quarter’s gains. Forward markets captured the shift in financial market expectations and risks with federal fund futures falling and equity volatility remaining stable at historically low levels throughout the quarter.Abroad, the impact of the U.K. vote to exit the EU (Brexit) has been muted to date, even as the British government approached and then triggered Article 50 of the Treaty on EU in late March. The resilient economic outlook, combined with a stronger than expected pickup in inflation, has shifted the Bank of England from a loosening to a tightening bias. Recent indicators suggest that the recovery in the eurozone has continued to gain momentum and move closer to historical trends. Inflationary pressures showed signs of building, as headline inflation moved closer to the European Central Bank’s inflation target. However, the pickup was mainly driven by food and energy prices; core inflation remained at historical low levels. As a result, although the European Central Bank kept its policy rate unchanged, it adopted a slightly more hawkish tone.The upward revision of the fourth quarter GDP indicated that the Japanese recovery has gathered momentum, driven by a strengthening of domestic demand. The new monetary policy regime of yield curve targeting has kept the Japanese yield curve in check against the global rise in long-term interest rates. Underlying inflation also showed signs of bottoming and turning positive over the quarter. In China, the service sector remained a key driver of economic growth amid signs that activity in the industrial sector could pick up steam in the coming months. The Yuan was stable against the dollar during the quarter as efforts to stem capital outflows by the government started to show improvements.Recent EventsCapital ManagementDuring the first quarter of 2017, we repurchased approximately $2.7 billion of common stock pursuant to the Board of Directors’ (the Board) authorization of our 2016 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) capital plan and to offset equity-based compensation awards. This also included repurchases related to the January 13, 2017 announcement of our plan to repurchase an additional $1.8 billion of common stock during the first half of 2017.

For additional information and a corresponding reconciliation to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 61.Financial HighlightsNet income was $4.9 billion, or $0.41 per diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $3.5 billion, or $0.28 per diluted share for the same period in 2016. The results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 were driven by higher revenue and lower provision for credit losses. Total assets increased $60.0 billion from December 31, 2016 to $2.2 trillion at March 31, 2017 primarily driven by higher cash and cash equivalents from seasonal increases in deposits and higher short-term bank funding as well as seasonal increases in trading account assets due to increased client financing activities and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell. Total liabilities increased $58.7 billion from December 31, 2016 to $2.0 trillion at March 31, 2017 primarily driven by higher securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase and short-term borrowings due to increased Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances for liquidity purposes as well as increases in trading account liabilities and a seasonal increase in deposits. Shareholders' equity increased $1.3 billion from December 31, 2016 primarily due to net income, partially offset by $2.7 billion of common stock repurchases.

Among other factors, these increases were primarily driven by the higher interest rate environment, primarily short-end rates, and growth in loans and deposits.

The following highlights the more significant changes.●Investment banking income increased $431 million driven by higher debt and equity issuance fees, and advisory fees driven by an increase in overall client activity and market fee pools.●Trading account profits increased $669 million due to a stronger performance across credit products led by mortgages, improved trading performance and increased client financing activity in equities.●Mortgage banking income decreased $311 million primarily driven by lower net servicing income and a decline in production income. Net servicing income decreased primarily due to lower mortgage servicing rights (MSR) results, net of the related hedge performance and lower servicing fees driven by a smaller servicing portfolio. Production income declined primarily due to lower volume.●Gains on sales of debt securities decreased $138 million primarily driven by lower sales volume.Provision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses decreased $162 million to $835 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily driven by credit quality improvements in energy exposures in the commercial portfolio. We expect the provision for credit losses will approximate net charge-offs for the second quarter of 2017. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Provision for Credit Losses on page 51. For more information on our energy sector exposure, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Industry Concentrations on page 47.

Personnel expense increased $306 million and included retirement-eligible incentive costs of $964 million compared to $850 million as well as seasonally elevated payroll tax costs. Also impacting the increase were higher incentive costs due to the impact of changes in share price on employee stock awards, and higher revenue-related incentive costs. Other general operating expense decreased $114 million largely driven by lower litigation expense. Income Tax Expense     Table 5Income Tax Expense          Three Months Ended March 31(Dollars in millions)2017 2016Income before income taxes$6,565 $4,977Income tax expense1,709 1,505Effective tax rate26.0% 30.2%The effective tax rates for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were driven by the impact of our recurring tax preference benefits. The effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2017 also included a tax benefit of $222 million related to new accounting guidance for the tax impact associated with share-based compensation. For additional information, see Note 11 – Shareholders’ Equity to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 30 percent for the remainder of 2017, absent unusual items. 5     Bank of America           Table 6Selected Quarterly Financial Data                      2017 Quarter 2016 Quarters(Dollars in millions, except per share information)First Fourth Third Second FirstIncome statement         Net interest income$11,058 $10,292 $10,201 $10,118 $10,485Noninterest income11,190 9,698 11,434 11,168 10,305Total revenue, net of interest expense22,248 19,990 21,635 21,286 20,790Provision for credit losses835 774 850 976 997Noninterest expense14,848 13,161 13,481 13,493 14,816Income before income taxes6,565 6,055 7,304 6,817 4,977Income tax expense1,709 1,359 2,349 2,034 1,505Net income4,856 4,696 4,955 4,783 3,472Net income applicable to common shareholders4,354 4,335 4,452 4,422 3,015Average common shares issued and outstanding10,100 10,170 10,250 10,328 10,370Average diluted common shares issued and outstanding10,915 10,959 11,000 11,059 11,100Performance ratios         Return on average assets0.88% 0.85% 0.90% 0.88% 0.64%Four quarter trailing return on average assets (1)0.88 0.82 0.76 0.74 0.73Return on average common shareholders’ equity7.27 7.04 7.27 7.40 5.11Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity (2)10.28 9.92 10.28 10.54 7.33Return on average shareholders' equity7.35 6.91 7.33 7.25 5.36Return on average tangible shareholders’ equity (2)10.00 9.38 9.98 9.93 7.40Total ending equity to total ending assets11.93 12.20 12.30 12.23 12.03Total average equity to total average assets12.01 12.24 12.28 12.13 11.98Dividend payout17.37 17.68 17.32 11.73 17.13Per common share data         Earnings $0.43 $0.43 $0.43 $0.43 $0.29Diluted earnings 0.41 0.40 0.41 0.41 0.28Dividends paid0.075 0.075 0.075 0.05 0.05Book value24.36 24.04 24.19 23.71 23.14Tangible book value (2)17.23 16.95 17.14 16.71 16.19Market price per share of common stock         Closing$23.59 $22.10 $15.65 $13.27 $13.52High closing25.50 23.16 16.19 15.11 16.43Low closing22.05 15.63 12.74 12.18 11.16Market capitalization$235,291 $222,163 $158,438 $135,577 $139,427(1) Calculated as total net income for four consecutive quarters divided by annualized average assets for four consecutive quarters.(2) Tangible equity ratios and tangible book value per share of common stock are non-GAAP financial measures.

Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on an fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis, are non-GAAP financial measures. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent and a representative state tax rate. In addition, certain performance measures including the efficiency ratio and net interest yield utilize net interest income (and thus total revenue) on an FTE basis. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield measures the bps we earn over the cost of funds. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices.We may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA)) which result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items are useful because they provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance. We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents an adjusted shareholders’ equity or common shareholders’ equity amount which has been reduced by goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity and return on average tangible shareholders’ equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals. These ratios are as follows:●Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted common shareholders’ equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by total assets less goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities.●Return on average tangible shareholders’ equity measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders’ equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders’ equity divided by total assets less goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities.●Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders’ equity divided by ending common shares outstanding.We believe that the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock.The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Table 6.Table 7 presents certain non-GAAP financial measures and performance measurements on an FTE basis.

Income on these nonperforming loans is generally recognized on a cost recovery basis. PCI loans were recorded at fair value upon acquisition and accrete interest income over the estimated life of the loan.(3) Includes non-U.S. consumer loans of $2.9 billion and $3.8 billion in the first quarter of 2017 and 2016.(4) Includes consumer finance loans of $454 million and $551 million; consumer leases of $1.9 billion and $1.4 billion, and consumer overdrafts of $170 million and $161 million in the first quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively.(5) Includes U.S. commercial real estate loans of $54.7 billion and $53.8 billion, and non-U.S. commercial real estate loans of $3.1 billion and $3.4 billion in the first quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively.(6) Interest income includes the impact of interest rate risk management contracts, which decreased interest income on the underlying assets by $17 million and $35 million in the first quarter of 2017 and 2016. Interest expense includes the impact of interest rate risk management contracts, which decreased interest expense on the underlying liabilities by $424 million and $565 million in the first quarter of 2017 and 2016. For additional information, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 58.9     Bank of AmericaBusiness Segment OperationsSegment Description and Basis of PresentationWe report our results of operations through the following four business segments: Consumer Banking, GWIM, Global Banking and Global Markets, with the remaining operations recorded in All Other. We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. We utilize a methodology that considers the effect of regulatory capital requirements in addition to internal risk- based capital models. Our internal risk-based capital models use a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment’s credit, market, interest rate, business and operational risk components. For more information on the nature of these risks, see Managing Risk on page 21.

(2) In segments and businesses where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, we allocate assets from All Other to match the segments’ and businesses’ liabilities and allocated shareholders’ equity. As a result, total earning assets and total assets of the businesses may not equal total Consumer Banking.Consumer Banking, which is comprised of Deposits and Consumer Lending, offers a diversified range of credit, banking and investment products and services to consumers and small businesses. Our customers and clients have access to a coast to  coast network including financial centers in 33 states and the District of Columbia. Our network includes approximately 4,600 financial centers, 15,900 ATMs, nationwide call centers, and online and mobile platforms.  Bank of America 10Consumer Banking ResultsNet income for Consumer Banking increased $130 million to $1.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily driven by higher net interest income and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by higher provision for credit losses. Net interest income increased $453 million to $5.8 billion primarily due to the beneficial impact of an increase in investable assets as a result of higher deposits. Noninterest income decreased $26 million to $2.5 billion.The provision for credit losses increased $307 million to $838 million due to loan growth and portfolio seasoning in the U.S. credit card portfolio. The three months ended March 31, 2017 included a net reserve increase of $66 million compared to a $208 million release for the same period in 2016. Noninterest expense decreased $132 million to $4.4 billion driven by improved operating efficiencies, partially offset by higher FDIC expense.The return on average allocated capital remained unchanged at 21 percent. For more information on capital allocations, see Business Segment Operations on page 10.DepositsDeposits includes the results of consumer deposit activities which consist of a comprehensive range of products provided to consumers and small businesses. Our deposit products include traditional savings accounts, money market savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, noninterest- and interest-bearing checking accounts, as well as investment accounts and products. Net interest income is allocated to the deposit products using our funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. Deposits generates fees such as account service fees, non-sufficient funds fees, overdraft charges and ATM fees, as well as investment and brokerage fees from Merrill Edge accounts. Merrill Edge is an integrated investing and banking service targeted at customers with less than $250,000 in investable assets. Merrill Edge provides investment advice and guidance, client brokerage asset services, a self-directed online investing platform and key banking capabilities including access to the Corporation’s network of financial centers and ATMs.Deposits includes the net impact of migrating customers and their related deposit and brokerage asset balances between Deposits and GWIM as well as other client-managed businesses. For more information on the migration of customer balances to or from GWIM, see GWIM – Net Migration Summary on page 14.Net income for Deposits increased $196 million to $1.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $371 million to $3.1 billion primarily due to the beneficial impact of an increase in investable assets as a result of higher deposits. Noninterest income increased $39 million to $1.2 billion primarily due to higher service charges. The prior-year period also included gains on certain divestitures.The provision for credit losses increased $7 million to $55 million. Noninterest expense increased $68 million to $2.5 billion primarily driven by higher FDIC expense.Average deposits increased $57.9 billion to $629.3 billion driven by strong organic growth. Growth in checking, traditional  savings and money market savings of $61.4 billion was partially offset by a decline in time deposits of $3.5 billion.

Mobile banking active users increased 2.6 million reflecting continuing changes in our customers’ banking preferences. The number of financial centers declined 130 driven by changes in customer preferences to self-service options as we continue to optimize our consumer banking network and improve our cost-to-serve.Consumer LendingConsumer Lending offers products to consumers and small businesses across the U.S. The products offered include credit and debit cards, residential mortgages and home equity loans, and direct and indirect loans such as automotive, recreational vehicle and consumer personal loans. In addition to earning net interest spread revenue on its lending activities, Consumer Lending generates interchange revenue from credit and debit card transactions, late fees, cash advance fees, annual credit card fees, mortgage banking fee income and other miscellaneous fees. Consumer Lending products are available to our customers through our retail network, direct telephone, and online and mobile channels. Consumer Lending results also include the impact of servicing residential mortgages and home equity loans in the core portfolio, including loans held on the balance sheet of Consumer Lending and loans serviced for others.We classify consumer real estate loans as core or non-core based on loan and customer characteristics such as origination date, product type, loan-to-value (LTV), Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score and delinquency status. For more information on the core and non-core portfolios, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 31. At March 31, 2017, total owned loans in the core portfolio held in Consumer Lending were $103.7 billion, an increase of $11.3 billion from March 31, 2016, primarily driven by higher residential mortgage balances, partially offset by a decline in home equity. Consumer Lending includes the net impact of migrating customers and their related loan balances between Consumer Lending and GWIM. For more information on the migration of customer balances to or from GWIM, see GWIM – Net Migration Summary on page 14.11     Bank of AmericaNet income for Consumer Lending decreased $66 million to $873 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 driven by higher provision for credit losses and lower noninterest income, partially offset by lower noninterest expense and higher net interest income. Net interest income increased $82 million to $2.7 billion primarily driven by the impact of an increase in loan balances. Noninterest income decreased $65 million to $1.3 billion driven by lower mortgage banking income, partially offset by higher card income.The provision for credit losses increased $300 million to $783 million due to loan growth and portfolio seasoning in the U.S. credit card portfolio. The three months ended March 31, 2017 included a net reserve increase of $62 million compared to a $204 million release for the same period in 2016. Noninterest expense decreased $200 million to $1.9 billion primarily driven by improved operating efficiencies.Average loans increased $19.8 billion to $253.0 billion primarily driven by increases in residential mortgages and consumer vehicle loans, partially offset by lower home equity loan balances.

Total U.S. credit card purchase volumes increased $4.2 billion to $55.3 billion and debit card purchase volumes increased $1.5 billion to $70.6 billion, reflecting higher levels of consumer spending. Mortgage Banking IncomeMortgage banking income in Consumer Banking includes production income and net servicing income. Production income is comprised primarily of revenue from the fair value gains and losses recognized on our interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and loans held-for-sale (LHFS), the related secondary market execution, and costs related to representations and warranties made in the sales transactions along with other obligations  incurred in the sales of mortgage loans. Production income decreased $84 million to $54 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 due to a decision to retain a higher percentage of residential mortgage production in Consumer Banking, as well as the impact of a higher interest rate environment driving lower refinances. Net servicing income within Consumer Banking includes income earned in connection with servicing activities and MSR valuation adjustments for the core portfolio, net of results from risk management activities used to hedge certain market risks of the MSRs. Net servicing income increased $13 million to $65 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016.Mortgage Servicing RightsAt March 31, 2017, the core MSR portfolio, held within Consumer Lending, was $1.9 billion compared to $1.8 billion at March 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by changes in fair value as well as new additions, which exceeded the amortization of expected cash flows. For more information on MSRs, see Note 14 – Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

MLGWM provides tailored solutions to meet our clients’ needs through a full set of investment management, brokerage, banking and retirement products. U.S. Trust, together with MLGWM’s Private Banking & Investments Group, provides comprehensive wealth management solutions targeted to high net worth and ultra high net worth clients, as well as customized solutions to meet clients’ wealth structuring, investment management, trust and banking needs, including specialty asset management services. Client assets managed under advisory and/or discretion of GWIM are assets under management (AUM) and are typically held in diversified portfolios. The majority of client AUM have an investment strategy with a duration of greater than one year and are, therefore, considered long-term AUM. Fees earned on long-term AUM are calculated as a percentage of total AUM. The asset management fees charged to clients per year depend on various factors, but are generally driven by the breadth of the client’s  relationship and generally range from 50 to 150 bps on their total AUM. The net client long-term AUM flows represent the net change in clients’ long-term AUM balances over a specified period of time, excluding market appreciation/depreciation and other adjustments.Net income for GWIM increased $29 million to $770 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 due to higher revenue, partially offset by an increase in expense. The operating margin was 27 percent compared to 26 percent a year ago. Net interest income increased $47 million to $1.6 billion driven by the impact of growth in loan balances. Noninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage services income, increased $76 million to $3.0 billion. The increase in noninterest income was driven by higher asset management fees primarily due to higher market valuations and long-term AUM flows, partially offset by lower transactional revenue. Noninterest expense increased $60 million to $3.3 billion primarily due to higher revenue-related incentives and FDIC expense.Return on average allocated capital was 22 percent, down from 23 percent a year ago as the impact of higher net income was more than offset by higher allocated capital.13     Bank of America     Key Indicators and Metrics      Three Months Ended March 31(Dollars in millions, except as noted) 2017 2016Revenue by Business    Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management $3,782 $3,667U.S. Trust 809 777Other (1) 1 25Total revenue, net of interest expense (FTE basis) $4,592 $4,469     Client Balances by Business, at period end     Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management $2,167,536 $1,998,145U.S. Trust 417,841 390,262Other (1) — 77,751Total client balances $2,585,377 $2,466,158     Client Balances by Type, at period end     Long-term assets under management $946,778 $812,916Liquidity assets under management (1) — 77,747Assets under management 946,778 890,663Brokerage assets 1,106,109 1,056,752Assets in custody 126,086 115,537Deposits 254,595 260,565Loans and leases (2) 151,809 142,641Total client balances $2,585,377 $2,466,158     Assets Under Management Rollforward    Assets under management, beginning of period $886,148 $900,863Net long-term client flows 29,214 (599)Net liquidity client flows — (3,820)Market valuation/other (1) 31,416 (5,781)Total assets under management, end of period $946,778 $890,663     Associates, at period end (3, 4)    Number of financial advisors 16,576 16,671Total wealth advisors, including financial advisors 18,435 18,486Total primary sales professionals, including financial advisors and wealth advisors 19,431 19,366     Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management Metric (4)    Financial advisor productivity (5) (in thousands) $999 $984     U.S. Trust Metric, at period end (4)    Primary sales professionals 1,671 1,595(1) Includes the results of BofA Global Capital Management, the cash management division of Bank of America, and certain administrative items.

The increase in AUM was primarily due to higher market valuations and positive net flows, which reflected client activity and a shift from brokerage assets to long-term AUM, partially offset by the sale of BofA Global Capital Management's liquidity AUM in the second quarter of 2016.Client balances increased $119.2 billion, or five percent, to nearly $2.6 trillion at March 31, 2017 driven by higher market valuations and positive net flows, partially offset by the impact of the sale of liquidity AUM in 2016.During the three months ended March 31, 2017, revenue from MLGWM of $3.8 billion increased three percent due to higher net interest income and asset management fees driven by higher market valuations and long-term AUM flows, partially offset by lower transactional revenue. U.S. Trust revenue of $809 million increased four percent reflecting higher net interest income and  asset management fees driven by higher market valuations and long-term AUM flows. Net Migration SummaryGWIM results are impacted by the net migration of clients and their corresponding deposit, loan and brokerage balances primarily to or from Consumer Banking, as presented in the table below. Migrations result from the movement of clients between business segments to better align with client needs.

Global Corporate Banking clients generally include large global corporations, financial institutions and leasing clients. Business Banking clients include mid-sized U.S.-based businesses requiring customized and integrated financial advice and solutions. Net income for Global Banking increased $637 million to $1.7 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 driven by higher revenue and lower provision for credit losses.Revenue increased $501 million to $5.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 driven by higher net interest income and noninterest income. Net interest income increased $229 million to $2.8 billion driven by the impact of growth in loans and leases, partially offset by loan spread compression. Noninterest income increased $272 million to $2.2 billion largely due to higher investment banking fees. The provision for credit losses decreased $536 million to $17 million driven by improvements in energy exposures. For additional information, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Industry Concentrations on page 47. Noninterest expense of $2.2 billion remained relatively unchanged as higher revenue-related incentives and FDIC expense were offset by lower other personnel and operating expense.The return on average allocated capital was 18 percent, up from 12 percent, as higher net income was partially offset by an increased capital allocation. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 10.15     Bank of AmericaGlobal Corporate, Global Commercial and Business Banking Global Corporate, Global Commercial and Business Banking each include Business Lending and Global Transaction Services activities.

Average deposits increased two percent due to continued portfolio growth with new and existing clients.Global Investment BankingClient teams and product specialists underwrite and distribute debt, equity and loan products, and provide advisory services and tailored risk management solutions. The economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Banking and Global Markets under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement.

Global Markets product coverage includes securities and derivative products in both the primary and secondary markets. Global Markets provides market-making, financing, securities clearing, settlement and custody services globally to our institutional investor clients in support of their investing and trading activities. We also work with our commercial and corporate clients to provide risk management products using interest rate, equity, credit, currency and commodity derivatives, foreign exchange, fixed-income and mortgage-related products. As a result of our market-making activities in these products, we may be required to manage risk in a broad range of financial products including government securities, equity and equity-linked securities, high-grade and high-yield corporate debt securities, syndicated loans, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), commodities and asset-backed securities (ABS). The economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are  shared primarily between Global Markets and Global Banking under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement. Global Banking originates certain deal-related transactions with our corporate and commercial clients that are executed and distributed by Global Markets. For information on investment banking fees on a consolidated basis, see page 16.Net income for Global Markets increased $324 million to $1.3 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily driven by higher sales and trading revenue and investment banking fees, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Net DVA losses were $130 million compared to gains of $154 million in the same period in 2016. Excluding net DVA, net income increased $500 million to $1.4 billion primarily driven by the same factors as described above. Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, increased $741 million primarily due to a stronger performance across credit and mortgage products. Noninterest expense increased $308 million to $2.8 billion primarily due to litigation expense in the three 17     Bank of Americamonths ended March 31, 2017 compared to a litigation recovery in the same period in 2016 and higher revenue-related expenses, partially offset by lower operating and support costs. Average earning assets increased $11.7 billion to $429.9 billion and period-end trading-related assets increased $37.7 billion to $418.3 billion both primarily driven by increased client financing activities in the global equities business.The return on average allocated capital was 15 percent, up from 11 percent, reflecting an increase in net income and a decrease in allocated capital.Sales and Trading RevenueSales and trading revenue includes unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading and other assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. Sales and trading revenue is segregated into fixed-income (government debt obligations, investment and non-investment grade corporate debt obligations, commercial MBS, residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), interest rate and credit derivative contracts), currencies (interest rate and foreign exchange contracts), commodities (primarily futures, forwards, swaps and options) and equities (equity-linked derivatives and cash equity activity). The following table and related discussion present sales and trading revenue, substantially all of which is in Global Markets, with the remainder in Global Banking. In addition, the following table and related discussion present sales and trading revenue excluding the impact of net DVA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe the use of this non-GAAP financial measure provides additional useful information to assess the underlying performance of these businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance.

FICC net DVA losses were $120 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to net DVA gains of $140 million for the same period in 2016. Equities net DVA losses were $10 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to net DVA gains of $14 million for the same period in 2016.The explanations for period-over-period changes in sales and trading, FICC and Equities revenue, as set forth below, would be the same if net DVA was included.FICC revenue, excluding net DVA, increased $665 million due to a more favorable market environment in credit and mortgage products with increased client activity combining for a stronger financial performance. Equities revenue, excluding net DVA, increased $76 million primarily due to stronger performance internationally in derivatives and client financing on improved investor sentiment.

Such allocated assets were $522.0 billion and $493.5 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, and $543.4 billion and $518.7 billion at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.(2) Includes $9.5 billion and $9.2 billion of non-U.S. credit card, which are included in assets of business held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. n/m = not meaningfulAll Other consists of ALM activities, equity investments, the non-U.S. consumer credit card business, non-core mortgage loans and servicing activities, the net impact of periodic revisions to the MSR valuation model for both core and non-core MSRs and the related economic hedge results and ineffectiveness, other liquidating businesses, residual expense allocations and other. ALM activities encompass certain residential mortgages, debt securities, interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities, the impact of certain allocation methodologies and accounting hedge ineffectiveness. The results of certain ALM activities are allocated to our business segments. For more information on our ALM activities, see Note 17 – Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Equity investments include our merchant services joint venture as well as Global Principal Investments (GPI) which is comprised of a portfolio of equity, real estate and other alternative investments. For more information on our merchant services joint venture, see Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. On December 20, 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell our non-U.S. consumer credit card business to a third party. Subject to regulatory approval, this transaction is expected to close by mid-2017. For more information on the sale of our non-U.S. consumer credit card business, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The Corporation classifies consumer real estate loans as core or non-core based on loan and customer characteristics such as  origination date, product type, LTV, FICO score and delinquency status. For more information on the core and non-core portfolios, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 31. Residential mortgage loans that are held for ALM purposes, including interest rate or liquidity risk management, are classified as core and are presented on the balance sheet of All Other. For more information on our interest rate and liquidity risk management activities, see Liquidity Risk on page 28 and Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 58. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, residential mortgage loans held for ALM activities decreased $1.9 billion to $32.8 billion at March 31, 2017 primarily as a result of payoffs, paydowns and loan sales outpacing new originations. Non-core residential mortgage and home equity loans, which are principally run-off portfolios, including certain loans accounted for under the fair value option and MSRs pertaining to non-core loans serviced for others, are also held in All Other. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, total non-core loans decreased $2.7 billion to $50.4 billion at March 31, 2017 due largely to payoffs and paydowns, as well as loan sales. The net loss for All Other decreased $264 million to $834 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 due to lower noninterest expense and a higher income tax benefit, partially offset by lower mortgage banking income, lower gains on sales of debt securities and a decrease in the benefit in the provision for credit losses. 19     Bank of AmericaMortgage banking income in All Other decreased $240 million primarily driven by lower MSR results, net of the related hedge performance, and lower servicing fees driven by a smaller servicing portfolio. Gains on sales of loans, including nonperforming and other delinquent loans were $17 million compared to gains of $157 million in the same period in 2016.The benefit in the provision for credit losses decreased $95 million to a benefit of $26 million resulting in lower reserve releases in the non-core consumer real estate loan portfolio as it continues to run-off. Noninterest expense decreased $193 million to $2.2 billion driven by lower litigation expense and a decline in non-core mortgage servicing costs. Annual retirement-eligible incentive costs of $964 million and $850 million were recorded on a consolidated basis for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. These costs are allocated to the business segments throughout the year. The income tax benefit was $1.4 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to a benefit of $889 million in the same period in 2016. The increase was driven by a $222 million tax benefit related to new accounting guidance effective this quarter for the tax impact associated with share-based compensation, and the change in the pretax loss. Both periods include income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual ObligationsWe have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties. For more information on obligations and commitments, see Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations in the MD&A of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as Note 11 – Long-term Debt and Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Representations and WarrantiesWe securitize first-lien residential mortgage loans generally in the form of RMBS guaranteed by the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), which include Freddie Mac (FHLMC) and Fannie Mae (FNMA), or by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) in the case of Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-insured, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed and Rural Housing Service-guaranteed mortgage loans, and sell pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans in the form of whole loans. In addition, in prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans. In connection with these transactions, we or certain of our subsidiaries or legacy companies make and have made various representations and warranties. Breaches of these representations and warranties have resulted in and may continue to result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage loans or to otherwise make whole or provide other remedies to investors, securitization trusts, guarantors, insurers or other parties (collectively, repurchases). At both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had $18.3 billion of unresolved repurchase claims, predominately  related to subprime and pay option first-lien loans and home equity loans. Outstanding repurchase claims remain unresolved primarily due to (1) the level of detail, support and analysis accompanying such claims, which impact overall claim quality and, therefore, claim resolution and (2) the lack of an established process to resolve disputes related to these claims.In addition to unresolved repurchase claims, we have received notifications from sponsors of third-party securitizations with whom we engaged in whole-loan transactions indicating that we may have indemnity obligations with respect to loans for which we have not received a repurchase request. These outstanding notifications totaled $1.3 billion at both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. There were no new notifications received during the three months ended March 31, 2017.The liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related provision is included in mortgage banking income. At March 31, 2017 and 2016, the liability for representations and warranties was $2.3 billion and $2.8 billion. The representations and warranties provision was a benefit of $3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to a provision of $42 million for the same period in 2016.In addition, we currently estimate that the range of possible loss for representations and warranties exposures could be up to $2 billion over existing accruals at March 31, 2017. The estimated range of possible loss represents a reasonably possible loss, but does not represent a probable loss, and is based on currently available information, significant judgment and a number of assumptions that are subject to change. Future provisions and/or ranges of possible loss associated with obligations under representations and warranties may be significantly impacted if future experiences are different from historical experience or our understandings, interpretations or assumptions. Adverse developments, with respect to one or more of the assumptions underlying the liability for representations and warranties and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss, such as counterparties successfully challenging or avoiding the application of the relevant statute of limitations, could result in significant increases to future provisions and/or the estimated range of possible loss. For more information on representations and warranties, see Note 7 – Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees to the Consolidated Financial Statements and, for more information related to the sensitivity of the assumptions used to estimate our liability for representations and warranties, see Complex Accounting Estimates – Representations and Warranties Liability in the MD&A of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Other Mortgage-related MattersWe continue to be subject to additional mortgage-related litigation and disputes, as well as governmental and regulatory scrutiny and investigations, related to our past and current origination, servicing, transfer of servicing and servicing rights, servicing compliance obligations, foreclosure activities, indemnification obligations, and mortgage insurance and captive reinsurance practices with mortgage insurers. The ongoing environment of additional regulation, increased regulatory compliance obligations, and enhanced regulatory enforcement, combined with ongoing uncertainty related to the continuing evolution of the regulatory environment, has resulted in increased operational and compliance costs and may limit our ability to continue providing   Bank of America 20certain products and services. For more information on management’s estimate of the aggregate range of possible loss for certain litigation matters and on regulatory investigations, see Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Managing RiskRisk is inherent in all our business activities. The seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risks can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. The Corporation takes a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement which are approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC) and the Board.Our Risk Framework is the foundation for comprehensive management of the risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth clear roles, responsibilities and accountability for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities.Our Risk Appetite Statement is intended to ensure that the Corporation maintains an acceptable risk profile by providing a common framework and a comparable set of measures for senior management and the Board to clearly indicate the level of risk the Corporation is willing to accept. Risk appetite is set at least annually in conjunction with the strategic, capital and financial operating plans to align risk appetite with the Corporation's strategy and financial resources. Our line of business strategies and risk appetite are also similarly aligned. For more information on our risk management activities, including our Risk Framework, and the key types of risk faced by the Corporation, see the Managing Risk through Reputational Risk sections in the MD&A of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Capital ManagementThe Corporation manages its capital position so its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and to maintain capital, risk and risk appetite commensurate with one another. Additionally, we seek to maintain safety and soundness at all times, even under adverse scenarios, take advantage of organic growth opportunities, meet obligations to creditors and counterparties, maintain ready access to financial markets, continue to serve as  a credit intermediary, remain a source of strength for our subsidiaries, and satisfy current and future regulatory capital requirements. Capital management is integrated into our risk and governance processes, as capital is a key consideration in the development of our strategic plan, risk appetite and risk limits. We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. For additional information, see Business Segment Operations on page 10.CCAR and Capital PlanningThe Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and requests for capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the CCAR capital plan.Our 2016 CCAR capital plan included requests: (i) to repurchase $5.0 billion of common stock over four quarters beginning in the third quarter of 2016, (ii) to repurchase common stock to offset the dilution resulting from certain equity-based compensation awards, and (iii) to increase the quarterly common stock dividend from $0.05 per share to $0.075 per share. On January 13, 2017, we announced a plan to repurchase an additional $1.8 billion of common stock during the first half of 2017, outside of the scope of the 2016 CCAR capital plan, to which the Federal Reserve did not object. The common stock repurchase authorization includes both common stock and warrants. As of March 31, 2017, we have repurchased $5.5 billion in connection with our 2016 CCAR capital plan and this additional authorization.The timing and amount of common stock repurchases will be subject to various factors, including the Corporation’s capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price, and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. The common stock repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a “well-capitalized” BHC, we may notify the Federal Reserve of our intention to make additional capital distributions not to exceed one percent of Tier 1 capital (0.25 percent of Tier 1 capital beginning April 1, 2017), and which were not contemplated in our capital plan, subject to the Federal Reserve's non-objection.In April 2017, we submitted our 2017 CCAR capital plan and related supervisory stress tests. The Federal Reserve has announced that it will release CCAR capital plan summary results, including supervisory projections of capital ratios, losses and revenues under stress scenarios, and publish the results of stress tests conducted under the supervisory adverse and supervisory severely adverse scenarios by June 30, 2017.21     Bank of AmericaRegulatory CapitalAs a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules issued by U.S. banking regulators including Basel 3, which includes certain transition provisions through January 1, 2019. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Basel 3 Advanced approaches institutions. Basel 3 OverviewBasel 3 updated the composition of capital and established a Common equity tier 1 capital ratio. Common equity tier 1 capital primarily includes common stock, retained earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI), net of deductions and adjustments primarily related to goodwill, deferred tax assets, intangibles, MSRs and defined benefit pension assets. Under the Basel 3 regulatory capital transition provisions, certain deductions and adjustments to Common equity tier 1 capital are phased in through January 1, 2018. As of January 1, 2017, under the transition provisions, 80 percent of these deductions and adjustments was recognized. Basel 3 also revised minimum capital ratios and buffer requirements, added a supplementary leverage ratio (SLR), and addressed the adequately capitalized minimum requirements under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. Finally, Basel 3 established two methods of calculating risk-weighted assets, the Standardized approach and the Advanced approaches. The Standardized approach relies primarily on supervisory risk weights based on exposure type, and the Advanced approaches determine risk weights based on internal models. As an Advanced approaches institution, we are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy including under the PCA framework.Minimum Capital RequirementsMinimum capital requirements and related buffers are being phased in from January 1, 2014 through January 1, 2019. The PCA framework establishes categories of capitalization including “well capitalized,” based on the Basel 3 regulatory ratio  requirements. U.S. banking regulators are required to take certain mandatory actions depending on the category of capitalization, with no mandatory actions required for “well-capitalized” banking organizations, which included BANA at March 31, 2017. We are subject to a capital conservation buffer, a countercyclical capital buffer and a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge that are being phased in over a three-year period ending January 1, 2019. Once fully phased in, the Corporation’s risk-based capital ratio requirements will include a capital conservation buffer greater than 2.5 percent, plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a G-SIB surcharge in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of Common equity tier 1 capital. Under the phase-in provisions, we were required to maintain a capital conservation buffer greater than 1.25 percent plus a G-SIB surcharge of 1.5 percent at March 31, 2017. The countercyclical capital buffer is currently set at zero. We estimate that our fully phased-in G-SIB surcharge will be 2.5 percent. The G-SIB surcharge may differ from this estimate over time. For more information on the Corporation's transition and fully phased-in capital ratios and regulatory requirements, see Table 9.Supplementary Leverage RatioBasel 3 also requires Advanced approaches institutions to disclose an SLR. The numerator of the SLR is quarter-end Basel 3 Tier 1 capital. The denominator is total leverage exposure based on the daily average of the sum of on-balance sheet exposures less permitted Tier 1 deductions, as well as the simple average of certain off-balance sheet exposures, as of the end of each month in a quarter. Effective January 1, 2018, the Corporation will be required to maintain a minimum SLR of 3.0 percent, plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Insured depository institution subsidiaries of BHCs will be required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered "well capitalized" under the PCA framework.  Bank of America 22Capital Composition and RatiosTable 9 presents Bank of America Corporation’s transition and fully phased-in capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Fully phased-in estimates are non-GAAP financial measures that the Corporation  considers to be useful measures in evaluating compliance with new regulatory capital requirements that are not yet effective. For reconciliations to GAAP financial measures, see Table 12. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Corporation meets the definition of “well capitalized” under current regulatory requirements.

The approach that yields the lower ratio is to be used to assess capital adequacy and was the Advanced approaches method at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.(2) The March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 amounts include a transition capital conservation buffer of 1.25 percent and 0.625 percent, and a transition G-SIB surcharge of 1.5 percent and 0.75 percent. The countercyclical capital buffer for both periods is zero.(3) Basel 3 fully phased-in Advanced approaches estimates assume approval by U.S. banking regulators of our internal analytical models, including approval of the internal models methodology (IMM) for calculating counterparty credit risk regulatory capital for derivatives. Basel 3 fully phased-in Common equity tier 1 capital ratio would be reduced by approximately 25 bps if IMM is not used.(4) Fully phased-in regulatory minimums assume a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent and estimated G-SIB surcharge of 2.5 percent. The estimated fully phased-in countercyclical capital buffer is currently set at zero. We will be subject to fully phased-in regulatory minimums on January 1, 2019. The fully phased-in SLR minimum assumes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent and is applicable on January 1, 2018.(5) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losses.(6) Reflects adjusted average total assets for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.Common equity tier 1 capital under Basel 3 Advanced – Transition was $167.4 billion at March 31, 2017, a decrease of $1.5 billion compared to December 31, 2016 driven by the phase-in under Basel 3 transition provisions of deductions, primarily related to deferred tax assets, common stock repurchases and dividends, partially offset by earnings. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, Total capital decreased $869 million primarily driven by the same factors as the decrease in Common  equity tier 1 capital, along with maturities of subordinated debt and phase-out under the Basel 3 transition provisions of trust preferred securities.Risk-weighted assets decreased $13 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2017 to $1,517 billion primarily due to lower credit card exposures, lower market risk, and lower exposures and improved credit quality on legacy retail products.23     Bank of AmericaTable 10 presents the capital composition as measured under Basel 3 – Transition at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

We estimate our minimum required external TLAC would be the greater of 22.5 percent of risk-weighted assets or 9.5 percent of SLR leverage exposure. In addition, U.S. G-SIBs must meet a minimum long-term debt requirement. Our minimum required long-term debt is estimated to be the greater of 8.5 percent of risk-weighted assets or 4.5 percent of SLR leverage exposure. The impact of the TLAC rule is not expected to be material to our results of operations.Revisions to Approaches for Measuring Risk-weighted AssetsThe Basel Committee has several open proposals to revise key methodologies for measuring risk-weighted assets. The proposals include a standardized approach for credit risk, standardized approach for operational risk, revisions to the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk framework and constraints on the use of internal models. The Basel Committee has also finalized a revised standardized model for counterparty credit risk, revisions to the securitization framework and its fundamental review of the trading book, which updates both modeled and standardized approaches for market risk measurement. These revisions are to be coupled with a proposed capital floor framework to limit the extent to which banks can reduce risk-weighted asset levels through the use of internal models, both at the input parameter and aggregate risk-weighted asset level. The Basel Committee expects to finalize the outstanding proposals in 2017. U.S. banking regulators may update the U.S. Basel 3 rules to incorporate the Basel Committee revisions.Revisions to the G-SIB Assessment FrameworkOn March 30, 2017, the Basel Committee issued a consultative document with proposed revisions to the G-SIB surcharge assessment framework. The proposed revisions would include removing the cap on the substitutability category, expanding the scope of consolidation to include insurance subsidiaries in three categories (size, interconnectedness and complexity) and modifying the substitutability category weights with the  introduction of a new trading volume indicator. The Basel Committee has also requested feedback on a new short-term wholesale funding indicator, which would be included in the interconnectedness category. The U.S. banking regulators may update the U.S. G-SIB surcharge rule to incorporate the Basel Committee revisions.For more information on our Regulatory Developments see Capital Management – Regulatory Developments in the MD&A of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Broker-dealer Regulatory Capital and Securities RegulationThe Corporation’s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (MLPF&S) and Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp (MLPCC). MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of MLPF&S and provides clearing and settlement services. Both entities are subject to the net capital requirements of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 15c3-1. Both entities are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Regulation 1.17.MLPF&S has elected to compute the minimum capital requirement in accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirement as permitted by SEC Rule 15c3-1. At March 31, 2017, MLPF&S’s regulatory net capital as defined by Rule 15c3-1 was $12.5 billion and exceeded the minimum requirement of $1.7 billion by $10.8 billion. MLPCC’s net capital of $3.4 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $518 million by $2.9 billion.In accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirements, MLPF&S is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion, net capital in excess of $500 million and notify the SEC in the event its tentative net capital is less than $5.0 billion. At March 31, 2017, MLPF&S had tentative net capital and net capital in excess of the minimum and notification requirements.Merrill Lynch International (MLI), a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority, and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At March 31, 2017, MLI’s capital resources were $35.4 billion which exceeded the minimum requirement of $16.5 billion.

To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks.We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as those obligations arise. We manage our liquidity position through line of business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management within Corporate Treasury enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. For more information regarding global funding and liquidity risk management, see Liquidity Risk – Time-to-required Funding and Stress Modeling in the MD&A of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.NB Holdings, Inc.We have intercompany arrangements with certain key subsidiaries under which we transferred certain of our parent company assets, and agreed to transfer certain additional parent company assets, to NB Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned holding company subsidiary (NB Holdings). The parent company is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets.In consideration for the transfer of assets, NB Holdings issued a subordinated note to the parent company in a principal amount equal to the value of the transferred assets. The aggregate principal amount of the note will increase by the amount of any future asset transfers. NB Holdings also provided the parent company with a committed line of credit that allows the parent company to draw funds necessary to service near-term cash needs. These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the parent company would be resolved under the U.S Bankruptcy Code. These arrangements include provisions to terminate the line of credit, forgive the subordinated note and require the parent company to transfer its remaining financial assets to NB Holdings if our projected liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution of the parent company becomes imminent.Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered AssetsWe maintain liquidity available to the Corporation, including the parent company and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Our liquidity buffer, referred to as Global Liquidity Sources (GLS), is comprised of assets that are readily available to the parent company and selected subsidiaries, including holding company, bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, even during stressed market conditions. Our cash is primarily on deposit with the Federal Reserve and, to a  lesser extent, central banks outside of the U.S. We limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS and a select group of non-U.S. government securities. We believe we can quickly obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold our GLS in legal entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses, and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities.Our GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. For more information on the final LCR rules, see Liquidity Risk – Basel 3 Liquidity Standards on page 29.Our GLS were $519 billion and $499 billion at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 and were as shown in Table 15.       Table 15Global Liquidity Sources               Average Three Months Ended March 31 2017(Dollars in billions)March 31 2017 December 31 2016 Parent company and NB Holdings$79 $76 $78Bank subsidiaries392 372 381Other regulated entities48 51 48Total Global Liquidity Sources$519 $499 $507As shown in Table 15, parent company and NB Holdings liquidity totaled $79 billion and $76 billion at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The increase in parent company and NB Holdings liquidity was primarily due to net debt issuance during the quarter. Typically, parent company and NB Holdings liquidity is in the form of cash deposited with BANA.Liquidity held at our bank subsidiaries totaled $392 billion and $372 billion at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The increase in bank subsidiaries’ liquidity was primarily due to net FHLB advances and deposit growth. Liquidity at bank subsidiaries excludes the cash deposited by the parent company and NB Holdings. Our bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain FHLBs and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $292 billion and $310 billion at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries and can only be transferred to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries with prior regulatory approval.Liquidity held at our other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, totaled $48 billion and $51 billion at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The decrease in other regulated entities’ liquidity was primarily due to broker-dealer funding requirements. Our other regulated entities also held unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we   Bank of America 28believe could be used to generate additional liquidity. Liquidity held in an other regulated entity is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity and transfers to the parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements.Table 16 presents the composition of GLS at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.     Table 16Global Liquidity Sources Composition   (Dollars in billions)March 31 2017 December 31 2016Cash on deposit$132 $106U.S. Treasury securities59 58U.S. agency securities and mortgage-backed securities317 318Non-U.S. government securities11 17Total Global Liquidity Sources$519 $499Time-to-required Funding and Liquidity Stress AnalysisWe use a variety of metrics to determine the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries. One metric we use to evaluate the appropriate level of liquidity at the parent company and NB Holdings is “time-to-required funding (TTF).” This debt coverage measure indicates the number of months the parent company can continue to meet its unsecured contractual obligations as they come due using only the parent company and NB Holdings' liquidity sources without issuing any new debt or accessing any additional liquidity sources. We define unsecured contractual obligations for purposes of this metric as maturities of senior or subordinated debt issued or guaranteed by Bank of America Corporation. These include certain unsecured debt instruments, primarily structured liabilities, which we may be required to settle for cash prior to maturity. TTF was 40 months at March 31, 2017 compared to 35 months at December 31, 2016. The increase in TTF was driven by debt issuances outpacing maturities.We also utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries. The liquidity stress testing process is an integral part of analyzing our potential contractual and contingent cash outflows. We evaluate the liquidity requirements under a range of scenarios with varying levels of severity and time horizons. The scenarios we consider and utilize incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific events, including potential credit rating downgrades for the parent company and our subsidiaries, and more severe events including potential resolution scenarios. The scenarios are based on our historical experience, experience of distressed and failed financial institutions, regulatory guidance, and both expected and unexpected future events.The types of potential contractual and contingent cash outflows we consider in our scenarios may include, but are not limited to, upcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt and reductions in new debt issuance; diminished access to secured financing markets; potential deposit withdrawals; increased draws on loan commitments, liquidity facilities and letters of credit; additional collateral that counterparties could call if our credit ratings were downgraded; collateral and margin requirements arising from market value changes; and potential liquidity required to maintain businesses and finance customer activities. Changes in certain market factors, including, but not limited to, credit rating  downgrades, could negatively impact potential contractual and contingent outflows and the related financial instruments, and in some cases these impacts could be material to our financial results.We consider all sources of funds that we could access during each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available sources with corresponding liquidity requirements by legal entity. We also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset and liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses.Basel 3 Liquidity StandardsBasel 3 has two liquidity risk-related standards: the LCR and the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution’s unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. The LCR regulatory requirement of 100 percent as of January 1, 2017 is applicable to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. As of March 31, 2017, the consolidated Corporation and its insured depository institutions were above the 2017 LCR requirements. Our LCR may fluctuate from period to period due to normal business flows from customer activity. Beginning with the second quarter 2017 results, we will be required to disclose publicly, on a quarterly basis, quantitative information about our LCR calculation and a discussion of the factors that have a significant effect on our LCR. We plan on disclosing this information in a Pillar 3 Liquidity Disclosure report on our Investor Relations website.U.S. banking regulators have issued a proposal for an NSFR requirement applicable to U.S. financial institutions following the Basel Committee's final standard. While not finalized, the U.S. NSFR would apply to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions beginning on January 1, 2018. We expect to meet the NSFR requirement within the regulatory timeline. The standard is intended to reduce funding risk over a longer time horizon. The NSFR is designed to ensure an appropriate amount of stable funding, generally capital and liabilities maturing beyond one year, given the mix of assets and off-balance sheet items.Diversified Funding SourcesWe fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups.The primary benefits of our centralized funding approach include greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations, time zone differences or other business considerations make parent company funding impractical, certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt.We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.27 trillion and $1.26 trillion at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Deposits are primarily generated by our Consumer Banking, GWIM and Global Banking segments. These deposits are diversified by clients, product type and geography, and the majority of our U.S. deposits are insured by the FDIC. We consider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of funding. We believe 29     Bank of Americathis deposit funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources. Our lending activities may also be financed through secured borrowings, including credit card securitizations and securitizations with GSEs, the FHA and private-label investors, as well as FHLB loans.Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. We believe funding these activities in the secured financing markets is more cost-efficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing. Repurchase agreements are generally short-term and often overnight. Disruptions in secured financing markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant reductions in the availability of such financing. We manage the liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding globally from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when appropriate. For more information on secured financing agreements, see Note 9 – Federal Funds Sold or Purchased, Securities Financing Agreements  and Short-term Borrowings to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We issue long-term unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. While the cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or the Corporation, we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month or quarter.During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we issued $17.1 billion of long-term debt consisting of $12.7 billion for Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of which was TLAC compliant, $2.0 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $2.4 billion of other debt.Table 17 presents the carrying value of aggregate annual contractual maturities of long-term debt as of March 31, 2017. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we had total long-term debt maturities and purchases of $13.5 billion consisting of $6.0 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $4.3 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $3.2 billion of other debt.

We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity and other factors. In addition, our other regulated entities may make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. For information on long-term debt funding, see Note 11 – Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K and for more information regarding funding and liquidity risk management, see Liquidity Risk – Time-to-required Funding and Stress Modeling in the MD&A of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Bank of America 30We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For more information on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 58.We may also issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes for client purposes, certain of which qualify as TLAC eligible debt. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we issued $682 million of structured notes, which are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price.Contingency PlanningWe maintain contingency funding plans that outline our potential responses to liquidity stress events at various levels of severity. These policies and plans are based on stress scenarios and include potential funding strategies and communication and notification procedures that we would implement in the event we  experienced stressed liquidity conditions. We periodically review and test the contingency funding plans to validate efficacy and assess readiness.Our U.S. bank subsidiaries can access contingency funding through the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries have access to central bank facilities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. While we do not rely on these sources in our liquidity modeling, we maintain the policies, procedures and governance processes that would enable us to access these sources if necessary.Credit RatingsCredit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Table 19 presents the Corporation's current long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies. These ratings have not changed from those disclosed in the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information on credit ratings, see Liquidity Risk – Credit Ratings in the MD&A of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.For information on the additional collateral and termination payments that could be required in connection with certain over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts and other trading agreements as a result of such a credit rating downgrade, see Note 2 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein and Item 1A.

Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such  as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience. These models are a component of our consumer credit risk management process and are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk.Consumer Credit PortfolioImprovement in the U.S. unemployment rate and home prices continued during the three months ended March 31, 2017 resulting in improved credit quality and lower credit losses in the consumer real estate portfolio compared to the same period in 2016. The 30 and 90 days or more past due balances declined across most consumer loan portfolios during the three months ended March 31, 2017 as a result of improved delinquency trends.31     Bank of AmericaImproved credit quality, continued loan balance run-off and sales in the consumer real estate portfolio drove an $86 million decrease in the consumer allowance for loan and lease losses in the three months ended March 31, 2017 to $6.1 billion at March 31, 2017.

In connection with an agreement to sell our non-U.S. consumer credit card business, this business, which includes $9.5 billion and $9.2 billion of non-U.S. credit card loans and related allowance  for loan and lease losses of $242 million and $243 million, is presented in assets of business held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. In this section, all applicable amounts and ratios include these balances, unless otherwise noted.Table 20 presents our outstanding consumer loans and leases, and the PCI loan portfolio. In addition to being included in the “Outstandings” columns in Table 20, PCI loans are also shown separately in the “Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio” columns. The impact of the PCI loan portfolio on certain credit statistics is reported where appropriate.

Nonperforming loans do not include past due consumer credit card loans, other unsecured loans and in general, consumer loans not secured by real estate (loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy are included) as these loans are typically charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. Real estate-secured past due consumer loans that are insured by the FHA or individually insured under long-term standby agreements  with FNMA and FHLMC (collectively, the fully-insured loan portfolio) are reported as accruing as opposed to nonperforming since the principal repayment is insured. Fully-insured loans included in accruing past due 90 days or more are primarily from our repurchases of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA. Additionally, nonperforming loans and accruing balances past due 90 days or more do not include the PCI loan portfolio or loans accounted for under the fair value option even though the customer may be contractually past due.

For more information on PCI write-offs, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 39.(2) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option.Net charge-off ratios, excluding the PCI and fully-insured loan portfolios, were 0.05 percent and 0.26 percent for residential mortgage, 0.42 percent and 0.64 percent for home equity and 0.82 percent and 0.93 percent for the total consumer portfolio for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These are the only product classifications that include PCI and fully-insured loans.Net charge-offs, as shown in Tables 22 and 23, exclude write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio of $9 million and $39 million in  residential mortgage and $24 million and $66 million in home equity for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. Net charge-off ratios including the PCI write-offs were 0.06 percent and 0.28 percent for residential mortgage and 0.55 percent and 0.95 percent for home equity for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. For more information on PCI write-offs, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 39.33     Bank of AmericaTable 23 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances, net charge-offs, allowance for loan and lease losses and provision for loan and lease losses for the core and non-core portfolios within the consumer real estate portfolio. We categorize consumer real estate loans as core and non-core based on loan and customer characteristics such as origination date, product type, LTV, FICO score and delinquency status consistent with our current consumer and mortgage servicing strategy. Generally, loans that were originated after January 1, 2010, qualified under government-sponsored enterprise underwriting guidelines, or otherwise met our underwriting guidelines in place in 2015 are characterized as core loans. Loans held in legacy private-label securitizations, government-insured loans originated prior to 2010, loan products no longer originated, and loans originated prior to 2010 and classified as nonperforming or modified in a TDR prior to 2016  are generally characterized as non-core loans, and are principally run-off portfolios. Core loans as reported in Table 23 include loans held in the Consumer Banking and GWIM segments, as well as loans held for ALM activities in All Other. For more information on core and non-core loans, see Note 4 – Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As shown in Table 23, outstanding core consumer real estate loans increased $2.2 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2017 driven by an increase of $3.9 billion in residential mortgage, partially offset by a $1.6 billion decrease in home equity. The increase in residential mortgage was due to a decision to retain a higher percentage of residential mortgage production in Consumer Banking and GWIM. The decrease in home equity was driven by paydowns outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines.

For more information on the fair value option, see Note 15 – Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(2) Net charge-offs exclude write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio. For more information on PCI write-offs, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 39.We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following discussions of the  residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we provide information that excludes the impact of the PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option in certain credit quality statistics. We separately disclose information on the PCI loan portfolio on page 39.  Bank of America 34Residential MortgageThe residential mortgage portfolio makes up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 43 percent of consumer loans and leases at March 31, 2017. Approximately 35 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio is in GWIM and represents residential mortgages originated for the home purchase and refinancing needs of our wealth management clients. Approximately 34 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio is in All Other and is comprised of originated loans, purchased loans used in our overall ALM activities, delinquent FHA loans repurchased pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA as well as loans repurchased related to our representations and warranties. The remaining portion of the portfolio is primarily in Consumer Banking.Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, increased $2.0 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2017 as retention of new originations was partially offset by loan sales of $687 million, and run-off. At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the residential mortgage portfolio included $27.6 billion and $28.7 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans. On this portion of the residential  mortgage portfolio, we are protected against principal loss as a result of either FHA insurance or long-term standby agreements that provide for the transfer of credit risk to FNMA and FHLMC. At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, $21.0 billion and $22.3 billion had FHA insurance with the remainder protected by long-term standby agreements. At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, $6.8 billion and $7.4 billion of the FHA-insured loan population were repurchases of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA.Table 24 presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, and excluding the PCI loan portfolio, our fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. Additionally, in the “Reported Basis” columns in the table below, accruing balances past due and nonperforming loans do not include the PCI loan portfolio, in accordance with our accounting policies, even though the customer may be contractually past due. As such, the following discussion presents the residential mortgage portfolio excluding the PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. For more information on the PCI loan portfolio, see page 39.

(2) These vintages of loans account for $880 million, or 32 percent, and $931 million, or 31 percent, of nonperforming residential mortgage loans at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, these vintages accounted for $5 million, or 30 percent, and $7 million, or eight percent of total residential mortgage net charge-offs.(3) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as annualized net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option.Nonperforming residential mortgage loans decreased $327 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017 as outflows, including a transfer to held-for-sale of $143 million and sales of $142 million, outpaced new inflows. Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at March 31, 2017, $869 million, or 32 percent, were current on contractual payments. Loans accruing past due 30 days or more decreased $504 million primarily due to an improvement in collections associated with the consumer real estate servicer conversion that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2016. Net charge-offs decreased $74 million to $17 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $91 million for the same period in 2016. This decrease in net charge-offs was primarily driven by recoveries of $11 million related to nonperforming loan sales during the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to nonperforming loan sale-related charge-offs of $42 million for the same period in 2016. Additionally, net  charge-offs declined driven by favorable portfolio trends and decreased write-downs on loans greater than 180 days past due, which were written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell, due in part to improvement in home prices and the U.S. economy.Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent represented two percent and three percent of the residential mortgage loan portfolio at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Of the loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent, 99 percent and 98 percent were performing at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where the outstanding carrying value of the loan is greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. The majority of these loans have a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent primarily due to home price deterioration since 2006, partially offset by subsequent appreciation. 35     Bank of AmericaOf the $156.5 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at March 31, 2017, as shown in Table 25, 36 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $11.0 billion, or 19 percent, at March 31, 2017. Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally have experienced a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At March 31, 2017, $272 million, or two percent of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $1.3 billion, or one percent for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at March 31, 2017, $456 million, or four percent of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $239 million were contractually current, compared to $2.7 billion, or two percent for the entire residential mortgage portfolio, of which $869 million were contractually current. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential  mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three to ten years. More than 80 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2020 or later.Table 25 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 16 percent and 15 percent of outstandings at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, loans within this MSA contributed net charge-offs of $5 million and net recoveries of $3 million within the residential mortgage portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 12 percent of outstandings at both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, loans within this MSA contributed a net recovery of $1 million and net charge-offs of $22 million within the residential mortgage portfolio.

There were no other significant single state concentrations.Home EquityAt March 31, 2017, the home equity portfolio made up 14 percent of the consumer portfolio and is comprised of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages.At March 31, 2017, our HELOC portfolio had an outstanding balance of $56.4 billion, or 88 percent of the total home equity portfolio compared to $58.6 billion, or 88 percent, at December 31, 2016. HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years and the borrowers typically are only required to pay the interest due on the loans on a monthly basis. After the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15-year amortizing loans.At March 31, 2017, our home equity loan portfolio had an outstanding balance of $5.5 billion, or nine percent of the total home equity portfolio compared to $5.9 billion, or nine percent, at December 31, 2016. Home equity loans are almost all fixed-rate loans with amortizing payment terms of 10 to 30 years and of the $5.5 billion at March 31, 2017, 56 percent have 25- to 30-year terms. At March 31, 2017, our reverse mortgage portfolio had an outstanding balance, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, of $2.0 billion, or three percent of the total  home equity portfolio compared to $1.9 billion, or three percent, at December 31, 2016. We no longer originate reverse mortgages. At March 31, 2017, approximately 67 percent of the home equity portfolio was in Consumer Banking, 25 percent was in All Other and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM. Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, decreased $2.5 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2017 primarily due to paydowns and charge-offs outpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. Of the total home equity portfolio at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, $19.3 billion and $19.6 billion, or 30 percent and 29 percent, were in first-lien positions (32 percent and 31 percent excluding the PCI home equity portfolio). At March 31, 2017, outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $10.5 billion, or 17 percent of our total home equity portfolio excluding the PCI loan portfolio.Unused HELOCs totaled $46.9 billion at March 31, 2017 compared to $47.2 billion at December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to accounts reaching the end of their draw period,   Bank of America 36which automatically eliminates open line exposure, and customers choosing to close accounts. Both of these more than offset the impact of new production. The HELOC utilization rate was 55 percent at both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.Table 26 presents certain home equity portfolio key credit statistics on both a reported basis excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, and excluding the PCI loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. Additionally,  in the “Reported Basis” columns in the table below, accruing balances past due 30 days or more and nonperforming loans do not include the PCI loan portfolio, in accordance with our accounting policies, even though the customer may be contractually past due. As such, the following discussion presents the home equity portfolio excluding the PCI loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option. For more information on the PCI loan portfolio, see page 39.

Of the nonperforming home equity portfolio at March 31, 2017, $1.5 billion, or 52 percent, were current on contractual payments. Nonperforming loans that are contractually current primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, junior-lien loans where the underlying first-lien is 90 days or more past due, as well as loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR. In addition, $820 million, or 29 percent of nonperforming home equity loans, were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due decreased $33 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to the improvement in collections associated with a consumer real estate servicer conversion that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2016.In some cases, the junior-lien home equity outstanding balance that we hold is performing, but the underlying first-lien is not. For outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio on which we service the first-lien loan, we are able to track whether the first-lien loan is in default. For loans where the first-lien is serviced by a third party, we utilize credit bureau data to estimate the delinquency status of the first-lien. Given that the credit bureau database we use does not include a property address for the mortgages, we are unable to identify with certainty whether a reported delinquent first-lien mortgage pertains to the same property for which we hold a junior-lien loan. For certain loans, we utilize a third-party vendor to combine credit bureau and public  record data to better link a junior-lien loan with the underlying first-lien mortgage. At March 31, 2017, we estimate that $966 million of current and $143 million of 30 to 89 days past due junior-lien loans were behind a delinquent first-lien loan. We service the first-lien loans on $156 million of these combined amounts, with the remaining $953 million serviced by third parties. Of the $1.1 billion of current to 89 days past due junior-lien loans, based on available credit bureau data and our own internal servicing data, we estimate that approximately $412 million had first-lien loans that were 90 days or more past due. Net charge-offs decreased $48 million to $64 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $112 million for the same period in 2016 driven by favorable portfolio trends due in part to improvement in home prices and the U.S. economy. Outstanding balances with refreshed combined loan-to-value (CLTV) greater than 100 percent comprised seven percent of the home equity portfolio at both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where our loan and available line of credit combined with any outstanding senior liens against the property are equal to or greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. Depending on the value of the property, there may be collateral in excess of the first-lien that is available to reduce the severity of loss on the second-lien. Of those outstanding balances with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent, 95 percent of the customers were current on their home equity loan and 89 percent of second-lien loans with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent were current on both their second-lien and underlying first-lien loans at March 31, 2017. 37     Bank of AmericaOf the $60.5 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at March 31, 2017, as shown in Table 27, 47 percent require interest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that have entered the amortization period was $15.7 billion at March 31, 2017. The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At March 31, 2017, $300 million, or two percent of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more. In addition, at March 31, 2017, $1.8 billion, or 12 percent of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $931 million were contractually current. Loans in our HELOC portfolio generally have an initial draw period of 10 years and 17 percent of these loans will enter the amortization period in the remainder of 2017 and will be required to make fully-amortizing payments. We communicate to contractually current customers more than a year prior to the end of their draw period to inform them of the potential change to the payment structure before entering the amortization period, and provide payment options to customers prior to the end of the draw period.Although we do not actively track how many of our home equity  customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and that is still in its revolving period (i.e., customers may draw on and repay their line of credit, but are generally only required to pay interest on a monthly basis). During the three months ended March 31, 2017, approximately 38 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs.Table 27 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, loans within this MSA contributed 20 percent and 13 percent of net charge-offs within the home equity portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made up 11 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, loans within this MSA contributed net recoveries of $4 million and net charge-offs of $2 million within the home equity portfolio.

(4) Amount excludes the PCI home equity portfolio.(5) At both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, 29 percent of PCI home equity loans were in California. There were no other significant single state concentrations.  Bank of America 38Purchased Credit-impaired Loan PortfolioLoans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination and for which it is probable at purchase that we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments are accounted for under the accounting guidance for PCI loans. For more information on PCI loans, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of  the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 4 – Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

This includes $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion of loans that were credit-impaired upon acquisition and $189 million and $226 million of loans that are 90 days or more past due at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The total unpaid principal balance of pay option loans with accumulated negative amortization was $278 million and $303 million, including $15 million and $16 million of negative amortization at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.The total PCI unpaid principal balance decreased $523 million, or four percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2017 primarily driven by payoffs, paydowns and write-offs. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we had no PCI loan sales compared to sales of $174 million for the same period in 2016.Of the unpaid principal balance of $13.5 billion at March 31, 2017, $12.0 billion, or 89 percent, was current based on the contractual terms, $795 million, or six percent, was in early stage delinquency, and $534 million was 180 days or more past due, including $465 million of first-lien mortgages and $69 million of home equity loans.During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we recorded a provision expense of $68 million for the PCI loan portfolio which included $59 million for residential mortgage and $9 million for home equity. This compared to a total provision benefit of $77 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The provision expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was primarily driven by lower expected cash flows.The PCI valuation allowance increased $35 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017 due to a provision expense of $68 million, partially offset by write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio of $9 million in residential mortgage and $24 million in home equity.The PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio represented 74 percent of the total PCI loan portfolio at March 31, 2017. Those loans to borrowers with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 27 percent of the PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio at March 31, 2017. Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 90 percent, after consideration of purchase accounting adjustments and the related valuation allowance, represented 21 percent of the PCI residential mortgage loan portfolio and 24 percent based on the unpaid principal balance at March 31, 2017.  The PCI home equity portfolio represented 26 percent of the total PCI loan portfolio at March 31, 2017. Those loans with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 16 percent of the PCI home equity portfolio at March 31, 2017. Loans with a refreshed CLTV greater than 90 percent, after consideration of purchase accounting adjustments and the related valuation allowance, represented 45 percent of the PCI home equity portfolio and 48 percent based on the unpaid principal balance at March 31, 2017. U.S. Credit CardAt March 31, 2017, 97 percent of the U.S. credit card portfolio was managed in Consumer Banking with the remainder in GWIM. Outstandings in the U.S. credit card portfolio decreased $3.7 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2017 due to paydowns and a seasonal decline in purchase volume. Net charge-offs increased $19 million to $606 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 due to loan growth and portfolio seasoning. U.S. credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest decreased $15 million from seasonal declines while loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest increased $19 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017, driven by the same factors as described for net charge-offs.Unused lines of credit for U.S. credit card totaled $327.4 billion and $321.6 billion at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The increase was driven by a seasonal decrease in line utilization due to a decrease in transaction volume as well as account growth and lines of credit increases.39     Bank of AmericaTable 29 presents certain state concentrations for the U.S. credit card portfolio.

Subject to regulatory approval, this transaction is expected to close by mid-2017. For more information on the sale of our non-U.S. consumer credit card business, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Outstandings in the non-U.S. credit card portfolio, which are recorded in All Other, increased $291 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017 primarily driven by higher cash and purchase volumes as well as strengthening of the British Pound against the U.S. Dollar. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, net charge-offs decreased $1 million to $44 million compared to the same period in 2016. Unused lines of credit for non-U.S. credit card totaled $25.2 billion and $24.4 billion at March 31, 2017 and December 31,  2016. The $784 million increase was driven by account growth and line of credit increases coupled with strengthening of the British Pound against the U.S. Dollar.Direct/Indirect ConsumerAt March 31, 2017, approximately 53 percent of the direct/indirect portfolio was included in Consumer Banking (consumer auto and specialty lending – automotive, marine, aircraft, recreational vehicle loans and consumer personal loans) and 46 percent was included in GWIM (principally securities-based lending loans).Outstandings in the direct/indirect portfolio decreased $1.3 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2017 primarily driven by lower draws and utilization in the securities-based lending portfolio.Table 30 presents certain state concentrations for the direct/indirect consumer loan portfolio.

The remainder is primarily associated with certain consumer finance businesses that we previously exited.Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties ActivityTable 31 presents nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. For more information on nonperforming loans, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2016  Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 4 – Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, nonperforming consumer loans declined $458 million to $5.5 billion primarily driven by net transfers of loans to held-for-sale of $221 million and loan sales of $142 million. Additionally, nonperforming loans declined as outflows outpaced new inflows.The outstanding balance of a real estate-secured loan that is in excess of the estimated property value less costs to sell is charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due unless repayment of the loan is fully insured. At March 31, 2017, $2.3 billion, or 40 percent of nonperforming consumer real estate loans and foreclosed   Bank of America 40properties had been written down to their estimated property value less costs to sell, including $2.0 billion of nonperforming loans 180 days or more past due and $328 million of foreclosed properties. In addition, at March 31, 2017, $2.3 billion, or 42 percent of nonperforming consumer loans were modified and are now current after successful trial periods, or are current loans classified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable policies.Foreclosed properties decreased $35 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017 as liquidations outpaced additions. PCI loans are excluded from nonperforming loans as these loans were written down to fair value at the acquisition date; however, once we acquire the underlying real estate upon foreclosure of the delinquent PCI loan, it is included in foreclosed properties. PCI-related foreclosed properties decreased $10 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017. Not included in foreclosed properties at March 31, 2017 was $1.1 billion of real estate that was acquired upon foreclosure of certain delinquent government- guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans). We exclude these amounts from our nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties activity as we expect we will be reimbursed once the property is conveyed to the guarantor for principal and, up to certain limits, costs incurred during the foreclosure process and interest incurred during the holding period. Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. These concessions typically result from our loss mitigation activities and could include reductions in the interest rate, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions. Certain TDRs are classified as nonperforming at the time of restructuring and may only be returned to performing status after considering the borrower’s sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period, generally six months. Nonperforming TDRs, excluding those modified loans in the PCI loan portfolio, are included in Table 31.

New foreclosed properties also includes properties obtained upon foreclosure of delinquent PCI loans, properties repurchased due to representations and warranties exposure and properties acquired with newly consolidated subsidiaries.(4) At March 31, 2017, 36 percent of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due.(5) Foreclosed property balances do not include properties insured by certain government-guaranteed loans, principally FHA-insured loans, of $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion at March 31, 2017 and 2016. (6) Outstanding consumer loans and leases exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option.41     Bank of AmericaOur policy is to record any losses in the value of foreclosed properties as a reduction in the allowance for loan and lease losses during the first 90 days after transfer of a loan to foreclosed properties. Thereafter, further losses in value as well as gains and losses on sale are recorded in noninterest expense. New foreclosed properties included in Table 31 are net of $19 million and $18 million of charge-offs and write-offs of PCI loans for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, recorded during the first 90 days after transfer.  We classify junior-lien home equity loans as nonperforming when the first-lien loan becomes 90 days past due even if the junior-lien loan is performing. At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, $412 million and $428 million of such junior-lien home equity loans were included in nonperforming loans and leases.Table 32 presents TDRs for the consumer real estate portfolio. Performing TDR balances are excluded from nonperforming loans and leases in Table 31.

Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the customer’s interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months, all of which are considered TDRs (the renegotiated TDR portfolio). In addition, the accounts of non-U.S. credit card customers who do not qualify for a fixed payment plan may have their interest rates reduced, as required by certain local jurisdictions. These modifications, which are also TDRs, tend to experience higher payment default rates given that the borrowers may lack the ability to repay even with the interest rate reduction. In all cases, the customer’s available line of credit is canceled.Modifications of credit card and other consumer loans are made through renegotiation programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external renegotiation programs. The renegotiated TDR portfolio is excluded in large part from Table 31 as substantially all of the loans remain on accrual status until either charged off or paid in full. At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, our renegotiated TDR portfolio was $594 million and $610 million, of which $474 million and $493 million were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. The decline in the renegotiated TDR portfolio was primarily driven by paydowns and charge-offs as well as lower program enrollments. For more information on the renegotiated TDR portfolio, see Note 4 – Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk ManagementCommercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure do not result in undesirable levels of risk. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property type. In addition, within our non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 37, 40 and 45 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our industry concentrations, including our utilized exposure to the energy sector, which was three percent of total commercial utilized exposure at both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Industry Concentrations on page 47 and Table 40.For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and net charge-offs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Bank of America 42Commercial Credit PortfolioDuring the three months ended March 31, 2017, other than in the higher risk energy sub-sectors, credit quality among large corporate borrowers was strong. We saw further improvement in the energy sector in the three months ended March 31, 2017, with continued stability in oil prices. Credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers continued to be strong with conservative LTV ratios, stable market rents in most sectors and vacancy rates remaining low.Outstanding commercial loans and leases increased $5.0 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2017 primarily in U.S. commercial. Nonperforming commercial loans and leases decreased $7 million to $1.8 billion during the three months ended  March 31, 2017. Nonperforming commercial loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans and leases, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, was 0.38 percent at both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Reservable criticized balances decreased $252 million to $16.1 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2017 driven by improvements in the energy sector. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio decreased $40 million to $5.2 billion at March 31, 2017. For additional information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 51.Table 33 presents our commercial loans and leases portfolio and related credit quality information at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

Commercial utilized credit exposure includes standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and financial guarantees, bankers’ acceptances and commercial letters of credit that have been issued and for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions during a specified time period and excludes exposure related to trading account assets. Although funds have not yet  been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes.Total commercial utilized credit exposure increased $9.3 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2017 primarily driven by increases in loans and leases and LHFS. The utilization rate for loans and leases, SBLCs and financial guarantees, commercial letters of credit and bankers acceptances, in the aggregate, was 58 percent at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

Criticized exposure corresponds to the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful asset categories as defined by regulatory authorities. Total commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased $252 million, or two  percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2017 driven by paydowns and net upgrades in the energy portfolio. Approximately 76 percent of commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure was secured at both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

U.S. commercial loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, increased $4.5 billion, or two percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2017 due to growth across most of the commercial businesses. Reservable criticized balances increased and nonperforming loans and leases decreased in the three months ended March 31, 2017, each with changes of less than  one percent. Net charge-offs decreased $21 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 due to lower energy sector related losses.Commercial Real EstateCommercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans and leases secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 23 percent of the commercial real estate loans and leases portfolio at both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The commercial real estate portfolio is   Bank of America 44predominantly managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms. Outstanding loans increased $494 million, or one percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2017 due to new originations slightly outpacing paydowns.For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we continued to see low default rates and solid credit quality in both the residential and non-residential portfolios. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including transfers of deteriorating exposures to management by independent special  asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation.Nonperforming commercial real estate loans and foreclosed properties increased $23 million, or 27 percent, due to higher foreclosed properties. Reservable criticized balances decreased $12 million, or three percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2017 primarily due to loan resolutions. Net recoveries were $4 million and $6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.

Non-residential nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties increased $24 million, or 30 percent, to $104 million at March 31, 2017 due to higher foreclosed properties. The non-residential nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties represented 0.18 percent and 0.14 percent of total non-residential loans and foreclosed properties at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Non-residential utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased $12 million, or three percent, to $385 million at March 31, 2017 compared to $397 million at December 31, 2016, which represented 0.67 percent and 0.70 percent of non-residential utilized reservable exposure, related to strong commercial real estate fundamentals in most sectors. For the non-residential portfolio, net recoveries decreased $2 million to $4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. At March 31, 2017, total committed residential exposure was $3.3 billion compared to $3.7 billion at December 31, 2016, of which $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion were funded secured loans. The nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties and the utilized reservable criticized ratios for the residential portfolio were 0.32 percent and 0.13 percent at March 31, 2017 compared to 0.35 percent and 0.16 percent at December 31, 2016.At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the commercial real estate loan portfolio included $7.0 billion and $6.8 billion of funded construction and land development loans that were originated to fund the construction and/or rehabilitation of commercial properties. Reservable criticized construction and land development loans totaled $122 million and $107 million, and nonperforming construction and land development loans and foreclosed properties totaled $56 million and $44 million at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. During a property’s construction phase, interest income is typically paid from interest reserves that are established at the inception of the loan. As construction is completed and the property is put into service, 45     Bank of Americathese interest reserves are depleted and interest payments from operating cash flows begin. We do not recognize interest income on nonperforming loans regardless of the existence of an interest reserve.Non-U.S. CommercialAt March 31, 2017, 78 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking and 22 percent in Global Markets. Outstanding loans, excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option, decreased $218 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017 primarily due to payoffs. Net charge-offs decreased $27 million to $15 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to a decline in energy sector related losses. For more information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 50.U.S. Small Business CommercialThe U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of small business card loans and small business loans managed in Consumer Banking. Credit card-related products were 50 percent and 48 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Net charge-offs were  unchanged at $52 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Of the U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs, 88 percent were credit card-related products for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to 89 percent for the same period in 2016.Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties ActivityTable 38 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, nonperforming commercial loans and leases increased $25 million to $1.7 billion. Approximately 76 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were secured and approximately 67 percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans were carried at approximately 89 percent of their unpaid principal balance before consideration of the allowance for loan and lease losses as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated property value less costs to sell.

TDRs are generally classified as performing after a sustained period of demonstrated payment performance.(4) New foreclosed properties represents transfers of nonperforming loans to foreclosed properties net of charge-offs recorded during the first 90 days after transfer of a loan to foreclosed properties.(5) Outstanding commercial loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option.  Bank of America 46Table 39 presents our commercial TDRs by product type and performing status. U.S. small business commercial TDRs are comprised of renegotiated small business card loans and small business loans. The renegotiated small business card loans are  not classified as nonperforming as they are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due.

Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial committed exposure increased $1.9 billion, or less than one percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2017 to $953.0 billion. The increase in commercial committed exposure was concentrated in the Food, Beverage and Tobacco sector and the Materials sector. Increases were partially offset by lower exposure to the Diversified Financials, Healthcare Equipment and Services, and Banking sectors.Industry limits are used internally to manage industry concentrations and are based on committed exposure that is allocated on an industry-by-industry basis. A risk management framework is in place to set and approve industry limits as well as to provide ongoing monitoring. The Management Risk Committee oversees industry limit governance.Diversified Financials, our largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $121.4 billion, decreased $3.2 billion, or three percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2017.The  decrease primarily reflected a decline in several counterparties.Real estate, our second largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $85.3 billion, increased $1.6 billion, or two percent, during the three months ended March 31, 2017. For more information on the commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Commercial Real Estate on page 44.Retailing committed exposure decreased $1.5 billion, or two percent, to $67.0 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in committed exposure occurred primarily in the Specialty Retail sector. Our energy-related committed exposure decreased $1.3 billion, or three percent, to $37.9 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2017. Energy sector net charge-offs were $3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $102 million for the same period in 2016. Energy sector reservable criticized exposure decreased $725 million to $4.8 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2017 due to exposure reductions and fewer new criticized exposures. The energy allowance for credit losses decreased $75 million to $850 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017.47     Bank of America         Table 40Commercial Credit Exposure by Industry (1)           Commercial Utilized Total Commercial Committed (2)(Dollars in millions)March 31 2017 December 31 2016 March 31 2017 December 31 2016Diversified financials$78,211 $81,156 $121,369 $124,535Real estate (3)63,384 61,203 85,286 83,658Retailing41,548 41,630 67,003 68,507Capital goods34,234 34,278 64,304 64,202Healthcare equipment and services38,737 37,656 62,117 64,663Government and public education45,843 45,694 54,354 54,626Materials23,645 22,578 46,485 44,357Banking38,184 39,877 45,320 47,799Consumer services28,994 27,413 44,141 42,523Food, beverage and tobacco21,205 19,669 41,273 37,145Energy18,002 19,686 37,920 39,231Commercial services and supplies21,372 21,241 34,164 35,360Utilities12,805 11,349 27,925 27,140Transportation19,645 19,805 27,609 27,483Media13,156 13,419 25,492 27,116Individuals and trusts16,404 16,364 22,854 21,764Technology hardware and equipment7,822 7,793 19,104 18,429Software and services9,540 7,991 19,084 19,790Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology5,943 5,539 18,858 18,910Telecommunication services7,020 6,317 17,593 16,925Insurance, including monolines6,724 7,406 13,779 13,936Automobiles and components5,744 5,459 13,111 12,969Consumer durables and apparel5,965 6,042 11,185 11,460Food and staples retailing5,724 4,795 9,565 8,869Religious and social organizations4,732 4,423 6,419 6,252Other 9,639 6,109 16,645 13,432Total commercial credit exposure by industry$584,222 $574,892 $952,959 $951,081Net credit default protection purchased on total commitments (4)    $(3,099) $(3,477)(1) Includes U.S. small business commercial exposure.(2) Includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments net of amounts distributed (e.g., syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions.

For additional information, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Risk Mitigation below.Risk MitigationWe purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection.At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $3.1 billion and $3.5 billion. We recorded net losses of $31 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to net losses of $203 million for the same period in 2016 on these positions. The gains and losses on these instruments were offset by gains and losses on the related exposures.

We execute the majority of our credit derivative trades in the OTC market with large, multinational financial institutions, including broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of other investors. Because these  transactions are executed in the OTC market, we are subject to settlement risk. We are also subject to credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to perform under the terms of these contracts. In most cases, credit derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit downgrade, depending on the ultimate rating level, or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required by the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades.Table 43 presents the total contract/notional amount of credit derivatives outstanding and includes both purchased and written credit derivatives. The credit risk amounts are measured as net asset exposure by counterparty, taking into consideration all contracts with the counterparty. For more information on our written credit derivatives, see Note 2 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The credit risk amounts discussed above and presented in Table 43 take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements while amounts disclosed in Note 2 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements are shown on a gross basis. Credit risk reflects the potential benefit from offsetting exposure to non-credit derivative products with the same counterparties that may be netted upon the occurrence of certain events, thereby reducing our overall exposure.

We calculate CVA based on a modeled expected exposure that incorporates current market risk factors including changes in market spreads and non-credit related market factors that affect the value of a derivative. The exposure also takes into consideration credit mitigants such as legally enforceable master netting agreements and collateral. For additional information, see Note 2 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We enter into risk management activities to offset market driven exposures. We often hedge the counterparty spread risk in CVA with credit default swaps (CDS). We hedge other market risks  in CVA primarily with currency and interest rate swaps. In certain instances, the net-of-hedge amounts in the table below move in the same direction as the gross amount or may move in the opposite direction. This movement is a consequence of the complex interaction of the risks being hedged, resulting in limitations in the ability to perfectly hedge all of the market exposures at all times.

We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance, rather than through country risk governance.Table 45 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures as of March 31, 2017. These exposures accounted for 87 percent and 88 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $2.7 billion in the three months ended March 31, 2017 primarily driven by increases in the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia, partially offset by reductions in Switzerland, Japan and Canada. On a product basis, the increase was driven by an increase in funded loans and loan equivalents in the United Kingdom, Singapore and Japan, and higher unfunded commitments in Australia and Germany.Non-U.S. exposure is presented on an internal risk management basis and includes sovereign and non-sovereign credit exposure, securities and other investments issued by or domiciled in countries other than the U.S. The risk assignments by country can be adjusted for external guarantees and certain collateral types. Exposures that are subject to external guarantees are reported under the country of the guarantor. Exposures with tangible collateral are reflected in the country where the collateral is held. For securities received, other than cross-border resale  agreements, outstandings are assigned to the domicile of the issuer of the securities.Funded loans and loan equivalents include loans, leases, and other extensions of credit and funds, including letters of credit and due from placements, which have not been reduced by collateral, hedges or credit default protection. Funded loans and loan equivalents are reported net of charge-offs but prior to any allowance for loan and lease losses. Unfunded commitments are the undrawn portion of legally binding commitments related to loans and loan equivalents.Net counterparty exposure includes the fair value of derivatives, including the counterparty risk associated with CDS, and secured financing transactions. Derivatives exposures are presented net of collateral, which is predominantly cash, pledged under legally enforceable master netting agreements. Secured financing transaction exposures are presented net of eligible cash or securities pledged as collateral.Securities and other investments are carried at fair value and long securities exposures are netted against short exposures with the same underlying issuer to, but not below, zero (i.e., negative issuer exposures are reported as zero).Net country exposure represents country exposure less hedges and credit default protection purchased, net of credit default protection sold. We hedge certain country exposures with credit default protection primarily in the form of single-name, as well as indexed and tranched CDS. The exposures associated with these hedges represent the amount that would be realized upon the isolated default of an individual issuer in the relevant country assuming a zero recovery rate for that individual issuer, and are calculated based on the CDS notional amount adjusted for any fair value receivable or payable. Changes in the assumption of an isolated default can produce different results in a particular tranche.

Our two largest emerging market country exposures at March 31, 2017 were Brazil and China. At March 31, 2017, net exposure to Brazil was $13.1 billion, concentrated in sovereign securities, oil and gas companies and commercial banks. At March 31, 2017, net exposure to China was $11.2 billion, concentrated in large state-owned companies, subsidiaries of multinational corporations and commercial banks. The outlook for policy direction and therefore economic performance in the EU remains uncertain as a consequence of reduced political cohesion among EU countries. Our largest EU country exposure at March 31, 2017 was the United Kingdom. At March 31, 2017, net exposure to the United Kingdom was $53.1 billion, concentrated in multinational corporations and sovereign clients. For additional information, see Executive Summary – First Quarter 2017 Economic and Business Environment on page 3.Provision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses decreased $162 million to $835 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The provision for credit losses was $99 million lower than net charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2017, resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses. This compared to a reduction of $71 million in the allowance for credit losses for the three months ended March 31, 2016. We expect the provision for credit losses will approximate net charge-offs for the second quarter of 2017.The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio increased $370 million to $772 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 due to loan growth and portfolio seasoning in the U.S. credit card portfolio. Included in the provision is an expense of $68 million related to the PCI loan portfolio for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to a benefit of $77 million for the same period in 2016. The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, decreased $532 million to $63 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 driven by improvements in energy exposures due in part to stabilized oil prices. Allowance for Credit LossesAllowance for Loan and Lease LossesThe allowance for loan and lease losses is comprised of two components. The first component covers nonperforming commercial loans and TDRs. The second component covers loans and leases on which there are incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable, as well as incurred losses that may not be represented in the loss forecast models. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the total of these two components. The allowance for loan and lease losses excludes LHFS and loans accounted for under the fair value option as the fair value reflects a credit risk component. For more information on the allowance for loan and lease losses, see Allowance for Credit Losses in the MD&A of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the factors that impacted the allowance for loan and lease losses included improvements in the credit quality of the consumer real estate  portfolios driven by continuing improvements in the U.S. economy and labor markets, proactive credit risk management initiatives and the impact of high credit quality originations. Evidencing the improvements in the U.S. economy and labor markets are downward unemployment trends and increases in home prices. In addition to these improvements, in the consumer portfolio, nonperforming consumer loans decreased $458 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017 as returns to performing status, paydowns, loan sales and charge-offs continued to outpace new nonaccrual loans. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the allowance for loan and lease losses in the commercial portfolio reflected decreased energy reserves due in part to stabilized oil prices which contributed to a modest improvement in energy-related exposure.The allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumer portfolio, as presented in Table 47, was $6.1 billion at March 31, 2017, a decrease of $86 million from December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily in the home equity portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the U.S. credit card portfolio. The reductions in the home equity portfolio were due to improved home prices, lower nonperforming loans and a decrease in consumer loan balances. The increase in the U.S. credit card portfolio was driven by loan growth and the seasoning of newer vintages within the portfolio. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio, as presented in Table 47, was $5.2 billion at March 31, 2017, a decrease of $40 million from December 31, 2016 driven by decreased energy reserves for the higher risk energy sub-sectors due in part to stabilized oil prices. Commercial utilized reservable criticized exposure decreased to $16.1 billion at March 31, 2017 from $16.3 billion (to 3.27 percent from 3.35 percent of total commercial utilized reservable exposure) at December 31, 2016, largely due to net upgrades and paydowns in the energy portfolio. Nonperforming commercial loans were $1.7 billion (0.38 percent of outstanding commercial loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option) at both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. See Tables 33, 34 and 36 for additional details on key commercial credit statistics.The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 1.25 percent at March 31, 2017 compared to 1.26 percent at December 31, 2016. The March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 ratios above include the PCI loan portfolio. Excluding the PCI loan portfolio, the allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 1.22 percent and 1.24 percent at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.Reserve for Unfunded Lending CommitmentsIn addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers’ acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option. For more information on the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, see Allowance for Credit Losses in the MD&A of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The reserve for unfunded lending commitments of $757 million at March 31, 2017 remained relatively unchanged from December 31, 2016. 51     Bank of AmericaTable 46 presents a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.

Various techniques and procedures are utilized to enable the most complete understanding of these risks. Quantitative measures of market risk are evaluated on a daily basis from a single position to the portfolio of the Corporation. These measures include sensitivities of positions to various market risk factors, such as the potential impact on revenue from a one basis point change in interest rates, and statistical measures utilizing both actual and hypothetical market moves, such as VaR and stress testing. Periods of extreme market stress influence the reliability of these techniques to varying degrees. Qualitative evaluations of market risk utilize the suite of quantitative risk measures while understanding each of their respective limitations. Additionally, risk managers independently evaluate the risk of the portfolios under the current market environment and potential future environments.VaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk as it allows the aggregation of market risk factors, including the effects of portfolio diversification. A VaR model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss a portfolio is not expected to exceed more than a certain number of times per period, based on a specified holding period, confidence level and window of historical data. We use one VaR model consistently across the trading portfolios and it uses a historical simulation approach based on a three-year window of historical data. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level. This means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days.Within any VaR model, there are significant and numerous assumptions that will differ from company to company. The accuracy of a VaR model depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the risk factors in the portfolio. A VaR model may require additional modeling assumptions for new products that do not have the necessary historical market data or for less liquid positions for which accurate daily prices are not consistently available. For positions with insufficient historical data for the VaR calculation, the process for establishing an appropriate proxy is based on fundamental and statistical analysis of the new product or less liquid position. This analysis identifies reasonable alternatives that replicate both the expected volatility and correlation to other market risk factors that the missing data would be expected to experience.VaR may not be indicative of realized revenue volatility as changes in market conditions or in the composition of the portfolio can have a material impact on the results. In particular, the historical data used for the VaR calculation might indicate higher or lower levels of portfolio diversification than will be experienced. In order for the VaR model to reflect current market conditions, Global Risk Management updates the historical data underlying our VaR model on a weekly basis, or more frequently during periods of market stress, and regularly review the assumptions underlying the model. A relatively minor portion of risks related to our trading positions is not included in VaR. These risks are reviewed as part  of our Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). For more information regarding ICAAP, see Capital Management in the MD&A of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Global Risk Management continually reviews, evaluates and enhances our VaR model so that it reflects the material risks in our trading portfolio. Changes to the VaR model are reviewed and approved prior to implementation and any material changes are reported to management through the appropriate management committees.Given the noted limitations of the VaR statistic, we also consider other quantitative measures of market risk. For example, Maximum Observed Loss is the largest estimated loss using a 10-day holding period over the historical dates since 2007. This statistic is calculated on a daily basis for the Corporation and across lines of businesses. For individual risks and product types, Global Risk Management reviews estimated gains and losses for specific scenarios, such as a 25 percent decrease in equity prices or sudden exchange rate movements. Global Markets Risk Management also has an extensive stress testing program. For more information, see Trading Portfolio Stress Testing on page 57.Trading limits on quantitative risk measures, such as those described above, are independently set by Global Markets Risk Management and reviewed on a regular basis to ensure the limits remain relevant and within our overall risk appetite for market risks. Trading limits are reviewed in the context of market liquidity, volatility and strategic business priorities. Trading limits are set at both a granular level to allow for extensive coverage of risks as well as at aggregated portfolios to account for correlations among risk factors. All trading limits are approved at least annually. Approved trading limits are stored and tracked in a centralized limits management system. Trading limit excesses are communicated to management for review. Certain quantitative market risk measures and corresponding limits have been identified as critical in the Corporation’s Risk Appetite Statement. These risk appetite limits are reported on a daily basis and are approved at least annually by the ERC and the Board.In periods of market stress, Global Markets senior leadership communicates daily to discuss losses, key risk positions and any limit excesses. As a result of this process, the businesses may selectively reduce risk.Table 48 presents the total market-based trading portfolio VaR which is the combination of the covered positions trading portfolio and the impact from less liquid trading exposures. Covered positions are defined by regulatory standards as trading assets and liabilities, both on- and off-balance sheet, that meet a defined set of specifications. These specifications identify the most liquid trading positions which are intended to be held for a short-term horizon and where we are able to hedge the material risk elements in a two-way market. Positions in less liquid markets, or where there are restrictions on the ability to trade the positions, typically do not qualify as covered positions. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval. In addition, Table 48 presents our fair value option portfolio, which includes substantially all of the funded and unfunded exposures for which we elect the fair value option, and their corresponding hedges. The fair value option portfolio combined with the total market-based trading portfolio VaR represents our total market-based portfolio VaR. Additionally, market risk VaR for trading activities as presented in Table 48 differs from VaR used for regulatory capital calculations due to the holding period being used. The holding period for VaR used for   Bank of America 54regulatory capital calculations is 10 days, while for the market risk VaR presented below it is one day. Both measures utilize the same process and methodology.The total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 48 include market risk to which we are exposed from all business segments,  excluding CVA and DVA. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment. Table 48 presents period-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for the three months ended March 31, 2017, December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2016, using a 99 percent confidence level.

Therefore the impact from less liquid exposures and the amount of portfolio diversification, which is the difference between the total portfolio and the sum of the individual components, are not relevant.The average total market-based trading portfolio VaR decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to reduced exposure to the interest rate and credit markets.  The graph below presents the daily total market-based trading portfolio VaR for the previous five quarters, corresponding to the data in Table 48.55     Bank of AmericaAdditional VaR statistics produced within our single VaR model are provided in Table 49 at the same level of detail as in Table 48. Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a  predefined statistical distribution. Table 49 presents average trading VaR statistics at 99 percent and 95 percent confidence levels for the three months ended March 31, 2017, December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2016.

A backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss exceeds the VaR for the corresponding day. These excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss and to ensure that the VaR methodology accurately represents those losses. The frequency of trading losses in excess of VaR are expected to be in line with the confidence level of the VaR statistic being tested. For example, with a 99 percent confidence level, one trading loss in excess of VaR is expected every 100 days or between two to three trading losses in excess of VaR over the course of a year. The number of backtesting excesses observed can differ from the statistically expected number of excesses if the current level of market volatility is materially different than the level of market volatility that existed during the three years of historical data used in the VaR calculation.The trading revenue used for backtesting is defined by regulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the VaR component of the regulatory capital calculation. This revenue differs from total trading-related revenue in that it excludes revenue from trading activities that either do not generate market risk or the market risk cannot be included in VaR. Some examples of the types of revenue excluded for backtesting are fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intraday trading revenues.Global Risk Management conducts daily backtesting on our trading portfolios, ranging from the total market-based portfolio to  individual trading areas. Additionally, daily backtesting is conducted on the VaR results used for regulatory capital calculations as well as the VaR results for key legal entities, regions and risk factors. These results are reported to senior market risk management. Senior management regularly reviews and evaluates the results of these tests.During the three months ended March 31, 2017, there were no days in which there was a backtesting excess for our total market-based portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period.Total Trading-related RevenueTotal trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment (FVA) gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. Trading account assets and liabilities are reported at fair value. For more information on fair value, see Note 14 – Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Trading-related revenue can be volatile and is largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Also, trading-related revenue is dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. Significant daily revenue by business is monitored and the primary drivers of these are reviewed.  Bank of America 56The histogram below is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for all of the trading days, of which 89 percent were daily  trading gains of over $25 million. This compares to the three months ended December 31, 2016 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 97 percent of the trading days, of which 75 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million and the largest loss was $24 million.Trading Portfolio Stress TestingBecause the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements.A set of scenarios, categorized as either historical or hypothetical, are computed daily for the overall trading portfolio and individual businesses. These scenarios include shocks to underlying market risk factors that may be well beyond the shocks found in the historical data used to calculate VaR. Historical scenarios simulate the impact of the market moves that occurred during a period of extended historical market stress. Generally, a multi-week period representing the most severe point during a crisis is selected for each historical scenario. Hypothetical  scenarios provide estimated portfolio impacts from potential future market stress events. Scenarios are reviewed and updated in response to changing positions and new economic or political information. In addition, new or ad hoc scenarios are developed to address specific potential market events or particular vulnerabilities in the portfolio. The stress tests are reviewed on a regular basis and the results are presented to senior management.Stress testing for the trading portfolio is integrated with enterprise-wide stress testing and incorporated into the limits framework. The macroeconomic scenarios used for enterprise-wide stress testing purposes differ from the typical trading portfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and the results are forecasted over multiple periods for use in consolidated capital and liquidity planning. For additional information, see Managing Risk on page 21.57     Bank of AmericaInterest Rate Risk Management for the Banking BookThe following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities.Interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our banking book balance sheet. Interest rate risk is measured as the potential change in net interest income caused by movements in market interest rates. Client-facing activities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet.We prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income. The baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future business growth, ALM positioning and the direction of interest rate movements as implied by the market-based forward curve. We then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The net interest income forecast is frequently updated for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends, market conditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually monitor our balance sheet position in order to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes.The interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate balance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing, maturity characteristics and investment securities premium amortization. Our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital.Table 50 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.       Table 50Forward Rates              March 31, 2017  FederalFunds Three-monthLIBOR 10-YearSwapSpot rates1.00% 1.15% 2.38%12-month forward rates1.50 1.64 2.54         December 31, 2016Spot rates0.75% 1.00% 2.34%12-month forward rates1.25 1.51 2.49Table 51 shows the pretax dollar impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment. In the three months ended March 31, 2017, the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet to rising rates was largely unchanged. We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel move in interest rates with the majority of that benefit coming from the short end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as available-for-sale (AFS), may adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital is reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income. For more  information on the transition provisions of Basel 3, see Capital Management – Regulatory Capital on page 22.         Table 51Estimated Banking Book Net Interest Income Sensitivity          Short Rate (bps) Long Rate (bps)    (Dollars in millions)  March 31 2017 December 31 2016Curve Change   Parallel Shifts       +100 bps instantaneous shift+100 +100 $3,337 $3,370-50 bps instantaneous shift-50 -50 (2,237) (2,900)Flatteners       Short-end instantaneous change+100 — 2,476 2,473Long-end instantaneous change— -50 (903) (961)Steepeners       Short-end instantaneous change-50 — (1,317) (1,918)Long-end instantaneous change— +100 876 928The sensitivity analysis in Table 51 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity.The behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis in Table 51 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher-yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios.Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative ContractsInterest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components. For more information on our hedging activities, see Note 2 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Our interest rate contracts are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards. In addition, we use foreign exchange contracts, including cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and options to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities.Changes to the composition of our derivatives portfolio during the three months ended March 31, 2017 reflect actions taken for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk management. The decisions to reposition our derivatives portfolio are based on the current assessment of economic and financial conditions including the interest rate and foreign currency environments, balance sheet   Bank of America 58composition and trends, and the relative mix of our cash and derivative positions.Table 52 presents derivatives utilized in our ALM activities including those designated as accounting and economic hedging instruments and shows the notional amount, fair value, weighted- average receive-fixed and pay-fixed rates, expected maturity and average estimated durations of our open ALM derivatives at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

Foreign exchange contracts of $(20.3) billion at December 31, 2016 were comprised of $21.5 billion in foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed swaps, $(38.5) billion in net foreign currency forward rate contracts, $(4.6) billion in foreign currency-denominated pay-fixed swaps and $1.3 billion in foreign currency futures contracts.59     Bank of AmericaWe use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities and other forecasted transactions (collectively referred to as cash flow hedges). The net losses on both open and terminated cash flow hedge derivative instruments recorded in accumulated OCI were $1.4 billion, on a pretax basis, at both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. These net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged cash flows. Assuming no change in open cash flow derivative hedge positions and no changes in prices or interest rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at March 31, 2017, the pretax net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings as follows: $301 million, or 22 percent within the next year, 51 percent in years two through five, and 16 percent in years six through ten, with the remaining 11 percent thereafter. For more information on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see Note 2 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We hedge our net investment in non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar using forward foreign exchange contracts that typically settle in less than 180 days, cross-currency basis swaps and foreign exchange options. We recorded net after-tax losses on derivatives in accumulated OCI associated with net investment hedges which were offset by gains on our net investments in consolidated non-U.S. entities at March 31, 2017.Mortgage Banking Risk ManagementWe originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held-for-investment or held-for-sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate. Interest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. Changes in interest rates and other market factors impact the volume of mortgage originations. Changes in interest rates also impact the value of IRLCs and the related residential first mortgage LHFS between the date of the IRLC and the date the loans are sold to the secondary market. An increase in mortgage interest rates typically leads to a decrease in the value of these instruments. Conversely, the value of the MSRs will increase driven by lower prepayment expectations when there is an increase in interest rates. Because the interest rate risks of these two hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities.For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we recorded gains in mortgage banking income of $25 million related to the change in fair value of the MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of gains and losses on the hedge portfolio, compared to gains of $131 million for the same period in 2016. For more information on MSRs, see Note 14 – Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements and for more information on mortgage banking income, see Consumer Banking on page 10.Complex Accounting EstimatesOur significant accounting principles are essential in understanding the MD&A. Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments. For additional information, see Complex Accounting Estimates in the MD&A of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Bank of America 68Bank of America Corporation and SubsidiariesNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNOTE 1 Summary of Significant Accounting PrinciplesBank of America Corporation, a bank holding company and a financial holding company, provides a diverse range of financial services and products throughout the U.S. and in certain international markets. The term “the Corporation” as used herein may refer to Bank of America Corporation individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation’s subsidiaries or affiliates. Principles of Consolidation and Basis of PresentationThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries and those variable interest entities (VIEs) where the Corporation is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Results of operations of acquired companies are included from the dates of acquisition and for VIEs, from the dates that the Corporation became the primary beneficiary. Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Corporation accounts for investments in companies for which it owns a voting interest and for which it has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financing decisions using the equity method of accounting. These investments are included in other assets. Equity method investments are subject to impairment testing, and the Corporation’s proportionate share of income or loss is included in other income.The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Realized results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The nature of the Corporation's business is such that the results of any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which consist of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the interim period results have been made. The Corporation evaluates subsequent events through the date of filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.On December 20, 2016, the Corporation entered into an agreement to sell its non-U.S. consumer credit card business to a third party. Subject to regulatory approval, this transaction is expected to close by mid-2017. After closing, the Corporation will retain substantially all payment protection insurance (PPI) exposure above existing reserves. The Corporation has considered this exposure in its estimate of a small after-tax gain on the sale. This transaction will reduce risk-weighted assets and goodwill upon closing, benefiting regulatory capital. The assets of this business, which are presented in the assets of business held for sale line on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, included consumer credit card receivables of $9.5 billion and $9.2 billion, an allowance for loan  losses of $242 million and $243 million, goodwill of $775 million for both periods, available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities of $691 million and $619 million and all other assets of $296 million and $305 million at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Liabilities are primarily comprised of intercompany borrowings. This business is included in All Other for reporting purposes.New Accounting PronouncementsAccounting for Financial Instruments -- Credit LossesThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance effective on January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted on January 1, 2019, that will require the earlier recognition of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments based on an expected loss model, replacing the incurred loss model that is currently in use. The Corporation is in the process of identifying and implementing required changes to loan loss estimation models and processes and evaluating the impact of this new accounting guidance, which at the date of adoption is expected to increase the allowance for credit losses with a resulting negative adjustment to retained earnings.Revenue RecognitionThe FASB issued new accounting guidance effective on January 1, 2018 for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. While the new guidance does not apply to revenue associated with loans or securities, the Corporation has been working to identify the customer contracts within the scope of the new guidance and assess the related revenues to determine if any accounting or internal control changes will be required for the new provisions. While the assessment is not complete, the timing of the Corporation’s revenue recognition is not expected to materially change. The classification of certain contract costs continues to be evaluated, and the final interpretation may impact the presentation of certain contract costs. Overall, the Corporation does not expect the new guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. The next phase of the Corporation’s implementation work will be to evaluate any changes that may be required to the Corporation’s applicable disclosures.Lease AccountingThe FASB issued new accounting guidance effective on January 1, 2019 that requires substantially all leases to be recorded as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. This new accounting guidance uses a modified retrospective transition that will be applied to all prior periods presented. The Corporation is in the process of reviewing its existing lease portfolios, as well as other service contracts for embedded leases, to evaluate the impact of the new accounting guidance on the financial statements, as well as the impact to regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets. The effect of the adoption will depend on its lease portfolio at the time of transition; however, the Corporation does not expect the new accounting guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. Upon completion of the inventory review and consideration of system requirements, the Corporation will evaluate the impacts of adopting the new accounting guidance on its disclosures. 69     Bank of AmericaRecognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesThe FASB issued new accounting guidance effective on January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted for the provisions related to debit valuation adjustment (DVA), on recognition and measurement of financial instruments, including certain equity investments and financial liabilities recorded at fair value under the fair value option. In 2015, the Corporation early adopted, retrospective to January 1, 2015, the provisions of this new accounting guidance related to DVA on financial liabilities accounted for under the fair value option. The Corporation does not expect the remaining provisions of this new accounting guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations.NOTE 2 DerivativesDerivative BalancesDerivatives are entered into on behalf of customers, for trading, or to support risk management activities. Derivatives used in risk  management activities include derivatives that may or may not be designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships. Derivatives that are not designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships are referred to as other risk management derivatives. For more information on the Corporation’s derivatives and hedging activities, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following tables present derivative instruments included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in derivative assets and liabilities at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting.

(ISDA) master netting agreements or similar agreements with substantially all of the Corporation’s derivative counterparties. Where legally enforceable, these master netting agreements give the Corporation, in the event of default by the counterparty, the right to liquidate securities held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty. For purposes of the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation offsets derivative assets and liabilities and cash collateral held with the same counterparty where it has such a legally enforceable master netting agreement.The Offsetting of Derivatives table presents derivative instruments included in derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 by primary risk (e.g., interest rate risk) and the platform, where applicable, on which these derivatives are transacted. Exchange-traded derivatives include listed options transacted on an exchange. Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives include bilateral transactions between the Corporation and a particular counterparty. OTC-cleared derivatives include bilateral transactions between the Corporation and a counterparty where the transaction is cleared through a clearinghouse. Balances are  presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting. Total gross derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements which includes reducing the balance for counterparty netting and cash collateral received or paid.Other gross derivative assets and liabilities in the table represent derivatives entered into under master netting agreements where uncertainty exists as to the enforceability of these agreements under bankruptcy laws in some countries or industries and, accordingly, receivables and payables with counterparties in these countries or industries are reported on a gross basis.Also included in the table is financial instruments collateral related to legally enforceable master netting agreements that represents securities collateral received or pledged and cash and securities collateral held and posted at third-party custodians. These amounts are not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but are shown as a reduction to total derivative assets and liabilities in the table to derive net derivative assets and liabilities.For more information on offsetting of securities financing agreements, see Note 9 – Federal Funds Sold or Purchased, Securities Financing Agreements and Short-term Borrowings.71     Bank of America        Offsetting of Derivatives                March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016(Dollars in billions)Derivative Assets Derivative Liabilities Derivative Assets Derivative LiabilitiesInterest rate contracts       Over-the-counter$251.3 $241.8 $267.3 $258.2Over-the-counter cleared128.5 135.0 177.2 182.8Foreign exchange contracts       Over-the-counter92.6 98.2 124.3 126.7Over-the-counter cleared0.9 0.9 0.3 0.3Equity contracts       Over-the-counter17.2 14.8 15.6 13.7Exchange-traded 12.6 11.7 11.4 10.8Commodity contracts       Over-the-counter3.0 4.1 3.7 4.9Exchange-traded 0.9 0.8 1.1 1.0Credit derivatives       Over-the-counter12.9 12.6 15.3 14.7Over-the-counter cleared4.5 4.6 4.3 4.3Total gross derivative assets/liabilities, before netting       Over-the-counter377.0 371.5 426.2 418.2Exchange-traded 13.5 12.5 12.5 11.8Over-the-counter cleared133.9 140.5 181.8 187.4Less: Legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral received/paid       Over-the-counter(350.8) (347.9) (398.2) (392.6)Exchange-traded (9.1) (9.1) (8.9) (8.9)Over-the-counter cleared(133.5) (140.4) (181.5) (187.3)Derivative assets/liabilities, after netting31.0 27.1 31.9 28.6Other gross derivative assets/liabilities (1)9.1 9.3 10.6 10.9Total derivative assets/liabilities (2)40.1 36.4 42.5 39.5Less: Financial instruments collateral (3)(12.5) (8.4) (13.5) (10.5)Total net derivative assets/liabilities$27.6 $28.0 $29.0 $29.0(1) Consists of derivatives entered into under master netting agreements where the enforceability of these agreements is uncertain.

ALM and Risk Management DerivativesThe Corporation’s asset and liability management (ALM) and risk management activities include the use of derivatives to mitigate risk to the Corporation including derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships and derivatives used in other risk management activities. Interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, commodity and credit contracts are utilized in the Corporation’s ALM and risk management activities.The Corporation maintains an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts, which are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation’s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity and volatility so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings or capital. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in fair value. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are linked to the hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this unrealized appreciation or depreciation.Market risk, including interest rate risk, can be substantial in the mortgage business. Market risk in the mortgage business is the risk that values of mortgage assets or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as interest rate movements. To mitigate the interest rate risk in mortgage banking production income, the Corporation utilizes  forward loan sale commitments and other derivative instruments, including purchased options, and certain debt securities. The Corporation also utilizes derivatives such as interest rate options, interest rate swaps, forward settlement contracts and eurodollar futures to hedge certain market risks of mortgage servicing rights (MSRs). For more information on MSRs, see Note 14 – Fair Value Measurements.The Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities, as well as the Corporation’s investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Foreign exchange contracts, which include spot and forward contracts, represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon settlement date. Exposure to loss on these contracts will increase or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange and interest rates fluctuate.The Corporation enters into derivative commodity contracts such as futures, swaps, options and forwards as well as non-derivative commodity contracts to provide price risk management services to customers or to manage price risk associated with its physical and financial commodity positions. The non-derivative commodity contracts and physical inventories of commodities expose the Corporation to earnings volatility. Fair value accounting hedges provide a method to mitigate a portion of this earnings volatility.  Bank of America 72The Corporation purchases credit derivatives to manage credit risk related to certain funded and unfunded credit exposures. Credit derivatives include credit default swaps (CDS), total return swaps and swaptions. These derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income.Derivatives Designated as Accounting HedgesThe Corporation uses various types of interest rate, commodity and foreign exchange derivative contracts to protect against changes in the fair value of its assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates, commodity prices and exchange rates (fair value hedges). The Corporation also uses these types of contracts and equity derivatives to protect against changes in the cash flows of its assets and liabilities, and other forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges). The Corporation hedges its net investment in consolidated non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar using forward  exchange contracts and cross-currency basis swaps, and by issuing foreign currency-denominated debt (net investment hedges).Fair Value HedgesThe table below summarizes information related to fair value hedges for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, including hedges of interest rate risk on long-term debt that were acquired as part of a business combination and redesignated at that time. At redesignation, the fair value of the derivatives was positive. As the derivatives mature, the fair value will approach zero. As a result, ineffectiveness will occur and the fair value changes in the derivatives and the long-term debt being hedged may be directionally the same in certain scenarios. Based on a regression analysis, the derivatives continue to be highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value of the long-term debt attributable to interest rate risk.

Of the $857 million after-tax net loss ($1.4 billion on a pretax basis) on derivatives in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) at March 31, 2017, $188 million after-tax ($301 million on a pretax basis) is expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months.  These net losses reclassified into earnings are expected to primarily reduce net interest income related to the respective hedged items. Amounts related to price risk on restricted stock awards reclassified from accumulated OCI are recorded in personnel expense. For terminated cash flow hedges, the time period over which substantially all of the forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately seven years, with a maximum length of time for certain forecasted transactions of 19 years.73     Bank of America      Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges            Three Months Ended March 31, 2017(Dollars in millions, amounts pretax)Gains (Losses)Recognized inAccumulated OCIon Derivatives Gains (Losses)in IncomeReclassified fromAccumulated OCI HedgeIneffectiveness andAmounts Excludedfrom EffectivenessTesting (1)Cash flow hedges     Interest rate risk on variable-rate portfolios$(37) $(112) $3Price risk on restricted stock awards (2)28 42 —Total$(9) $(70) $3Net investment hedges     Foreign exchange risk$(389) $(130) $(15)       Three Months Ended March 31, 2016Cash flow hedges     Interest rate risk on variable-rate portfolios$39 $(164) $6Price risk on restricted stock awards (2)(198) (34) —Total$(159) $(198) $6Net investment hedges     Foreign exchange risk$(633) $1 $(143)(1) Amounts related to cash flow hedges represent hedge ineffectiveness and amounts related to net investment hedges represent amounts excluded from effectiveness testing.(2) Gains (losses) recognized in accumulated OCI are primarily related to the change in the Corporation’s stock price for the period.Other Risk Management DerivativesOther risk management derivatives are used by the Corporation to reduce certain risk exposures. These derivatives are not qualifying accounting hedges because either they did not qualify for or were not designated as accounting hedges. The table below presents gains (losses) on these derivatives for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. These gains (losses) are largely offset by the income or expense that is recorded on the hedged item.

The net gains on IRLCs related to the origination of mortgage loans that are held-for-sale, which are not included in the table but are considered derivative instruments, were $56 million and $151 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.(2) Primarily related to derivatives that are economic hedges of credit risk on loans.

Through March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Corporation transferred $6.5 billion and $6.6 billion of primarily non-U.S. government-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to a third-party trust and received gross cash proceeds of $6.5 billion and $6.6 billion at the transfer dates. At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the fair value of these securities was $6.2 billion and $6.3 billion. Derivative assets of $42 million and $43 million and liabilities of $12 million and $10 million were recorded at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016,  and are included in credit derivatives in the derivative instruments table on page 70. Sales and Trading RevenueThe Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate client transactions and to manage risk exposures arising from trading account assets and liabilities. It is the Corporation’s policy to include these derivative instruments in its trading activities which include derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments. The resulting risk from these derivatives is managed on a portfolio basis as part of the Corporation’s Global Markets business segment. The related sales and trading revenue generated within Global Markets is recorded in various income statement line items including trading account profits and net interest income as well as other revenue categories.  Bank of America 74Sales and trading revenue includes changes in the fair value and realized gains and losses on the sales of trading and other assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. Revenue is generated by the difference in the client price for an instrument and the price at which the trading desk can execute the trade in the dealer market. For equity securities, commissions related to purchases and sales are recorded in the “Other” column in the Sales and Trading Revenue table. Changes in the fair value of these securities are included in trading account profits. For debt securities, revenue, with the exception of interest associated with the debt securities, is typically included in trading account profits. Unlike commissions for equity securities, the initial revenue related to broker-dealer services for debt securities is typically included in the pricing of the instrument rather than being charged through separate fee arrangements. Therefore, this revenue is recorded in trading account profits as part of the initial mark to fair value. For  derivatives, the majority of revenue is included in trading account profits. In transactions where the Corporation acts as agent, which include exchange-traded futures and options, fees are recorded in other income.The following table, which includes both derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments, identifies the amounts in the respective income statement line items attributable to the Corporation’s sales and trading revenue in Global Markets, categorized by primary risk, for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. The difference between total trading account profits in the following table and in the Consolidated Statement of Income represents trading activities in business segments other than Global Markets. This table includes debit valuation and funding valuation adjustment (DVA/FVA) gains (losses). Global Markets results in Note 17 – Business Segment Information are presented on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis. The following table is not presented on an FTE basis.

Credit derivatives derive value based on an underlying third-party referenced obligation or a portfolio of referenced obligations and generally require the Corporation, as the seller of credit protection, to make payments to a buyer upon the occurrence of a pre-defined credit event. Such credit events generally include bankruptcy of the referenced credit entity and failure to pay under the obligation, as well as acceleration of indebtedness and payment repudiation or moratorium. For credit derivatives based on a portfolio of referenced credits or credit indices, the Corporation may not be required to make payment until a specified amount of loss has  occurred and/or may only be required to make payment up to a specified amount.Credit derivative instruments where the Corporation is the seller of credit protection and their expiration at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 are summarized in the following table. These instruments are classified as investment and non-investment grade based on the credit quality of the underlying referenced obligation. The Corporation considers ratings of BBB- or higher as investment grade. Non-investment grade includes non-rated credit derivative instruments. The Corporation discloses internal categorizations of investment grade and non-investment grade consistent with how risk is managed for these instruments.75     Bank of America          Credit Derivative Instruments    March 31, 2017 Carrying Value(Dollars in millions)Less thanOne Year One toThree Years Three toFive Years Over FiveYears TotalCredit default swaps:         Investment grade$5 $36 $277 $683 $1,001Non-investment grade237 655 574 3,004 4,470Total242 691 851 3,687 5,471Total return swaps/other:         Investment grade24 — — — 24Non-investment grade141 — — — 141Total165 — — — 165Total credit derivatives$407 $691 $851 $3,687 $5,636Credit-related notes:         Investment grade$— $3 $546 $1,000 $1,549Non-investment grade19 14 30 1,382 1,445Total credit-related notes$19 $17 $576 $2,382 $2,994 Maximum Payout/NotionalCredit default swaps:         Investment grade$111,737 $136,977 $110,112 $34,600 $393,426Non-investment grade80,990 62,329 37,069 22,009 202,397Total192,727 199,306 147,181 56,609 595,823Total return swaps/other:         Investment grade27,669 — — — 27,669Non-investment grade8,070 4,951 500 286 13,807Total35,739 4,951 500 286 41,476Total credit derivatives$228,466 $204,257 $147,681 $56,895 $637,299 December 31, 2016 Carrying ValueCredit default swaps:         Investment grade$10 $64 $535 $783 $1,392Non-investment grade771 1,053 908 3,339 6,071Total781 1,117 1,443 4,122 7,463Total return swaps/other:         Investment grade16 — — — 16Non-investment grade127 10 2 1 140Total143 10 2 1 156Total credit derivatives$924 $1,127 $1,445 $4,123 $7,619Credit-related notes:         Investment grade$— $12 $542 $1,423 $1,977Non-investment grade70 22 60 1,318 1,470Total credit-related notes$70 $34 $602 $2,741 $3,447 Maximum Payout/NotionalCredit default swaps:         Investment grade$121,083 $143,200 $116,540 $21,905 $402,728Non-investment grade84,755 67,160 41,001 18,711 211,627Total205,838 210,360 157,541 40,616 614,355Total return swaps/other:         Investment grade12,792 — — — 12,792Non-investment grade6,638 5,127 589 208 12,562Total19,430 5,127 589 208 25,354Total credit derivatives$225,268 $215,487 $158,130 $40,824 $639,709The notional amount represents the maximum amount payable by the Corporation for most credit derivatives. However, the Corporation does not monitor its exposure to credit derivatives based solely on the notional amount because this measure does not take into consideration the probability of occurrence. As such, the notional amount is not a reliable indicator of the Corporation’s exposure to these contracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and establish limits to help ensure that  certain credit risk-related losses occur within acceptable, predefined limits.The Corporation manages its market risk exposure to credit derivatives by entering into a variety of offsetting derivative contracts and security positions. For example, in certain instances, the Corporation may purchase credit protection with identical underlying referenced names to offset its exposure. The carrying value and notional amount of written credit derivatives for which the Corporation held purchased credit derivatives with identical   Bank of America 76underlying referenced names and terms were $2.6 billion and $486.6 billion at March 31, 2017, and $4.7 billion and $490.7 billion at December 31, 2016.Credit-related notes in the table on page 76 include investments in securities issued by collateralized debt obligation (CDO), collateralized loan obligation (CLO) and credit-linked note vehicles. These instruments are primarily classified as trading securities. The carrying value of these instruments equals the Corporation’s maximum exposure to loss. The Corporation is not obligated to make any payments to the entities under the terms of the securities owned.Credit-related Contingent Features and CollateralThe Corporation executes the majority of its derivative contracts in the OTC market with large, international financial institutions, including broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of non-financial companies. A significant majority of the derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit rating downgrade (depending on the ultimate rating level) or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required of the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow the Corporation to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades. Further, as previously discussed on page 71, the Corporation enters into legally enforceable master netting agreements which reduce risk by permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of certain events.A majority of the Corporation’s derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features, primarily in the form of ISDA master netting agreements and credit support documentation that enhance the creditworthiness of these instruments compared to other obligations of the respective counterparty with whom the Corporation has transacted. These contingent features may be for the benefit of the Corporation as well as its counterparties with respect to changes in the Corporation’s creditworthiness and the mark-to-market exposure under the derivative transactions. At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Corporation held cash and securities collateral of $77.1 billion and $85.5 billion, and posted cash and securities collateral of $64.0 billion and $71.1 billion in the normal course of business under derivative agreements. This excludes cross-product margining agreements where clients are permitted to margin on a net basis for both derivative and secured financing arrangements.In connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, the Corporation can be required to provide additional collateral or to terminate transactions with certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade of the senior debt ratings of the Corporation or certain subsidiaries. The amount of additional collateral required depends on the contract and is usually a fixed incremental amount and/or the market value of the exposure.At March 31, 2017, the amount of collateral, calculated based on the terms of the contracts, that the Corporation and certain subsidiaries could be required to post to counterparties but had not yet posted to counterparties was approximately $2.4 billion, including $1.2 billion for Bank of America, N.A. (BANA).Some counterparties are currently able to unilaterally terminate certain contracts, or the Corporation or certain  subsidiaries may be required to take other action such as find a suitable replacement or obtain a guarantee. At March 31, 2017, the liability recorded for these derivative contracts was $41 million.The table below presents the amount of additional collateral that would have been contractually required by derivative contracts and other trading agreements at March 31, 2017 if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch and by an additional second incremental notch.

Assumptions used for the underlying loans that support the MBS can vary widely from loan to loan and are influenced by such factors as loan interest rate, geographic location of the borrower, borrower characteristics and collateral type. Based on these assumptions, the Corporation then determines how the underlying collateral cash flows will be distributed to each MBS issued from the applicable special purpose entity. Expected principal and interest cash flows on an impaired AFS debt security are discounted using the effective yield of each individual impaired AFS debt security.Significant assumptions used in estimating the expected cash flows for measuring credit losses on non-agency RMBS were as follows at March 31, 2017.      Significant Assumptions         Range (1) Weighted- average 10th Percentile (2) 90th Percentile (2)Prepayment speed11.4% 2.8% 20.0%Loss severity21.3 9.5 39.2Life default rate22.9 1.3 80.4(1) Represents the range of inputs/assumptions based upon the underlying collateral.(2) The value of a variable below which the indicated percentile of observations will fall.Annual constant prepayment speed and loss severity rates are projected considering collateral characteristics such as loan-to-value (LTV), creditworthiness of borrowers as measured using Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores, and geographic concentrations. The weighted-average severity by collateral type was 17.8 percent for prime, 19.9 percent for Alt-A and 31.9 percent for subprime at March 31, 2017. Additionally, default rates are projected by considering collateral characteristics including, but not limited to, LTV, FICO and geographic concentration. Weighted-average life default rates by collateral type were 16.3 percent for prime, 23.9 percent for Alt-A and 24.3 percent for subprime at March 31, 2017.

For more information, see Note 14 – Fair Value Measurements and Note 15 – Fair Value Option.(9) Total outstandings includes U.S. commercial real estate loans of $54.3 billion and non-U.S. commercial real estate loans of $3.1 billion.(10) Includes non-U.S. credit card loans, which are included in assets of business held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. (11) The Corporation pledged $143.1 billion of loans to secure potential borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB. This amount is not included in the parenthetical disclosure of loans and leases pledged as collateral on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as there were no related outstanding borrowings.The Corporation categorizes consumer real estate loans as core and non-core based on loan and customer characteristics such as origination date, product type, LTV, FICO score and delinquency status consistent with its current consumer and mortgage servicing strategy. Generally, loans that were originated after January 1, 2010, qualified under government-sponsored enterprise underwriting guidelines, or otherwise met the Corporation's underwriting guidelines in place in 2015 are characterized as core loans. Loans held in legacy private-label securitizations, government-insured loans originated prior to 2010, loan products no longer originated, and loans originated prior to 2010 and classified as nonperforming or modified in a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) prior to 2016 are generally characterized as non-core loans, and are principally run-off portfolios.  The Corporation has entered into long-term credit protection agreements with FNMA and FHLMC on loans totaling $6.6 billion and $6.4 billion at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, providing full credit protection on residential mortgage loans that become severely delinquent. All of these loans are individually insured and therefore the Corporation does not record an allowance for credit losses related to these loans.Nonperforming Loans and LeasesThe Corporation classifies junior-lien home equity loans as nonperforming when the first-lien loan becomes 90 days past due even if the junior-lien loan is performing. At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, $412 million and $428 million of such junior-lien home equity loans were included in nonperforming loans. 83     Bank of AmericaThe Corporation classifies consumer real estate loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower as TDRs, irrespective of payment history or delinquency status, even if the repayment terms for the loan have not been otherwise modified. The Corporation continues to have a lien on the underlying collateral. At March 31, 2017, nonperforming loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy with no change in repayment terms were $517 million of which $320 million were current on their contractual payments, while $166 million were 90 days or more past due. Of the contractually current nonperforming loans, approximately 83 percent were discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy over 12 months ago, and approximately 73 percent were discharged 24 months or more ago. During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Corporation sold nonperforming and other delinquent consumer real estate loans with a carrying value of $142 million and $1.0 billion, including $0 and $174 million of PCI loans. The Corporation recorded net recoveries of $11 million and net charge-offs of $40 million related to these sales for the three months  ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. Gains related to these sales of $6 million and $31 million were recorded in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Corporation transferred nonperforming loans with a net carrying value of $221 million to held-for-sale. There were no transfers of nonperforming loans to held-for-sale for the same period in 2016.The table below presents the Corporation’s nonperforming loans and leases including nonperforming TDRs, and loans accruing past due 90 days or more at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Nonperforming loans held-for-sale (LHFS) are excluded from nonperforming loans and leases as they are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. For more information on the criteria for classification as nonperforming, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, residential mortgage includes $2.7 billion and $3.0 billion of loans on which interest has been curtailed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), and therefore are no longer accruing interest, although principal is still insured, and $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion of loans on which interest is still accruing.n/a = not applicableCredit Quality IndicatorsThe Corporation monitors credit quality within its Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio segments based on primary credit quality indicators. For more information on the portfolio segments, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment, the primary credit quality indicators are refreshed LTV and refreshed FICO score. Refreshed LTV measures the carrying value of the loan as a percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. Home equity loans are evaluated using combined loan-to-value (CLTV) which measures the carrying value  of the Corporation’s loan and available line of credit combined with any outstanding senior liens against the property as a percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. FICO score measures the creditworthiness of the borrower based on the financial obligations of the borrower and the borrower’s credit history. FICO scores are typically refreshed quarterly or more frequently. Certain borrowers (e.g., borrowers that have had debts discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding) may not have their FICO scores updated. FICO scores are also a primary credit quality indicator for the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment and the business card portfolio within U.S. small business commercial. Within the Commercial portfolio segment, loans are evaluated using the internal classifications of pass rated or   Bank of America 84reservable criticized as the primary credit quality indicators. The term reservable criticized refers to those commercial loans that are internally classified or listed by the Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful, which are asset quality categories defined by regulatory authorities. These assets have an elevated level of risk and may have a high probability of default or total loss. Pass rated refers to all loans not considered  reservable criticized. In addition to these primary credit quality indicators, the Corporation uses other credit quality indicators for certain types of loans.The following tables present certain credit quality indicators for the Corporation’s Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio segments, by class of financing receivables, at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

Bank of America 86Impaired Loans and Troubled Debt RestructuringsA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information, it is probable that the Corporation will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. Impaired loans include nonperforming commercial loans and all consumer and commercial TDRs. Impaired loans exclude nonperforming consumer loans and nonperforming commercial leases unless they are classified as TDRs. Loans accounted for under the fair value option are also excluded. PCI loans are excluded and reported separately on page 93. For additional information, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Consumer Real EstateImpaired consumer real estate loans within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment consist entirely of TDRs. Excluding PCI loans, most modifications of consumer real estate loans meet the definition of TDRs when a binding offer is extended to a borrower. For more information on impaired consumer real estate loans, see Note 4 – Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Consumer real estate loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy with no change in repayment terms and not reaffirmed by the borrower of $1.4 billion were included in TDRs at March 31, 2017, of which $517 million were classified as nonperforming and $501 million were loans fully-insured by the  FHA. For more information on loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, see Nonperforming Loans and Leases in this Note.At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, remaining commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose terms have been modified in a consumer real estate TDR were immaterial. Consumer real estate foreclosed properties totaled $328 million and $363 million at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The carrying value of consumer real estate loans, including fully-insured and PCI loans, for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process as of March 31, 2017 was $4.3 billion. During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Corporation reclassified $200 million and $416 million of consumer real estate loans to foreclosed properties or, for properties acquired upon foreclosure of certain government-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans), to other assets. The reclassifications represent non-cash investing activities and, accordingly, are not reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.The table below provides the unpaid principal balance, carrying value and related allowance at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and the average carrying value and interest income recognized for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 for impaired loans in the Corporation’s Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment. Certain impaired consumer real estate loans do not have a related allowance as the current valuation of these impaired loans exceeded the carrying value, which is net of previously recorded charge-offs.

A payment default for consumer real estate TDRs is recognized when a borrower has missed three monthly payments (not necessarily consecutively) since modification. Payment defaults on a trial modification where the borrower has not yet met the terms of the agreement are included in the table below if the borrower is 90 days or more past due three months after the offer to modify is made.

The Corporation seeks to assist customers that are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying loans while ensuring compliance with federal, local and international laws and guidelines. Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months, all of which are considered TDRs. In addition, the accounts of non-U.S. credit card customers who do not qualify for a fixed payment plan may have their interest rates reduced, as required by certain local jurisdictions. These modifications, which are also TDRs, tend to experience higher payment default rates given that the borrowers  may lack the ability to repay even with the interest rate reduction. In substantially all cases, the customer’s available line of credit is canceled. The Corporation makes loan modifications directly with borrowers for debt held only by the Corporation (internal programs). Additionally, the Corporation makes loan modifications for borrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies that provide solutions to customers’ entire unsecured debt structures (external programs). The Corporation classifies other secured consumer loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy as TDRs which are written down to collateral value and placed on nonaccrual status no later than the time of discharge.

The Corporation routinely securitizes loans and debt securities using VIEs as a source of funding for the Corporation and as a means of transferring the economic risk of the loans or debt securities to third parties. The assets are transferred into a trust or other securitization vehicle such that the assets are legally isolated from the creditors of the Corporation and are not available to satisfy its obligations. These assets can only be used to settle obligations of the trust or other securitization vehicle. The Corporation also administers, structures or invests in other VIEs including CDOs, investment vehicles and other entities. For more information on the Corporation’s utilization of VIEs, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.The tables in this Note present the assets and liabilities of consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, in situations where the Corporation has continuing involvement with transferred assets or if the Corporation otherwise has a variable interest in the VIE. The tables also present the Corporation’s maximum loss exposure at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 resulting from its involvement with consolidated VIEs and unconsolidated VIEs in which the Corporation holds a variable interest. The Corporation’s maximum loss exposure is based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and incorporates not only potential losses associated with assets recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but also potential losses associated with off-balance sheet commitments, such as unfunded liquidity commitments and other contractual arrangements. The Corporation’s maximum loss exposure does not include losses previously recognized through write-downs of assets.The Corporation invests in ABS issued by third-party VIEs with which it has no other form of involvement and enters into certain commercial lending arrangements that may also incorporate the use of VIEs to hold collateral. These securities and loans are included in Note 3 – Securities or Note 4 – Outstanding Loans and Leases. In addition, the Corporation uses VIEs such as trust  preferred securities trusts in connection with its funding activities. For additional information, see Note 11 – Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Corporation uses VIEs, such as common trust funds managed within Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), to provide investment opportunities for clients. These VIEs, which are generally not consolidated by the Corporation, as applicable, are not included in the tables herein.Except as described below, the Corporation did not provide financial support to consolidated or unconsolidated VIEs during the three months ended March 31, 2017 or the year ended December 31, 2016 that it was not previously contractually required to provide, nor does it intend to do so.First-lien Mortgage SecuritizationsFirst-lien MortgagesAs part of its mortgage banking activities, the Corporation securitizes a portion of the first-lien residential mortgage loans it originates or purchases from third parties, generally in the form of RMBS guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises, FNMA and FHLMC (collectively the GSEs), or Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) primarily in the case of FHA-insured and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed mortgage loans. Securitization usually occurs in conjunction with or shortly after origination or purchase, and the Corporation may also securitize loans held in its residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, the Corporation may, from time to time, securitize commercial mortgages it originates or purchases from other entities. The Corporation typically services the loans it securitizes. Further, the Corporation may retain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts including senior and subordinate securities and equity tranches issued by the trusts. Except as described below and in Note 7 – Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees, the Corporation does not provide guarantees or recourse to the securitization trusts other than standard representations and warranties.The table below summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage securitizations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.

Gains recognized on these LHFS prior to securitization, which totaled $90 million and $108 million, net of hedges, during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, are not included in the table above.(3) The Corporation may have the option to repurchase delinquent loans out of securitization trusts, which reduces the amount of servicing advances it is required to make. The Corporation may also repurchase loans from securitization trusts to perform modifications. The majority of repurchased loans are FHA-insured mortgages collateralizing GNMA securities.In addition to cash proceeds as reported in the table above, the Corporation received securities with an initial fair value of $275 million and $898 million in connection with first-lien mortgage securitizations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. The receipt of these securities represents non-cash operating and investing activities and, accordingly, is not reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Substantially all of  these securities were initially classified as Level 2 assets within the fair value hierarchy. During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, there were no changes to the initial classification.The Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization of consumer real estate loans. The unpaid principal balance of loans serviced for investors, including residential mortgage and home equity loans, totaled $316.0 billion and   Bank of America 96$386.0 billion at March 31, 2017 and 2016. Servicing fee and ancillary fee income on serviced loans was $245 million and $302 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. Servicing advances on serviced loans were $5.8 billion and $6.2 billion at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. For more information on MSRs, see Note 14 – Fair Value Measurements.During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Corporation deconsolidated agency residential mortgage securitization vehicles with total assets of $0 and $2.7 billion  following the sale of retained interests to third parties, after which the Corporation no longer had the unilateral ability to liquidate the vehicles. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, gains on sale of $113 million related to the deconsolidations were recorded in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.The table below summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage securitization trusts in which the Corporation held a variable interest at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Corporation recognized $15 million and $2 million of credit-related impairment losses in earnings on those securities classified as AFS debt securities and none on HTM securities.(3) Not included in the table above are all other assets of $118 million and $189 million, representing the unpaid principal balance of mortgage loans eligible for repurchase from unconsolidated residential mortgage securitization vehicles, principally guaranteed by GNMA, and all other liabilities of $118 million and $189 million, representing the principal amount that would be payable to the securitization vehicles if the Corporation was to exercise the repurchase option, at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.(4) Principal balance outstanding includes loans where the Corporation was the transferor to securitization vehicles with which it has continuing involvement, which may include servicing the loans.97     Bank of AmericaOther Asset-backed SecuritizationsThe table below summarizes select information related to home equity loan, credit card and other asset-backed VIEs in which the Corporation held a variable interest at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

For both consolidated and unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs, the maximum loss exposure excludes the liability for representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees. For additional information, see Note 7 – Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees.(2) At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, loans and leases in the consolidated credit card trust included $13.9 billion and $17.6 billion of seller’s interest.(3) At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, all other assets in the consolidated credit card trust included restricted cash, certain short-term investments, and unbilled accrued interest and fees.(4) As a holder of these securities, the Corporation receives scheduled principal and interest payments. During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the Corporation recognized $2 million and $1 million of credit-related impairment losses in earnings on those securities classified as AFS debt securities and none on HTM securities.(5) The retained senior and subordinate securities were valued using quoted market prices or observable market inputs (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy).(6) Total assets include loans the Corporation transferred with which it has continuing involvement, which may include servicing the loan.Home Equity LoansThe Corporation retains interests in home equity securitization trusts to which it transferred home equity loans. These retained interests include senior and subordinate securities and residual interests. In addition, the Corporation may be obligated to provide subordinate funding to the trusts during a rapid amortization event. The Corporation typically services the loans in the trusts. Except as described below and in Note 7 – Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate Guarantees, the Corporation does not provide guarantees or recourse to the securitization trusts other than standard representations and warranties. There were no securitizations of home equity loans during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, and all of the home equity trusts that hold revolving home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have entered the rapid amortization phase.The maximum loss exposure in the table above includes the Corporation’s obligation to provide subordinate funding to the  consolidated and unconsolidated home equity loan securitizations that have entered the rapid amortization phase. During this period, cash payments from borrowers are accumulated to repay outstanding debt securities, and the Corporation continues to make advances to borrowers when they draw on their lines of credit. At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, home equity loan securitizations in rapid amortization for which the Corporation has a subordinate funding obligation, including both consolidated and unconsolidated trusts, had $2.4 billion and $2.7 billion of trust certificates outstanding that were held by third parties. The charges that will ultimately be recorded as a result of the rapid amortization events depend on the undrawn available credit on the home equity lines, performance of the loans, the amount of subsequent draws and the timing of related cash flows. Amounts actually funded by the Corporation under this obligation totaled $0 and $1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.  Bank of America 98Credit Card SecuritizationsThe Corporation securitizes originated and purchased credit card loans. The Corporation’s continuing involvement with the securitization trust includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided interest (seller’s interest) in the receivables, and holding certain retained interests including senior and subordinate securities, subordinate interests in accrued interest and fees on the securitized receivables, and cash reserve accounts. The seller’s interest in the trust, which is pari passu to the investors’ interest, is classified in loans and leases.During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, $2.0 billion and $0 of new senior debt securities were issued to third-party investors from the credit card securitization trust.The Corporation held subordinate securities issued by the credit card securitization trust with a notional principal amount of $7.7 billion and $7.5 billion at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. These securities serve as a form of credit enhancement to the senior debt securities and have a stated interest rate of zero percent. There were $323 million and $0 of these subordinate securities issued during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.Resecuritization TrustsThe Corporation transfers trading securities, typically MBS, into resecuritization vehicles at the request of customers seeking securities with specific characteristics. The Corporation may also resecuritize debt securities carried at fair value, including AFS securities, within its investment portfolio for purposes of improving liquidity and capital, and managing credit or interest rate risk. Generally, there are no significant ongoing activities performed in a resecuritization trust and no single investor has the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust.The Corporation resecuritized $7.8 billion and $6.6 billion of securities during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. Securities transferred into resecuritization vehicles during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were measured  at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in trading account profits prior to the resecuritization and no gain or loss on sale was recorded. Resecuritization proceeds included securities with an initial fair value of $734 million and $1.0 billion during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. All of the securities received as resecuritization proceeds were classified as trading securities and were categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.Municipal Bond TrustsThe Corporation administers municipal bond trusts that hold highly-rated, long-term, fixed-rate municipal bonds. The trusts obtain financing by issuing floating-rate trust certificates that reprice on a weekly or other short-term basis to third-party investors. The Corporation may transfer assets into the trusts and may also serve as remarketing agent and/or liquidity provider for the trusts. The floating-rate investors have the right to tender the certificates at specified dates. Should the Corporation be unable to remarket the tendered certificates, it may be obligated to purchase them at par under standby liquidity facilities. The Corporation also provides credit enhancement to investors in certain municipal bond trusts whereby the Corporation guarantees the payment of interest and principal on floating-rate certificates issued by these trusts in the event of default by the issuer of the underlying municipal bond.The Corporation’s liquidity commitments to unconsolidated municipal bond trusts, including those for which the Corporation was transferor, totaled $1.6 billion at both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The weighted-average remaining life of bonds held in the trusts at March 31, 2017 was 5.2 years. There were no material write-downs or downgrades of assets or issuers during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.Other Variable Interest EntitiesThe table below summarizes select information related to other VIEs in which the Corporation held a variable interest at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

The Corporation may transfer assets to and invest in securities issued by these vehicles. The Corporation typically enters into credit, equity, interest rate, commodity or foreign currency derivatives to synthetically create or alter the investment profile of the issued securities.The Corporation’s maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated customer vehicles totaled $2.6 billion and $2.9 billion at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, including the notional amount of derivatives to which the Corporation is a counterparty, net of losses previously recorded, and the Corporation’s investment, if any, in securities issued by the vehicles. The maximum loss exposure has not been reduced to reflect the benefit of offsetting swaps with the customers or collateral arrangements. The Corporation also had liquidity commitments, including written put options and collateral value guarantees, with certain unconsolidated vehicles of $64 million and $323 million at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, that are included in the table above.Collateralized Debt Obligation VehiclesThe Corporation receives fees for structuring CDO vehicles, which hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities, typically corporate debt or ABS, which the CDO vehicles fund by issuing multiple tranches of debt and equity securities. Synthetic CDOs enter into a portfolio of CDS to synthetically create exposure to fixed-income securities. CLOs, which are a subset of CDOs, hold pools of loans, typically corporate loans. CDOs are typically managed by third-party portfolio managers. The Corporation typically transfers assets to these CDOs, holds securities issued by the CDOs and may be a derivative counterparty to the CDOs, including a CDS counterparty for synthetic CDOs. The Corporation has also entered into total return swaps with certain CDOs whereby the Corporation absorbs the economic returns generated by specified assets held by the CDO.The Corporation’s maximum loss exposure to consolidated and unconsolidated CDOs totaled $586 million and $430 million at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. This exposure is calculated on a gross basis and does not reflect any benefit from insurance purchased from third parties.Investment VehiclesThe Corporation sponsors, invests in or provides financing, which may be in connection with the sale of assets, to a variety of investment vehicles that hold loans, real estate, debt securities or other financial instruments and are designed to provide the desired investment profile to investors or the Corporation. At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Corporation’s consolidated investment vehicles had total assets of $778 million and $846 million. The Corporation also held investments in unconsolidated vehicles with total assets of $18.7 billion and $17.3 billion at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The Corporation’s maximum loss exposure associated with both consolidated and unconsolidated investment vehicles totaled $5.3 billion and $5.1 billion at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 comprised primarily of on-balance sheet assets less non-recourse liabilities. In prior periods, the Corporation transferred servicing advance receivables to independent third parties in connection with the sale of MSRs. Portions of the receivables were transferred into unconsolidated securitization trusts. The Corporation retained senior interests in such receivables with a maximum loss exposure and funding obligation of $90 million and $150 million, including a funded balance of $67 million and $75 million at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, which were classified in other debt securities carried at fair value.Leveraged Lease TrustsThe Corporation’s net investment in consolidated leveraged lease trusts totaled $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The trusts hold long-lived equipment such as rail cars, power generation and distribution equipment, and commercial aircraft. The Corporation structures the trusts and holds a significant residual interest. The net investment represents the Corporation’s maximum loss exposure to the trusts in the unlikely event that the leveraged lease investments become worthless. Debt issued by the leveraged lease trusts is non-recourse to the Corporation.Tax Credit VehiclesThe Corporation holds investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships and similar entities that construct, own and operate affordable housing, wind and solar projects. An unrelated third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the vehicle. The Corporation earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure included in the Other VIEs table was $12.8 billion and $12.6 billion at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The Corporation’s risk of loss is generally mitigated by policies requiring that the project qualify for the expected tax credits prior to making its investment.The Corporation's investments in affordable housing partnerships, which are reported in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, totaled $7.4 billion, including unfunded commitments to provide capital contributions of $2.7 billion at both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The unfunded commitments are expected to be paid over the next five years. The Corporation recognized tax credits and other tax benefits from investments in affordable housing partnerships of $251 million and reported pretax losses in other noninterest income of $196 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. For the same period in 2016, the Corporation recognized tax credits and other tax benefits of $193 million and pretax losses of $198 million. Tax credits are recognized as part of the Corporation's annual effective tax rate used to determine tax expense in a given quarter. Accordingly, the portion of a year's expected tax benefits recognized in any given quarter may differ from 25 percent. The Corporation may from time to time be asked to invest additional amounts to support a troubled affordable housing project. Such additional investments have not been and are not expected to be significant.NOTE 7 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate GuaranteesBackgroundThe Corporation securitizes first-lien residential mortgage loans generally in the form of RMBS guaranteed by the GSEs or by GNMA in the case of FHA-insured, VA-guaranteed and Rural Housing   Bank of America 100Service-guaranteed mortgage loans, and sells pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans in the form of whole loans. In addition, in prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans. In connection with these transactions, the Corporation or certain of its subsidiaries or legacy companies make and have made various representations and warranties. Breaches of these representations and warranties have resulted in and may continue to result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage loans or to otherwise make whole or provide other remedies to investors, securitization trusts, guarantors, insurers or other parties (collectively, repurchases). Settlement ActionsThe Corporation has vigorously contested any request for repurchase where it has concluded that a valid basis for repurchase does not exist and will continue to do so in the future. However, in an effort to resolve legacy mortgage-related issues, the Corporation has reached bulk settlements, certain of which have been for significant amounts, in lieu of a loan-by-loan review process, including settlements with the GSEs, four monoline insurers and Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon), as trustee for certain securitization trusts. These bulk settlements generally did not cover all transactions with the relevant counterparties or all potential claims that may arise, including in some instances securities law, fraud, indemnification and servicing claims, some of which have been addressed separately. The Corporation’s liability in connection with the transactions and claims not covered by these settlements could be material to the Corporation’s results of operations or liquidity for any particular reporting period. The Corporation may reach other settlements in the future if opportunities arise on terms it believes to be advantageous. However, there can be no assurance that the Corporation will reach future settlements or, if it does, that the terms of past settlements can be relied upon to predict the terms of future settlements. Unresolved Repurchase ClaimsUnresolved representations and warranties repurchase claims represent the notional amount of repurchase claims made by counterparties, typically the outstanding principal balance or the unpaid principal balance at the time of default. In the case of first-lien mortgages, the claim amount is often significantly greater than the expected loss amount due to the benefit of collateral and, in some cases, mortgage insurance (MI) or mortgage guarantee payments. Claims received from a counterparty remain outstanding until the underlying loan is repurchased, the claim is rescinded by the counterparty, the Corporation determines that the applicable statute of limitations has expired, or representations and warranties claims with respect to the applicable trust are settled, and fully and finally released. The Corporation does not include duplicate claims in the amounts disclosed. The table below presents unresolved repurchase claims at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The unresolved repurchase claims include only claims where the Corporation believes that the counterparty has the contractual right to submit claims. The unresolved repurchase claims predominantly relate to subprime and pay option first-lien loans and home equity loans. For additional information, see Private-label Securitizations and Whole-loan Sales Experience in this Note and Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial  Statements of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.    Unresolved Repurchase Claims by Counterparty, net of duplicate claims    (Dollars in millions)March 31 2017 December 31 2016By counterparty   Private-label securitization trustees, whole-loan investors, including third-party securitization sponsors and other (1)$16,678 $16,685Monolines 1,583 1,583GSEs 4 9Total unresolved repurchase claims by counterparty, net of duplicate claims$18,265 $18,277(1) Includes $11.9 billion of claims based on individual file reviews and $4.8 billion of claims submitted without individual file reviews at both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Corporation received $24 million in new repurchase claims and $36 million in claims were resolved. Of the remaining unresolved monoline claims, substantially all of the claims pertain to second-lien loans and are currently the subject of litigation with a single monoline insurer. There may be additional claims or file requests in the future.In addition to the unresolved repurchase claims in the Unresolved Repurchase Claims by Counterparty, net of duplicate claims table, the Corporation has received notifications from sponsors of third-party securitizations with whom the Corporation engaged in whole-loan transactions indicating that the Corporation may have indemnity obligations with respect to loans for which the Corporation has not received a repurchase request. These outstanding notifications totaled $1.3 billion at both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. There were no new notifications received during the three months ended March 31, 2017.The presence of repurchase claims on a given trust, receipt of notices of indemnification obligations and receipt of other communications, as discussed above, are all factors that inform the Corporation’s liability for representations and warranties and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss.Private-label Securitizations and Whole-loan Sales ExperiencePrior to 2009, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans. In connection with these transactions, the Corporation or certain of its subsidiaries or legacy companies made various representations and warranties. When the Corporation provided representations and warranties in connection with the sale of whole loans, the whole-loan investors may retain the right to make repurchase claims even when the loans were aggregated with other collateral into private-label securitizations sponsored by the whole-loan investors. In other third-party securitizations, the whole-loan investors’ rights to enforce the representations and warranties were transferred to the securitization trustees. Private-label securitization investors generally do not have the contractual right to demand repurchase of loans directly or the right to access loan files directly.At both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, for loans originated between 2004 and 2008, the notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims submitted by private-label 101     Bank of Americasecuritization trustees, whole-loan investors, including third-party securitization sponsors, and others was $16.6 billion. The notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims at both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 included $5.6 billion of claims related to loans in specific private-label securitization groups or tranches where the Corporation owns substantially all of the outstanding securities or will otherwise realize the benefit of any repurchase claims paid.The notional amount of outstanding unresolved repurchase claims remained relatively unchanged at March 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016. Outstanding repurchase claims remained unresolved primarily due to (1) the level of detail, support and analysis accompanying such claims, which impact overall claim quality and, therefore, claims resolution, and (2) the lack of an established process to resolve disputes related to these claims.The Corporation reviews properly presented repurchase claims on a loan-by-loan basis. For time-barred claims, the counterparty is informed that the claim is denied on the basis of the statute of limitations and the claim is treated as resolved. For timely claims, if the Corporation, after review, does not believe a claim is valid, it will deny the claim and generally indicate a reason for the denial. If the counterparty agrees with the Corporation's denial of the claim, the counterparty may rescind the claim. If there is a disagreement as to the resolution of the claim, meaningful dialogue and negotiation between the parties are generally necessary to reach a resolution on an individual claim. When a claim is denied and the Corporation does not hear from the counterparty for six months, the Corporation views the claim as inactive; however, such claims remain in the outstanding claims balance until resolution. In the case of private-label securitization trustees and third-party sponsors, there is currently no established process in place for the parties to reach a conclusion on an individual loan if there is a disagreement on the resolution of the claim. The Corporation has performed an initial review with respect to substantially all outstanding claims and, although the Corporation does not believe a valid basis for repurchase has been established by the claimant, it considers such claims activity in the computation of its liability for representations and warranties.Liability for Representations and Warranties and Corporate Guarantees and Estimated Range of Possible LossThe liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related provision is included in mortgage banking income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The liability for representations and warranties is established when those obligations are both probable and reasonably estimable.The Corporation’s representations and warranties liability and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss at March 31, 2017 considers, among other things, the repurchase experience implied in the settlements with BNY Mellon and other counterparties. Since the securitization trusts that were included in the settlements with BNY Mellon and other counterparties differ from other securitization trusts, the Corporation adjusts the experience implied by those prior settlements based on the characteristics of those trusts where the Corporation has a continuing possibility of timely claims in order to determine the representations and warranties liability and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss. The table below presents a rollforward of the liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees.    Representations and Warranties and Corporate Guarantees Three Months Ended March 31(Dollars in millions)2017 2016Liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees, January 1$2,339 $11,326Additions for new sales1 1Payments (1)(43) (8,557)Provision (benefit)(3) 42Liability for representations and warranties and corporate guarantees, March 31 $2,294 $2,812(1) In February 2016, the Corporation made an $8.5 billion settlement payment to BNY Mellon as part of the settlement with BNY Mellon.The representations and warranties liability represents the Corporation’s best estimate of probable incurred losses as of March 31, 2017. However, it is reasonably possible that future representations and warranties losses may occur in excess of the amounts recorded for these exposures. The Corporation currently estimates that the range of possible loss for representations and warranties exposures could be up to $2 billion over existing accruals at March 31, 2017. The Corporation treats claims that are time-barred as resolved and does not consider such claims in the estimated range of possible loss. The estimated range of possible loss reflects principally exposures related to loans in private-label securitization trusts. It represents a reasonably possible loss, but does not represent a probable loss, and is based on currently available information, significant judgment and a number of assumptions that are subject to change.The liability for representations and warranties exposures and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss do not consider certain losses related to servicing, including foreclosure and related costs, fraud, indemnity, or claims (including for RMBS) related to securities law or monoline insurance litigation. Losses with respect to one or more of these matters could be material to the Corporation’s results of operations or liquidity for any particular reporting period.Future provisions and/or ranges of possible loss for representations and warranties may be significantly impacted if actual experiences are different from the Corporation’s assumptions in predictive models, including, without limitation, the actual repurchase rates on loans in trusts not settled as part of the settlements with BNY Mellon and other counterparties which may be different than the implied repurchase experience, estimated MI rescission rates, economic conditions, estimated home prices, consumer and counterparty behavior, the applicable statute of limitations, potential indemnity obligations to third parties to whom the Corporation has sold loans subject to representations and warranties, and a variety of other judgmental factors. Adverse developments with respect to one or more of the assumptions underlying the liability for representations and warranties and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss, such as counterparties successfully challenging or avoiding the application of the relevant statute of limitations, could result in significant increases to future provisions and/or the estimated range of possible loss.

Substantially all of the Corporation’s securities financing activities are transacted under legally enforceable master repurchase agreements or legally enforceable master securities lending agreements that give the Corporation, in the event of default by the counterparty, the right to liquidate securities held and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty. The Corporation offsets securities financing transactions with the same counterparty on the Consolidated Balance Sheet where it has such a legally enforceable master netting agreement and the transactions have the same maturity date. The Securities Financing Agreements table presents securities financing agreements included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, and in federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty netting. Gross assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master  netting agreements. For more information on the offsetting of derivatives, see Note 2 – Derivatives.The “Other” amount in the table, which is included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accrued expenses and other liabilities, relates to transactions where the Corporation acts as the lender in a securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged as collateral or sold. In these transactions, the Corporation recognizes an asset at fair value, representing the securities received, and a liability, representing the obligation to return those securities.Gross assets and liabilities in the table include activity where uncertainty exists as to the enforceability of certain master netting agreements under bankruptcy laws in some countries or industries and, accordingly, these are reported on a gross basis.The column titled “Financial Instruments” in the table includes securities collateral received or pledged under repurchase or securities lending agreements where there is a legally enforceable master netting agreement. These amounts are not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, but are shown as a reduction to the net balance sheet amount in this table to derive a net asset or liability. Securities collateral received or pledged where the legal enforceability of the master netting agreements is not certain is not included.

For securities loaned transactions, the Corporation receives collateral in the form of cash, letters of credit or other securities. To help ensure that the market value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient, collateral is generally valued daily, and the Corporation may be required to deposit  additional collateral or may receive or return collateral pledged when appropriate. Repurchase agreements and securities loaned transactions are generally either overnight, continuous (i.e., no stated term) or short-term. The Corporation manages liquidity risks related to these agreements by sourcing funding from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when appropriate.105     Bank of AmericaNOTE 10 Commitments and ContingenciesIn the normal course of business, the Corporation enters into a number of off-balance sheet commitments. These commitments expose the Corporation to varying degrees of credit and market risk and are subject to the same credit and market risk limitation reviews as those instruments recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For more information on commitments and contingencies, see Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Credit Extension CommitmentsThe Corporation enters into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and commercial letters of credit to meet the financing needs of its customers. The table below includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments net of amounts distributed (e.g., syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions. The distributed amounts were $11.9 billion and $12.1  billion at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. At March 31, 2017, the carrying value of these commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option, was $776 million, including deferred revenue of $19 million and a reserve for unfunded lending commitments of $757 million. At December 31, 2016, the comparable amounts were $779 million, $17 million and $762 million, respectively. The carrying value of these commitments is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.The table below also includes the notional amount of commitments of $5.9 billion and $7.0 billion at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 that are accounted for under the fair value option. However, the table below excludes cumulative net fair value of $135 million and $173 million on these commitments, which is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities. For more information regarding the Corporation’s loan commitments accounted for under the fair value option, see Note 15 – Fair Value Option.

Amounts in the table include consumer SBLCs of $399 million and $376 million at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.(2)  Includes business card unused lines of credit.Legally binding commitments to extend credit generally have specified rates and maturities. Certain of these commitments have adverse change clauses that help to protect the Corporation against deterioration in the borrower’s ability to pay.Other CommitmentsAt March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Corporation had commitments to purchase loans (e.g., residential mortgage and commercial real estate) of $537 million and $767 million, and commitments to purchase commercial loans of $564 million and $636 million, which upon settlement will be included in loans or LHFS.At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Corporation had commitments to purchase commodities, primarily liquefied  natural gas of $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion, which upon settlement will be included in trading account assets.At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Corporation had commitments to enter into resale and forward-dated resale and securities borrowing agreements of $61.5 billion and $48.9 billion, and commitments to enter into forward-dated repurchase and securities lending agreements of $36.6 billion and $24.4 billion. These commitments expire within the next 12 months.The Corporation has entered into agreements to purchase retail automotive loans from certain auto loan originators. These agreements provide for stated purchase amounts and contain cancellation provisions that allow the Corporation to terminate its commitment to purchase at any time, with a minimum notification period. At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Corporation’s maximum purchase commitment was $175 million   Bank of America 106and $475 million. In addition, the Corporation has a commitment to originate or purchase auto loans and leases from a strategic partner up to $1.9 billion for the remainder of 2017, with this commitment expiring on December 31, 2017.The Corporation is a party to operating leases for certain of its premises and equipment. Commitments under these leases are approximately $1.7 billion, $2.2 billion, $1.9 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion for the remainder of 2017 and the years through 2021, respectively, and $5.1 billion in the aggregate for all years thereafter.Other GuaranteesBank-owned Life Insurance Book Value ProtectionThe Corporation sells products that offer book value protection to insurance carriers who offer group life insurance policies to corporations, primarily banks. At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the notional amount of these guarantees, which are recorded as derivatives totaled $14.0 billion and $13.9 billion. At both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Corporation’s maximum exposure related to these guarantees totaled $3.2 billion, with estimated maturity dates between 2031 and 2039. The net fair value including the fee receivable associated with these guarantees was $3 million and $4 million at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and reflects the probability of surrender as well as the multiple structural protection features in the contracts.Merchant ServicesIn accordance with credit and debit card association rules, the Corporation sponsors merchant processing servicers that process credit and debit card transactions on behalf of various merchants. In connection with these services, a liability may arise in the event of a billing dispute between the merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately resolved in the cardholder’s favor. If the merchant defaults on its obligation to reimburse the cardholder, the cardholder, through its issuing bank, generally has until six months after the date of the transaction to present a chargeback to the merchant processor, which is primarily liable for any losses on covered transactions. However, if the merchant processor fails to meet its obligation to reimburse the cardholder for disputed transactions, then the Corporation, as the sponsor, could be held liable for the disputed amount. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the sponsored entities processed and settled $186.8 billion and $159.4 billion of transactions and recorded losses of $7 million and $6 million. A significant portion of this activity was processed by a joint venture in which the Corporation holds a 49 percent ownership, and is recorded in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and in All Other. At both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the carrying value of the Corporation's investment in the merchant services joint venture was $2.9 billion. At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the sponsored merchant processing servicers held as collateral $210 million and $188 million of merchant escrow deposits which may be used to offset amounts due from the individual merchants.The Corporation believes the maximum potential exposure for chargebacks would not exceed the total amount of merchant transactions processed through Visa and MasterCard for the last six months, which represents the claim period for the cardholder, plus any outstanding delayed-delivery transactions. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the maximum potential exposure for sponsored transactions totaled $322.8 billion and $325.7 billion. However, the Corporation believes that the  maximum potential exposure is not representative of the actual potential loss exposure and does not expect to make material payments in connection with these guarantees.Other GuaranteesThe Corporation has entered into additional guarantee agreements and commitments, including sold risk participation swaps, liquidity facilities, lease-end obligation agreements, partial credit guarantees on certain leases, real estate joint venture guarantees, divested business commitments and sold put options that require gross settlement. The maximum potential future payment under these agreements was approximately $6.4 billion and $6.7 billion at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The estimated maturity dates of these obligations extend up to 2040. The Corporation has made no material payments under these guarantees.In the normal course of business, the Corporation periodically guarantees the obligations of its affiliates in a variety of transactions including ISDA-related transactions and non-ISDA related transactions such as commodities trading, repurchase agreements, prime brokerage agreements and other transactions.Payment Protection Insurance Claims MatterIn the U.K., the Corporation previously sold PPI through its international card services business to credit card customers and consumer loan customers. In response to customer complaints across the industry, media coverage and pressure from consumer advocacy groups, the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) investigated and raised concerns about the way some companies handled complaints related to the sale of these insurance policies. On March 2, 2017, the FCA issued its final rules and guidance on PPI complaints and included an August 29, 2019 deadline for customers to file a complaint.On December 20, 2016, the Corporation entered into an agreement to sell its non-U.S. consumer credit card business to a third party. Subject to regulatory approval, this transaction is expected to close by mid-2017. After closing, the Corporation will retain substantially all PPI exposure above existing reserves. The Corporation has considered this exposure in its estimate of a small after-tax gain on the sale. The reserve for PPI claims was $225 million and $252 million at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The Corporation recorded no expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. Litigation and Regulatory MattersThe following supplements the disclosure in Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K (the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure).In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to many pending and threatened legal, regulatory and governmental actions and proceedings.In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties, the Corporation generally cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be, what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be, or what the eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter may be.107     Bank of AmericaIn accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Corporation establishes an accrued liability when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. As a matter develops, the Corporation, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates on an ongoing basis whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and estimable. Once the loss contingency is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Corporation will establish an accrued liability and record a corresponding amount of litigation-related expense. The Corporation continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established. Excluding expenses of internal and external legal service providers, litigation-related expense of $274 million and $388 million was recognized for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.For a limited number of the matters disclosed in this Note, and in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure, for which a loss, whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, is reasonably possible in future periods, the Corporation is able to estimate a range of possible loss. In determining whether it is possible to estimate a range of possible loss, the Corporation reviews and evaluates its matters on an ongoing basis, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. In cases in which the Corporation possesses sufficient appropriate information to estimate a range of possible loss, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed below. There may be other disclosed matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but such an estimate of the range of possible loss may not be possible. For those matters where an estimate of the range of possible loss is possible, management currently estimates the aggregate range of possible loss is $0 to $1.5 billion in excess of the accrued liability (if any) related to those matters. This estimated range of possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions, and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. Therefore, this estimated range of possible loss represents what the Corporation believes to be an estimate of possible loss only for certain matters meeting these criteria. It does not represent the Corporation’s maximum loss exposure. Information is provided below, or in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure, regarding the nature of all of these contingencies and, where specified, the amount of the claim  associated with these loss contingencies. Based on current knowledge, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters, including the matters described herein and in the prior commitments and contingencies disclosure, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the Corporation. However, in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters, some of which are beyond the Corporation’s control, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to the Corporation’s results of operations or liquidity for any particular reporting period.Deposit Insurance AssessmentOn February 24, 2017, BANA filed an answer to the complaint in which it disputed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's (FDIC) claims and asserted a counterclaim against the FDIC challenging the validity of the 2011 and 2012 FDIC rules on which the FDIC's complaint is based. On March 9, 2017, the FDIC invoiced BANA for additional deposit insurance and interest in the amount of $583 million for the quarters ending March 31, 2012 through March 31, 2013. On April 7, 2017, the FDIC amended its complaint to add a claim for this additional amount. Pending final resolution, BANA has pledged security satisfactory to the FDIC related to the disputed additional assessment amounts reflected in the FDIC's December 15, 2016 and March 9, 2017 invoices. Interchange and Related LitigationOn March 27, 2017, the United States Supreme Court denied the certiorari petition filed by counsel for the class seeking review of the Second Circuit decision. U.S. Bank -- Harborview Mortgage Repurchase LitigationOn March 6, 2017, U.S. Bank, National Association (U.S. Bank), as trustee for the HarborView Mortgage Loan Trust 2005-10, filed a petition in the State of Minnesota, Hennepin County District Court, seeking instructions from that court regarding, among other things, the acceptance or rejection of the proposed settlement and the proposed allocation and distribution of any settlement proceeds received by U.S. Bank as trustee (the "Minnesota Action"). On March 23, 2017, the New York state court in the underlying action entered a stipulated order implementing a stay pending resolution of the Minnesota Action. Certain stakeholders have filed separate actions in New York federal court and Minnesota state court seeking, among other things, to enjoin U.S. Bank's acceptance of the proposed settlement.   Bank of America 108NOTE 11 Shareholders’ EquityCommon Stock       Declared Quarterly Cash Dividends on Common Stock (1)       Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date Dividend Per Share   April 26, 2017 June 2, 2017 June 30, 2017 $0.075January 26, 2017 March 3, 2017 March 31, 2017 0.075(1) In 2017 and through May 2, 2017.The Corporation’s 2016 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) capital plan included requests to repurchase $5.0 billion of common stock over four quarters beginning in the third quarter of 2016, to repurchase common stock to offset the dilution resulting from certain equity-based compensation awards and to increase the quarterly common stock dividend from $0.05 per share to $0.075. On January 13, 2017, the Corporation announced a plan to repurchase $1.8 billion of common stock during the first half of 2017, to which the Federal Reserve did not object, in addition to the previously announced repurchases associated with the 2016 CCAR capital plan. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Corporation repurchased and retired 114 million shares of common stock, which reduced shareholders' equity by $2.7 billion. The Corporation has warrants outstanding and exercisable to purchase 122 million shares of its common stock expiring on October 28, 2018, and warrants outstanding and exercisable to purchase 150 million shares of common stock expiring on January 16, 2019. These warrants were originally issued in connection with preferred stock issuances to the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2009 and 2008, and are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The exercise price of the warrants expiring on January 16, 2019 is subject to continued adjustment each time the quarterly cash dividend is in excess of $0.01 per common share to compensate the holders of the warrants for dilution resulting from an increased dividend. As a result of the Corporation’s first-quarter 2017 dividend of $0.075 per common share, the exercise price of the warrants expiring on January 16, 2019 was adjusted to $12.904 per share. The warrants expiring on October 28, 2018, which have an exercise price of $30.79 per share, also contain this anti-dilution provision except the adjustment is triggered only when the Corporation declares quarterly dividends at a level greater than $0.32 per common share.During the three months ended March 31, 2017, in connection with employee stock plans, the Corporation issued approximately 60 million shares and repurchased approximately 24 million shares of its common stock to satisfy tax withholding obligations. At March 31, 2017, the Corporation had reserved 1.6 billion  unissued shares of common stock for future issuances under employee stock plans, common stock warrants, convertible notes and preferred stock.Preferred StockDuring the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Corporation declared $502 million of cash dividends on preferred stock. There were no issuances of preferred stock during the three months ended March 31, 2017.Restricted Stock UnitsDuring the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Corporation granted 85 million restricted stock unit (RSU) awards to certain employees under the Bank of America Corporation Key Employee Equity Plan. Generally, one-third of the RSUs vest on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date provided that the employee remains continuously employed with the Corporation during that time. The RSUs granted during the three months ended March 31, 2017 were authorized to settle predominantly in shares of common stock of the Corporation, and will be expensed ratably over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures, for non-retirement eligible employees based on the grant-date fair value of the shares. Certain RSUs will be settled in cash or contain settlement provisions that subject these awards to variable accounting whereby compensation expense is adjusted to fair value based on changes in the share price of the Corporation's common stock up to the settlement date. For RSUs granted to employees who are retirement eligible or will become retirement eligible during the vesting period, the RSUs are expensed as of the grant date or ratably over the period from the grant date to the date the employee becomes retirement eligible, net of estimated forfeitures. For additional information, see Note 18 – Stock-based Compensation Plans to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Accounting for Share-based CompensationThe FASB issued new accounting guidance, which was effective on January 1, 2017, that simplifies certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. Under this new accounting guidance, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies on the delivery of share-based awards are recognized as discrete items in income tax expense or benefit in the statement of income. Previously such amounts were recorded in shareholders' equity. The adoption of this new accounting guidance resulted in a $222 million tax benefit upon the delivery of share-settled awards in the three months ended March 31, 2017. 109     Bank of AmericaNOTE 12 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)The table below presents the changes in accumulated OCI after-tax for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.

Three Months Ended March 31(Dollars in millions, except per share information; shares in thousands)2017 2016Earnings per common share   Net income$4,856 $3,472Preferred stock dividends(502) (457)Net income applicable to common shareholders$4,354 $3,015Average common shares issued and outstanding10,099,557 10,370,094Earnings per common share$0.43 $0.29    Diluted earnings per common share   Net income applicable to common shareholders$4,354 $3,015Add preferred stock dividends due to assumed conversions75 75Net income allocated to common shareholders$4,429 $3,090Average common shares issued and outstanding10,099,557 10,370,094Dilutive potential common shares (1)815,258 729,973Total diluted average common shares issued and outstanding10,914,815 11,100,067Diluted earnings per common share$0.41 $0.28(1) Includes incremental dilutive shares from RSUs, restricted stock and warrants.The Corporation previously issued a warrant to purchase 700 million shares of the Corporation’s common stock to the holder of the Series T Preferred Stock. The warrant may be exercised, at the option of the holder, through tendering the Series T Preferred Stock or paying cash. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, the 700 million average dilutive potential common shares were included in the diluted share count under the “if-converted” method. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, 62 million average dilutive potential common shares associated with the Series L Preferred Stock were not included in the diluted share count because the result would have been antidilutive under the “if-converted” method. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, average options to purchase 30 million and 53 million shares of common stock were outstanding but not included in the computation of EPS because the result would have been antidilutive under the treasury stock method. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, average warrants to purchase 122 million shares of common stock were outstanding but not included in the computation of EPS because the result would have been antidilutive under the treasury stock method, and average warrants to purchase 150 million shares of common stock were included in the diluted EPS calculation under the treasury stock method.NOTE 14 Fair Value MeasurementsUnder applicable accounting guidance, fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Corporation determines the fair values of its financial instruments under applicable accounting guidance which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Corporation categorizes its financial instruments into three levels based on the established fair value hierarchy. The Corporation conducts a review of its fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of fair value hierarchy classifications are made if the  significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable in the current marketplace. These transfers are considered to be effective as of the beginning of the quarter in which they occur. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy and how the Corporation measures fair value, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 20 – Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Corporation accounts for certain financial instruments under the fair value option. For additional information, see Note 15 – Fair Value Option.Valuation Processes and TechniquesThe Corporation has various processes and controls in place so that fair value is reasonably estimated. A model validation policy governs the use and control of valuation models used to estimate fair value. This policy requires review and approval of models by personnel who are independent of the front office and periodic reassessments of models so that they are continuing to perform as designed. In addition, detailed reviews of trading gains and losses are conducted on a daily basis by personnel who are independent of the front office. A price verification group, which is also independent of the front office, utilizes available market information including executed trades, market prices and market-observable valuation model inputs so that fair values are reasonably estimated. The Corporation performs due diligence procedures over third-party pricing service providers in order to support their use in the valuation process. Where market information is not available to support internal valuations, independent reviews of the valuations are performed and any material exposures are escalated through a management review process. While the Corporation believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, there were no changes to valuation approaches or techniques that had, or are expected to have, a 111     Bank of Americamaterial impact on the Corporation’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.For information regarding Level 1, 2 and 3 valuation techniques, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Commercial loans, debt securities and other include corporate CLOs and CDOs, commercial loans and bonds, and securities backed by non-real estate assets. Structured liabilities primarily include equity-linked notes that are accounted for under the fair value option.The Corporation uses multiple market approaches in valuing certain of its Level 3 financial instruments. For example, market comparables and discounted cash flows are used together. For a given product, such as corporate debt securities, market comparables may be used to estimate some of the unobservable inputs and then these inputs are incorporated into a discounted cash flow model. Therefore, the balances disclosed encompass both of these techniques.The level of aggregation and diversity within the products disclosed in the tables result in certain ranges of inputs being wide and unevenly distributed across asset and liability categories. Sensitivity of Fair Value Measurements to Changes in Unobservable InputsLoans and SecuritiesA significant increase in market yields, default rates, loss severities or duration would result in a significantly lower fair value for long positions. Short positions would be impacted in a directionally opposite way. The impact of changes in prepayment speeds would have differing impacts depending on the seniority of the instrument and, in the case of CLOs, whether prepayments can be reinvested. A significant increase in price would result in a significantly higher fair value for long positions and short positions would be impacted in a directionally opposite way. Mortgage Servicing RightsThe weighted-average lives and fair value of MSRs are sensitive to changes in modeled assumptions. The weighted-average life is a product of changes in market rates of interest, prepayment rates and other model and cash flow assumptions. The weighted-average life represents the average period of time that the MSRs' cash flows are expected to be received. Absent other changes, an increase (decrease) to the weighted-average life would generally result in an increase (decrease) in the fair value of the MSRs. For example, a 10 percent or 20 percent decrease in prepayment rates, which impact the weighted-average life, could result in an increase in fair value of $94 million or $196 million, while a 10 percent or 20 percent increase in prepayment rates could result in a decrease in fair value of $88 million or $169 million. A 100 bp or 200 bp decrease in option-adjusted spread (OAS) levels could result in an increase in fair value of $87 million or $180 million, while a 100 bp or 200 bp increase in OAS levels could result in a decrease in  fair value of $81 million or $157 million. These sensitivities are hypothetical and actual amounts may vary materially. As the amounts indicate, changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of MSRs that continue to be held by the Corporation is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities. In addition, these sensitivities do not reflect any hedge strategies that may be undertaken to mitigate such risk. The Corporation manages the risk in MSRs with derivatives such as options and interest rate swaps, which are not designated as accounting hedges, as well as securities including MBS and U.S. Treasury securities. The securities used to manage the risk in the MSRs are classified in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.Structured Liabilities and DerivativesFor credit derivatives, a significant increase in market yield, upfront points (i.e., a single upfront payment made by a protection buyer at inception), credit spreads, default rates or loss severities would result in a significantly lower fair value for protection sellers and higher fair value for protection buyers. The impact of changes in prepayment speeds would have differing impacts depending on the seniority of the instrument.Structured credit derivatives are impacted by credit correlation. Default correlation is a parameter that describes the degree of dependence among credit default rates within a credit portfolio that underlies a credit derivative instrument. The sensitivity of this input on the fair value varies depending on the level of subordination of the tranche. For senior tranches that are net purchases of protection, a significant increase in default correlation would result in a significantly higher fair value. Net short protection positions would be impacted in a directionally opposite way. For equity derivatives, commodity derivatives, interest rate derivatives and structured liabilities, a significant change in long-dated rates and volatilities and correlation inputs (e.g., the degree of correlation between an equity security and an index, between two different commodities, between two different interest rates, or between interest rates and foreign exchange rates) would result in a significant impact to the fair value; however, the magnitude and direction of the impact depend on whether the Corporation is long or short the exposure. For structured liabilities, a significant increase in yield or decrease in price would result in a significantly lower fair value. A significant decrease in duration may result in a significantly higher fair value.

The Corporation accounts for certain loan commitments under the fair value option.The carrying values and fair values of the Corporation’s commercial unfunded lending commitments were $893 million and $4.3 billion at March 31, 2017, and $937 million and $4.9 billion at December 31, 2016. Commercial unfunded lending commitments are primarily classified as Level 3. The carrying value of these commitments is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities.The Corporation does not estimate the fair values of consumer unfunded lending commitments because, in many instances, the Corporation can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing notice to the borrower. For more information on commitments, see Note 10 – Commitments and Contingencies.121     Bank of AmericaNOTE 17 Business Segment InformationThe Corporation reports its results of operations through the following four business segments: Consumer Banking, GWIM, Global Banking and Global Markets, with the remaining operations recorded in All Other.

Bank of America 122GlossaryAlt-A Mortgage – A type of U.S. mortgage that is considered riskier than A-paper, or "prime," and less risky than "subprime," the riskiest category. Alt-A interest rates therefore tend to be between those of prime and subprime consumer real estate loans. Typically, Alt-A mortgages are characterized by borrowers with less than full documentation, lower credit scores and higher LTVs.Assets in Custody – Consist largely of custodial and non-discretionary trust assets excluding brokerage assets administered for clients. Trust assets encompass a broad range of asset types including real estate, private company ownership interest, personal property and investments.Assets Under Management (AUM) – The total market value of assets under the investment advisory and/or discretion of GWIM which generate asset management fees based on a percentage of the assets’ market values. AUM reflects assets that are generally managed for institutional, high net worth and retail clients, and are distributed through various investment products including mutual funds, other commingled vehicles and separate accounts.Banking Book – All on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments of the Corporation except for those positions that are held for trading purposes.Carrying Value (with respect to loans) – The amount at which a loan is recorded on the balance sheet. For loans recorded at amortized cost, carrying value is the unpaid principal balance net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and costs and unamortized purchase premiums or discounts, less net charge-offs and interest payments applied as a reduction of principal under the cost recovery method for loans that have been on nonaccrual status. For PCI loans, the carrying value equals fair value upon acquisition adjusted for subsequent cash collections and yield accreted to date. For credit card loans, the carrying value also includes interest that has been billed to the customer. For loans classified as held-for-sale, carrying value is the lower of carrying value as described in the sentences above, or fair value. For loans where we have elected the fair value option, the carrying value is fair value.Client Brokerage Assets – Client assets which are held in brokerage accounts, including non-discretionary brokerage and fee-based assets that generate brokerage income and asset management fee revenue.Committed Credit Exposure – Includes any funded portion of a facility plus the unfunded portion of a facility on which the lender is legally bound to advance funds during a specified period under prescribed conditions. Credit Derivatives – Contractual agreements that provide protection against a credit event on one or more referenced obligations. The nature of a credit event is established by the protection purchaser and the protection seller at the inception of the transaction, and such events generally include bankruptcy or insolvency of the referenced credit entity, failure to meet payment obligations when due, as well as acceleration of indebtedness and payment repudiation or moratorium. The purchaser of the credit derivative pays a periodic fee in return for a payment by the protection seller upon the occurrence, if any, of such a credit event. A CDS is a type of a credit derivative.Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) – A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the counterparty credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments. Debit Valuation Adjustment (DVA) – A portfolio adjustment required to properly reflect the Corporation’s own credit risk exposure as part of the fair value of derivative instruments and/or structured liabilities.Funding Valuation Adjustment (FVA) – A portfolio adjustment required to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives. Interest Rate Lock Commitment (IRLC) – Commitment with a loan applicant in which the loan terms, including interest rate and price, are guaranteed for a designated period of time subject to credit approval.Letter of Credit – A document issued on behalf of a customer to a third party promising to pay the third party upon presentation of specified documents. A letter of credit effectively substitutes the issuer’s credit for that of the customer. Loan-to-value (LTV) – A commonly used credit quality metric. LTV is calculated as the outstanding carrying value of the loan divided by the estimated value of the property securing the loan. Estimated property values are generally determined through the use of automated valuation models (AVMs) or the CoreLogic Case-Shiller Index. An AVM is a tool that estimates the value of a property by reference to large volumes of market data including sales of comparable properties and price trends specific to the MSA in which the property being valued is located. CoreLogic Case-Shiller is a widely used index based on data from repeat sales of single family homes. CoreLogic Case-Shiller indexed-based values are reported on a three-month or one-quarter lag.123     Bank of AmericaMargin Receivable – An extension of credit secured by eligible securities in certain brokerage accounts.Matched Book – Repurchase and resale agreements or securities borrowed and loaned transactions where the overall asset and liability position is similar in size and/or maturity. Generally, these are entered into to accommodate customers where the Corporation earns the interest rate spread.Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSR) – The right to service a mortgage loan when the underlying loan is sold or securitized. Servicing includes collections for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors.Net Interest Yield – Net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets.Nonperforming Loans and Leases – Includes loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status, including nonaccruing loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Loans accounted for under the fair value option, PCI loans and LHFS are not reported as nonperforming loans and leases. Credit card receivables, residential mortgage loans that are insured by the FHA or through long-term credit protection agreements with FNMA and FHLMC (fully-insured loan portfolio) and certain other consumer loans are not placed on nonaccrual status and are, therefore, not reported as nonperforming loans and leases.Operating Margin – Income before income taxes divided by total revenue, net of interest expense.Pay Option Loans – Pay option adjustable-rate mortgages have interest rates that adjust monthly and minimum required payments that adjust annually. During an initial five- or ten-year period, minimum required payments may increase by no more than 7.5 percent. If payments are insufficient to pay all of the monthly interest charges, unpaid interest is added to the loan balance (i.e., negative amortization) until the loan balance increases to a specified limit, at which time a new monthly payment amount adequate to repay the loan over its remaining contractual life is established. Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) – A framework established by the U.S. banking regulators requiring banks to maintain certain levels of regulatory capital ratios, comprised of five categories of capitalization: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” Insured depository institutions that fail to meet certain of these capital levels are subject to increasingly strict limits on their activities, including their ability to make capital distributions, pay management compensation, grow assets and take other actions. Purchased Credit-impaired (PCI) Loan – A loan purchased as an individual loan, in a portfolio of loans or in a business combination with evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination for which it is probable, upon acquisition, that the investor will be unable to collect all contractually required payments. These loans are recorded at fair value upon acquisition.Subprime Loans – Although a standard industry definition for subprime loans (including subprime mortgage loans) does not exist, the Corporation defines subprime loans as specific product offerings for higher risk borrowers, including individuals with one or a combination of high credit risk factors, such as low FICO scores, high debt to income ratios and inferior payment history. Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) – Loans whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties. Certain consumer loans for which a binding offer to restructure has been extended are also classified as TDRs. Concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate to a rate that is below market on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance, loans discharged in bankruptcy or other actions intended to maximize collection. Secured consumer loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not been reaffirmed by the borrower are classified as TDRs at the time of discharge from bankruptcy. Value-at-Risk (VaR) – VaR is a model that simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of hypothetical scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss the portfolio is expected to experience with a given confidence level based on historical data. A VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of potential gains and losses on our trading portfolios.
