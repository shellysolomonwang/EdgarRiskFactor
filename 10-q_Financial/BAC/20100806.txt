Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on recent or proposed legislative and regulatory initiatives as well as other risks the Corporation is exposed to, including among others enhanced regulatory scrutiny or potential legal liability as a result of the recent financial crisis.   On July 21, 2010, the Financial Reform Act was signed into law. The Financial Reform Act provides for sweeping financial regulatory reform and will alter the way in which the Corporation conducts certain businesses, restrict its ability to compete, increase costs and reduce revenues.   The Financial Reform Act mandates that the Federal Reserve Board (Federal Reserve) limit debit card interchange fees. Provisions in the legislation also ban banking organizations from engaging in proprietary trading and restrict their sponsorship of, or investing in, hedge funds and private equity funds, subject to limited exceptions. The Financial Reform Act increases regulation of the derivative markets through measures that broaden the derivative instruments subject to regulation and will require clearing and exchange trading as well as imposing additional capital and margin requirements for derivative market participants. The Financial Reform Act changes the assessment base used in calculating Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) deposit insurance fees from assessable deposits to total assets less tangible capital; provides for resolution authority to establish a process to unwind large systemically important financial companies; establishes a consumer financial protection bureau; includes new minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements for large financial institutions; and proposes disqualification of trust preferred securities and other hybrid capital securities from Tier 1 capital. Many of these provisions will be phased-in over the next several months or years and will be subject both to further rulemaking and the discretion of applicable regulatory bodies.   The Financial Reform Act may have a significant and negative impact on the Corporation’s earnings through fee reductions, higher costs (both regulatory and implementation) and new restrictions, as well as reduce available capital and have a material adverse impact on certain assets and liabilities held by the Corporation. The final rules adopted and ultimate impact on the Corporation’s businesses and results of operations will depend on regulatory interpretation and rulemaking, as well as the success of any actions by the Corporation to mitigate the negative earnings impact of the provisions. Two of the major credit ratings agencies have indicated that enactment of the Financial Reform Act, including regulators’ interpretation or rulemaking thereunder, may at some point result in a downgrade to the Corporation’s credit ratings. One of these ratings agencies placed the Corporation’s and certain other banks’ credit ratings on negative outlook based on an earlier version of financial reform legislation, and the other ratings agency placed the Corporation’s and other banks’ credit ratings on negative outlook shortly after the Financial Reform Act was signed into law. It remains unclear what other actions the ratings agencies may take as a result of enactment of the Financial Reform Act. However, in the event of certain credit ratings downgrades, the  92    Table of Contents  Corporation’s access to credit markets, liquidity and its related funding costs would be materially adversely affected. For additional information about the Corporation’s credit ratings, see Liquidity Risk and Capital Management on page 139.   The limits to be placed on debit interchange fees will significantly reduce the Corporation’s debit card interchange revenues. Interchange fees, or “swipe” fees, are charges that merchants pay to the Corporation and other credit card companies and card-issuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions. The legislation, which provides the Federal Reserve with authority over interchange fees received or charged by a card issuer, requires that fees must be “reasonable and proportional” to the costs of processing such transactions. The Federal Reserve has nine months to provide clarification on the rules, which are to become effective one year from the passage of the Financial Reform Act. In issuing regulations, the Federal Reserve must consider the functional similarity between debit card transactions and traditional checking transactions and the incremental costs incurred by a card issuer in processing a particular debit card transaction. In addition, the legislation prohibits card issuers and networks from entering into exclusive arrangements requiring that debit card transactions be processed on a single network or only two affiliated networks, and allows merchants to determine transaction routing.   As previously announced by the Corporation on July 16, 2010, we currently estimate that 2010 debit card revenue for Global Card Services will be approximately $2.9 billion. Subject to final rulemaking over the next year, the Corporation’s annualized revenue loss, before any mitigation, could be as much as $1.8 billion to $2.3 billion beginning in the third quarter of 2011. Our consumer and small business card products, including the debit card business, are part of an integrated platform within the Global Card Services business segment. We currently estimate that the revenue loss due to the Financial Reform Act and its related rules will materially reduce the carrying value of the $22.3 billion of goodwill applicable to Global Card Services. Based on the Corporation’s current estimates of the revenue impact to this business segment, the Corporation expects to record a non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge for Global Card Services in the three months ended September 30, 2010 that is estimated to be in the range of $7 billion to $10 billion. This estimate does not include potential mitigation actions to recapture lost revenue. A number of these actions may not reduce the goodwill impairment because they will generate revenue for business segments other than Global Card Services  (e.g., Deposits) or because the actions may be identified and implemented after the impairment charge has been recorded. The impairment charge, which is a non-cash item, will have no impact on the Corporation’s reported Tier 1 and tangible equity ratios. For more information on goodwill, refer to Note 9 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Complex Accounting Estimates on page 192.   On July 27, 2010, the U.K. government enacted a law change reducing the corporate income tax rate by one percent effective for the 2011 U.K. tax financial year beginning on April 1, 2011. Such reduction favorably affects income tax expense on future U.K. earnings, but it also requires the Corporation to revalue its U.K. net deferred tax assets using the lower tax rate. During the third quarter the Corporation will record a charge to income tax expense of nearly $400 million for this revaluation. If future rate reductions were to be enacted as suggested in U.K. Treasury announcements, a similar charge to income tax expense for each one percent reduction in the rate would result in each period of enactment.   On April 8, 2010, the U.K. enacted into law a one-time employer payroll tax of 50 percent on bonuses awarded to employees of applicable banking entities between December 9, 2009 and April 5, 2010. The impact of this tax on our payroll tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2010 was $425 million and is reflected in personnel expense.   On December 17, 2009, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision released consultative documents on both capital and liquidity. For more information, see Basel Regulatory Capital Requirements on page 145.   On November 12, 2009, the Federal Reserve issued amendments to Regulation E which implements the Electronic Fund Transfer Act. The rules became effective on July 1, 2010 for new customers and will be effective for existing customers in mid-August. These amendments limit the way we and other banks charge an overdraft fee for non-recurring debit card transactions that overdraw a consumer’s account unless the consumer affirmatively consents to the bank’s payment of overdrafts for those transactions. We have announced plans to not offer customers the opportunity to opt-in to overdraft services related to non-recurring debit card transactions. However, customers will be able to opt-in on a withdrawal-by-withdrawal basis to access cash through the Bank of America ATM network where the bank is able to alert customers that the transaction may overdraw their account and result in a fee if they choose to proceed. The 2010 earnings impact related to overdraft policy changes and Regulation E, which goes into effect in the third quarter of 2010, is expected to be approximately $1 billion after-tax.   On May 22, 2009, the CARD Act was signed into law. The majority of the CARD Act provisions became effective in February 2010. The CARD Act legislation contains comprehensive credit card reform related to credit card industry practices including significantly restricting banks’ ability to change interest rates and assess fees to reflect individual consumer risk, changing the way payments are applied and requiring changes to consumer credit card disclosures. The provisions of the CARD Act negatively impacted net interest income and card income during the six months ended June 30, 2010 and are expected to negatively impact future net interest income due to the restrictions on our ability to reprice credit  93    Table of Contents  cards based on risk, and card income due to restrictions imposed on certain fees. The 2010 full-year decrease in revenue related to the CARD Act, net of mitigation efforts, is expected to be approximately $1 billion after-tax.   For additional information on current legislative and regulatory initiatives, see Regulatory Initiatives on page 137.  Recent Events  As previously disclosed, in connection with the approval we received to repurchase the TARP preferred stock on December 9, 2009, the Corporation agreed to increase equity by $3.0 billion through net asset sales to be approved by the Federal Reserve and contracted for by June 30, 2010. The Federal Reserve has waived the June 30, 2010 requirement, and the Corporation now has until December 31, 2010 to generate the requisite additional capital. As discussed below, the Corporation has been active in selling assets generating $10 billion in gross proceeds and approximately $1.9 billion in after-tax GAAP accounting gains toward the $3.0 billion target. To the extent the asset sales are not completed by December 31, 2010, the Corporation must raise a commensurate amount of common equity.   During the three months ended June 30, 2010, the Corporation sold or agreed to sell a number of non-core assets as part of a strategy to focus on its core businesses and strengthen capital ratios. The transactions included the sale of our investment in Itaú Unibanco Holding S.A. (Itaú Unibanco) generating a $1.2 billion pre-tax gain, sale of our equity holdings in MasterCard resulting in a pre-tax gain of $440 million, and an agreement to sell our entire stake in Grupo Financiero Santander, S.A.B. de C.V. (Santander) on which we recorded an impairment write-down of $428 million. We also completed the sale of Columbia Management’s long-term asset management business (Columbia) generating a $60 million pre-tax gain and a reduction in goodwill and intangibles of approximately $800 million. In addition, we entered into agreements to sell $2.9 billion of our exposure in certain private equity funds, including $1.5 billion of funded exposure and $1.4 billion of unfunded exposure, resulting in a pre-tax loss of $163 million. For more information on these transactions, refer to Note 5 – Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In July 2010, we announced our intention to sell Balboa Insurance Group (Balboa), a wholly-owned subsidiary that provides primarily lender-placed insurance to financial institutions and their customers, as well as homeowners, renters and life insurance to consumers.  Recent Accounting Developments  In March 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued new accounting guidance on embedded credit derivatives. This new accounting guidance clarifies the scope exception for embedded credit derivatives and defines which embedded credit derivatives are required to be evaluated for bifurcation and separate accounting. This new accounting guidance was effective on July 1, 2010. Upon adoption, companies may elect the fair value option for any beneficial interests, including those that would otherwise require bifurcation under the new guidance. In connection with the adoption on July 1, 2010, the Corporation elected the fair value option for $629 million of debt securities, principally collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), that otherwise may be subject to bifurcation under the new guidance. Accordingly, the Corporation recorded a $232 million charge to retained earnings on July 1, 2010 to reflect the after-tax cumulative effect of the change. The adoption of this new accounting guidance is not material to the Corporation’s financial position or results of operations.   In July 2010, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that requires additional disclosures about a company’s allowance for credit losses and the credit quality of the loan portfolio. The additional disclosures include a rollforward of the allowance for credit loss on a disaggregated basis and more information, by type of receivable, on credit quality indicators including aging and troubled debt restructurings as well as significant purchases and sales. These new disclosures are effective for the 2010 annual report. This new accounting guidance does not change the accounting model, and accordingly, will have no impact on the Corporation’s consolidated results of operations or financial position.  On January 1, 2010, the Corporation adopted new FASB accounting guidance on transfers of financial assets and consolidation of variable interest entities (VIEs). This new accounting guidance revises sale accounting criteria for transfers of financial assets, including elimination of the concept of and accounting for qualifying special purpose entities (QSPEs), and significantly changes the criteria for consolidation of a VIE. As described more fully in Note 8 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Corporation routinely transfers mortgage loans, credit card receivables and other financial instruments to special purpose entities (SPEs) that, prior to January 1, 2010, met the definition of a QSPE, which was not previously subject to consolidation by the transferor. Among other things, the new consolidation guidance eliminated the concept of a QSPE and as a result, former QSPEs are now subject to the consolidation guidance for VIEs. For more information on the new consolidation guidance, see Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  94    Table of Contents  Performance Overview  Net income was $3.1 billion and $6.3 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, compared to $3.2 billion and $7.5 billion for the same periods in 2009. After preferred stock dividends and accretion, net income applicable to common shareholders was $2.8 billion, or $0.27 per diluted common share, and $5.6 billion, or $0.55 per diluted common share, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to $2.4 billion, or $0.33 per diluted common share, and $5.2 billion, or $0.75 per diluted common share, for the same periods in 2009. Revenue, net of interest expense on a FTE basis declined $3.6 billion to $29.5 billion and $7.4 billion to $61.7 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 representing an 11 percent decrease from the same periods in 2009.   Net interest income on a FTE basis increased $1.3 billion to $13.2 billion and $2.5 billion to $27.3 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009. The increases were driven by the impact of adoption of the new consolidation guidance and improved deposit pricing, partially offset by lower commercial and consumer loan levels and lower rates on the core assets and trading book. Net interest yield on a FTE basis increased 13 basis points (bps) to 2.77 percent and 18 bps to 2.85 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009, due to the factors stated above.   Noninterest income decreased $4.9 billion to $16.3 billion and $9.9 billion to $34.5 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009. Lower equity investment income, mortgage banking income and trading account profits drove the decline in the three months ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in the prior year. Equity investment income for the three months ended June 30, 2010 included the sale of our investment in Itaú Unibanco, the China Construction Bank (CCB) dividend and the gain on the sale of our MasterCard equity holdings; however, these items were more than offset by the prior year’s gain related to the sale of portions of our investment in CCB. Other income included a gain during the three months ended June 30, 2010 related to credit valuation adjustments primarily associated with the Merrill Lynch structured notes, compared to a loss on these structured notes in the prior year and the absence of the prior year’s gain related to the contribution of our merchant processing business to a joint venture. Noninterest income for the six months ended June 30, 2010, declined due to those items mentioned above as well as lower gains on sales of debt securities and lower card income.   The provision for credit losses decreased $5.3 billion to $8.1 billion and $8.8 billion to $17.9 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009. The provision for credit losses was $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion lower than net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, resulting in a reduction in the allowance for loan and lease losses. The reserve reductions were primarily due to improved delinquencies and collections, lower bankruptcies in domestic credit card and consumer lending businesses and improved credit profiles in the commercial portfolios. These were partially offset by reserve additions in the consumer real estate portfolios amid continued stress in the housing market, which included reserve additions for purchased credit-impaired consumer portfolios obtained through acquisitions.   Noninterest expense increased $233 million to $17.3 billion and $1.0 billion to $35.0 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009. The increases were driven by higher personnel costs due in part to the U.K. payroll tax on certain year-end incentive payments and higher professional fees in the three months ended June 30, 2010, and the expense associated with retirement eligible stock grants and higher litigation costs recorded in the first quarter of 2010. These increases were partially offset by declines in pre-tax merger and restructuring charges compared to the prior year.  95    Table of Contents  Segment Results  Effective January 1, 2010, management realigned the former Global Banking and Global Markets business segments into Global Commercial Banking and GBAM. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These changes did not have an impact on the previously reported consolidated results of the Corporation. For additional information related to the business segments, see Note 17 – Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

For more information on this measure and a corresponding reconciliation to a GAAP financial measure, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 105.     (2)   For the three and six months ended June 30, 2009, Global Card Services is presented on a managed basis with a corresponding offset recorded in All Other. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, Global Card Services and All Other are presented in accordance with new consolidation guidance. Accordingly, current period Global Card Services results are comparable to prior period results that are presented on a managed basis. For more information on the new consolidation guidance, see Note 8 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For more information on the reconciliation of Global Card Services and All Other, see Note 17 – Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.     Deposits net income rose from the prior year due to increases in revenue and lower noninterest expense. Revenue increased due to disciplined pricing, a customer shift to more liquid products and a higher residual net interest income allocation related to asset and liability management (ALM) activities. This was partially offset by lower service charges driven by overdraft policy changes implemented in 2009. Noninterest expense decreased, reflecting the absence of the special FDIC assessment recorded in the prior year, partially offset by higher distribution costs as a higher proportion of banking center sales and service efforts were aligned to Deposits.   Global Card Services net income increased from the prior year due to declining credit costs reflecting continued improvement in the U.S. economy. Revenue decreased from the prior year, driven by lower average loans and reduced interest and fee income primarily resulting from the implementation of the CARD Act, partially offset by the gain on the sale of our MasterCard equity holdings. Provision for credit losses decreased from the prior year as lower delinquencies, decreasing bankruptcies, and lower expected losses from the improving economic outlook drove lower charge-offs and reserve reductions during the quarter. Noninterest expense declined due to a decrease in distribution costs as a higher proportion of banking center sales and service efforts were aligned to Deposits from Global Card Services.   Home Loans & Insurance net loss widened compared to the prior year as revenue decreased as a result of lower mortgage banking income. The decline in mortgage banking income was driven by higher representations and warranties expense combined with lower production volume and margins resulting from a decrease in refinance activity. Also contributing to the decline was less favorable mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) results, net of hedges, partially offset by increased servicing fees. The provision for credit losses decreased due to lower reserve additions driven by improving portfolio trends. Noninterest expense declined as lower insurance loss provision was offset by increased costs related to default management staff and loss mitigation efforts.   In addition to the drivers discussed above, during the six months ended June 30, 2010, Home Loan & Insurance results, compared to the same period in 2009, were also impacted by increased litigation related costs.   Global Commercial Banking net income increased compared to the prior year due to lower credit costs. Net interest income benefited from improved loan spreads partially offset by loan balance declines. Strong deposit growth also contributed to revenue, as clients remained very liquid. Revenue was negatively impacted by increased costs related to an  96    Table of Contents  agreement to purchase certain loans, partially offset by a higher residual net interest income allocation related to ALM activities. The provision for credit losses decreased driven by reserve reductions and lower net charge-offs in the commercial domestic and retail dealer-related portfolios.   GBAM net income decreased compared to the prior year due to widespread market deterioration in the sales and trading businesses and due to the absence of the prior year gain on the contribution of our merchant processing business to a joint venture. Revenue was negatively impacted by a significant reduction in investor transactional flow caused by the uncertainty stemming from sovereign debt fears and impending regulatory changes. Noninterest expense increased driven by the U.K. payroll tax on certain incentive compensation and higher recognized incentive compensation expense due to the deferral of long-term compensation in the prior year. Provision for credit losses declined primarily driven by reserve reductions and lower charge-offs in the commercial domestic portfolio.   GWIM net income declined from the prior year driven by the after-tax loss on the sale of the former Columbia long-term asset management business, partially offset by higher investment and brokerage activity and lower credit costs. Revenue increased compared to the prior year driven by higher investment and brokerage income, higher net interest income and the pre-tax gain on sale of the Columbia long-term asset management business. The provision for credit losses decreased compared to the prior year due to improvement in the consumer real estate and commercial lending portfolios.   All Other reported an increase in net income for the three months ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in the prior year due to higher revenue, partially offset by increases in provision for credit losses and noninterest expense. Revenue increased driven by the sale of shares of Itaú Unibanco and gains related to credit valuation adjustments on Merrill Lynch structured notes. Provision for credit losses was driven by the impact of new consolidation guidance partially offset by lower reserve additions related to the residential mortgage and the discontinued real estate purchased credit-impaired loan portfolios. Results were also impacted by lower gains on sales of debt securities as a result of net losses on sales of certain non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). Noninterest expense increased due to higher personnel, general operating and other expenses.     Financial Highlights Net Interest Income  Net interest income on a FTE basis increased $1.3 billion to $13.2 billion and $2.5 billion to $27.3 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009. The increase was due to the impact of adoption of new consolidation guidance which contributed approximately $2.7 billion and $5.5 billion to the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 and due to deposit pricing. The increase was partially offset by lower commercial and consumer loan levels and lower rates on the core assets and trading book. The net interest yield on a FTE basis increased 13 bps to 2.77 percent and 18 bps to 2.85 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009 due to the factors stated above.  97    Table of Contents  Noninterest Income                                         Table 3   Noninterest Income       Three Months Ended June 30   Six Months Ended June 30   (Dollars in millions)   2010   2009   2010   2009         Card income   $  2,023     $  2,149     $  3,999     $  5,014     Service charges     2,576       2,729       5,142       5,262     Investment and brokerage services     2,994       2,994       6,019       5,957     Investment banking income     1,319       1,646       2,559       2,701     Equity investment income     2,766       5,943       3,391       7,145     Trading account profits     1,227       2,164       6,463       7,365     Mortgage banking income     898       2,527       2,398       5,841     Insurance income     678       662       1,393       1,350     Gains on sales of debt securities     37       632       771       2,130     Other income     1,861       724       3,065       3,037     Net impairment losses recognized in earnings on available-for-sale debt securities     (126 )     (1,026 )     (727 )     (1,397 )       Total noninterest income   $  16,253     $  21,144     $  34,473     $  44,405            Noninterest income decreased $4.9 billion to $16.3 billion and $9.9 billion to $34.5 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009. The following items highlight the significant changes.       •   Card income decreased $126 million and $1.0 billion due primarily to lower fee income from the implementation of the CARD Act, lower balance transfer fees and the absence of certain fee income due to the contribution of our merchant processing business to a joint venture in the prior year. The decline in fees was partially offset by the impact of adoption of new consolidation guidance and an increase in interchange income resulting from higher retail volume.        •   Investment banking income decreased $327 million for the three months ended June 30, 2010 due to lower equity and debt issuance fees and $142 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010 due to lower advisory fees.        •   Equity investment income decreased $3.2 billion and $3.8 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010. During the three months ended June 30, 2010, the benefits of the $1.2 billion pre-tax gain on the sale of our investment in Itaú Unibanco, $814 million in Global Principal Investments revenue, primarily driven by valuation adjustments, a $535 million CCB dividend and the $440 million pre-tax gain on the sale of our MasterCard equity holdings were more than offset by the impairment of $428 million recorded as a result of our agreement to sell our investment in Santander and the absence of the $5.3 billion pre-tax gain related to the sale of CCB shares recorded during the same period in the prior year. The six months ended June 30, 2010 included a $331 million loss from the sale of our discretionary equity securities portfolio in the first quarter of 2010. The first quarter of 2009 included a $1.9 billion pre-tax gain related to the sale of CCB shares.        •   Trading account profits decreased $937 million and $902 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 due to general market deterioration resulting from concerns around the global economy. In addition, results were driven by a lack of liquidity as sovereign debt fears and regulatory uncertainty fueled investor concerns. These were partially offset by reduced write-downs on legacy assets. Also, we recorded credit valuation adjustments on derivative liabilities of $206 million and $368 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to $(1.6) billion and $85 million for the same periods in the prior year.        •   Mortgage banking income decreased $1.6 billion and $3.4 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 due to decreases in production income of $1.5 billion and $2.4 billion. In addition, servicing income decreased $135 million and $1.0 billion. In both periods, the decrease in production income was driven by an increase in representations and warranties expense and lower volume and margins. The decline in servicing income for the six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in the prior year was also due to less favorable MSR results, net of hedges.        •   Gains on sales of debt securities decreased $595 million and $1.4 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 driven by lower net gains on sales of debt securities as a result of net losses on sales of certain non-agency RMBS. These losses were offset by gains on sales of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS), agency CMOs and     98    Table of Contents          commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS). In addition, the six months ended June 30, 2010 were impacted by lower sales of agency MBS compared to the same period in the prior year.        •   Other income increased by $1.1 billion and $28 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 due to increased credit valuation adjustments recorded on Merrill Lynch structured notes and reduced write-downs on legacy assets compared to the same periods in the prior year. These items were partially offset by the absence of the prior year’s gain recorded on the contribution of our merchant processing business to a joint venture.        •   Net impairment losses recognized in earnings on available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities decreased $900 million and $670 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 as a result of lower impairment write-downs on non-agency RMBS and CDOs.    Provision for Credit Losses  The provision for credit losses decreased $5.3 billion to $8.1 billion and $8.8 billion to $17.9 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009.   The consumer portion of the provision for credit losses decreased $3.2 billion to $7.1 billion and $5.5 billion to $15.4 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009. The decreases for both the three- and six-month periods were due to reserve reductions in 2010 compared to reserve additions in 2009. The commercial portion of the provision for credit losses including the provision for unfunded lending commitments decreased $2.1 billion to $957 million and $3.3 billion to $2.5 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009. In the three-month comparison, the decrease was driven by reserve reductions and lower net charge-offs in the core commercial portfolio driven by improved borrower credit profiles. In the six-month comparison, the decrease was also driven by reserve reductions in the commercial domestic and small business portfolios due to improved borrower credit profiles, combined with smaller reserve increases in the commercial real estate portfolio.   Net charge-offs totaled $9.6 billion, or 3.98 percent and $20.4 billion, or 4.21 percent of average loans and leases for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 compared with $8.7 billion, or 3.64 percent and $15.6 billion, or 3.24 percent for the three and six months ended June 30, 2009. The increase in net charge-offs was due to the impact of adoption of new consolidation guidance resulting in consolidating certain securitized loan balances in our consumer credit card and home equity portfolios and losses on modified consumer real estate loans that were written down to the underlying collateral value. For more information on the provision for credit losses, refer to Provision for Credit Losses on page 179.

The increases were driven by higher personnel costs due in part to the U.K. bonus tax of $425 million recorded in the three months ended June 30, 2010 and an increase in the  99    Table of Contents  expense associated with retirement eligible stock grants of $593 million to $758 million recorded in the six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in the prior year. These increases were partially offset by declines in merger and restructuring charges.  Income Tax Expense  Income tax expense was $672 million for the three months ended June 30, 2010 compared to a benefit of $845 million for the same period in 2009 resulting in an effective tax rate of 17.7 percent as compared to (35.5) percent in the prior year. Income tax expense was $1.9 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2010, compared to $284 million for the same period in 2009 resulting in an effective tax rate of 23.0 percent as compared to 3.7 percent in the prior year. Income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 included benefits of $250 million and $750 million from partial releases of a valuation allowance provided for acquired capital loss carryforward tax benefits in connection with the acquisition of Merrill Lynch. The effective tax rate increases were driven by permanent tax preferences (e.g., tax-exempt income and tax credits) and a smaller valuation allowance release together offsetting lower percentages of pre-tax income than similar items offset in the comparative 2009 periods.   Long-standing deferral provisions applicable to active finance income earned by certain foreign subsidiaries expired for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2010. The impact of the expiration of these provisions, which is dependent upon the amount, composition and geographic mix of our 2010 earnings, increased tax expense by $100 million during the six months ended June 30, 2010. If these deferral provisions were to be extended retroactive to January 1, 2010, this tax and any additional amounts recorded to date would be reversed.   On July 27, 2010, the U.K. enacted a law change reducing the corporate income tax rate.

Impact of Adopting New Consolidation Guidance  On January 1, 2010, the Corporation adopted new consolidation guidance resulting in the consolidation of certain former QSPEs and VIEs that were not recorded on the Corporation’s Consolidated Balance Sheet prior to that date. The adoption of this new consolidation guidance resulted in a net incremental increase in assets of $100.4 billion, including $69.7 billion resulting from consolidation of credit card trusts and $30.7 billion from consolidation of other SPEs including multi-seller conduits, and a net increase of $106.7 billion in total liabilities, including $84.4 billion of long-term debt. These amounts are net of retained interests in securitizations held on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2009 and a $10.8 billion increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses, the majority of which relates to credit card receivables. The Corporation recorded a $6.2 billion charge, net of tax, to retained earnings on January 1, 2010 for the cumulative effect of the adoption of this new consolidation guidance due primarily to the increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses, and a $116 million charge to accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI). The initial recording of these assets, related allowance for loan and lease losses and liabilities on the Corporation’s Consolidated Balance Sheet had no impact at the date of adoption on consolidated results of operations. For additional detail on the impact of adopting this new consolidation guidance, refer to Note 8 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Assets  At June 30, 2010, total assets were $2.4 trillion, an increase of $140.6 billion from December 31, 2009. Changes from year end were attributable to an increase in federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell driven by a favorable rate environment. In addition, changes were driven by the impact of adopting new consolidation guidance which increased loan balances, primarily in the credit card, commercial – domestic and home equity portfolios, partially offset by an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses. The impact of this new consolidation guidance was offset by lower consumer and commercial loan balances and loans held-for-sale (LHFS). Trading account assets increased as a result of the new consolidation guidance and higher levels of fixed-income securities. In addition, all other assets grew driven by an increase in cash and cash equivalents due to increased liquidity as a result of reduced loan demand.  101    Table of Contents   Average total assets increased $69.4 billion and $30.2 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009. The increases were due in part to adopting new consolidation guidance. Increases in debt securities were driven by prior year reductions in the ALM portfolio, and increases in federal funds sold, securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, and trading account assets were attributable to activity in GBAM.  Liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity  Total liabilities increased $138.8 billion to $2.1 trillion at June 30, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009. The increase in total liabilities was attributable to an increase in federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase due to a favorable rate environment. In addition, liabilities increased due to the impact of adopting new consolidation guidance which increased long-term debt and short-term borrowings. Also, changes in trading account liabilities reflected trading activity in fixed-income securities, including derivative portfolio hedges. All other liabilities increased due to foreign currency exchange rates. These increases were partially offset by decreases in deposits due to lower escrow balances.   Average total liabilities increased $78.8 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. The increase was due to adopting new consolidation guidance, which impacted long-term debt, and due to an increase in trading account liabilities and all other liabilities. These increases were partially offset by decreases in short-term borrowings due to the rate environment.   Average total liabilities increased $34.4 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009. The increases were driven by the adoption of new consolidation guidance, which impacted long-term debt, and due to an increase in trading account liabilities and federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase partially offset by a decrease in commercial paper and short-term liabilities.   Shareholders’ equity increased $1.7 billion to $233.2 billion at June 30, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009. The increase was driven by net income and improved accumulated OCI related to AFS debt securities recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2010 partially offset by the impact of adopting new consolidation guidance as we recorded a $6.2 billion charge to retained earnings due primarily to the increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses.   Average shareholders’ equity decreased $9.4 billion and $4.2 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, compared to the same periods in 2009 driven by the TARP repayment and impact of adopting new consolidation guidance.   Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management functions, primarily involving our portfolios of highly liquid assets, that are designed to ensure the adequacy of capital while enhancing our ability to manage liquidity requirements for the Corporation and for our customers, and to position the balance sheet in accordance with the Corporation’s risk appetite. The execution of these functions requires the use of balance sheet and capital related limits including spot, average and risk-weighted asset limits, particularly in our trading businesses. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated on an average basis.  102    Table of Contents                                                   Table 6    Selected Quarterly Financial Data       2010

Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data differently.   We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses (i.e., efficiency ratio and net interest yield) on a FTE basis. Although this is a non-GAAP measure, we believe managing the business with net interest income on a FTE basis provides a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent. This measure ensures comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources.   As mentioned above, certain performance measures including the efficiency ratio and net interest yield utilize net interest income (and thus total revenue) on a FTE basis. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield evaluates how many bps we are earning over the cost of funds. During our annual planning process, we set efficiency targets for the Corporation and each line of business. We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures provide additional clarity in assessing our results. Targets vary by year and by business and are based on a variety of factors including maturity of the business, competitive environment, market factors, and other items including our risk appetite.   We evaluate our business based on the following ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP measure. Return on average tangible common shareholders’ equity measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of common shareholders’ equity plus any Common Equivalent Securities (CES) less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTE measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of average shareholders’ equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible common equity ratio represents common shareholders’ equity plus CES less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. The tangible equity ratio represents total shareholders’ equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by total assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents ending common shareholders’ equity less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity (i.e., capital). In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use ROTE as key measures to support our overall growth goals. We believe the use of these non-GAAP measures provides additional clarity in assessing the results of the Corporation.

As discussed in the GBAM business segment section beginning on page 123, we evaluate our market-based results and strategies on a total market-based revenue approach by combining net interest income and noninterest income for GBAM. In addition, the 2009 periods are presented on a managed basis which adjusted for loans that we originated and subsequently sold into credit card securitizations. Noninterest income, rather than net interest income and provision for credit losses, was recorded for securitized assets as we are compensated for servicing the securitized assets and recorded servicing income and gains or losses on securitizations, where appropriate. The 2010 periods are presented in accordance with new consolidation guidance. An analysis of core net interest income, core average earning assets and core net interest yield on earning assets, which adjusts for the impact of these two non-core items from reported net interest income on a FTE basis, is shown below. We believe the use of this non-GAAP presentation provides additional clarity in assessing our results.

(6)   Calculated on an annualized basis.     n/a = not applicable     For the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, core net interest income decreased $1.0 billion to $12.1 billion and $1.8 billion to $25.0 billion compared to core net interest income on a managed basis of $13.2 billion and $26.8 billion for the same periods in 2009. The decrease was driven by lower loan levels compared to managed loan levels for the same periods in 2009, and lower yields for the discretionary and credit card portfolios. These impacts were partially offset by lower rates on deposits.   For the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, core average earning assets decreased $31.7 billion to $1.4 trillion and $69.9 billion to $1.4 trillion compared to core average earning assets on a managed basis of $1.4 trillion and $1.5 trillion for the same periods in 2009 primarily due to lower commercial loan levels and lower consumer loan levels compared to managed consumer loan levels for the same periods in 2009.   For the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, core net interest yield decreased 21 bps to 3.50 percent and seven bps to 3.60 percent compared to core net interest yield on a managed basis of 3.71 and 3.67 percent for the same periods in 2009 due to the factors noted above.  108    Table of Contents                                                          Table 11   Quarterly Average Balances

Income on these nonperforming loans is recognized on a cash basis. Purchased credit-impaired loans were written down to fair value upon acquisition and accrete interest income over the remaining life of the loan.

(7)   Interest income includes the impact of interest rate risk management contracts, which decreased interest income on assets by $751 million and $72 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009. Interest expense includes the impact of interest rate risk management contracts, which decreased interest expense on liabilities by $1.8 billion and $1.1 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009. For further information on interest rate contracts, see Interest Rate Risk Management for Nontrading Activities beginning on page 187.    111    Table of Contents     Business Segment Operations Segment Description and Basis of Presentation  We report the results of our operations through six business segments: Deposits, Global Card Services, Home Loans & Insurance, Global Commercial Banking, GBAM and GWIM, with the remaining operations recorded in All Other. Effective January 1, 2010, we realigned the Global Corporate and Investment Banking portion of the former Global Banking segment with the former Global Markets business segment to form GBAM and to reflect Global Commercial Banking as a standalone segment. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.   We prepare and evaluate segment results using certain non-GAAP methodologies and performance measures, many of which are discussed in Supplemental Financial Data beginning on page 105. We begin by evaluating the operating results of the segments which by definition exclude merger and restructuring charges. The segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies which are utilized to determine net income. The net interest income of the business segments includes the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics.   Equity is allocated to business segments and related businesses using a risk-adjusted methodology incorporating each segment’s credit, market, interest rate, strategic and operational risk components. The nature of these risks is discussed further beginning on page 138. The Corporation benefits from the diversification of risk across these components which is reflected as a reduction to allocated equity for each segment. The total amount of average equity reflects both risk-based capital and the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the business segments.

Deposits includes the results of consumer deposit activities which consist of a comprehensive range of products provided to consumers and small businesses. In addition, Deposits includes an allocation of ALM activities. In the U.S., we serve approximately 57 million consumer and small business relationships through a franchise that stretches coast to coast through 32 states and the District of Columbia utilizing our network of approximately 5,900 banking centers, more than 18,000 domestic-branded ATMs, nationwide call centers and leading online and mobile banking platforms.   Our deposit products include traditional savings accounts, money market savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, and noninterest- and interest-bearing checking accounts. Deposit products provide a relatively stable source of funding and liquidity. We earn net interest spread revenue from investing this liquidity in earning assets through client-facing lending and ALM activities. The revenue is allocated to the deposit products using our funds transfer pricing process which takes into account the interest rates and maturity characteristics of the deposits. Deposits also generate fees such as account service fees, non-sufficient funds fees, overdraft charges and ATM fees.   In the fourth quarter of 2009, we implemented changes in our overdraft fee policies which have negatively impacted revenue. These changes were intended to help customers limit overdraft fees. In addition, in November 2009, the Federal Reserve issued amendments to Regulation E, which will negatively impact future service charge revenue in Deposits. Regulation E was effective for new customers on July 1, 2010 and will go into effect for existing customers in mid-August 2010. For more information on Regulation E, see Regulatory Overview beginning on page 92.   At June 30, 2010, our active online banking customer base was 29.2 million subscribers, an increase of approximately 550 thousand from the same period in 2009 and our active bill pay users paid $151.4 billion of bills online during the first half of 2010, which is in line with the year-ago period.   Deposits includes the net impact of migrating customers and their related deposit balances between the Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management (MLGWM) business within GWIM and Deposits. For more information on the migration of customer balances, see the GWIM discussion beginning on page 128.  113    Table of Contents  Three Months Ended June 30, 2010 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2009   Net income rose $131 million, or 25 percent, to $665 million from higher revenue and lower noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $386 million, or 22 percent, to $2.1 billion as a result of disciplined pricing, a customer shift to more liquid products and a higher residual net interest income allocation related to ALM activities. Average deposits remained relatively flat from a year ago as organic growth and the transfer of certain deposits from other client-managed businesses were offset by the expected decline in higher-yielding Countrywide deposits.   Noninterest income fell $259 million, or 15 percent, to $1.5 billion. The positive impacts of revenue initiatives were offset by the negative impact of the overdraft fee policy changes, which have had an average negative revenue impact of approximately $160 million each quarter since being implemented in the fourth quarter of 2009 for the purpose of helping customers limit overdraft fees.   Noninterest expense decreased $97 million, or four percent, due to the special FDIC assessment during the second quarter of 2009, partially offset by an increase in distribution costs as a higher proportion of banking center sales and service efforts were aligned to Deposits from the other consumer businesses. FDIC charges were $227 million compared to $594 million during the same period in 2009 which included the special FDIC assessment.  Six Months Ended June 30, 2010 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2009   Net income rose $205 million, or 18 percent, to $1.4 billion as revenue rose, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $663 million, or 18 percent, to $4.3 billion, while noninterest income decreased $275 million, or eight percent, to $3.0 billion. Also, average deposits grew $18.9 billion, or five percent. These period-over-period changes were driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. In addition, noninterest expense increased $99 million, or two percent, as a higher proportion of banking center sales and service efforts were aligned to Deposits from the other consumer businesses. Also included are FDIC charges of $453 million as compared to $765 million during the same period in 2009 which included the special FDIC assessment.  114    Table of Contents     Global Card Services                                             Three Months Ended June 30   Six Months Ended June 30    (Dollars in millions)   2010   2009 (1)   2010   2009 (1)         Net interest income (2)   $  4,439     $  4,976     $  9,257     $  10,174     Noninterest income:                                   Card income     1,900       2,163       3,781       4,277     All other income     522       123       626       258         Total noninterest income     2,422       2,286       4,407       4,535         Total revenue, net of interest expense     6,861       7,262       13,664       14,709                                         Provision for credit losses     3,795       7,655       7,330       15,876     Noninterest expense     1,799       1,936       3,556       3,982         Income (loss) before income taxes     1,267       (2,329 )     2,778       (5,149 )   Income tax expense (benefit) (2)     461       (743 )     1,025       (1,806 )       Net income (loss)   $  806     $  (1,586 )   $  1,753     $  (3,343 )                                           Net interest yield (2)     10.01 %     9.26 %     10.17 %     9.34 %   Return on average equity     7.98       n/m       8.45       n/m     Efficiency ratio (2)     26.20       26.66       26.02       27.07                                         Balance Sheet                                                                       Average                                   Total loans and leases   $  177,571     $  215,808     $  183,407     $  219,888     Total earning assets     177,868       215,575       183,579       219,771     Total assets     186,195       231,927       190,993       237,214     Allocated equity     40,517       41,775       41,836       40,885                                                                                     June 30   December 31    Period end                   2010   2009                             Total loans and leases                   $  173,021     $  196,289     Total earning assets                     173,497       196,046     Total assets                     183,334       212,668                   (1)   Prior year amounts are presented on a managed basis.

(2)   FTE basis     n/m = not meaningful     Global Card Services provides a broad offering of products including U.S. consumer and business card, consumer lending, international card and debit card to consumers and small businesses. We provide credit card products to customers in the U.S., Canada, Ireland, Spain and the U.K. We offer a variety of co-branded and affinity credit and debit card products and are one of the leading issuers of credit cards through endorsed marketing in the U.S. and Europe. On February 22, 2010, the majority of the provisions in the CARD Act went into effect and negatively affected net interest income during the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 due to the restrictions on our ability to reprice credit cards based on risk and on card income due to restrictions imposed on certain fees. For more information on the CARD Act, see Regulatory Overview beginning on page 92.   As previously announced by the Corporation on July 16, 2010, we currently estimate that 2010 debit card revenue for Global Card Services will be approximately $2.9 billion. As a result of the Financial Reform Act and its related rules and subject to final rulemaking over the next year, the Corporation’s annualized revenue loss, before any mitigation, could be as much as $1.8 billion to $2.3 billion beginning in the third quarter of 2011. Our consumer and small business card products, including the debit card business, are part of an integrated platform within Global Card Services. Our current estimate of revenue loss due to the Financial Reform Act will materially reduce the carrying value of the $22.3 billion of goodwill applicable to Global Card Services. Based on our current estimates of the revenue impact to this business segment, we expect to record a non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge for Global Card Services in the three months ended September 30, 2010 that is estimated to be in the range of $7 billion to $10 billion. This estimate does not include potential mitigation actions to recapture lost revenue. A number of these actions may not reduce the goodwill impairment because they will generate revenue for business segments other than Global Card Services  (e.g., Deposits) or because the actions may be identified and implemented after the impairment charge has been recorded. The  115    Table of Contents  impairment charge, which is a non-cash item, will have no impact on the Corporation’s reported Tier 1 and tangible equity ratios. For more information on goodwill, refer to Note 9 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Complex Accounting Estimates on page 192.   The Corporation reports its Global Card Services 2010 results in accordance with new consolidation guidance. Under this new consolidation guidance, we consolidated all credit card trusts. Accordingly, current year results are comparable to prior year results that were presented on a managed basis. For more information on managed basis, refer to Note 23 – Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K and for more information on new consolidation guidance, refer to Impact of Adopting New Consolidation Guidance on page 101 and Note 8 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Three Months Ended June 30, 2010 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2009   Global Card Services recorded net income of $806 million compared to a net loss of $1.6 billion as credit costs declined, reflecting continued improvement in the U.S. economy. Revenue decreased from lower average loans and reduced interest and fee income resulting from the implementation of the CARD Act, partially offset by the pre-tax gain of $440 million on the sale of our MasterCard equity holdings. Provision for credit losses decreased $3.9 billion as lower delinquencies, decreasing bankruptcies and lower expected losses from the improving economic outlook drove charge-off and reserve reductions.   Net interest income decreased to $4.4 billion, or 10 percent, from $5.0 billion due to a decrease in average loans of $38.2 billion, or 18 percent, partially offset by lower funding costs.   Noninterest income increased $136 million, or six percent, to $2.4 billion driven by an increase in all other income of $399 million to $522 million primarily driven by the pre-tax gain of $440 million on the sale of our MasterCard equity holdings, partially offset by lower insurance income. In addition, higher interchange income largely due to increased consumer spending was more than offset by the implementation of the CARD Act resulting in lower card income of $263 million.   Provision for credit losses decreased $3.9 billion to $3.8 billion primarily due to an improved economic outlook which led to reserve reductions in the consumer card, consumer lending and small business card portfolios in 2010. Reserves were increased for these portfolios during the three months ended June 30, 2009. Also contributing to reduced provision expense were lower domestic net charge-offs partially offset by the acceleration of $378 million in foreign charge-offs on certain renegotiated loans to conform charge-off policies to our domestic portfolio. The same period in the prior year included reserve additions related to maturing securitizations which increased the provision expense.   Noninterest expense decreased $137 million, or seven percent, to $1.8 billion from a decrease in the distribution costs as a higher proportion of banking center sales and service efforts were aligned to Deposits from Global Card Services.  Six Months Ended June 30, 2010 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2009   Global Card Services recorded net income of $1.8 billion compared to a net loss of $3.3 billion as the provision for credit losses declined $8.5 billion to $7.3 billion and net interest income declined $917 million to $9.3 billion. Noninterest expense decreased $426 million to $3.6 billion and noninterest income declined $128 million to $4.4 billion. These period-over-period changes were driven by the same factors as described in the three month discussion above; however, noninterest income declined due to the implementation of the CARD Act.  116    Table of Contents     Home Loans & Insurance                                             Three Months Ended June 30   Six Months Ended June 30    (Dollars in millions)   2010   2009   2010   2009         Net interest income (1)   $  1,000     $  1,199     $  2,213     $  2,391     Noninterest income:                                   Mortgage banking income     1,020       2,661       2,661       6,081     Insurance income     561       553       1,151       1,134     All other income     214       50       394       93         Total noninterest income     1,795       3,264       4,206       7,308         Total revenue, net of interest expense     2,795       4,463       6,419       9,699                                         Provision for credit losses     2,390       2,726       5,990       6,098     Noninterest expense     2,817       2,834       6,146       5,491         Loss before income taxes     (2,412 )     (1,097 )     (5,717 )     (1,890 )   Income tax benefit (1)     (878 )     (371 )     (2,111 )     (669 )       Net loss   $  (1,534 )   $  (726 )   $  (3,606 )   $  (1,221 )                                           Net interest yield (1)     2.13 %     2.43 %     2.36 %     2.53 %   Efficiency ratio (1)     100.78       63.50       95.73       56.62                                         Balance Sheet                                                                       Average                                   Total loans and leases   $  130,664     $  131,509     $  132,196     $  128,543     Total earning assets     188,146       197,651       189,468       190,272     Total assets     229,168       232,253       231,628       225,718     Allocated equity     26,346       16,128       26,811       15,503                                                 June 30   December 31    Period end                   2010   2009                             Total loans and leases                   $  129,798     $  131,302     Total earning assets                     188,091       188,349     Total assets                     225,492       232,588                   (1)   FTE basis     Home Loans & Insurance generates revenue by providing an extensive line of consumer real estate products and services to customers nationwide. Home Loans & Insurance products are available to our customers through a retail network of approximately 5,900 banking centers, mortgage loan officers in nearly 800 locations and a sales force offering our customers direct telephone and online access to our products. These products are also offered through our correspondent and wholesale loan acquisition channels. Home Loans & Insurance products include fixed and adjustable rate first-lien mortgage loans for home purchase and refinancing needs, reverse mortgages, home equity lines of credit and home equity loans. First mortgage products are either sold into the secondary mortgage market to investors, while retaining MSRs and the Bank of America customer relationships, or are held on our balance sheet in All Other for ALM purposes. Home Loans & Insurance is not impacted by the Corporation’s first mortgage production retention decisions as Home Loans & Insurance is compensated for the decision on a management accounting basis with a corresponding offset recorded in All Other. Home equity lines of credit and home equity loans are held on our balance sheet. In addition, Home Loans & Insurance offers property, casualty, life, disability and credit insurance. In July 2010, we announced our intention to sell Balboa, a wholly-owned subsidiary, and part of Home Loans & Insurance, that provides primarily lender-placed insurance to financial institutions and their customers, as well as homeowners, renters and life insurance to consumers.   Home Loans & Insurance includes the impact of transferring customers and their related loan balances between GWIM and Home Loans & Insurance based on client segmentation thresholds. Subsequent to the date of migration, the associated net interest income and noninterest expense are recorded in the business to which the customers were transferred. For more information on the migration of customers, see the GWIM discussion beginning on page 128.  117    Table of Contents  Three Months Ended June 30, 2010 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2009   Home Loans & Insurance recorded a net loss of $1.5 billion compared to a net loss of $726 million as a result of lower mortgage banking income and lower net interest income partially offset by a decrease in provision for credit losses.   Net interest income decreased $199 million, or 17 percent, to $1.0 billion driven primarily by lower levels of earning assets and increased cost to carry advances on delinquent loans serviced for others.   Noninterest income decreased $1.5 billion, or 45 percent, to $1.8 billion due to a decline in mortgage banking income of $1.6 billion as a result of lower production income driven by increases in representations and warranties expense, and lower volume and margins resulting from declines in the market demand for refinances. The volume impact of the smaller mortgage market was partially offset by an increase in market share. In addition, the decline in mortgage banking income was driven by lower servicing income due to less favorable MSR results, net of hedges, partially offset by an increase in servicing fees driven by improved delinquent account performance. Other income increased as a result of an increase in home equity revenue due to the impact of new consolidation guidance in 2010.   Provision for credit losses decreased $336 million to $2.4 billion driven primarily by lower reserve additions due to improving portfolio trends. This was partially offset by additional provision expense associated with home equity VIEs that were consolidated on January 1, 2010 under new consolidation guidance and the impact related to certain modified loans that were written-down to the underlying collateral value. Provision expense remained elevated amid continued stress in the housing market.   Noninterest expense was essentially flat as lower production expenses and lower insurance loss provision were offset by increased costs related to default management staff, loss mitigation efforts and higher provision for nonreimbursable servicing advances.  Six Months Ended June 30, 2010 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2009   Home Loans & Insurance recorded a net loss of $3.6 billion compared to a net loss of $1.2 billion due to a decline in mortgage banking income of $3.4 billion to $2.7 billion and an increase in noninterest expense of $655 million to $6.1 billion. These period-over-period changes were a result of the same factors described in the three months discussion above along with increased noninterest expense in the 2010 six-month period as a result of higher litigation costs.   Provision for credit losses decreased $108 million to $6.0 billion. In addition to the factors noted above, given that the six-month period in 2010 included a more significant impact related to certain modified loans that were written-down to the underlying collateral value, provision expense benefited from lower reserve additions in the Countrywide purchased credit-impaired home equity portfolio.  Mortgage Banking Income   We categorize Home Loans & Insurance mortgage banking income into production and servicing income. Production income is comprised of revenue from the fair value gains and losses recognized on our interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and LHFS, the related secondary market execution, and costs related to representations and warranties in the sales transactions along with other obligations incurred in the sales of mortgage loans. In addition, production income includes revenue for transfers of mortgage loans from Home Loans & Insurance to the ALM portfolio related to the Corporation’s mortgage production retention decisions which is eliminated in All Other.   Servicing activities primarily include collecting cash for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers, disbursing customer draws for lines of credit and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors and escrow payments to third parties. Our home retention efforts are also part of our servicing activities, along with responding to customer inquiries and supervising foreclosures and property dispositions. Servicing income includes income earned in connection with these activities such as late fees, and MSR valuation adjustments, net of economic hedge activities.  118    Table of Contents   The following table summarizes the components of mortgage banking income.

Three Months Ended June 30, 2010 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2009   Production income of $180 million represented a decrease of $1.5 billion as core production income declined $692 million due to a decline in production volume resulting from weaker market demand for refinance transactions combined with lower pricing margins due to increased competition partially offset by an increase in our market share. Representations and warranties expense increased to $1.2 billion from $446 million due to increased estimates of defaults reflecting uncertainty in the housing markets combined with a higher rate of repurchase or similar requests and our continued evaluation of exposure to repurchases and claims, including repurchase demands from monoline insurers. For additional information on representations and warranties, see Note 8 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Residential Mortgage beginning on page 151.   Net servicing income decreased $147 million largely due to lower MSR results, net of hedges, partially offset by a decrease in the impact of customer payments and higher servicing fees. For additional information on MSRs and the related hedge instruments, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management on page 191.  Six Months Ended June 30, 2010 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2009   Production income of $937 million represented a decrease of $2.4 billion attributable in part to a decline in production volume resulting from weaker market demand for refinance transactions partially offset by an increase in our market share. Also contributing to the decline were lower pricing margins due to increased competition. In addition, representations and warranties expense increased to $1.8 billion from $880 million in the same period in 2009 for the same reasons as described above. For additional information on representations and warranties, see Note 8 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management – Residential Mortgage beginning on page 151.   Net servicing income decreased $1.0 billion largely due to lower MSR results, net of hedges, partially offset by a decrease in the impact of customer payments and an increase in servicing fees.

(2)   Servicing of residential mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit, home equity loans and discontinued real estate mortgage loans.     First mortgage production in Home Loans & Insurance was $69.1 billion and $136.1 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to $103.0 billion and $181.5 billion in the same periods of 2009. The decreases of $33.9 billion and $45.4 billion were driven by weaker market demand for refinance transactions partially offset by an increase in market share. Home equity production was $1.8 billion and $3.6 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to $2.9 billion and $5.8 billion in the same periods of 2009. The decreases of $1.1 billion and $2.2 billion were primarily due to more stringent underwriting guidelines for home equity lines of credit and loans as well as lower consumer demand.   At June 30, 2010, the consumer MSR balance was $14.7 billion, which represented 86 bps of the related unpaid principal balance as compared to $19.5 billion, or 113 bps of the related unpaid principal balance at December 31, 2009. The decrease in the consumer MSR balance was driven by the impact of declining mortgage rates during the three months ended June 30, 2010 partially offset by the addition of new MSRs recorded in connection with sales of loans. As a result of the decline in rates, the value of the MSRs decreased driven by an increase in expected prepayments which reduced the expected life of the consumer MSRs resulting in the 27 bps decrease in the capitalized MSRs as a percentage of loans serviced.  120    Table of Contents     Global Commercial Banking                                           Three Months Ended June 30   Six Months Ended June 30   (Dollars in millions)   2010     2009     2010     2009           Net interest income (1)   $ 2,118     $ 1,979     $ 4,331     $ 3,960     Noninterest income:                                   Service charges     528       512       1,071       1,023     All other income     132       352       406       569         Total noninterest income     660       864       1,477       1,592         Total revenue, net of interest expense     2,778       2,843       5,808       5,552                                         Provision for credit losses     623       2,081       1,549       3,868     Noninterest expense     909       970       1,876       1,944         Income (loss) before income taxes     1,246       (208 )     2,383       (260 )   Income tax expense (benefit) (1)     456       (144 )     880       (160 )       Net income (loss)   $ 790     $ (64 )   $ 1,503     $ (100 )                                           Net interest yield (1)     3.13 %     3.23 %     3.26 %     3.36 %   Return on average equity     7.55       n/m       7.16       n/m     Efficiency ratio (1)     32.74       34.12       32.31       35.00                                         Balance Sheet                                                                       Average                                   Total loans and leases   $ 206,111     $ 234,355     $ 209,955     $ 235,695     Total earning assets (2)     271,370       245,586       267,890       237,932     Total assets (2)     302,636       278,267       298,767       270,444     Total deposits     145,221       125,805       144,300       122,175     Allocated equity     41,971       43,476       42,306       41,608                                         June 30     December 31     Period end   2010     2009             Total loans and leases   $ 203,173     $ 215,237     Total earning assets (2)     272,691       264,745     Total assets (2)     303,848       295,829     Total deposits     147,251       146,905                   (1)   FTE basis     (2)   Total earning assets and total assets include asset allocations to match liabilities (i.e., deposits).

Three Months Ended June 30, 2010 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2009   Global Commercial Banking recorded net income of $790 million, an increase of $854 million, primarily driven by lower credit costs partially offset by lower revenue.   Net interest income increased $139 million, or seven percent. Improved loan spreads on new, renewed and amended facilities were offset by the $28.2 billion, or 12 percent, decline in average loan balances due to client deleveraging, lower new loan demand and economic uncertainty. Net interest income also benefited from the growth in average deposits of $19.4 billion, or 15 percent, as clients remain very liquid. Additionally, a higher allocation of residual net interest income allocation related to ALM activities benefited results.  121    Table of Contents   Noninterest income decreased $204 million, or 24 percent, to $660 million, due to a decrease in all other income of $220 million, or 63 percent, compared to the prior year mainly driven by increased costs related to an agreement to purchase certain loans. Service charges were relatively flat.   The provision for credit losses was $623 million compared to $2.1 billion. The decrease was primarily driven by reserve reductions and lower net charge-offs in the commercial domestic and retail dealer-related portfolios reflecting improved borrower credit profiles and higher resale values. Also contributing to the decrease was the lower level of reserve additions in commercial real estate.  Six Months Ended June 30, 2010 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2009   Net income increased $1.6 billion driven by an increase in net interest income of $371 million and a decrease in provision for credit losses of $2.3 billion. The increase in net interest income was partially offset by a decrease of $115 million in noninterest income. These period-over-period changes were driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above.  Global Commercial Banking Revenue   Global Commercial Banking revenues can also be categorized as business lending revenue derived from credit-related products and services and treasury services revenue primarily from capital and treasury management.   Business lending revenue decreased $145 million, or eight percent, to $1.7 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 and increased $111 million, or three percent, to $3.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. For the three months ended June 30, 2010, improved loan spreads on new, renewed and amended facilities were offset by the decline in average loan balances. Additionally, the decrease was attributable to increased costs related to an agreement to purchase certain loans. For the six months ended June 30, 2010, business lending revenue increased due to improved loan spreads on new, renewed and amended facilities offset by the decline in average loan balances and the increased costs related to an agreement to purchase certain loans.   Treasury services revenue increased $80 million and $145 million, or eight and seven percent, to $1.1 billion and $2.3 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, compared to the same periods in 2009, benefiting from the growth in average deposits as clients remained very liquid. However, this increase was muted by narrowing deposit spreads and lower treasury services charges.  122    Table of Contents     Global Banking & Markets                                           Three Months Ended June 30   Six Months Ended June 30   (Dollars in millions)   2010     2009     2010     2009           Net interest income (1)   $ 1,976     $ 2,366     $ 4,122     $ 5,148     Noninterest income:                                   Service charges     529       441       1,048       923     Investment and brokerage services     676       861       1,299       1,476     Investment banking income     1,301       1,605       2,518       2,725     Trading account profits     1,202       2,048       6,274       7,017     All other income      850       3,531       1,543       2,985         Total noninterest income     4,029       8,045       11,634       14,203         Total revenue, net of interest expense     6,005       10,411       15,756       19,351                                         Provision for credit losses     (133 )     588       114       913     Noninterest expense     4,790       3,920       9,160       8,613         Income before income taxes     1,348       5,903       6,482       9,825     Income tax expense (1)     421       2,000       2,337       3,405         Net income   $ 927     $ 3,903     $ 4,145     $ 6,420                                             Return on average equity     7.00 %     31.52 %     15.46 %     27.09 %   Efficiency ratio (1)     79.75       37.66       58.14       44.51                                         Balance Sheet                                                                       Average                                   Total trading-related assets (2)   $ 513,204     $ 504,861     $ 511,358     $ 521,558     Total loans and leases     95,902       116,513       97,456       118,940     Total market-based earning assets     520,825       476,431       524,054       483,086     Total earning assets     610,791       587,112       617,133       598,681     Total assets     774,792       780,910       778,439       807,940     Total deposits     113,165       102,650       108,664       103,325     Allocated equity     53,117       49,670       54,080       47,792                                         June 30     December 31      Period end   2010     2009             Total trading-related assets (2)   $ 472,079     $ 411,562     Total loans and leases     95,647       95,930     Total market-based earning assets     462,484       404,315     Total earning assets     549,911       501,877     Total assets     712,219       653,802     Total deposits     106,091       102,211                   (1)   FTE basis     (2)   Includes assets which are not considered earning assets (i.e., derivative assets).

GBAM also includes the results of our merchant processing joint venture, Banc of America Merchant Services, LLC.  123    Table of Contents   During the second quarter of 2009, we entered into a joint venture agreement with First Data Corporation (First Data) to form Banc of America Merchant Services, LLC. The joint venture provides payment solutions, including credit, debit and prepaid cards, and check and e-commerce payments to merchants ranging from small businesses to corporate and commercial clients worldwide. In addition to Bank of America and First Data, the remaining stake was initially held by a third party. During the second quarter of 2010, the third party sold its interest to the joint venture and thus increased the Corporation’s ownership interest in the joint venture to 49 percent. For additional information on the joint venture agreement, see Note 5 – Securities.  Three Months Ended June 30, 2010 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2009   Net income decreased $3.0 billion to $927 million due to a widespread market deterioration and slowdown, lower net interest income and increased noninterest expense. The prior year included the $3.8 billion pre-tax gain related to the contribution of the merchant processing business to the joint venture.   Net interest income decreased $390 million to $2.0 billion due to lower spreads on trading-related assets and lower average loans and leases, which decreased $20.6 billion, or 18 percent, driven primarily by reduced demand. Net interest income is both market-based, which is related to sales and trading, and core, which is related to credit and treasury services. Noninterest income decreased $4.0 billion due to decreased sales and trading revenue and the prior-year gain related to the contribution of the merchant processing business to the joint venture, partially offset by credit valuation gains on derivative liabilities compared to losses in the prior year as described in the Sales and Trading Revenue section below, and reduced write-downs on legacy assets. Noninterest expense increased $870 million driven by the U.K. payroll tax on certain year-end incentive payments and higher expense on proportionately larger prior-year incentive deferrals. Provision for credit losses decreased $721 million driven by lower net charge-offs and reserve reductions reflecting stabilized borrower cash flows and improved borrower liquidity.  Six Months Ended June 30, 2010 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2009   Net income decreased $2.3 billion to $4.1 billion due to the same factors mentioned in the three month discussion above except for credit valuation gains which were $163 million higher in the six month period.  Components of Global Banking & Markets Sales and Trading Revenue   Sales and trading revenue is segregated into fixed-income including investment and noninvestment grade corporate debt obligations, CMBS, RMBS and CDO; currencies including interest rate and foreign exchange contracts; commodities including primarily futures, forwards, swaps and options; and equity income from equity-linked derivatives and cash equity activity.

Sales and trading revenue decreased $712 million to $3.2 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to general market deterioration and a lack of liquidity as sovereign debt fears and regulatory uncertainty fueled investor concerns. FICC revenue decreased $366 million to $2.3 billion primarily due to lower results in credit products, which benefited a year earlier from spread tightening, partially offset by improved results in rates and currencies and mortgage-backed products. Equities revenue decreased $346 million to $852 million due to lower primary revenues and domestic volumes within the cash business. Additionally, we recorded net credit spread gains on derivative liabilities in the second quarter of 2010 of $77 million due to spread widening during the quarter compared to losses of $1.6 billion due to spread tightening during the prior year quarter. Write-downs on legacy assets were $179 million for the three months ended June 30, 2010 and $1.3 billion for the same period in 2009.   Sales and trading revenue increased slightly to $10.2 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009. FICC revenue increased $381 million to $7.8 billion due to lower losses in our mortgage-backed  124    Table of Contents  products offset by lower revenue in our rates and currencies and commodities products. We recorded net credit spread gains on derivative liabilities during the six months ended June 30, 2010 of $246 million due to spread widening compared to $83 million in 2009. Write-downs on legacy assets were $213 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010 and $3.0 billion for the same period in 2009. Losses in the prior year were primarily driven by our CDO exposure, as well as monoline and CMBS exposure.   Equity income was $2.4 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to $2.7 billion for the same period in 2009 driven by lower domestic volumes and market conditions in the derivatives business.  Investment Banking Income   Product specialists within GBAM underwrite and distribute debt and equity securities, and certain other loan products, and provide advisory services. To provide a complete discussion of our consolidated investment banking income, the following table presents total investment banking income for the Corporation, more than 90 percent of which is recorded in GBAM with the remainder in GWIM and Global Commercial Banking.

Investment banking income decreased $327 million to $1.3 billion and $142 million to $2.6 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009. Equity issuance fees decreased $190 million and $3 million due to market conditions and a decline in market-based revenue pools. Debt issuance fees decreased $117 million and were flat for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 consistent with overall market-based revenue pools, somewhat offset by increased leveraged finance activities. Advisory fees decreased $50 million and $212 million attributable to a significant slowdown in mergers and acquisitions activity.  125    Table of Contents  Business Lending Revenue   Business lending revenue of $870 million and $1.8 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 increased $237 million and $324 million compared to the same periods in 2009 primarily due to favorable hedge results and higher fees partially offset by losses on the fair value option book and lower leasing activity. Net interest income benefited marginally from widening credit spreads and higher loan fees partially offset by a decline in loan balances due to weak credit demand resulting from economic conditions and greater liquidity.  Treasury Services Revenue   Treasury services revenue of $712 million and $1.4 billion for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 decreased $3.8 billion compared to the same periods in 2009 which included a $3.8 billion pre-tax gain related to the contribution of the merchant processing business to the joint venture. Net interest income increased due to growth in deposit balances and increased spreads. Subsequent to the contribution of the merchant processing business to the joint venture, we account for our investment under the equity method of accounting. Equity investment income from the joint venture was $39 million and $62 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010.   Collateralized Debt Obligation Exposure  CDO vehicles hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities and issue multiple tranches of debt securities including commercial paper, mezzanine and equity securities. Our CDO exposure can be divided into funded and unfunded super senior liquidity commitment exposure, other super senior exposure (i.e., cash positions and derivative contracts), warehouse, and sales and trading positions. For more information on our CDO liquidity commitments, see Note 8 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Super senior exposure represents the most senior class of commercial paper or notes that are issued by the CDO vehicles. These financial instruments benefit from the subordination of all other securities issued by the CDO vehicles.   For the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, we incurred $313 million and $605 million of losses resulting from our CDO exposure which includes our super senior, warehouse, sales and trading positions, hedging activities and counterparty credit risk valuations. This compares to $1.2 billion and $1.8 billion in CDO-related losses for the same periods in 2009. Included in these losses in 2010 were $224 million and $318 million related to counterparty risk on our CDO-related exposure, as compared to $419 million and $628 million in 2009. Also included in these losses were other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) charges of $9 million and $249 million compared to $290 million and $598 million in the same periods in 2009 related to CDOs and retained positions classified as AFS debt securities.   As presented in the following table at June 30, 2010, our hedged and unhedged super senior CDO exposure before consideration of insurance, net of write-downs, was $2.5 billion. For additional information on our CDO positions, including the super senior CDO exposure in the table below, and our maximum exposure to loss, see Note 8 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Super Senior Collateralized Debt Obligation Exposure   June 30, 2010                                                             Retained   Total   Non-       (Dollars in millions)   Subprime (1)   Positions   Subprime   Subprime (2)   Total         Unhedged   $ 745     $ 330     $ 1,075     $ 307     $ 1,382     Hedged (3)     580       —       580       552       1,132         Total   $ 1,325     $ 330     $ 1,655     $ 859     $ 2,514                   (1)   Classified as subprime when subprime consumer real estate loans make up at least 35 percent of the original net exposure value of the underlying collateral.     (2)   Includes highly-rated collateralized loan obligations and CMBS super senior exposure.     (3)   Hedged amounts are presented at carrying value before consideration of insurance.     We value our CDO structures using market-standard models to model the specific collateral composition and cash flow structure of each deal. Key inputs to the model are prepayment rates, default rates and severities for each collateral type, and other relevant contractual features. Unrealized losses recorded in accumulated OCI on super senior cash positions and retained positions from liquidated CDOs in aggregate increased $64 million and $118 million for the three and six months to $968 million at June 30, 2010.   At June 30, 2010, total subprime super senior unhedged exposure of $1.1 billion was marked at 16 percent, including $330 million of retained positions from liquidated CDOs, and the $307 million of non-subprime unhedged exposure was  126    Table of Contents  marked at 27 percent of the original net exposure amounts. Net hedged subprime super senior exposure of $580 million was marked at 12 percent and the $552 million of hedged non-subprime super senior exposure was marked at 59 percent of its original net exposure.  Credit Default Swaps with Monolines    June 30, 2010                                               Other           Super   Guaranteed       (Dollars in millions)   Senior CDOs   Positions   Total         Notional   $ 3,668     $ 35,235     $ 38,903                                 Mark-to-market or guarantor receivable   $ 2,919     $ 7,292     $ 10,211     Credit valuation adjustment     (2,206 )     (3,783 )     (5,989 )       Total   $ 713     $ 3,509     $ 4,222         Credit valuation adjustment %     76 %     52 %     59 %   (Write-downs) gains during the three months ended June 30, 2010   $ (224 )   $ 115     $ (109 )   (Write-downs) gains during the six months ended June 30, 2010     (333 )     154       (179 )          Monoline wrap protection on our super senior CDOs had a notional value of $3.7 billion at June 30, 2010, with a receivable of $2.9 billion and a counterparty credit valuation adjustment of $2.2 billion, or 76 percent. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, we recorded $224 million and $333 million of counterparty credit risk-related write-downs on these positions. At December 31, 2009, the monoline wrap on our super senior CDOs had a notional value of $3.8 billion, with a receivable of $2.8 billion and a counterparty credit valuation adjustment of $1.9 billion, or 66 percent. In addition, we held collateral in the form of cash and marketable securities of $709 million and $1.1 billion at June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009 related to our non-monoline purchased insurance.   In addition to the monoline exposure related to super senior CDOs, at June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, we had $35.2 billion and $38.8 billion of notional exposure to monolines that predominantly hedge corporate collateralized loan obligation and CDO exposure as well as CMBS, RMBS and other ABS cash and synthetic exposures. Mark-to-market monoline derivative credit exposure was $7.3 billion at June 30, 2010 compared to $8.3 billion at December 31, 2009. This decrease was driven by positive valuation adjustments on legacy assets and terminated monoline contracts.   At June 30, 2010, the counterparty credit valuation adjustment related to non-super senior CDO monoline derivative exposure was $3.8 billion which reduced our net mark-to-market exposure to $3.5 billion. We do not hold collateral against these derivative exposures. Also, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, we recognized gains of $115 million and $154 million for counterparty credit risk related to these positions.   With the Merrill Lynch acquisition, we acquired a loan with a carrying value of $4.3 billion as of June 30, 2010 that is collateralized by U.S. super senior ABS CDOs. Merrill Lynch originally provided financing to the borrower for an amount equal to approximately 75 percent of the fair value of the collateral. The loan has full recourse to the borrower and all scheduled payments on the loan have been received. Events of default under the loan are customary events of default, including failure to pay interest when due and failure to pay principal at maturity. Collateral for the loan is excluded from our CDO exposure discussions and the applicable tables.  127    Table of Contents     Global Wealth & Investment Management                                                     Three Months Ended June 30, 2010                 Merrill Lynch           Retirement &                     Global Wealth   U.S.   Philanthropic       (Dollars in millions)   Total     Management   Trust   Services   Other               Net interest income (1)   $ 1,385       $ 1,089     $ 356     $ 22     $ (82 )   Noninterest income:                                             Investment and brokerage services     2,241         1,697       289       221       34     All other income     705         458       11       31       205               Total noninterest income     2,946         2,155       300       252       239               Total revenue, net of interest expense     4,331         3,244       656       274       157                                                   Provision for credit losses     121         35       86       —       —     Noninterest expense     3,370         2,707       443       207       13               Income before income taxes     840         502       127       67       144     Income tax expense (1)     484         186       47       25       226               Net income (loss)   $ 356       $ 316     $ 80     $ 42     $ (82 )                                                           Net interest yield (1)     2.36  %       2.27  %     2.86  %     3.26 %     n/m     Return on average equity (2)     6.08         13.85       5.56       n/m       n/m     Efficiency ratio (1)     77.77         83.45       67.51       75.56       n/m     Period end – total assets (3)   $ 259,734       $ 201,410     $ 52,993     $ 2,799       n/m                                                                     Three Months Ended June 30, 2009                 Merrill Lynch           Retirement &                     Global Wealth   U.S.   Philanthropic       (Dollars in millions)   Total     Management   Trust   Services   Other               Net interest income (1)   $ 1,288       $ 1,037     $ 330     $ 21     $ (100 )   Noninterest income:                                             Investment and brokerage services     2,028         1,479       286       196       67     All other income     646         494       11       42       99               Total noninterest income     2,674         1,973       297       238       166               Total revenue, net of interest expense     3,962         3,010       627       259       66                                                   Provision for credit losses     238         154       84       —       —     Noninterest expense     3,142         2,496       442       177       27               Income before income taxes     582         360       101       82       39     Income tax expense (benefit) (1)     186         133       37       30       (14 )             Net income   $ 396       $ 227     $ 64     $ 52     $ 53                                                             Net interest yield (1)     2.52  %       2.47  %     2.50  %     3.31  %     n/m     Return on average equity (2)     8.77         11.32       5.05       n/m       n/m     Efficiency ratio (1)     79.26         82.90       70.42       68.39       n/m     Period end – total assets (3)   $ 233,792       $ 181,708     $ 56,669     $ 2,289       n/m                         (1)  FTE basis     (2)  Average allocated equity for GWIM was $23.5 billion and $18.1 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009.

GWIM provides a wide offering of investment, brokerage and customized banking services tailored to meet the changing wealth management needs of our individual and institutional customer base. Our clients have access to a range of services offered through three primary businesses: MLGWM; U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management (U.S. Trust); and Retirement & Philanthropic Services (RPS). The results of the BofA Global Capital Management (BACM) business, which is the cash and liquidity asset management business that Bank of America retained following the sale of the Columbia long-term asset management business, the Corporation’s approximate 34 percent economic ownership interest in BlackRock, Inc. (BlackRock) and other miscellaneous items, are included in Other within GWIM. The historical results of Columbia’s long-term asset business have been transferred to All Other.   MLGWM includes the impact of migrating customers and their related deposit and loan balances to or from Deposits, Home Loans & Insurance and the ALM portfolio as presented in the following table. The directional shift of total deposits migrated was mainly due to client segmentation threshold changes resulting from the Merrill Lynch acquisition. Subsequent to the date of migration, the associated net interest income, noninterest income and noninterest expense are recorded in the business to which the customers migrated.                                          Migration Summary               Three Months Ended June 30   Six Months Ended June 30   (Dollars in millions)   2010   2009   2010   2009         Total deposits — MLGWM from (to) Deposits    $ (555 )   $ (34,340 )   $ 2,454     $ (40,480 )   Total loans — MLGWM to Home Loans & Insurance and the ALM portfolio      (19 )     (3,479 )     (617 )     (13,630 )         Three Months Ended June 30, 2010 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2009   Net income decreased $40 million, or ten percent, to $356 million driven in part by the tax-related effects of the sale of the Columbia long-term asset management business and higher noninterest expense, partially offset by lower credit costs and higher revenue.   Net interest income increased $97 million, or eight percent, to $1.4 billion driven by the results from corporate ALM activity partially offset by the impact of net migration of customer relationships to Deposits, Home Loans & Insurance and the ALM portfolio. A more detailed discussion regarding migrated customer relationships and related balances is provided in MLGWM beginning on page 131.   Noninterest income increased $272 million, or ten percent, to $2.9 billion primarily driven by higher valuations in the equity markets, higher equity investment income from our investment in BlackRock, the gain on the sale of the Columbia long-term asset management business and increased transactional activity.   Provision for credit losses decreased $117 million, or 49 percent, to $121 million driven by improvement in the consumer real estate and commercial lending portfolios.   Noninterest expense increased $228 million, or seven percent, to $3.4 billion due to increases in revenue-related expenses, an increase in corporate overhead and other personnel costs. In response to regulatory and business changes in Argentina, MLGWM decided to close offices in Argentina in June 2010 which also contributed to the expense increase. These increases were partially offset by lower FDIC expenses.  Six Months Ended June 30, 2010 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2009   Net income decreased $73 million, or eight percent, to $817 million, driven by an increase of $305 million in noninterest expense and a decrease of $166 million in net interest income partially offset by an increase of $542 million in noninterest income and a decrease of $129 million in provision for credit losses. These period-over-period changes were driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above, except for net interest income which was driven primarily by the impact of net migration of customer relationships to Deposits, Home Loans & Insurance and the ALM portfolio in the prior year. Also, noninterest income was impacted by lower losses related to the support of certain cash funds.  130    Table of Contents  Client Assets   The following table presents client assets which consist of AUM, client brokerage assets, assets in custody and client deposits.

The decrease in net client assets was due to the sale of the Columbia long-term asset management business, outflows in MLGWM’s non-fee based brokerage assets and outflows in BACM’s money market assets due to the continued low rate environment.  Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management  MLGWM provides a high-touch client experience through a network of approximately 15,100 client-facing financial advisors to our affluent customers with a personal wealth profile of at least $250,000 of investable assets. Total client assets in MLGWM were $1.4 trillion at both June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009. In addition, as discussed above, MLGWM includes the impact of migrating customers and their related deposit and loan balances to or from Deposits, Home Loans & Insurance and the ALM portfolio. Three Months Ended June 30, 2010 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2009   Net income increased $89 million, or 39 percent, to $316 million as increases in net interest income and noninterest income and lower credit costs were partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $52 million, or five percent, to $1.1 billion driven by the impact of a higher net interest income allocation from ALM activities, partially offset by the impact of net migration of customer relationships to Deposits, Home Loans & Insurance and the ALM portfolio. Noninterest income increased $182 million, or nine percent, to $2.2 billion primarily due to higher valuations in equity markets and increased transactional revenue. Provision for credit losses decreased $119 million, or 77 percent, primarily due to lower consumer real estate-related credit costs. Noninterest expense increased $211 million, or eight percent, to $2.7 billion due to increases in revenue-related expenses, expenses associated with the Argentine exit, and other personnel costs. These expenses were partially offset by lower FDIC expenses.  Six Months Ended June 30, 2010 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2009   Net income increased $11 million, or two percent, to $675 million driven by an increase of $261 million in noninterest income and decrease of $284 million in provision for credit losses largely offset by an increase of $306 million in noninterest expense and decrease of $221 million in net interest income. These period-over-period changes were driven by the same factors as mentioned in the three-month discussion above. Additionally, net interest income was impacted by the lower rate environment and the impact of net migration of customer relationships to Deposits, Home Loans & Insurance and the ALM portfolio in the prior year.  131    Table of Contents  U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management  U.S. Trust provides comprehensive wealth management solutions to wealthy and ultra-wealthy clients with investable assets of more than $3 million. In addition, U.S. Trust provides resources and customized solutions to meet clients’ wealth structuring, investment management, trust and banking needs as well as specialty asset management services (oil and gas, real estate, farm and ranch, timberland, private businesses and tax advisory). Clients also benefit from access to resources available through the Corporation including capital markets products, large and complex financing solutions, and our extensive banking platform.  Three Months Ended June 30, 2010 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2009   Net income increased $16 million, or 25 percent, to $80 million driven primarily by higher net interest income. Net interest income increased $26 million primarily due to a higher net interest income allocation from ALM activities. Noninterest income remained relatively unchanged, but reflected higher valuations in the equity markets, offset by net outflows and lower transactional revenues. Provision for credit losses also remained relatively unchanged with slightly higher net charge-offs in the consumer portfolio, offset by lower reserve additions in the commercial lending portfolio. Noninterest expense increased slightly due to higher dedicated support and personnel costs offset by the absence of the special FDIC assessment recorded in the prior year.  Six Months Ended June 30, 2010 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2009   Net income decreased $47 million, or 29 percent, to $116 million driven primarily by an increase in provision for credit losses of $155 million from a reserve build in the consumer portfolio and lower noninterest income of $7 million, offset by decreased noninterest expense of $56 million and higher net interest income of $32 million. These period-over-period changes were driven by the same factors as discussed in the three-month discussion above.  Retirement & Philanthropic Services  RPS provides institutional and personal retirement solutions, and comprehensive investment advisory and philanthropic services to individuals, small to large corporations, pension plans, endowments and foundations. Retirement solutions include investment management, administration, recordkeeping and custodial services. These services are provided for 401(k), pension, profit-sharing, equity award and non-qualified deferred compensation plans. For institutional philanthropic clients, RPS also offers specialized advisory, asset management and administrative solutions. Additionally, RPS works closely with Financial Advisors to offer a range of personal and institutional retirement products and solutions which drive revenue for the MLGWM business.  Three Months Ended June 30, 2010 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2009   Net income decreased $10 million, or 19 percent, to $42 million as an increase in revenue was more than offset by higher noninterest expense. Noninterest income increased $14 million, or six percent, primarily due to higher valuations in the equity markets. Net interest income remained relatively unchanged. Expenses increased $30 million, or 17 percent, mainly due to higher Financial Advisor distribution costs.  Six Months Ended June 30, 2010 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2009   Net income decreased $10 million, or 11 percent, to $80 million primarily driven by a $53 million increase in noninterest expense offsetting a $37 million increase in revenue. These period-over-period changes were driven by the same factors as discussed in the three-month discussion above.  Other  Other includes the remaining cash management business of Columbia known as BACM, the Corporation’s approximately 34 percent economic ownership interest in BlackRock and other miscellaneous items. Our investment in BlackRock is accounted for under the equity method of accounting with our proportionate share of income or loss recorded in equity investment income. The sale of the Columbia long-term asset management business to Ameriprise Financial Inc. was completed on April 30, 2010.  132    Table of Contents   Net income decreased $135 million and $27 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same periods in 2009 driven by the tax-related effects of the sale of the Columbia long-term asset management business, partially offset by higher noninterest income related to our investment in BlackRock. Additionally, noninterest income was higher for the six months ended June 30, 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 due to lower losses related to the support of certain cash funds.  133    Table of Contents     All Other                                             Three Months Ended   Three Months Ended       June 30, 2010   June 30, 2009       Reported   Reported   Securitization   As   (Dollars in millions)   Basis   Basis (1)   Offset (2)   Adjusted         Net interest income (3)   $ 164     $ (1,595 )   $ 2,358     $ 763     Noninterest income:                                   Card income (loss)     —       (278 )     592       314     Equity investment income     2,114       5,979       —       5,979     Gains on sales of debt securities     15       672       —       672     All other income (loss)     783       (4,110 )     33       (4,077 )       Total noninterest income     2,912       2,263       625       2,888         Total revenue, net of interest expense     3,076       668       2,983       3,651                                         Provision for credit losses     1,248       —       2,983       2,983     Merger and restructuring charges (4)     508       829       —       829     All other noninterest expense     564       796       —       796         Income (loss) before income taxes     756       (957 )     —       (957 )   Income tax benefit (3)     (357 )     (1,724 )     —       (1,724 )       Net income   $ 1,113     $ 767     $ —     $ 767                                                       Six Months Ended   Six Months Ended       June 30, 2010   June 30, 2009       Reported   Reported   Securitization   As   (Dollars in millions)   Basis   Basis (1)   Offset (2)   Adjusted         Net interest income (3)   $ 307     $ (3,452 )   $ 4,749     $ 1,297     Noninterest income:                                   Card income (loss)     —       256       348       604     Equity investment income     2,481       7,302       —       7,302     Gains on sales of debt securities     662       2,143       —       2,143     All other income (loss)     906       (1,367 )     67       (1,300 )       Total noninterest income     4,049       8,334       415       8,749         Total revenue, net of interest expense     4,356       4,882       5,164       10,046                                         Provision for credit losses     2,466       (667 )     5,164       4,497     Merger and restructuring charges (4)     1,029       1,594       —       1,594     All other noninterest expense     1,706       1,247       —       1,247         Income (loss) before income taxes     (845 )     2,708       —       2,708     Income tax benefit (3)     (1,185 )     (969 )     —       (969 )       Net income   $ 340     $ 3,677     $ —     $ 3,677                   (1)  Provision for credit losses represents the provision for credit losses in All Other combined with the Global Card Services securitization offset.

(3)  Includes elimination of segments’ excess asset allocations to match liabilities (i.e., deposits) of $607.5 billion and $510.5 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009; $595.6 billion and $497.9 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009; and $599.9 billion and $561.6 billion at June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009.     All Other includes our Equity Investments businesses and Other. For periods prior to 2010, Global Card Services was reported on a managed basis which included a securitization impact adjustment. All Other’s results included a corresponding securitization offset which removed the impact of these securitized loans in order to present the consolidated results on a GAAP basis (i.e., held basis). The current periods are presented in accordance with new consolidation guidance, which was adopted on January 1, 2010. See the Global Card Services section beginning on page 115 for information on the Global Card Services managed results.   Equity Investments includes Global Principal Investments, Corporate Investments and Strategic Investments. During the first quarter of 2010, the $2.7 billion Corporate Investment equity portfolio was sold as a result of a change in our investment portfolio objectives shifting more to core interest income and reducing our exposure to equity market risk, resulting in a loss of $331 million.   Global Principal Investments is comprised of a diversified portfolio of investments in private equity, real estate and other alternative investments. These investments are made either directly in a company or held through a fund with related income recorded in equity investment income. Global Principal Investments had unfunded equity commitments of $1.8 billion at June 30, 2010, related to certain of these investments. For more information on these commitments, see Note 11 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Affiliates of the Corporation may, from time to time, act as general partner, fund manager and/or investment advisor to certain Corporation-sponsored real estate private equity funds. In such capacities, these affiliates manage and/or provide investment advisory services to such real estate private equity funds primarily for the benefit of third-party institutional and private clients. Such activities inherently involve risk to us and to the fund investors, and in certain situations may result in loss.   The Strategic Investments business includes investments of $9.2 billion in CCB, $2.6 billion in Santander, which excludes the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments in accumulated OCI, and other investments. In June 2010, we sold our investment in Itaú Unibanco, resulting in a $1.2 billion pre-tax gain and entered into an agreement to sell our investment in Santander, which is expected to close during the third quarter of 2010. Because the sale of Santander is expected to result in a loss, we recorded an impairment write-down in the second quarter equal to the estimated pre-tax loss of $428 million. For more information on these investments, see Note 5 – Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements.   In 2009, we sold 19.1 billion common shares in CCB for $10.1 billion, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $7.3 billion. We remain a significant shareholder in CCB with an approximate 11 percent ownership interest. In the second quarter of 2010, we accrued a $535 million dividend on our investment in CCB.  135    Table of Contents   The following table presents the components of All Other’s equity investment income and reconciliation to the total consolidated equity investment income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009 and also All Other’s equity investments at June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009.

Other also includes certain amounts associated with ALM activities, amounts associated with the change in the value of derivatives used as economic hedges of interest rate and foreign exchange rate fluctuations, impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to revaluation of foreign currency-denominated debt, fair value adjustments on certain structured notes, certain gains (losses) on sales of whole mortgage loans, gains (losses) on sales of certain debt securities and other-than-temporary impairment write-downs on certain AFS securities. In addition, Other includes adjustments to net interest income and income tax expense to remove the FTE effect of items (primarily low-income housing tax credits) that are reported on a FTE basis in the business segments. Other also includes a trust services business which is a client-focused business providing trustee services and fund administration to various financial services companies.   First Republic results are also included in Other. First Republic, acquired as part of the Merrill Lynch acquisition, provides personalized, relationship-based banking services including private banking, private business banking, real estate lending, trust, brokerage and investment management. First Republic is a standalone bank that operates primarily on the west coast and in the northeast and caters to high-end customers. On October 21, 2009, we reached an agreement to sell First Republic to a number of investors, led by First Republic’s existing management, Colony Capital, LLC and General Atlantic, LLC. On July 1, 2010, we removed $17.4 billion of loans and $17.8 billion of deposits from our consolidated balance sheet as a result of this transaction.  Three Months Ended June 30, 2010 Compared to Three Months Ended June 30, 2009   All Other reported net income of $1.1 billion compared to $767 million due to higher revenue, partially offset by an increase in provision for credit losses.   Net interest income increased $1.8 billion to $164 million due to the absence of the securitization offset impact in the current period as a result of the adoption of new consolidation guidance.   Noninterest income increased $649 million to $2.9 billion primarily driven by a pre-tax gain on the sale of Itaú Unibanco of $1.2 billion, a CCB dividend of $535 million and positive valuation adjustments on certain Merrill Lynch structured notes of $1.2 billion compared to $3.6 billion of negative credit valuation adjustments in the prior year. The prior-year period included a $5.3 billion pre-tax gain on the sale of a portion of CCB shares. Also, card income associated with the securitization offset is now no longer in All Other.   Provision for credit losses increased $1.2 billion, driven by the impact of new consolidation guidance partially offset by lower reserve additions related to the residential mortgage and discontinued real estate purchased credit-impaired loan portfolios.  136    Table of Contents   The decrease in income tax benefits to $357 million was primarily attributable to the increase in income before taxes, a lower tax benefit from the partial release of a valuation allowance established for acquired capital loss carryforward amounts and lower other residual amounts resulting from the recognition of tax benefits during the interim periods.  Six Months Ended June 30, 2010 Compared to Six Months Ended June 30, 2009   Net income decreased $3.3 billion to $340 million as increases in net interest income of $3.8 billion were more than offset by decreases in noninterest income of $4.3 billion and higher provision of $3.1 billion. These period-over-period changes were driven by the same factors as described in the three-month discussion above. In addition, noninterest income decreased primarily due to the absence of the $7.3 billion pre-tax gain resulting from sales of shares in CCB in addition to gains on the sale of agency mortgage-backed securities of $672 million, both occurring in the first half of 2009. These prior period gains combined with the net negative credit valuation adjustments were somewhat offset by the same factors described above. The increase in the income tax benefit was driven by the decrease in income before taxes, partially offset by the factors described above.     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations  We have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into a number of off-balance sheet commitments including commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and commercial letters of credit to meet the financing needs of our customers. Beginning on January 1, 2010, the accounting and reporting for these commitments were subject to new consolidation guidance which is more fully discussed in Note 8 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information on our obligations and commitments, see Note 10 – Long-term Debt and Note 11 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements, pages 42 through 43 of the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as Note 13 – Long-term Debt and Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Regulatory Initiatives  On July 21, 2010, the Financial Reform Act was signed into law. This legislation will alter the way in which the Corporation conducts certain businesses, restrict its ability to compete, and increase costs and reduce revenues. For additional information, refer to Regulatory Overview on page 92.   The U.K. has adopted increased capital and liquidity requirements for local financial institutions, including regulated U.K. subsidiaries of foreign bank holding companies and other financial institutions as well as branches of foreign banks located in the U.K. In addition, the U.K. has proposed the creation and production of recovery and resolution plans (commonly referred to as living wills) by such entities. We are currently monitoring the impact of these initiatives.   On February 23, 2010, regulators issued clarifying guidance, effective in the first quarter of 2010, on modified consumer real estate loans that specifies criteria required to demonstrate a borrower’s capacity to repay the modified loan. In connection with this guidance, we reviewed our modified consumer real estate loans and determined that a portion of these loans did not meet the criteria and, therefore, were deemed collateral dependent. The guidance requires that modified loans deemed to be collateral dependent be written down to their estimated collateral value which resulted in $813 million of net charge-offs during the three months ended March 31, 2010, of which $643 million were home equity, $161 million were residential mortgage and $9 million were discontinued real estate. Furthermore, we had $142 million of net charge-offs for collateral dependent modified loans during the three months ended June 30, 2010, of which $128 million were home equity and $14 million were residential mortgage.   On January 21, 2010, the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, FDIC and Office of Thrift Supervision (collectively, joint agencies) issued a final rule regarding risk-based capital requirements related to the impact of the adoption of new consolidation guidance. The impact on the Corporation on January 1, 2010, due to the new consolidation guidance and the final rule was an increase in risk-weighted assets of $21.3 billion and a reduction in capital of $9.7 billion. The overall effect of the new consolidation guidance and the final rule was a decrease in Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common ratios of 76 bps and 73 bps. For more information, see the Impact of Adopting New Consolidation Guidance section on page 101 and Liquidity Risk and Capital Management beginning on page 139.  137    Table of Contents   On December 17, 2009, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision released consultative documents on both capital and liquidity. In addition, we began Basel II parallel implementation on April 1, 2010. For more information, see Basel Regulatory Capital Requirements on page 145.   On March 4, 2009, the U.S. Treasury provided details related to the $75 billion Making Home Affordable program (MHA). The MHA is focused on reducing the number of foreclosures and making it easier for customers to refinance loans. The MHA consists of the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) which provides guidelines on “first lien” loan modifications, and the Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) which provides guidelines for loan refinancing. The HAMP is designed to help at-risk homeowners avoid foreclosure by reducing payments. This program provides incentives to lenders to modify all eligible loans that fall under the guidelines of this program. The HARP is available to approximately four to five million homeowners who have a proven payment history on an existing mortgage owned by the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC). The HARP is designed to help eligible homeowners refinance their mortgage loans to take advantage of current lower mortgage rates or to refinance adjustable-rate mortgages (ARM) into more stable fixed-rate mortgages.   As part of the MHA program, on April 28, 2009, the U.S. government announced intentions to create the second lien modification program (2MP) that is designed to reduce the monthly payments on qualifying home equity loans and lines of credit under certain conditions, including completion of a HAMP modification on the first mortgage on the property. This program provides incentives to lenders to modify all eligible loans that fall under the guidelines of this program. Additional clarification on government guidelines for the program was announced in the first quarter of 2010. On April 8, 2010, we began early implementation of the 2MP with the mailing of trial modification offers to eligible home equity customers, although U.S. government processes for confirming homeowner eligibility and measuring progress are not expected to be fully implemented for several months. We will modify eligible second liens under this initiative regardless of whether the MHA modified “first lien” is serviced by Bank of America or another participating servicer.   On April 5, 2010, we implemented the Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives (HAFA) program, which is another addition to the HAMP, that assists borrowers with non-retention options instead of foreclosure. The HAFA program provides incentives to lenders to assist all eligible borrowers that fall under the guidelines of this program. Our first goal is to work with the borrower to determine if a loan modification or other homeownership retention solution is available before pursuing non-retention options such as short sales. Short sales are an important option for homeowners who are facing financial difficulty and do not have a viable option to remain in the home. HAFA’s short sale guidelines are designed to streamline and standardize the process and will be compatible with Bank of America’s new cooperative short sale program.   During the six months ended June 30, 2010, 159,000 loan modifications were completed with a total unpaid principal balance of $36.5 billion, including 71,000 customers who were converted from trial-period to permanent modifications under the HAMP. In addition, on March 26, 2010, the U.S. government announced new changes to the MHA program guidelines that will include principal forgiveness options to the HAMP for a sub-segment of qualified HAMP borrowers. The details around eligibility, forgiveness arrangements, and the incentive structures are still being finalized and are not available at the time of this filing; however, the implementation of these changes is anticipated for Fall of 2010.   In addition to the programs described above, we have implemented several programs designed to help our customers. For information on these programs, refer to Credit Risk Management beginning on page 147. We will continue to help our customers address financial challenges through these government programs and our own home retention programs.     Managing Risk  Given our wide range of business activities as well as the competitive dynamics, the regulatory environment and the geographic span of such activities, risk taking is an inherent activity for the Corporation. Our business exposes us to strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. The Corporation’s risk management infrastructure is continually evolving to meet the challenges posed by the increased complexity of the financial services industry and markets, by our increased size and global footprint, and by the recent financial crisis. We have redefined our risk framework and articulated a risk appetite approved by the Corporation’s Board of Directors (the Board). While many of these processes, and roles and responsibilities continue to evolve and mature, we continue to enhance our risk management process with a focus on clarity of roles and accountabilities, escalation of issues, aggregation of risk and data across the enterprise, and effective governance characterized by clarity and transparency.   We take a comprehensive approach to risk management. Risk management planning is fully integrated with strategic, financial and customer/client planning so that goals and responsibilities are aligned across the organization. Risk is managed in a systematic manner by focusing on the Corporation as a whole and managing risk across the enterprise and within individual business units, products, services and transactions. We maintain a governance structure that delineates the  138    Table of Contents  responsibilities for risk management activities, as well as governance and oversight of those activities, by executive management and the Board. For a more detailed discussion of our risk management activities, see pages 44 through 87 of the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Strategic Risk Management  Strategic risk is embedded in every line of business and is one of the major risk categories along with credit, market, liquidity, compliance and operational risks. It is the risk that results from adverse business decisions, ineffective or inappropriate business plans, or failure to respond to changes in the competitive environment, business cycles, customer preferences, product obsolescence, regulatory environment, business strategy execution and resulting reputation risk. In the financial services industry, strategic risk is high due to changing customer, competitive and regulatory environments. The Corporation’s appetite for strategic risk is assessed within the context of the strategic plan, with strategic risks selectively and carefully taken to maintain relevance in the evolving marketplace. Strategic risk is managed in the context of our overall financial condition and assessed, managed and acted on by the Chief Executive Officer and executive management team. Significant strategic actions, such as material acquisitions or capital actions, are reviewed and approved by the Board.   For more information on our Strategic Risk Management activities, refer to page 47 of the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Liquidity Risk and Capital Management Funding and Liquidity Risk Management  We define liquidity risk as the potential inability to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations, on- or off-balance sheet, as they come due. Our primary liquidity objective is to ensure adequate funding for our businesses throughout market cycles, including periods of financial stress. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk, maintain excess liquidity and access diverse funding sources including our stable deposit base. We define excess liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our funding requirements as those obligations arise.   Global funding and liquidity risk management activities are centralized within Corporate Treasury. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity risk management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. For additional information regarding Funding and Liquidity Risk Management, see the discussion that follows and refer to page 47 of the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Global Excess Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets   We maintain excess liquidity available to the parent company, Bank of America Corporation, and selected subsidiaries in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that together serve as our primary means of liquidity risk mitigation. We call these assets our “Global Excess Liquidity Sources,” and we limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS and a select group of non-U.S. government securities. We believe we can quickly obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed market conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold these assets in entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities.   Our global excess liquidity sources increased $79 billion to $293 billion at June 30, 2010 compared to $214 billion at December 31, 2009 and were maintained as presented in the table below. This increase was due primarily to liquidity generated by our bank subsidiaries through loan repayments combined with lower loan demand and other factors.  Table 13 Global Excess Liquidity Sources                                June 30     December 31     (Dollars in billions)   2010     2009           Parent company   $ 96     $ 99     Bank subsidiaries     166       89     Broker/dealers     31       26         Total global excess liquidity sources   $ 293     $ 214           139    Table of Contents   As noted above, the excess liquidity available to the parent company is held in cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities and totaled $96 billion and $99 billion at June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009. Typically, parent company cash is deposited overnight with Bank of America, N.A.   Our bank subsidiaries’ excess liquidity sources at June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009 consisted of $166 billion and $89 billion in cash on deposit at the Federal Reserve and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. These amounts are distinct from the cash deposited by the parent company, as described above. In addition to their excess liquidity sources, our bank subsidiaries hold significant amounts of other unencumbered securities that we believe we could also use to generate liquidity, such as investment grade ABS and municipal bonds. Another way our bank subsidiaries can generate incremental liquidity is by pledging a range of other unencumbered loans and securities to certain Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically identified eligible assets was approximately $187 billion at both June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries may only be used to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries and may not be transferred to the parent company or other nonbank subsidiaries.   Our broker/dealer subsidiaries’ excess liquidity sources at June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009 consisted of $31 billion and $26 billion in cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Our broker/dealers also held significant amounts of other unencumbered securities we believe we could utilize to generate additional liquidity, including investment grade corporate bonds, ABS and equities. Liquidity held in a broker/dealer subsidiary may only be available to meet the liquidity requirements of that entity and may not be transferred to the parent company or other subsidiaries.  Time to Required Funding and Stress Modeling   We use a variety of metrics to determine the appropriate amounts of excess liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our bank and broker/dealer subsidiaries. The primary metric we use to evaluate the appropriate level of excess liquidity at the parent company is “Time to Required Funding.” This debt coverage measure indicates the number of months that the parent company can continue to meet its unsecured contractual obligations as they come due using only its Global Excess Liquidity Sources without issuing any new debt or accessing any additional liquidity sources. We define unsecured contractual obligations for purposes of this metric as senior or subordinated debt maturities issued or guaranteed by Bank of America Corporation or Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., including certain unsecured debt instruments, primarily structured notes, which we may be required to settle for cash prior to maturity. The Asset and Liability Market Risk Committee (ALMRC) has established a minimum target for “Time to Required Funding” of 21 months. “Time to Required Funding” was 22 months at June 30, 2010 compared to 25 months at December 31, 2009.   We also utilize liquidity stress models to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of excess liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our bank and broker/dealer subsidiaries. We use these models to analyze our potential contractual and contingent cash outflows and liquidity requirements under a range of scenarios with varying levels of severity and time horizons. These scenarios incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific events, including potential credit rating downgrades for the parent company and our subsidiaries. We consider and utilize scenarios based on historical experience, regulatory guidance, and both expected and unexpected future events.  Diversified Funding Sources   We fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits and secured and unsecured liabilities through a globally coordinated funding strategy. We diversify our funding globally across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor bases.   We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposit base which was $974 billion and $992 billion at June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009. Deposits are primarily generated by our Deposits, Global Commercial Banking and GWIM segments. These deposits are diversified by clients, product types and geography. Some of our domestic deposits are insured by the FDIC. We consider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of funding. We believe this deposit funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources.   We issue the majority of our unsecured debt at the parent company and Bank of America, N.A. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2010, the parent company issued $6.3 billion and $13.4 billion of long-term senior unsecured debt. During the first half of 2010, Bank of America N.A. issued $3.5 billion of long-term senior unsecured debt, all of which was issued in the first quarter of 2010.  140    Table of Contents   The primary benefits of our centralized funding strategy include greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations, time zone differences or other business considerations make parent company funding impractical, certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt.   We issue unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. While the cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or the Corporation, we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month or quarter.   At June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, our long-term debt was issued in the currencies presented in the following table.                          Table 14           Long-term Debt By Major Currency               June 30   December 31   (Dollars in millions)   2010   2009         U.S. Dollar   $  347,034     $  281,692     Euros     85,144       99,917     British Pound     19,255       16,460     Japanese Yen     18,238       19,903     Canadian Dollar     6,825       4,894     Australian Dollar     6,791       7,973     Swiss Franc     2,421       2,666     Other     4,375       5,016         Total long-term debt   $  490,083     $  438,521            At June 30, 2010, the above table includes $85.2 billion of primarily U.S. Dollar long-term debt issued by VIEs that were consolidated in accordance with new consolidation guidance effective January 1, 2010.   We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For further details on our ALM activities, refer to Interest Rate Risk Management for Nontrading Activities beginning on page 187.   We also diversify our funding sources by issuing various types of debt instruments including structured notes, which are debt obligations that pay investors with returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these notes with derivative positions and/or in the underlying instruments so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to immediately settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date. We had outstanding structured notes of $56 billion and $57 billion at June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009.   Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity, or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price.   For additional information on debt funding, see Note 13 – Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information regarding Funding and Liquidity Risk Management, refer to pages 47 through 49 of the MD&A of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Credit Ratings   Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly impacted by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions including over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. It is our objective to maintain high-quality credit ratings.   Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions subject to ongoing review by the ratings agencies and may change from time to time. The ratings agencies regularly evaluate us and our securities, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt  141    Table of Contents  and other securities, including asset securitizations. These evaluations are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. In light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the financial markets, there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings. During 2009, the ratings agencies took numerous actions to adjust our credit ratings and outlooks, many of which were negative. The ratings agencies have indicated that our credit ratings currently reflect their expectation that, if necessary, we would receive significant support from the U.S. government. In February 2010, a ratings agency affirmed our current credit ratings but revised the outlook to negative from stable based on its belief that it is less certain whether the U.S. government would be willing to provide extraordinary support. Also, on July 27, 2010, another ratings agency affirmed our current ratings but revised the outlook to negative from stable due to their expectation for lower levels of government support over time as a result of the passage of the Financial Reform Act. Other factors that influence our credit ratings include the ratings agencies’ assessment of the general operating environment, our relative positions in the markets in which we compete, reputation, liquidity position, the level and volatility of earnings, corporate governance and risk management policies, capital position, capital management practices and current or future regulatory and legislative initiatives.   The Financial Reform Act provides for sweeping financial regulatory reform and will alter the way in which the Corporation conducts certain businesses, restrict its ability to compete, increase costs and reduce revenues. The Financial Reform Act may have a significant and negative impact on the Corporation’s earnings through fee reductions, higher costs (both regulatory and implementation) and new restrictions, as well as reduce available capital and have a material adverse impact on certain assets and liabilities of the Corporation. A reduction in certain of our credit ratings or the ratings of certain asset-backed securitizations would likely have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, access to credit markets, the related cost of funds, our businesses and on certain trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where counterparty creditworthiness is critical. If Bank of America Corporation or Bank of America, N.A. commercial paper or short-term credit ratings were downgraded by one or more levels, our incremental cost of funds and potential lost funding would be material. For information regarding the additional collateral and termination payments that would be required in connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements as a result of a credit ratings downgrade, see Note 4 – Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.   The credit ratings of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. from the three major credit ratings agencies are the same as those of Bank of America Corporation. The major credit ratings agencies have indicated that the primary drivers of Merrill Lynch’s credit ratings are Bank of America’s credit ratings.  Regulatory Capital  To meet minimum, adequately capitalized regulatory requirements, an institution must maintain a Tier 1 capital ratio of four percent and a Total capital ratio of eight percent. A “well-capitalized” institution must generally maintain capital ratios 200 bps higher than the minimum guidelines. The risk-based capital rules have been further supplemented by a Tier 1 leverage ratio, defined as Tier 1 capital divided by quarterly average total assets, after certain adjustments. “Well-capitalized” bank holding companies must have a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of four percent. National banks must maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least five percent to be classified as “well-capitalized.” At June 30, 2010, the Corporation’s Tier 1 capital, Total capital and Tier 1 leverage ratios were 10.67 percent, 14.77 percent and 6.69 percent, respectively. This classifies the Corporation as “well-capitalized” for regulatory purposes, the highest classification.   Certain corporate-sponsored trust companies which issue trust preferred securities are not consolidated. In accordance with Federal Reserve guidance, the Federal Reserve currently allows the trust preferred securities to qualify as Tier 1 capital with revised quantitative limits that will be effective on March 31, 2011. As a result, we include trust preferred securities in Tier 1 capital. Current limits restrict core capital elements to 15 percent of total core capital elements for internationally active bank holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve revised the qualitative standards for capital instruments included in regulatory capital. Internationally active bank holding companies are those that have significant activities in non-U.S. markets with consolidated assets greater than $250 billion or on-balance sheet foreign exposure greater than $10 billion. At June 30, 2010, our restricted core capital elements comprised 11.6 percent of total core capital elements. We expect to remain fully compliant with the revised limits prior to the implementation date of March 31, 2011.   The Financial Reform Act includes a provision under which previously issued and outstanding trust preferred securities in the aggregate amount of $21.4 billion (approximately 140 bps of Tier 1 capital if enacted currently) at June 30, 2010, will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital effective January 1, 2013. However, the exclusion of trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital will be phased in “incrementally” over a three-year phase-in period. The treatment of trust preferred securities during the phase-in period remains unclear and is subject to future rulemaking.  142    Table of Contents   The Corporation calculates Tier 1 common capital as Tier 1 capital including any CES less preferred stock, qualifying trust preferred securities, hybrid securities and qualifying noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries. CES was included in Tier 1 common capital based upon applicable regulatory guidance and our expectation at December 31, 2009 that the underlying Common Equivalent Junior Preferred Stock Series S (Common Equivalent Stock) would convert into common stock following shareholder approval of additional authorized shares. Shareholders approved the increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock at a special meeting of stockholders held on February 23, 2010 and the Common Equivalent Stock converted to common stock on February 24, 2010. Tier 1 common capital decreased $678 million to $119.7 billion at June 30, 2010 compared to $120.4 billion at December 31, 2009. The Tier 1 common capital ratio increased 20 bps to 8.01 percent. The ratio increase was driven by the impact of a $47.5 billion decrease in risk-weighted assets. The $6.3 billion of net income and an $880 million reduction in goodwill and intangible regulatory capital deductions during the first half of 2010 were offset by the $6.2 billion charge, net-of-tax, for the cumulative effect of the adoption of the new consolidation guidance primarily related to the increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses and a $1.8 billion higher disallowed deferred tax asset resulting from the higher allowance for loan and lease losses.

Balance also includes 45 percent of the pre-tax net unrealized gains on AFS marketable equity securities.    Enterprise-wide Stress Testing  As a part of our core risk management practices, the Corporation conducts enterprise-wide stress tests on a periodic basis to better understand earnings, capital and liquidity sensitivities to certain economic and business scenarios, including economic conditions that are more severe than anticipated. These enterprise-wide stress tests provide an understanding of the potential impacts to our risk profile, capital and liquidity. Scenarios are selected by a group comprised of senior line of business, risk and finance executives. Impacts to each line of business from each scenario are then determined and analyzed, primarily leveraging the models and processes utilized in everyday management routines. Impacts are assessed along with potential mitigating actions that may be taken. Analysis from such stress scenarios is compiled for and reviewed through our Risk Oversight Committee (ROC), ALMRC and the Enterprise Risk Committee of the Board and serves to inform and be incorporated, along with other core business processes, into decision making by management and the Board. The Corporation continues to invest in and improve stress testing capabilities as a core business process.  Regulatory Capital Impact of Final Rule on Adopting New Consolidation Guidance  On January 21, 2010, the joint agencies issued a final rule regarding risk-based capital and the impact of new consolidation guidance issued by the FASB. The final rule allows for a phase-in period for a maximum of one year for the effect on risk-weighted assets and the regulatory limit on the inclusion of the allowance for loan and lease losses in Tier 2 capital related to the assets that are consolidated. The Corporation elected to forgo the phase-in period and consolidated the amounts for regulatory capital purposes as of January 1, 2010. The incremental impact to the Corporation on January 1, 2010, was an increase in assets of $100.4 billion and risk-weighted assets of $21.3 billion and a reduction in capital of $9.7 billion. The overall effect of the new consolidation guidance and the final rule was a decrease in Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 common ratios of 76 bps and 73 bps. For more information on the impact of the new consolidation guidance, refer to Note 8 – Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  144    Table of Contents  Basel Regulatory Capital Requirements  In June 2004, the Basel II Accord was published with the intent of more closely aligning regulatory capital requirements with underlying risks, similar to economic capital. While economic capital is measured to cover unexpected losses, the Corporation also manages regulatory capital to adhere to regulatory standards of capital adequacy.   The Basel II Final Rule (Basel II Rules), which was published on December 7, 2007, establishes requirements for the U.S. implementation and provides detailed capital requirements for credit and operational risk (Pillar 1), supervisory requirements (Pillar 2) and disclosure requirements (Pillar 3). We began Basel II parallel implementation on April 1, 2010.   Financial institutions are required to successfully complete a minimum parallel qualification period before receiving regulatory approval to report regulatory capital using the Basel II methodology. During the parallel period, the resulting capital calculations under both the current (Basel I) rules and the Basel II Rules will be reported to the financial institutions’ regulatory supervisors for at least four consecutive quarterly periods. Once the parallel period is successfully completed, the financial institutions will utilize Basel II as the methodology for calculating regulatory capital. A three-year transitional floor period will follow after which use of Basel I will be discontinued.   In July 2009, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Committee) released a consultative document entitled “Revisions to the Basel II Market Risk Framework” that would significantly increase the capital requirements for trading book activities if adopted as proposed. The proposal recommended implementation by December 31, 2010, but regulatory agencies are currently evaluating the proposed rulemaking and related impacts before establishing final rules. While the proposal originally recommended implementation by December 31, 2010, implementation is now targeted by December 31, 2011 but U.S. regulators have not yet issued implementing regulations. As a result, we cannot determine the final implementation date or capital impact of the rules.   In December 2009, the Committee issued a consultative document entitled “Strengthening the Resilience of the Banking Sector,” with additional guidance published in July 2010 describing pending changes to the December consultative document. The Committee expects to issue final rules by year-end 2010 and is calling for regulators to implement regulations by year-end 2012. If adopted as proposed, the rules could significantly increase capital requirements for the Corporation. The consultative document and the Financial Reform Act propose disqualification of trust preferred securities and other hybrid capital securities from Tier 1 capital treatment with the Financial Reform Act proposing a phase-in over 2013 to 2015. The consultative document also proposes the potential capital deduction of certain assets (deferred tax assets, MSRs, and investments in financial firms within prescribed limitations certain of which may be significant), increased capital for counterparty credit risk, and new minimum capital and buffer requirements. For additional information on our MSRs, refer to Note 16 – Mortgage Servicing Rights to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Note 22 – Mortgage Servicing Rights to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K. For additional information on deferred tax assets, refer to Note 19 – Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We continue to monitor the development and potential impact of these proposals, but it is too early in the rulemaking process to determine a final implementation date or capital or other impact to us.
