ITEM 1(A). RISK FACTORS In the second quarter of 2017, there were no significant new risk factors from those disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our 2016 Form 10-K. In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report, including the regulatory update information of Item 2 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, you should carefully consider the factors discussed under “Risk Factors” and the regulation discussion under “Business - Regulation” in our 2016 Form 10-K. These risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The risks and uncertainties in our 2016 Form 10-K are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. ITEM 2.
