These actions included the potential repurchase of up to $250 million shares of common stock, through the first quarter of 2015. Huntington's Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program consistent with Huntington’s capital plan. During the 2014 second quarter, Huntington repurchased a total of 12.1 million shares at a weighted average share price of $9.17.  On April 29, 2014, Huntington repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares of common stock from a third party under an accelerated share repurchase program. The accelerated share repurchase program enabled Huntington to purchase 1.9 million shares immediately, while the third party may purchase shares in the market up through June 24, 2014 (the Repurchase Term). In connection with the repurchase of these shares, Huntington entered into a variable share forward sale agreement, which provides for a settlement, reflecting a price differential based on the adjusted volume-weighted average price as defined in the agreement with the third party. The variable share forward agreement was settled in shares, resulting in approximately 0.3 million shares being delivered to Huntington on June 27, 2014. Based on the adjusted volume-weighted average prices through June 24, 2014, the settlement of the variable share forward agreement did not have a material impact to Huntington.  Item 5. Other Information  On July 30, 2014, Huntington commenced organizational actions to reduce noninterest expense and improve productivity. The organizational actions are expected to be substantially complete by the end of August 2014. The resulting estimated annualized expense savings of $30 to $35 million will be achieved primarily through reductions in personnel expense by improving productivity in functions that are not directly focused on revenue generation. Huntington will continue to invest in initiatives to grow revenue and improve productivity. Accordingly, some portion of the expense saves resulting from the organizational actions will be reinvested to help achieve our long-term strategic objectives. As a result of the organizational actions, Huntington expects to recognize approximately $15 to $20 million in restructuring charges during the 2014 third quarter and $3 to $5 million during the 2014 fourth quarter.
