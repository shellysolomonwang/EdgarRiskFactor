On March 11, 2015, Huntington Bancshares Incorporated was notified by the Federal Reserve that it had no objection to Huntington’s proposed capital actions included in Huntington’s capital plan submitted to the Federal Reserve in January 2015. These actions included the potential repurchase of up to $366 million of common stock from the second quarter of 2015, through the second quarter of 2016. Huntington’s board of directors authorized a share repurchase program consistent with Huntington’s capital plan. During the 2015 first quarter, Huntington repurchased a total of 4.9 million shares at a weighted average share price of $10.45, which completed our previous authorization.  Item 6. Exhibits
