Item 1A.Risk Factors.With the exception of the following additions or updates to the list of current and proposed legal or regulatory requirements discussed in Item 1A of our Form 10-K Annual Report for 2015 there have been no material changes in the risk factors previously provided. During the first quarter of 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor finalized changes to definitions and rules related to fiduciaries. These changes will require modifications to our distribution activities and may impact our ability to service clients in the manner we service them today or engage in certain types of distribution activities. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is considering its own fiduciary rule proposal. Any such rule may also have an impact on our business activities.As previously noted, we cannot predict the nature of future changes to the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our business, nor the extent of the impacts that will result from current or future proposals. However, any such changes are likely to increase the costs of compliance and the complexity of our operations. They may also result in changes to our product or service offerings. The changing regulatory landscape may also impact a number of our service providers and to the extent such providers alter their services or increase their fees it may impact our expenses or those of the products we offer.Item 2.Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
