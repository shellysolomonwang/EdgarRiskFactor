Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Report and in “Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K (“2013 Form 10-K”). Unless otherwise specified, references to notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2014 included in this Report.      Management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial condition. The following MD&A is intended to provide the reader with an understanding of our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity by focusing on changes from year to year in certain key measures used by management to evaluate performance, such as profitability, growth and credit quality metrics. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes in this Report and the more detailed information contained in our 2013 Form 10-K.               1   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents    SUMMARY OF SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA    The following table presents selected consolidated financial data from our results of operations for the second quarter and first six months of 2014 and 2013, and selected comparative balance sheet data as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013. We also provide selected key metrics we use in evaluating our performance. Certain prior period amounts have been recast to conform to the current period presentation. The comparability of our results of operations between reported periods is impacted by the following transactions completed in 2013:      •    On November 1, 2013, we completed the acquisition of Beech Street Capital, a privately-held, national originator and servicer of Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) and Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”) multifamily commercial real estate loans.      •    On September 6, 2013, we completed the sale of the Best Buy private label and co-branded credit card portfolio to Citibank, N.A (“Portfolio Sale”). Pursuant to the agreement we received $6.4 billion for the net portfolio assets.  In 2012, we completed the acquisitions of (i) substantially all of the assets and assumed liabilities of HSBC’s credit card and private-label credit card business in the United States (other than the HSBC Bank USA, National Association consumer credit card program and certain other retained assets and liabilities) (the “2012 U.S. card acquisition”); and (ii) substantially all of the ING Direct business in the United States (“ING Direct”) from ING Groep N.V., ING Bank N.V., ING Direct N.V. and ING Direct Bancorp (the “ING Direct acquisition”).  We use the term “Acquired Loans” to refer to a limited portion of the credit card loans acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition and the substantial majority of consumer and commercial loans acquired in the ING Direct and Chevy Chase Bank, F.S.B. (“CCB”) acquisitions, which were recorded at fair value at acquisition and subsequently accounted for based on expected cash flows to be collected (under the accounting standard formerly known as “Statement of Position 03-3, Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer,” commonly referred to as “SOP 03-3”). The difference between the fair value at acquisition and expected cash flows represents the accretable yield, which is recognized in interest income over the life of the loans. The difference between the contractual payments on the loans and expected cash flows represents the nonaccretable difference or the amount of principal and interest not considered collectible, which incorporates future expected credit losses over the life of the loans. Decreases in expected cash flows resulting from further credit deterioration will generally result in an impairment charge recognized in our provision for credit losses and an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses. Charge-offs are not recorded until the expected credit losses within the nonaccretable difference is depleted. In addition, Acquired Loans are not initially classified as delinquent or nonperforming as we expect to collect our net investment in these loans and the nonaccretable difference is expected to absorb the majority of the losses associated with these loans. The accounting and classification of these loans may significantly alter some of our reported credit quality metrics. We therefore supplement certain reported credit quality metrics with metrics adjusted to exclude the impact of these Acquired Loans. The period-end carrying value of Acquired Loans accounted for subsequent to acquisition based on expected cash flows to be collected was $26.0 billion and $28.6 billion as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.

During this change, we determined that we had previously understated the total number of full-time equivalent employees by approximately 7%.       INTRODUCTION    General  We are a diversified financial services holding company with banking and non-banking subsidiaries. Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through branches, the internet and other distribution channels.

The Company is hereafter collectively referred to as “we,” “us” or “our.” COBNA and CONA are collectively referred to as the “Banks.” Certain business terms used in this document are defined in the “Glossary and Acronyms” section and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.  We had total loans held for investment of $198.5 billion, deposits of $205.9 billion and stockholders’ equity of $43.8 billion as of June 30, 2014, compared with total loans held for investment of $197.2 billion, deposits of $204.5 billion and stockholders’ equity of $41.6 billion as of December 31, 2013.  Our consolidated total net revenues are derived primarily from lending to consumer and commercial customers net of funding costs associated with interest on customer deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. We also earn non-interest income which primarily consists of interchange income net of reward expenses, service charges and other customer-related fees. Our expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating expenses (including salaries and associate benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, professional services, communication and data processing expenses and other miscellaneous expenses), marketing expenses and income taxes.  Our principal operations are currently organized for management reporting purposes into three primary business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group, are included in the Other category.        •    Credit Card: Consists of our domestic consumer and small business card lending, national closed-end installment lending and the international card lending businesses in Canada and the United Kingdom.               5   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents     •    Consumer Banking: Consists of our branch-based lending and deposit gathering activities for consumers and small businesses, national deposit gathering, national auto lending and consumer home loans lending and servicing activities.        •    Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending, deposit gathering and treasury management services to commercial real estate and commercial and industrial customers. Our commercial and industrial customers typically include companies with annual revenues between $10 million and $1 billion.  Table 2 summarizes our business segment results, which we report based on income from continuing operations, net of tax, for the second quarter and first six months of 2014 and 2013. We provide information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in “Note 19—Business Segments” in our 2013 Form 10-K. We also provide a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our results based on the accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”) results in “Note 13—Business Segments” of this Report.

See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for additional information. Prior periods have been recast to conform to this presentation.      (2)   Total net revenue consists of net interest income and non-interest income.

In comparison, we reported net income of $1.1 billion ($1.85 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $5.6 billion and net income of $2.2 billion ($3.62 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $11.2 billion for the second quarter and first six months of 2013, respectively.  Beginning on January 1, 2014, we calculate our regulatory capital under the Basel III Standardized Approach subject to transition provisions. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, as calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach including transition provisions, was 12.72% as of June 30, 2014. Our Tier 1 common ratio, as calculated under Basel I, was 12.19% as of December 31, 2013. These numbers are not directly comparable due to methodological differences in the calculation of the ratios.  On March 26, 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of shares of our common stock (“2014 Stock Repurchase Program”). Through the end of the second quarter of 2014, we have repurchased approximately $1 billion of common stock and expect to complete the 2014 Stock Repurchase Program by the first quarter of 2015. See “Capital Management” below for additional information.  Below are additional highlights of our performance in the second quarter and first six months of 2014. These highlights generally are based on a comparison between the results of the second quarter and first six months of 2014 and 2013, except as otherwise noted. The changes in our financial condition and credit performance are generally based on our financial condition and credit performance as of June 30, 2014, compared with our financial condition and credit performance as of December 31, 2013. We provide a more detailed discussion of our financial performance in the sections following this “Executive Summary and Business Outlook.”  Total Company      •    Earnings: Our net income increased by $86 million in the second quarter of 2014, or 8%, to $1.2 billion compared to $1.1 billion in the second quarter of 2013, and our net income increased by $184 million in the first six months of 2014, or 9%, to $2.3 billion, compared to $2.2 billion for the first six months of 2013. Significant drivers of the increase in earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2014 were a decrease in the provision for credit losses due to lower charge-offs; and a pre-tax benefit for mortgage representation and warranty losses of $18 million and $51 million for the second quarter and first six months of 2014, respectively, compared to a pre-tax provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses of $183 million and $280 million for the second quarter and first six months of 2013 respectively. These items were partially offset by a decrease in net interest income attributable to lower average interest-earning assets and lower yields in the Credit Card business.      •    Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment increased by $1.3 billion, or 1%, in the first six months of 2014, to $198.5 billion as of June 30, 2014, from $197.2 billion as of December 31, 2013. The increase was due to commercial and industrial and commercial and multifamily real estate loan growth in our Commercial Banking business, and continued strong auto loan originations outpacing the run-off of the acquired home loans portfolio in our Consumer Banking business. Overall, there was a decline in our credit card loan portfolio primarily due to seasonality in the first quarter, partially offset by loan growth in the second quarter in our Credit Card business.      •    Charge-off and Delinquency Statistics: Our net charge-off rate decreased by 36 basis points to 1.67% in the second quarter of 2014, compared to 2.03% in the second quarter of 2013, and our net charge-off rate decreased by 33 basis points in the first six months of 2014, to 1.79%, compared to 2.12% for the first six months of 2013. The decrease in our reported net charge-offs and net charge-off rates were largely due to the improvement in delinquencies and run-off of portfolios with higher credit risk. Our reported 30+ day               7   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents       delinquency rate declined to 2.53% as of June 30, 2014, from 2.96% as of December 31, 2013, and 2.71% as of June 30, 2013. The decrease from year end was primarily due to seasonality and strong credit performance. We provide additional information on our credit quality metrics below under “Business Segment Financial Performance” and “Credit Risk Profile.”      •    Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses: We reduced our allowance for loan and lease losses by $317 million to $4.0 billion as of June 30, 2014, from $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2013. The decrease in the allowance for loan and lease losses was mainly due to improvements in delinquency inventories coupled with an improved credit outlook. The allowance coverage ratio declined to 2.01% as of June 30, 2014, from 2.19% as of December 31, 2013.      •    Representation and Warranty Reserve: The representation and warranty reserve decreased by $160 million to $1.0 billion as of June 30, 2014, from $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2013. We recorded a benefit for mortgage representation and warranty losses of $51 million (which includes benefits of $36 million and $15 million in discontinued operations and continuing operations, respectively) in the first six months of 2014. The decrease in representation and warranty reserve was primarily driven by legal developments.  Business Segment Financial Performance      •    Credit Card: Our Credit Card business generated net income from continuing operations of $668 million and $1.3 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2014, respectively, compared with net income from continuing operations of $719 million and $1.4 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2013, respectively. The decreases in net income for these periods were driven by a decrease in net interest income primarily due to the Portfolio Sale in the third quarter of 2013 and the run-off of certain credit card loans acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition, partially offset by (i) a reduction in the provision for credit losses as a result of lower charge-offs on the underlying loan portfolio; (ii) lower acquisition-related costs; and (iii) lower operating expenses attributable to the Portfolio Sale and operating efficiency. Period-end loans held for investment in our Credit Card business decreased by $2.3 billion to $79.0 billion as of June 30, 2014 from $81.3 billion as of December 31, 2013. The decrease was largely due to seasonal decreases in the first quarter of 2014 partially offset by growth in the second quarter of 2014.      •    Consumer Banking: Our Consumer Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $334 million and $664 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2014, respectively, compared with net income from continuing operations of $444 million and $827 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2013, respectively. The decreases in net income in these periods were primarily attributable to a higher provision for loan and lease losses, net interest margin compression in both retail banking and the auto loans portfolio, partially offset by growth in the auto loans portfolio. Period-end loans held for investment in our Consumer Banking business increased by $300 million to $71.1 billion as of June 30, 2014, from $70.8 billion as of December 31, 2013, due to growth in our auto loans portfolio outpacing the run-off in our home loans portfolio.      •    Commercial Banking: Our Commercial Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $171 million and $308 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2014, respectively, compared with net income from continuing operations of $181 million and $374 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2013, respectively. The decreases in net income for these periods were primarily due to a higher provision for credit losses, reflecting a lower allowance release. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $12 million and $52 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2014, respectively, compared to a benefit of $14 million and $49 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2013, respectively. Higher revenue due to growth in commercial loans was offset by rate spread compression and increased operating expenses associated with continued investments in business growth and the Beech Street Capital acquisition. Period-end loans held for investment in our Commercial Banking business increased by $3.3 billion to $48.3 billion as of June 30, 2014, from $45.0 billion as of December 31, 2013. The increase was driven by strong loan originations in the commercial and industrial and commercial and multifamily real estate businesses.               8   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents Business Outlook  We discuss below our current expectations regarding our total company performance and the performance of each of our business segments over the near-term based on market conditions, the regulatory environment and our business strategies as of the time we filed this Report. The statements contained in this section are based on our current expectations regarding our outlook for our financial results and business strategies. Our expectations take into account, and should be read in conjunction with, our expectations regarding economic trends and analysis of our business as discussed in “Part I—Item 1. Business” and “Part I—Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2013 Form 10-K. Certain statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise disclosed, forward-looking statements do not reflect: (i) any change in current dividend or repurchase strategies; (ii) the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures or similar transactions that have not been previously disclosed; or (iii) any changes in laws, regulations or regulatory interpretations, in each case after the date as of which such statements are made. See “Forward-Looking Statements” in this Report for more information on forward-looking statements included in this Report and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2013 Form 10-K for factors that could materially influence our results.  Total Company Expectations  We continue to expect 2014 pre-provision earnings, excluding non-recurring items, of approximately $10 billion. In addition, we expect modest changes in the components of pre-provision earnings with higher revenue offsetting higher expenses relative to our initial expectations for 2014. We expect an increase in marketing in the second half of 2014, driven by both expected seasonal trends and because of the success and continuing opportunities we see to grow customer relationships, purchase volume, and loans. Although we had a release of allowance in the second quarter, we believe that we are less likely to see allowance releases going forward as we return to growth and considering charge-offs are below historical averages. Actual results are expected to vary from these expectations within a reasonable margin of error.  We expect that pre-provision earnings will rise in 2015, with growth in average loans driving increased revenues, partially offset by higher non-interest expense, as we continue to invest to sustain growth and returns. Although it will vary from quarter to quarter, we expect the full-year 2015 efficiency ratio to be between 53% and 54%, excluding non-recurring items.  We believe our actions have created a balance sheet with strong capital and liquidity. The Federal Reserve did not object to our capital plan submitted in the 2014 CCAR cycle. Pursuant to the capital plan, we expect to maintain our quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, subject to approval by the Board of Directors. In addition, the Board of Directors authorized the establishment of a share repurchase program to repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of shares of our common stock through the end of the first quarter of 2015. Under this program, we repurchased approximately $1 billion of our shares in the second quarter, and we expect to repurchase an additional $1.5 billion over the next three quarters.  The timing and exact amount of any common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including market conditions, our capital position and amount of retained earnings. Our 2014 Stock Repurchase Program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time. See “MD&A—Capital Management—Capital Planning and Regulatory Stress Testing” for more information.  Business Segment Expectations  Credit Card: We returned to year-over-year growth in the Domestic Card portfolio in the second quarter. Our estimate of the run-off of acquired card loans is now substantially less than $1 billion for 2014 and we no longer               9   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents  expect it to be a significant offset to growth. Overall, we believe that our Domestic Card portfolio continues to be well-positioned and will continue to deliver strong, sustainable and resilient returns and generate capital on a strong trajectory.  Consumer Banking: In our Consumer Banking business, we expect auto credit losses will gradually increase from the historic lows of the past few years and that auto margins and returns will continue to decline, but remain within ranges that support an attractive business. We expect home loans run-off of approximately $6 billion in 2014 based on our current view of interest rates. In addition, we expect the impacts of the prolonged low interest rate environment to continue to pressure the economics of our retail banking deposit businesses, even if rates rise in 2014.  Commercial Banking: In our Commercial Banking business, charge-offs, non-performing loans and criticized loans are at exceptionally low levels and we expect strong credit performance to continue in 2014. As competition continues to increase, it is likely that the pace of the growth in our Commercial Banking business will moderate over time. We continue to expect our focused and specialized approach to deliver strong results in 2014.       CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES    The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses in the consolidated financial statements. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We provide a summary of our significant accounting policies under “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2013 Form 10-K.  We have identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition. These critical accounting policies govern:      •    Loan loss reserves      •    Asset impairment      •    Fair value of financial instruments      •    Representation and warranty reserves      •    Customer rewards reserves  We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them, as necessary, based on changing conditions. Management has discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.  We provide additional information on our critical accounting policies and estimates under “MD&A—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our 2013 Form 10-K.               10   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents    ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTS    Accounting for Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects  In January 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance permitting an entity to account for Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects using the proportional amortization method, if certain criteria are met. The proportional method amortizes the cost of the investment over the period in which the investor expects to receive tax credits and other tax benefits, and the resulting amortization is recognized as a component of income taxes attributable to continuing operations. Historically, these investments were under the equity method of accounting and the passive losses related to the investments were recognized within non-interest expense. Prior period results and related metrics have been recast. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for more information.       CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    The section below provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated financial performance for the second quarter and first six months of 2014 and 2013. Following this section, we provide a discussion of our business segment results. You should read this section together with our “Executive Summary and Business Outlook,” where we discuss trends and other factors that we expect will affect our future results of operations.  Net Interest Income  Net interest income represents the difference between the interest income and applicable fees earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense on our interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations and other borrowings. We include in interest income any past due fees on loans that we deem collectible. Our net interest margin based on our consolidated results represents the difference between the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, including the notional impact of non-interest bearing funding. We expect net interest income and our net interest margin to fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  Table 3 below presents, for each major category of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the average outstanding balances, interest income earned, interest expense incurred, average yield and rate for the second quarter and first six months of 2014 and 2013.               11   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents Table 3: Average Balances, Net

qualified affordable housing projects. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for additional information. Prior periods have been recast to conform to this presentation.               13   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents     (2)   Past due fees included in interest income totaled approximately $336 million and $695 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2014, respectively, and $464 million and $944 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2013, respectively.        (3)   Interest income and interest expense and the calculation of average yields on interest-earning assets and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities include the impact of hedge accounting.  Net interest income decreased by $238 million, or 5%, from the second quarter of 2013 to $4.3 billion in the second quarter of 2014 primarily driven by a decrease in average interest-earning assets in our Credit Card business, partially offset by lower funding costs. Net interest income of $8.7 billion in the first six months of 2014, decreased by $458 million, or 5%, from the first six months of 2013, primarily driven by a decrease in average interest-earning assets, partially offset by lower funding costs and higher yields in investment securities.      •    Average Interest-Earning Assets: The decrease in average interest-earning assets in the second quarter of 2014, compared to the second quarter of 2013, and in the first six months of 2014, compared to the first six months of 2013, was primarily driven by the Portfolio Sale in the third quarter of 2013, the run-off in our acquired home loans portfolio within our Consumer Banking business, and the run-off of certain receivables acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition, partially offset by continued strong growth in commercial and auto loans. The decrease in average investment securities was due to sales and paydowns outpacing purchases.      •    Net Interest Margin: The decrease in our net interest margin in the second quarter of 2014, compared to the second quarter of 2013, and in the first six months of 2014, compared to the first six months of 2013, was primarily due to lower yields on our credit card and commercial loan portfolios, partially offset by a reduction in our cost of funds and higher yields in our investment securities.  Table 4 displays the change in our net interest income between periods and the extent to which the variance is attributable to: (i) changes in the volume of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; or (ii) changes in the interest rates related to these assets and liabilities.

The portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate is allocated proportionately when the calculation results in a positive value. When the portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate results in a negative value, the total amount is allocated to volume or rate, depending on which amount is positive.  Non-Interest Income  Non-interest income primarily consists of interchange income net of rewards expense, service charges and other customer-related fees, and other non-interest income. Other non-interest income includes the pre-tax provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses related to continuing operations. It also includes gains and losses from the sale of investment securities, gains and losses on derivatives not accounted for in hedge accounting relationships, as well as hedge ineffectiveness.  Table 5 displays the components of non-interest income for the second quarter and first six months of 2014 and 2013.

For the total impact to the provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses, including the portion recognized on our consolidated statements of income as a component of discontinued operations, see “MD&A—Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis—Table 14: Changes in Representation and Warranty Reserve.”        (2)   Excludes changes in cumulative credit risk valuation adjustments related to derivatives in a gain position. Credit risk valuation adjustments for derivative assets totaled $5 million and $7 million as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. See “Note 9—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” for additional information.  Non-interest income increased by $68 million, or 6%, to $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2014, from $1.1 billion in second quarter of 2013. Non-interest income increased by $107 million, or 5%, to $2.2 billion in the first six months of 2014, from $2.1 billion in the first six months of 2013. The main drivers for the increases in non-interest income were (i) an increase in interchange fees, net due to strong purchase volume in our credit card loan portfolio; and (ii) an increase in the benefit for mortgage representation and warranty losses resulting from legal developments. These were partially offset by a decrease in service charges and other customer-related fees in our Credit Card business reflecting our strategic choice to discontinue certain card-related fees.               15   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents Provision for Credit Losses  Our provision for credit losses in each period is driven by charge-offs, changes to the allowance for loan and lease losses and changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $704 million and $1.4 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2014, respectively, compared with $762 million and $1.6 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2013, respectively.  The decreases in the provision for credit losses of $58 million and $208 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2014, respectively, were driven by lower charge-offs partially offset by a lower release of the allowance for loan and lease losses. The decrease in our reported net charge-offs was largely due to credit improvement of the underlying portfolio. The decrease in our allowance for loan and lease losses was attributable to an overall improved credit outlook coupled with improvements in delinquency inventories.  We provide additional information on the provision for credit losses and changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses within “Credit Risk Profile—Summary of Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses,” “Note 4—Loans” and “Note 5—Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.” For information on the allowance methodology for each of our loan categories, see “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2013 Form 10-K.  Non-Interest Expense  Non-interest expense consists of ongoing operating costs, such as salaries and associate benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, professional services, communications and data processing expenses and other miscellaneous expenses, as well as marketing costs, merger-related expenses and amortization of intangibles. Table 6 displays the components of non-interest expense for the second quarter and first six months of 2014 and 2013.

See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for additional information. Prior periods have been recast to conform to this presentation.      (2)   Includes acquisition-related costs of $18 million and $41 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2014, respectively as compared with $50 million and $96 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2013, respectively. These amounts are comprised of transaction costs, legal and other professional or consulting fees, restructuring costs, and integration expense.               16   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents Non-interest expense decreased by $39 million, or 1%, to $3.0 billion in the second quarter of 2014, from $3.0 billion in the second quarter of 2013. Non-interest expense decreased by $98 million, or 2%, to $5.9 billion in the first six months of 2014, from $6.0 billion in the first six months of 2013. The decrease reflects a reduction in acquisition-related costs and a decline in amortization of intangibles. These were partially offset by (i) higher operating expenses attributable to growth in our auto loans portfolio; (ii) the change to include auto repossession-related expenses as a component of operating expenses (prior to January 1, 2014 these costs were reported as a component of net charge-offs); and (iii) higher operating expenses attributable to growth in our Commercial Banking business, partially offset by lower bankcard, regulatory and other fee assessments and communication and data processing expenses.  Income Taxes  We recorded income tax provisions of $581 million (32.5% effective income tax rate) and $1.2 billion (33.3% effective income tax rate) in the second quarter and first six months of 2014, respectively, compared to income tax provisions of $631 million (34.0% effective income tax rate) and $1.2 billion (33.2% effective income tax rate) in the second quarter and first six months of 2013, respectively. The decrease in our effective income tax rate in the second quarter of 2014 from the second quarter of 2013, was primarily attributable to increased tax credits and tax exempt income, as well as a reduction in unfavorable net discrete tax expense. The slight increase in our effective income tax rate in the first six months of 2014 from the first six months of 2013 was primarily attributable to increased discrete tax expense in the first six months of 2014 over the first six months of 2013, partially offset by increased tax credits and tax exempt income. Our effective income tax rate, excluding the impact of discrete tax items discussed above, was 32.5% in both the second quarter and first six months of 2014, and 33.5%, and 33.1% in the second quarter and first six months of 2013, respectively.  We provide additional information on items affecting our income taxes and effective tax rate in our 2013 Form 10-K in “Note 17—Income Taxes.”  Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax  Income (loss) from discontinued operations reflects ongoing costs, which primarily consist of mortgage loan repurchase representation and warranty charges, related to the mortgage origination operations of GreenPoint’s wholesale mortgage banking unit that we closed in 2007. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $10 million and income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $20 million as of the second quarter and first six months of 2014, respectively, compared to losses of $119 million and $197 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2013, respectively. The pre-tax portion of the provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses recognized on our consolidated statements of income as a component of discontinued operations was a provision of $11 million ($7 million net of tax) and a benefit of $36 million ($23 million net of tax) in the second quarter and first six months of 2014, respectively, and provisions of $187 million ($117 million net of tax) and $294 million ($184 million net of tax) in the second quarter and first six months of 2013, respectively.  We provide additional information on the provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses and the related reserve for potential representation and warranty claims in “Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis—Potential Mortgage Representation and Warranty Liabilities” and “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees, and Others.”               17   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents    BUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE    Our principal operations are currently organized into three major business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group, are included in the “Other” category.  The results of our individual businesses, which we report on a continuing operations basis, reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. We provide additional information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in “Note 19—Business Segments” in our 2013 Form 10-K.  We refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our “managed” presentation, which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on U.S. GAAP. There is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to U.S. GAAP; therefore, the managed presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial service companies. In addition, our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Below we summarize our business segment results for the second quarter and first six months of 2014 and 2013 and provide a comparative discussion of these results. We also discuss changes in our financial condition and credit performance statistics as of June 30, 2014, compared with December 31, 2013. We provide a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated results in “Note 13—Business Segments.” Additionally, we provide information on the outlook for each of our business segments as described above under “Executive Summary and Business Outlook.”  Credit Card Business  The primary sources of revenue for our Credit Card business are interest income, fees collected from customers and interchange fees. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs such as salaries and associate benefits, occupancy and equipment, professional services, communications and data processing expenses and marketing expenses. Rewards costs are generally netted against interchange fees.  Our Credit Card business generated net income from continuing operations of $668 million and $1.3 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2014, respectively, compared with net income from continuing operations of $719 million and $1.4 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2013, respectively.

The estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees is reflected as a reduction in revenue and is not included in our net charge-offs. Total net revenue was reduced by $153 million and $316 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2014, respectively, and by $192 million and $457 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2013, respectively, for the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees. The finance charge and fee reserve totaled $182 million and $190 million as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.        (2)   Period-end loans held for investment and average loans held for investment include accrued finance charges and fees, net of the estimated uncollectible amount.        (3)   Calculated by dividing annualized interest income for the period by average loans held for investment during the period for the specified loan category. Annualized interest income also includes interest income on loans held for sale. The transfer of the Best Buy loan portfolio from loans held for investment to loans held for sale resulted in an increase in the average yield for the total Credit Card business of 152 and 124 basis points in the second quarter and first six months of 2013, respectively.        (4)   Calculated by dividing annualized total net revenue for the period by average loans held for investment during the period for the specified loan category. Annualized interest income also includes interest income on loans held for sale. The transfer of the Best Buy loan portfolio from loans held for investment to loans held for sale resulted in an increase in the net revenue margin for the total Credit Card business of 169 and 139 basis points in the second quarter and first six months of 2013, respectively.        (5)   Represents the net reduction in interest income attributable to the amortization of premiums on purchased loans accounted for based on contractual cash flows and the accretion of other intangibles associated with the 2012 U.S. card acquisition.               19   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents     (6)   Consists of credit card purchase transactions, net of returns for the period for both loans classified as held for investment and loans classified as held for sale. Excludes cash advance and balance transfer transactions.        (7)   Calculated by dividing the allowance for loan and lease losses as of the end of the period by period-end loans held for investment.  Key factors affecting the results of our Credit Card business for the second quarter and first six months of 2014, compared with the second quarter and first six months of 2013, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 include the following:      •    Net Interest Income: Net interest income decreased by $343 million, or 12%, in the second quarter of 2014 from the second quarter of 2013, to $2.5 billion, and by $648 million, or 12%, in the first six months of 2014 from the first six months of 2013, to $5.0 billion. The decrease in net interest income was primarily driven by the Portfolio Sale in the third quarter of 2013 and the run-off of certain credit card loans acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition.      •    Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income increased by $7 million, or 1%, in the second quarter of 2014 from the second quarter of 2013, to $839 million, and decreased by $29 million, or 2%, in the first six months of 2014 from the first six months of 2013, to $1.6 billion. The decrease in the first six months of 2014 compared to the first six months of 2013 was largely due to a reduction in customer fees, partially offset by increased interchange fees, net driven by higher purchase volume.      •    Provision for Credit Losses: The provision for credit losses decreased by $164 million, or 23%, in the second quarter of 2014 from the second quarter of 2013, to $549 million, and by $349 million, or 24%, in the first six months of 2014 from the first six months of 2013, to $1.1 billion. The decrease was driven by lower charge-offs in the second quarter and first six months of 2014 attributable to lower delinquencies in the underlying loan portfolio.      •    Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense decreased by $100 million, or 5%, in the second quarter of 2014 from the second quarter of 2013, to $1.7 billion, and by $222 million, or 6%, in the first six months of 2014 from the first six months of 2013, to $3.4 billion. The decrease was largely due to lower acquisition-related costs and operating expenses associated with the Portfolio Sale in the third quarter of 2013, as well as operating efficiencies. Non-interest expense also included PCCR intangible amortization of $192 million in the first six months of 2014, compared with $226 million in the first six months of 2013.      •    Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment decreased by $2.3 billion, or 3%, to $79.0 billion as of June 30, 2014, from $81.3 billion as of December 31, 2013. The decrease was largely due to expected seasonal decreases in the first quarter 2014 and the run-off of certain credit card loans acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition, partially offset by growth in the credit card loan portfolio in the second quarter of 2014.      •    Charge-off and Delinquency Statistics: Our reported net charge-off rate decreased to 3.56% and 3.79% in the second quarter and first six months of 2014, respectively, from 4.36% and 4.41% in the second quarter and first six months of 2013, respectively. The decrease was largely due to continued economic improvement and portfolio seasoning. The 30+ day delinquency rate decreased to 2.97% as of June 30, 2014, from 3.54% as of December 31, 2013 primarily due to seasonality and strong credit performance.  Domestic Card Business  Domestic Card generated net income from continuing operations of $607 million and $1.2 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2014, respectively, compared with net income from continuing operations of $638 million and $1.3 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2013, respectively. Domestic Card accounted for 90% of total net revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2014 and 2013, for our Credit Card business.               20   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents Table 7.1 summarizes the financial results for Domestic Card and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.

(3)   Calculated by dividing annualized total net revenue for the period by average loans held for investment during the period. Annualized interest income includes interest income on loans held for sale. The transfer of the Best Buy loan portfolio from loans held for investment to loans held for sale resulted in an increase in the net revenue margin for the Domestic Card business of 188 and 154 basis points in the second quarter and first six months of 2013, respectively.

The primary drivers of the decline in net income for our Domestic Card business in the second quarter and first six months of 2014, compared with the second quarter and first six months of 2013, were declines in revenue primarily driven by the Portfolio Sale in the third quarter of 2013 and the run-off of certain credit card loans acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition, partially offset by a lower provision for credit losses, lower acquisition-related costs, as well as lower operating expenses attributable to the Portfolio Sale in 2013 and operating efficiencies.  The decrease in period-end loans held for investment was due to the expected seasonal decreases in the first quarter of 2014 and the run-off of certain credit card loans acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition, partially offset by the growth in the credit card loan portfolio in the second quarter of 2014.  International Card Business  International Card generated net income from continuing operations of $61 million and $134 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2014, respectively, compared with net income from continuing operations of $81 million and $123 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2013, respectively. International Card accounted for 10% of total net revenues in the second quarter and first six months of 2014 and 2013, for our Credit Card business.

The decrease in net income in the second quarter of 2014 compared to the second quarter of 2013 was primarily due to a build of $37 million in our U.K. cross sell reserves in the second quarter of 2014 related to the number of customer claims declining at a slower pace than we previously expected. The cross sell provision is split evenly and recorded in revenue and in non-interest expense.               23   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents The increase in net income in the first six months of 2014 compared to the first six months of 2013 was primarily due to a reduction in the provision for credit losses attributable to lower net charge-offs, reflecting the improvement in the credit environment in Canada and the U.K. These were partially offset by the U.K. cross sell reserve build.  Consumer Banking Business  The primary sources of revenue for our Consumer Banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits and non-interest income from customer fees. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, ongoing operating costs, such as salaries and associate benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, professional services, communications and data processing expenses, as well as marketing expenses.  Our Consumer Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $334 million and $664 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2014, respectively, compared with net income from continuing operations of $444 million and $827 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2013, respectively.

The average balance of Consumer Banking loans held for investment, excluding Acquired Loans, was $44.7 billion and $40.2 billion in the second quarter of 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $43.9 billion and $39.7 billion in the first six months of 2014 and 2013, respectively.

See “Credit Risk Profile” and “Note 4—Loans” for additional information on the impact of Acquired Loans on our credit quality metrics.      (4)   Calculated by dividing nonperforming assets as of the end of the period by the sum of period-end loans held for investment, foreclosed properties, and other foreclosed assets.      (5)   Calculated by dividing the allowance for loan and lease losses as of the end of the period by period-end loans held for investment.  Key factors affecting the results of our Consumer Banking business for the second quarter and first six months of 2014, compared with the second quarter and first six months of 2013, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 include the following:      •    Net Interest Income: Net interest income decreased by $47 million, or 3%, in the second quarter of 2014 from the second quarter of 2013, to $1.4 billion, and by $92 million, or 3%, in the first six months of 2014 from the first six months of 2013, to $2.9 billion. The decrease in net interest income was primarily attributable to compression in deposit spreads in retail banking and lower net interest income due to the run-off in the acquired home loans portfolio, partially offset by higher net interest income generated by growth in our auto loans portfolio.  Consumer Banking yields increased in both the second quarter and first six months of 2014 to 6.2%, as compared to 6.0% in both the second quarter and first six months of 2013. This increase was driven by changes in the product mix in Consumer Banking as a result of growth in our auto loans portfolio and the run-off of the acquired home loans portfolio. While the shift to auto loans drove an increase in the total Consumer Banking yield, the average yield on auto loans decreased to 8.8% in the second quarter of 2014 as compared to 10.0% in the second quarter of 2013, and decreased to 8.9% in the first six months of 2014, as compared to 10.1% in the first six months of 2013. This decrease was primarily attributable to a shift in the credit quality mix of our auto loans portfolio and increased competition in the auto business. The average yield on home loans was 3.7% in both the second quarter and the first six months of 2014, compared to 3.2% in both the second quarter and the first six months of 2013. The higher yield in the home loans portfolio was driven by an increase in expected cash flows as a result of credit improvement on the acquired portfolios.      •    Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income decreased by $19 million, or 10%, in the second quarter of 2014 from the second quarter of 2013, to $170 million, and by $50 million, or 14%, in the first six months of 2014 from the first six months of 2013, to $320 million, primarily driven by a higher provision for representation and warranty losses in our home loans portfolio related to our continuing operations in the first quarter of 2014 and a gain on the sale of certain of our mortgage servicing rights (“MSR”) in the second quarter of 2013.      •    Provision for Credit Losses: The provision for credit losses increased by $76 million, or 113%, in the second quarter of 2014 from the second quarter of 2013, to $143 million, driven by a larger allowance build due to the growth in our auto loans portfolio and smaller allowance releases attributable to our home loans portfolio. The provision for credit losses increased by $41 million, or 17%, in the first six months of 2014 from the first six months of 2013, to $283 million, driven by higher charge-offs and smaller allowance releases.      •    Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $28 million, or 3%, in the second quarter of 2014 from the second quarter of 2013, to $938 million and by $68 million, or 4%, in the first six months of 2014 from the first six months of 2013, to $1.9 billion. The increase was largely due to the growth in our auto loans portfolio and to a smaller degree, the change to include the auto repossession-related expenses as a component of operating expenses. Prior to January 1, 2014, these costs were reported as a component of net charge-offs.               26   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents   •    Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment increased by $300 million, or less than 1%, in the first six months of 2014 to $71.1 billion as of June 30, 2014 from $70.8 billion as of December 31, 2013, primarily due to the growth in the auto loans portfolio, partially offset by the run-off of our acquired home loans portfolio.      •    Deposits: Period-end deposits increased by $1.5 billion, or 1%, in the first six months of 2014 to $169.2 billion as of June 30, 2014, from $167.7 billion as of December 31, 2013, driven by deposit growth in our Consumer Banking business.      •    Charge-off and Delinquency Statistics: The reported net charge-off rate increased by 9 basis points to 0.69% in the second quarter of 2014 from 0.60% in the second quarter of 2013, and increased by 7 basis points to 0.76% in the first six months of 2014 from 0.69% in the first six months of 2013. The 30+ day delinquency rate decreased to 3.49% as of June 30, 2014, from 3.89% as of December 31, 2013. The increase in the net charge-off rate reflected a mix shift toward auto loans (which typically carry higher charge-off rates than our home loans portfolio), as home loans run off.  Commercial Banking Business  The primary sources of revenue for our Commercial Banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits and non-interest income from customer fees. Because we have some investments that generate tax-exempt income or tax credits, we make certain reclassifications to our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues on a taxable-equivalent basis. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, ongoing operating costs, such as salaries and associate benefits, occupancy, equipment, professional services, communications and data processing expenses, as well as marketing expenses.  On January 1, 2014, we adopted the proportional amortization method of accounting for Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects. The proportional amortization method amortizes the cost of the investment over the period in which we will receive tax credits and other tax benefits, and the resulting amortization is recognized as a component of income taxes attributable to continuing operations. Historically, these investments were accounted for under the equity method of accounting and the passive losses related to the investments were recognized within non-interest expense.

(2)  The average yield on loans held for investment is calculated by dividing annualized interest income for the period by average loans held for investment during the period. Some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits. Accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory tax rate of 35%.               28   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents     (3)   Includes Acquired Loans with carrying value of $217 million and $262 million as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. The average balance of commercial banking loans held for investment, excluding Acquired Loans, was $46.8 billion and $39.2 billion in the second quarter of 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $46.0 billion and $38.7 billion in the first six months of 2014 and 2013, respectively.        (4)   Calculated by dividing nonperforming assets as of the end of the period by the sum of period-end loans held for investment, foreclosed properties, and other foreclosed assets.        (5)   Calculated by dividing the allowance for loan and lease losses as of the end of the period by period-end loans held for investment.  Key factors affecting the results of our Commercial Banking business for the second quarter and first six months of 2014, compared with the second quarter and first six months of 2013, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 include the following:      •    Net Interest Income: Net interest income increased by $34 million, or 8%, in the second quarter of 2014 from the second quarter of 2013, to $436 million, and by $54 million, or 7%, in the first six months of 2014 from the first six months of 2013, to $857 million. The increase was driven by growth in commercial loans, partially offset by lower loan yields driven by market and competitive pressures.      •    Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income increased by $16 million, or 17%, in the second quarter of 2014 from the second quarter of 2013, to $109 million, and by $19 million, or 11%, in the first six months of 2014 from the first six months of 2013, to $196 million, primarily driven by increased revenue related to fee-based services and products and the Beech Street Capital acquisition.      •    Provision for Credit Losses: The provision for credit losses increased by $26 million in the second quarter of 2014 to $12 million from a benefit of $14 million in the second quarter of 2013, and by $101 million in the first six months of 2014 to $52 million from a benefit of $49 million in the first six months of 2013. The increase was primarily driven by growth in the portfolio. The increase in allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments was $9 million and $45 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2014, respectively, compared with a release of $20 million and $60 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2013, respectively.      •    Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $39 million, or 17%, in the second quarter of 2014 from the second quarter of 2013, to $267 million, and by $73 million, or 16%, in the first six months of 2014 from the first six months of 2013, to $522 million, driven by operating expenses associated with continued investments in business growth and the Beech Street Capital acquisition.      •    Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment increased by $3.3 billion, or 7%, to $48.3 billion as of June 30, 2014 from $45.0 billion as of December 31, 2013. The increase was driven by loan growth in the commercial and industrial and commercial and multifamily real estate businesses.      •    Deposits: Period-end deposits increased by $873 million, or 3%, to $31.4 billion as of June 30, 2014, from $30.6 billion as of December 31, 2013, driven by our strategy to deepen and expand relationships with commercial customers.      •    Charge-off Statistics: The net charge-off rate was 0.03% in both the second quarter and first six months of 2014, compared to 0.04% and 0.06% in the second quarter and first six months of 2013, respectively. The nonperforming loans rate increased to 0.38% as of June 30, 2014, from 0.33% as of December 31, 2013. The continued strength in the credit metrics in our Commercial Banking business reflects stable credit trends and underlying collateral values.  Other Category  Other includes unallocated amounts related to our centralized Corporate Treasury group activities, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management, gains and losses on our               29   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents  investment securities portfolio and certain trading activities. Other also includes foreign exchange-rate fluctuations related to the revaluation of foreign currency-denominated investments; certain gains and losses on the sale and securitization of loans; unallocated corporate expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance, such as certain acquisition and restructuring charges; a portion of the provision for representation and warranty losses related to continuing operations; certain material items that are non-recurring in nature; and offsets related to certain line-item reclassifications.  Net profit from continuing operations recorded in Other was $31 million and $20 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2014, respectively, compared with a net loss from continuing operations of $117 million and $245 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2013, respectively. The shift from a net loss to a net profit was primarily due to higher net interest income driven by higher interest rates, lower funding costs, the continued run-off of higher rate brokered deposits, as well as the absence of the one-time charge associated with our redemption of trust preferred securities in January 2013.

(2)   Some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits, accordingly we make certain reclassifications within our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, with offsetting reclassifications within the Other category, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory tax rate of 35%.               30   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents    CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ANALYSIS    Total assets of $298.3 billion as of June 30, 2014, increased by $1.4 billion, from $296.9 billion, as of December 31, 2013. Total liabilities of $254.5 billion as of June 30, 2014, decreased by $799 million, from $255.3 billion as of December 31, 2013. Stockholders’ equity increased by $2.2 billion, to $43.8 billion as of June 30, 2014. The increase in stockholders’ equity was primarily attributable to our net income of $2.3 billion for the first six months of 2014.  Following is a discussion of material changes in the major components of our assets and liabilities during the first six months of 2014. Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management activities that are intended to ensure the adequacy of capital while managing our liquidity requirements for the Company and our customers and our market risk exposure in accordance with our risk appetite.  Investment Securities  Our investment portfolio consists primarily of the following: U.S. Treasury debt, U.S. Agency debt and corporate debt securities guaranteed by U.S. government agencies; Agency and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) and commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”); other asset-backed securities (“ABS”) and other investments. The carrying value of our investments in U.S. Treasury, Agency securities and other securities guaranteed by the U.S. government or agencies of the U.S. government represented 79% and 77% of our total investment securities portfolio as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.  Our investment portfolio includes securities available for sale and held to maturity. We classify securities as available for sale or held to maturity based on our investment strategy and management’s assessment of our intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity. We report securities available for sale on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). We report securities held to maturity on our consolidated balance sheets at carrying value. Carrying value generally equals amortized cost. For securities transferred from available for sale to held to maturity, carrying value also includes unrealized gains and losses recognized in AOCI at the date of transfer. Such unrealized gains or losses are accreted over the remaining life of the security with no impact on future net income.  During the first six months of 2014, the fair value of our investment portfolio increased by $1.5 billion, or 3% from $61.0 billion as of December 31, 2013, to $62.5 billion as of June 30, 2014. This increase was primarily driven by lower interest rates.  We had gross unrealized gains of $965 million and gross unrealized losses of $299 million on available-for sale investment securities as of June 30, 2014, compared with gross unrealized gains of $799 million and gross unrealized losses of $631 million as of December 31, 2013. The decrease in gross unrealized losses in the first six months of 2014 was primarily driven by lower interest rates in the second quarter of 2014. Of the $299 million in gross unrealized losses as of June 30, 2014, $276 million was related to securities that had been in a loss position for more than 12 months.

We provide information on OTTI recognized in earnings on our investment securities above under “Consolidated Results of Operations—Non-Interest Income.”  Credit Ratings  Our portfolio of investment securities continues to be concentrated in securities that generally have high credit ratings and low credit risk, such as securities issued and guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury and other government sponsored enterprises or agencies. Approximately 91% and 92% of our total investment securities portfolio was rated AA+ or its equivalent, or better as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, while approximately 6% and 5% was below investment grade as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.

The increase was due to commercial and industrial and commercial and multifamily real estate loan growth in our Commercial Banking business, and continued strong auto loan originations outpacing the run-off of the acquired home loans portfolio in our Consumer Banking business. Overall, there was a decline in our credit card loan portfolio primarily due to seasonality in the first quarter, partially offset by loan growth in the second quarter in our Credit Card business.  We provide additional information on the composition of our loan portfolio and credit quality below in “Credit Risk Profile” and in “Note 4—Loans.”  Loans Held for Sale  Loans held for sale, which are carried at lower of cost or fair value, increased to $709 million as of June 30, 2014, from $218 million as of December 31, 2013. The increase was primarily driven by higher originations and timing of sales of loans.               33   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents Customer Deposits  Our customer deposits represent our largest source of funding for our operations, providing a consistent source of low-cost funds. Total customer deposits increased by $1.4 billion to $205.9 billion as of June 30, 2014, from $204.5 billion as of December 31, 2013. The increase in deposits was driven by growth in our Consumer and Commercial Banking businesses, which reflected our focus on deepening deposit relationships with existing customers and our continued marketing strategy to attract new business. We provide information on the composition of our deposits, average outstanding balances, interest expense and yield below in “Liquidity Risk Profile.”  Securitized Debt Obligations  Securitization debt obligations decreased by $279 million during the first six months of 2014, to $10.0 billion as of June 30, 2014, from $10.3 billion as of December 31, 2013. The decrease was driven by maturities of $2.8 billion, partially offset by the issuances of $2.5 billion of credit card securitization debt during the first six months of 2014. We provide additional information on our borrowings below in “Liquidity Risk Profile.”  Other Debt  Other debt, which consists primarily of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, senior and subordinated notes and Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLB”) advances, totaled $29.1 billion as of June 30, 2014, of which $10.5 billion represented short-term borrowings and $18.6 billion represented long-term debt. Other debt totaled $30.4 billion as of December 31, 2013, of which $16.2 billion represented short-term borrowings and $14.2 billion represented long-term debt.  The decrease in other debt of $1.3 billion in the first six months of 2014 was primarily attributable to net maturities of $5.9 billion of FHLB advances and the maturity of $1.4 billion unsecured senior notes, partially offset by the issuance of $4.8 billion of unsecured senior notes as well as a $1.1 billion increase in federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. We provide additional information on our borrowings below in “Liquidity Risk Profile” and in “Note 8—Deposits and Borrowings.”  Potential Mortgage Representation and Warranty Liabilities  We acquired three subsidiaries that originated residential mortgage loans and sold these loans to various purchasers, including purchasers who created securitization trusts. These subsidiaries are Capital One Home Loans, LLC, which was acquired in February 2005; GreenPoint, which was acquired in December 2006 as part of the North Fork acquisition; and CCB, which was acquired in February 2009 and subsequently merged into CONA.  We have established representation and warranty reserves for losses associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable, including both litigation and non-litigation liabilities. These reserves are reported on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities. The reserve setting process relies heavily on estimates, which are inherently uncertain, and requires the application of judgment. We evaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis. We build our representation and warranty reserves through the provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses, which we report on our consolidated statements of income as a component of non-interest income for loans originated and sold by CCB and Capital One Home Loans, LLC and as a component of discontinued operations for loans originated and sold by GreenPoint. In establishing the representation and warranty reserves, we consider a variety of factors depending on the category of purchaser. The aggregate reserves for all three subsidiaries totaled $1.0 billion as of June 30, 2014, compared with $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2013.               34   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents The table below summarizes changes in our representation and warranty reserves in the second quarter and first six months of 2014 and 2013.

As part of our business planning processes, we have considered various outcomes relating to the potential future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are possible but do not rise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying an incremental accrual under applicable accounting standards. Our current best estimate of reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond what was in our reserve as of June 30, 2014, is approximately $2.5 billion, a decline from our estimate of $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2013.  We provide additional information related to the representation and warranty reserve, including factors that may impact the adequacy of the reserves and the ultimate amount of losses incurred by our subsidiaries, in “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees, and Others.”       OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES    In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various types of arrangements with limited liability companies, partnerships or trusts that often involve special purpose entities and variable interest entities (“VIE”). Some of these arrangements are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or may be recorded in amounts different from the full contract or notional amount of the arrangements, depending on the nature or structure of, and accounting required to be applied to, the arrangement. These arrangements may expose us to potential losses in excess of the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Our involvement in these arrangements can take many forms, including securitization and servicing activities, the purchase or sale of mortgage-backed or other asset-backed securities in connection with our home loans portfolio and loans to VIEs that hold debt, equity, real estate or other assets.  Our continuing involvement in unconsolidated VIEs primarily consists of certain mortgage loan trusts and community reinvestment and development entities. The carrying amount of assets and liabilities of these unconsolidated VIEs was $3.4 billion and $464 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2014, and our maximum exposure to loss was $4.0 billion as of June 30, 2014. We provide a discussion of our activities related to these VIEs in “Note 6—Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations.”       CAPITAL MANAGEMENT    The level and composition of our equity capital are determined by multiple factors, including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements and internal risk-based capital assessments such as internal stress testing and               35   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents  economic capital. The level and composition of our capital may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment, conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments.  Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective Action  Bank holding companies and national banks are subject to capital adequacy standards adopted by the Federal Reserve and the OCC, respectively. The capital adequacy standards set forth minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements that are based on quantitative and qualitative measures of assets and off-balance sheet items. National banks, as insured depository institutions, are also subject to Prompt Corrective Action (“PCA”) capital regulations, which require the U.S. federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” for banks that do not meet established minimum capital requirements.  In July 2013, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and the Federal Deposit Issuance Corporation (“FDIC”) (collectively, the U.S. federal banking agencies) finalized a new capital rule (the “Final Rule”) that implements the Basel III capital accord developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“Basel Committee”) and certain Dodd-Frank Act capital provisions and updates the PCA capital requirements. Prior to being revised in the Final Rule, the minimum risk-based capital requirements adopted by the U.S. federal banking agencies followed the Basel I framework, originally promulgated pursuant to the Basel Committee’s Basel I accord, and the advanced approaches capital rules (“Advanced Approaches”), based upon the framework originally promulgated as a result of the Basel II accord. The Final Rule amended both the Basel I and Advanced Approaches frameworks, establishing a new common equity Tier 1 capital requirement and setting higher minimum capital ratio requirements. The Company refers to the amended Basel I framework as the “Basel III Standardized Approach,” and the amended Advanced Approaches framework as the “Basel III Advanced Approaches.”  At the end of 2012, the Company met one of the two independent eligibility criteria set by banking regulators for becoming subject to the Advanced Approaches capital rules. As a result, the Company has undertaken a multi-year process of implementing the Advanced Approaches regime for calculating risk-weighted assets and regulatory capital levels. Certain provisions of the Final Rule began to take effect on January 1, 2014 for Advanced Approaches banking organizations, including the Company. The Company will be subject to a parallel run under Advanced Approaches, expected to begin January 1, 2015, during which it will calculate capital ratios under both the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches, though it will continue to use the Basel III Standardized Approach for purposes of meeting regulatory capital requirements. By rule, the parallel run must last at least four consecutive quarters. Therefore, the first quarter of 2016 is the earliest possible date on which the Company would use the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework in calculating its regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets for purposes of risk-based capital requirements. Consistent with the experience of other U.S. banks, it is possible that our parallel run will last longer than the four quarter minimum. Under the Dodd-Frank Act and the Final Rule, organizations subject to Basel III Advanced Approaches may not hold less capital than would be required under the Basel III Standardized Approach. Therefore, even after we exit parallel run, we will continue to calculate regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets under the Basel III Standardized Approach.  As of January 1, 2014, the new minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements for Advanced Approaches banking organizations include a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 5.5%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0%, and a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 4.0%. On January 1, 2015, the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements will increase to 4.5% for the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio and to 6.0% for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio. The minimum requirements for the total risk-based capital ratio and the Tier 1 leverage capital ratio will not change from 2014 to 2015.  Insured depository institutions also are subject to PCA capital regulations. Under current PCA regulations, an insured depository institution is considered to be well-capitalized if it maintains a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0%, a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 5.0%, and is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued               36   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents   by its regulator. While the Final Rule increases some of the thresholds for the PCA capital categories and adds the new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to the PCA regulations, those changes are not effective until January 1, 2015. Beginning on January 1, 2015, the well-capitalized level for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio will increase to 8.0%, and the well-capitalized level for the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio will be established at 6.5%. The well-capitalized levels for the total risk-based capital ratio and the Tier 1 leverage capital ratio will not change.  Prior to 2014, we also disclosed a Tier 1 common capital ratio for our bank holding company, which is a regulatory capital measure widely used by investors, analysts, rating agencies and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies. There was no mandated minimum or well-capitalized standard for the Tier 1 common capital ratio.  We disclose a non-GAAP tangible common equity ratio (“TCE ratio”) in “MD&A—Summary of Selected Financial Data.” While the TCE ratio is a capital measure widely used by investors, analysts, rating agencies, and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies, it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We provide information on the calculation of this ratio in “MD&A—Supplemental Tables—Table A: Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures and Calculation of Regulatory Capital Measures.”  Table 15 provides a comparison of our regulatory capital ratios under the U.S. federal banking agencies’ capital adequacy standards as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013. Under the Final Rule, beginning on January 1, 2014, as an Advanced Approaches banking organization that has yet to enter or exit parallel run, we began using the Basel III Standardized Approach for calculating our regulatory capital, subject to applicable transition provisions. In 2014, however, we will continue to use Basel I for calculating our risk-weighted assets in our regulatory capital ratios, as required under the Final Rule. Beginning on January 1, 2015, we will use the Basel III Standardized Approach for calculating our risk-weighted assets in our regulatory capital ratios.

Prior periods have been recast to conform to this presentation.                 37   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents     (2)   Capital ratios are calculated based on the Basel I capital framework as of December 31, 2013 and are calculated based on the Basel III Standardized Approach framework, subject to applicable transition provisions, as of June 30, 2014. Capital ratios that are not applicable are denoted by “N/A.” See “MD&A—Supplemental Tables—Table A: Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures and Calculation of Regulatory Capital Measures” for additional information.        (3)   Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure under Basel III calculated based on common equity Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets.        (4)   Tier 1 common capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure under Basel I calculated based on Tier 1 common capital divided by Basel I risk-weighted assets.        (5)   Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets.        (6)   Total risk-based capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on total risk-based capital divided by risk-weighted assets.        (7)   Tier 1 leverage ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by average assets, after certain adjustments.  Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, as calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach, subject to transition provisions, was 12.72% as of June 30, 2014. Our Tier 1 common capital ratio, as calculated under Basel I, was 12.19% as of December 31, 2013. These numbers are not directly comparable due to methodological differences in the calculation of the ratios and the transition requirements under the Final Rule. For purposes of our capital plan, for which we received the Federal Reserve’s non-objection on March 26, 2014, we were assessed on our ability throughout the 2014 CCAR Cycle to maintain, among other measures, a Tier 1 common ratio of 5.0% on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions. We estimate that our Tier 1 common ratio, as calculated under Basel I, was approximately 12.7% as of June 30, 2014. Capital One Financial Corporation exceeded U.S. federal banking agencies’ minimum capital requirements and the Banks exceeded minimum regulatory requirements and were “well-capitalized” under PCA requirements as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013.  As described above, we are currently using the Basel III Standardized Approach for calculating our regulatory capital, subject to transition provisions. The Basel III Standardized Approach common equity Tier 1 capital requirement under the Final Rule includes additional adjustments and deductions not included in the Tier 1 common capital requirement calculated under Basel I, such as the inclusion of the unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investment securities included in AOCI and adjustments related to intangibles. These adjustments are phased-in at 20% for 2014, 40% for 2015, 60% for 2016, 80% for 2017 and at 100% for 2018. Also as described above, we will continue to use Basel I for calculating our risk-weighted assets in our risk-based regulatory capital ratios in 2014. However, beginning on January 1, 2015, we will use the Basel III Standardized Approach for calculating our risk-weighted assets in our risk-based regulatory capital ratios.  The following table compares our common equity Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as of June 30, 2014, calculated based on the Final Rule, subject to applicable transition provisions, to our estimated common equity Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as of June 30, 2014, calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach, as it applies when fully phased-in. See the table and notes below for further discussion on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions used in calculating this ratio.               38   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents Table 16: Estimated Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio under Fully Phased-In Basel III Standardized Approach              (Dollars in millions)         Common Equity Tier 1 Capital under Basel III Standardized as of June 30, 2014    $  28,774      Adjustments related to AOCI(1)     (378)      Adjustments related to intangibles(1)     (1,157)      Other adjustments(1)     (1)                  Estimated Common Equity Tier 1 Capital under Fully Phased-In Basel III Standardized    $ 27,238                  Risk-weighted assets under Basel I    $ 226,172      Adjustments for Basel III Standardized(2)     8,017                  Estimated risk-weighted assets under Basel III Standardized    $ 234,189                  Estimated Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio under Fully Phased-In Basel III Standardized(3)     11.6%              (1)   Assumes adjustments are fully phased-in.        (2)   Adjustments to the Basel I approach to calculating risk-weighted assets include higher risk weights for exposures 90 days or more past due or in nonaccrual, high volatility commercial real estate, securitization exposures and corresponding adjustments to PCCR intangibles, deferred tax assets and certain other assets in the calculation of common equity Tier 1 capital under the Basel III Standardized Approach.        (3)   Calculated by dividing estimated common equity Tier 1 capital under the fully phased-in Basel III Standardized Approach by estimated risk-weighted assets under the Basel III Standardized Approach.  Under the Final Rule, when we complete our parallel run for the Advanced Approaches, our minimum risk-based capital requirement will be the greater requirement of the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches. See “Supervision and Regulation—Basel III and U.S. Capital Rules” in our 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. Based on our business mix, we anticipate that we will need to hold more regulatory capital under the Basel III Advanced Approaches than under Basel I or the Basel III Standardized Approach to meet our minimum required regulatory capital ratios.  Capital Planning and Regulatory Stress Testing  In November 2011, the Federal Reserve finalized capital planning rules applicable to large bank holding companies like us. Under these rules, bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more must submit capital plans to the Federal Reserve on an annual basis that contains a description of all planned capital actions, including dividends or stock repurchases, over a nine-quarter planning horizon beginning with the fourth quarter of the calendar year prior to the submission of the capital plan (“CCAR cycle”). The bank holding company may take the capital actions in its capital plan if the Federal Reserve provides a non-objection to the plan. The Federal Reserve’s objection or non-objection applies specifically to capital actions during the four quarters beginning with the second quarter of the second calendar year in the planning horizon. The purpose of the rules is to ensure that large bank holding companies have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and capital needs to continue operations through times of economic and financial stress. On June 12, 2014, the Federal Reserve and OCC proposed changes to their regulations governing the CCAR and stress testing processes. For additional information on the Proposed Rules, see “MD&A—Supervision and Regulation.”  As a result of the Federal Reserve’s non-objection to our 2014 capital plan, we expect to maintain our quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, subject to approval by our Board of Directors. In addition, our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of shares of common stock through the end of the first quarter of 2015.               39   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents Equity Offerings and Transactions  On June 12, 2014, the Company issued and sold 20,000,000 depositary shares (“Depositary Shares”), each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of Fixed Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C, $0.01 par value, with a liquidation preference of $25 per Depositary Share (equivalent to $1,000 per share of Series C Preferred Stock) (the “Series C Preferred Stock”). Dividends will accrue on the Series C Preferred Stock at a rate of 6.25% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. The net proceeds of the offering of the 20,000,000 Depositary Shares were approximately $484 million, after deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses. Under the terms of the Series C Preferred Stock, the ability of the Company to pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or to repurchase, redeem or acquire its common stock or any preferred stock ranking on parity with or junior to the Series C Preferred Stock, is subject to restrictions in the event that the Company does not declare and either pay or set aside a sum sufficient for payment of dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock for the immediately preceding dividend period.  Dividend Policy and Stock Purchases  We paid common stock dividends of $0.30 per share in the second quarter of 2014. During the second quarter, we also paid preferred stock dividends of $15.00 per share on the outstanding shares of our 6.00% fixed rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series B (the “Series B Preferred Stock”).  On July 31, 2014, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, payable August 21, 2014 and quarterly dividends on our Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock payable on September 2nd. Based on these declarations, the company will pay approximately $169 million in common equity dividends and approximately $20 million in total preferred dividends in Q3 2014.  The declaration and payment of dividends to our stockholders, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. As a bank holding company, our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries. Regulatory restrictions exist that limit the ability of the Banks to transfer funds to our bank holding company. Funds available for dividend payments from COBNA and CONA were $1.3 billion and $210 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2014. There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends. For additional information on dividends, see “Part I-Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation—Dividends, Stock Purchases and Transfer of Funds” in our 2013 Form 10-K.  As disclosed in “Capital Planning and Regulatory Stress Testing” above, we plan to repurchase up to $2.5 billion of common stock within the CCAR 2014 cycle, through the 2014 Stock Repurchase Program approved by our Board of Directors. Through the end of the second quarter of 2014, we have repurchased approximately $1.0 billion of shares as a part of this program.  The timing and exact amount of any common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including market conditions, our capital position and amount of retained earnings. Our share repurchase program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time. For additional information on stock repurchases, see “Part I—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation—Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Transfer of Funds” in our 2013 Form 10-K.       RISK MANAGEMENT    Overview  We use a risk framework to manage risk. We execute against our risk management framework with the “Three Lines of Defense” risk management model to demonstrate and structure the roles, responsibilities and               40   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents  accountabilities in the organization for taking and managing risk. The “First Line of Defense” is comprised of the business areas that through their day-to-day business activities take risk on our behalf. As the business owner, the first line is responsible for identifying, assessing, managing and controlling that risk, and for mitigating our overall risk exposure. The “Second Line of Defense” provides oversight of first line risk taking and management, and is comprised of our risk management organization and other staff control functions. The second line assists in determining risk capacity, risk appetite, and the strategies, policies and structure for managing risks. The second line is both an “expert advisor” to the first line and an “effective challenger” of first line risk activities. The “Third Line of Defense” is comprised of our internal audit and credit review functions. The third line provides independent and objective assurance to senior management and to the Board of Directors that first and second line risk management and internal control systems and its governance processes are well-designed and working as intended. Our risk framework, which is built around governance, processes and people, consists of the following eight key elements:        •    Establish governance processes, accountabilities, and risk appetites        •    Identify and assess risks and ownership        •    Develop and operate controls, monitoring and mitigation plans        •    Test and detect control gaps and perform corrective action        •    Escalate key risks and gaps to executive management, and when appropriate the Board of Directors        •    Calculate and allocate capital in alignment with risk management and measurement processes (including stress testing)        •    Support with the right culture, talent and skills        •    Enable with right data, infrastructure and programs  We provide additional discussion of our risk management principles, roles and responsibilities, framework and risk appetite under “MD&A—Risk Management” in our 2013 Form 10-K.       CREDIT RISK PROFILE    Our loan portfolio accounts for the substantial majority of our credit risk exposure. These activities are also governed under our credit policy and are subject to independent review and approval. Below we provide information about the composition of our loan portfolio, key concentrations and credit performance metrics.  We also engage in certain non-lending activities that may give rise to credit and counterparty settlement risk, including the purchase of securities for our investment securities portfolio, entering into derivative transactions to manage our market risk exposure and to accommodate customers, foreign exchange transactions, and customer overdrafts. We provide additional information on credit risk related to our investment securities portfolio under “Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis—Investment Securities” and credit risk related to derivative transactions in “Note 9—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”  Loan Portfolio Composition  We provide a variety of lending products. Our primary products include credit cards, auto loans, home loans and commercial loans. For information on our lending policies and procedures, including our underwriting criteria for our primary loan products, see “MD&A—Credit Risk Profile” in our 2013 Form 10-K.  Our total loan portfolio consists of loans held for investment, including restricted loans (underlying our consolidated securitization trusts), and loans held for sale. Table 17 presents the composition of our portfolio of loans held for investment, by portofilio segment, as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013. Table 17 and the               41   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents  credit metrics presented in this section exclude loans held for sale, which are carried at lower of cost or fair value and totaled $709 million and $218 million as of June 30, 2014, and December 31, 2013, respectively.

Credit Risk Measurement  We closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to assess and manage our exposure to credit risk. Key metrics we track in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming asset rates, as well as charge-off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger balance commercial loans. Trends in delinquency rates are a primary indicator of credit risk within our consumer loan portfolios, as changes in delinquency rates provide an early warning of changes in credit losses. The primary indicator of credit risk in our commercial loan portfolios is risk ratings. Because we generally classify loans that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming, the level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of our loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on regional economic conditions.  We use borrower credit scores in underwriting for most consumer loans. We do not use credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality because product differences, loan structure and other factors drive large differences in credit quality for a given credit score. We continuously adjust our management of credit lines and collection strategies based on customer behavior and risk profile changes. Based on our most recent data, we estimate that approximately one-third of our Domestic Card portfolio had credit scores equal to or below 660 or no score, based on loan balances as of June 30, 2014, consistent with the proportion of the Domestic Card portfolio with credit scores equal to or below 660 or no score as of December 31, 2013.               42   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents We present information in the section below on the credit performance of our loan portfolio, including the key metrics we use in tracking changes in the credit quality of our loan portfolio. We also present adjusted credit quality metrics excluding impact from Acquired Loans.  See “Note 4—Loans” in this Report for additional credit quality information. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2013 Form 10-K for information on our accounting policies for delinquent, nonperforming loans, charge-offs and troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) for each of our loan categories.  Delinquency Rates  We consider the entire balance of an account to be delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the first statement cycle date equal to or following the due date specified on the customer’s billing statement. Our 30+ day delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due, whereas our 30+ day performing delinquency metrics include loans that are 30 or more days past due but currently classified as performing and accruing interest. The 30+ day delinquency and 30+ day performing delinquency metrics are generally the same for credit card loans, as we continue to classify the substantial majority of credit card loans as performing until the account is charged-off, typically when the account is 180 days past due. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2013 Form 10-K for information on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming for each of our loan categories.  Table 18 presents our 30+ day performing and total 30+ day delinquency rates, by portfolio segment, as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013. It also presents the adjusted rates, which exclude Acquired Loans from the denominator as they are accounted for based on cash flows expected to be collected over the life of the loans.               43   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents Table 18: 30+ Day Delinquencies                                                            June 30, 2014     December 31, 2013        30+ Day Performing     30+ Day Total     30+ Day Performing     30+ Day Total      (Dollars in millions)   Amount     Rate(1)     AdjustedRate(2)     Amount     Rate(1)     AdjustedRate(2)     Amount     Rate(1)     AdjustedRate(2)     Amount     Rate(1)     AdjustedRate(2)      Credit Card:                                                                Domestic credit card    $ 2,013        2.83%       2.83%      $ 2,013        2.83%       2.83%      $ 2,514        3.43%       3.43%      $ 2,514        3.43%       3.43%     International credit card     267        3.40        3.40        330        4.20        4.20        299        3.71        3.71        367        4.56        4.56                                                                                         Total credit card     2,280        2.89        2.89        2,343        2.97        2.97        2,813        3.46        3.46        2,881        3.54        3.55                                                                                         Consumer Banking:                                                                Auto     2,006        5.77        5.77        2,156        6.20        6.20        2,181        6.85        6.85        2,375        7.46        7.46       Home loan     42        0.13        0.61        287        0.88        4.14        55        0.16        0.78        323        0.91        4.55       Retail banking     17        0.48        0.48        36        0.98        1.00        25        0.69        0.70        52        1.44        1.46                                                                                        Total consumer banking     2,065        2.91        4.56        2,479        3.49        5.47        2,261        3.20        5.32        2,750        3.89        6.47                                                                                         Commercial Banking:                                                                Commercial and multifamily real estate     61        0.27        0.27        95        0.43        0.43        29        0.14        0.14        64        0.31        0.31      Commercial and industrial     36        0.14        0.14        82        0.32        0.32        73        0.31        0.32        108        0.46        0.47                                                                                         Total commercial lending     97        0.20        0.20        177        0.37        0.38        102        0.23        0.23        172        0.39        0.39                                                                                         Small-ticket commercial real estate     1        0.15        0.15        12        1.30        1.30        8        0.79        0.79        11        1.17        1.17                                                                                        Total commercial banking     98        0.20        0.20        189        0.39        0.39        110        0.24        0.25        183        0.41        0.41                                                                                         Other:                                                                Other loans     4        2.91        2.91        16        12.43        12.43        4        3.32        3.32        19        15.72        15.72                                                                                         Total    $  4,447        2.24        2.58       $  5,027        2.53        2.91       $  5,188        2.63        3.08       $  5,833        2.96        3.46                                                                                             (1)   Calculated by loan category by dividing 30+ day delinquent loans as of the end of the period by period-end loans held for investment for the specified loan category, including Acquired Loans as applicable.

Table 20 summarizes loans that were 90 days or more past due as to interest or principal and still accruing interest as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013. These loans consist primarily of credit card accounts between 90 days and 179 days past due. As permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”), we generally continue to accrue interest and fees on domestic credit card loans through the date of charge-off, which is typically in the period the account becomes 180 days past due. While domestic credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until the loan is charged-off, we reduce the balance of our credit card receivables by the amount of finance charges and fees billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from revenue.

Nonperforming Loans and Nonperforming Assets  Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, foreclosed property and repossessed assets and the net realizable value of auto loans that have been charged-off as a result of a bankruptcy. Nonperforming loans               45   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents  generally include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and certain restructured loans whose contractual terms have been modified in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty. In addition, we separately track and report Acquired Loans accounted for based on expected cash flows and disclose our delinquency and nonperforming loan rates with and without these Acquired Loans. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2013 Form 10-K for information on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming for each of our loan categories.  Table 21 presents comparative information on nonperforming loans, by portfolio segment, and other nonperforming assets, as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013. We do not classify loans held for sale as nonperforming, as they are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value.

Interest income foregone related to nonperforming loans was $29 million and $34 million in the first six months of 2014 and 2013, respectively. Foregone interest income represents the amount of interest income that would have been recorded during the period for nonperforming loans as of the end of the period had the loans performed according to their contractual terms.        (2)   The nonperforming loan ratio, excluding Acquired Loans’ impact for our home loans portfolio, total consumer banking, and total nonperforming loans held for investment was 5.06%, 1.17%, and 0.47%, respectively, as of June 30, 2014, compared with 5.29%, 1.44%, and 0.51%, respectively, as of December 31, 2013.               46   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents     (3)   Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment, excluding the impact of domestic credit card loans, was 0.63% and 0.70% as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.        (4)   The denominator used in calculating the nonperforming asset ratios consists of total loans held for investment and other nonperforming assets.        (5)   Includes foreclosed properties related to Acquired Loans of $71 million and $68 million as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.        (6)   Includes the net realizable value of auto loans that have been charged-off as a result of a bankruptcy and repossessed assets obtained in satisfaction of auto loans. Both of these amounts are included in other assets.        (7)   The nonperforming asset ratio, excluding the impact of Acquired Loans was 0.59% and 0.63% as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.  Net Charge-Offs  Net charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine are uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and fraud losses from charge-offs. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for loan and lease losses and subsequent recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses. Costs incurred to recover charged-off loans are recorded as collection expense and included on our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest expense. Our charge-off time frame for loans varies based on the loan type. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Loans” in our 2013 Form 10-K for information on our charge-off policy for each of our loan categories.

Loan Modifications and Restructurings  As part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may provide short-term (three to twelve months) or long-term (greater than twelve months) modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to improve long-term collectability of the loan and to avoid the need for foreclosure or repossession of collateral.  Table 23 presents the total TDR loan balances as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013.

The majority of our credit card TDR loan modifications involve reducing the interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. We determine the effective interest rate for purposes of measuring impairment on modified loans that involve a reduction and are considered to be a TDR based on the interest rate in effect immediately prior to the loan entering the modification program. In some cases, the interest rate on a credit card account is automatically increased due to non-payment, late payment or similar events. In all cases, we cancel the customer’s available line of credit on the credit card. If the customer does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement may revert to its original payment terms, with the amount of any loan outstanding reflected in the appropriate delinquency category. The loan amount may then be charged-off in accordance with our standard charge-off policy.  Within the Consumer Banking business, the majority of our modified loans receive an extension, while a portion receive an interest rate reduction or principal reduction. Their impairment is determined using the present value of expected cash flows, or a collateral evaluation for auto and home loans that were charged down to fair value. In the Commercial Banking business, the majority of modified loans receive an extension, with a portion of these loans receiving an interest rate reduction. The impairment on modified commercial loans is generally determined based on the underlying collateral value. We provide additional information on modified loans accounted for as TDRs, including the performance of those loans subsequent to modification, in “Note 4—Loans.”  Impaired Loans  A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan. Generally, we report loans as impaired based on the method for measuring impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. Loans defined as individually impaired include larger balance commercial nonperforming loans and TDR loans. Loans held for sale are not reported as impaired, as these loans are recorded at lower of cost or fair value. Impaired loans also exclude Acquired Loans accounted for based on expected cash flows because this accounting methodology takes into consideration future credit losses expected to be incurred, as discussed above under “Summary of Selected Financial Data.”  Impaired loans, including TDRs, totaled $2.0 billion as of June 30, 2014, compared with $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2013. TDRs accounted for $1.7 billion of impaired loans as of both June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013. We provide additional information on our impaired loans, including the allowance for loan and lease losses established for these loans, in “Note 4—Loans” and “Note 5—Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.”               49   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses  Our allowance for loan and lease losses represents management’s best estimate of incurred loan and lease credit losses inherent in our held for investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date. The allowance for loan and lease losses is increased through the provision for credit losses and reduced by net charge-offs. We provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses in “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2013 Form 10-K.  Our allowance for loan and lease losses decreased by $317 million to $4.0 billion as of June 30, 2014, from $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2013, attributable to continued improvement in delinquency inventories, lower charge-offs in new originations and improved credit outlook. These were partially offset by a modest provision for allowance for loan and lease losses related to growth in the auto loans portfolio.  Table 24 presents changes in our allowance for loan and lease losses for the second quarter and first six months of 2014 and 2013, and details the provision for credit losses recognized on our consolidated statements of income, and charge-offs and recoveries by portfolio segment.               50   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents Table 24: Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Activity                             Three Months Ended June 30,       Six Months Ended June 30,       (Dollars in millions)    2014       2013       2014       2013      Balance at beginning of period, as reported    $  4,098       $  4,606       $  4,315       $  5,156      Provision for credit losses(1)     701        778        1,424        1,613      Charge-offs:                       Credit Card:                       Domestic credit card     (867)        (1,033)        (1,831)        (2,152)      International credit card     (128)        (148)        (259)        (291)                                                Total credit card     (995)        (1,181)        (2,090)        (2,443)                                                Consumer Banking:                       Auto     (183)        (153)        (388)        (335)      Home loan     (8)        (5)        (19)        (12)      Retail banking     (14)        (19)        (29)        (44)                                               Total consumer banking     (205)        (177)        (436)        (391)                                                Commercial Banking:                       Commercial and multifamily real estate     —        (2)        (2)        (4)      Commercial and industrial     (6)        (6)        (10)        (10)                                                Total commercial lending     (6)        (8)        (12)        (14)      Small-ticket commercial real estate     (2)        (6)        (3)        (12)                                                Total commercial banking     (8)        (14)        (15)        (26)      Other loans     (4)        (7)        (6)        (15)                                                Total charge-offs     (1,212)        (1,379)        (2,547)        (2,875)                                                Recoveries:                       Credit Card:                       Domestic credit card     257        284        521        576      International credit card     53        47        104        95                                                Total credit card     310        331        625        671                                                Consumer Banking:                       Auto     72        61        143        121      Home loan     3        1        9        4      Retail banking     8        5        14        13                                                Total consumer banking     83        67        166        138                                                Commercial Banking:                       Commercial and multifamily real estate     1        1        2        2      Commercial and industrial     4        4        6        6                                                Total commercial lending     5        5        8        8      Small-ticket commercial real estate     —        5        —        7                                                Total commercial banking     5        10        8        15                                                Other:                       Other loans     2        2        5        3                                                Total recoveries     400        410        804        827                                                Net charge-offs     (812)        (969)        (1,743)        (2,048)      Other changes(2)     11        (8)        2        (314)                                                Balance at end of period    $  3,998       $  4,407       $  3,998       $  4,407                                                Allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans held for investment               2.01%       2.30%                 51   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents       (1)   The total provision for credit losses reported on our consolidated statements of income consists of a provision for loan and lease losses and a provision for unfunded lending commitments. The table above only presents the provision for loan and lease losses, and does not include the provision for unfunded lending commitments of $3 million and $15 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2014, respectively, and a benefit of $16 million and a provision of $34 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2013, respectively.        (2)   Primarily represents foreign currency translation adjustments and the net impact of loan transfers and sales. In the first quarter of 2013, the allowance of loan and lease losses was reduced by $289 million attributable to the transfer of the Best Buy portfolio from HFI to HFS, which was subsequently sold in the third quarter of 2013.

LIQUIDITY RISK PROFILE    We have established liquidity guidelines that are intended to ensure we have sufficient asset-based liquidity to withstand the potential impact of deposit attrition or diminished liquidity in the funding markets. Our guidelines include maintaining an adequate liquidity reserve to cover our funding requirements as well as any potential deposit run-off and maintaining diversified funding sources to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. Our liquidity reserves consist of readily-marketable or pledgable assets which can be used as a source of liquidity, if needed.  Table 26 below presents the composition of our liquidity reserves as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013.

(2)   We pledged securities available for sale with a fair value of $7.5 billion and $10.7 billion as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. We also pledged securities held to maturity with a carrying value of $11.9 billion and $8.2 billion as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.  Our liquidity reserves increased by $7.7 billion, or 11%, in the first six months of 2014, to $77.3 billion as of June 30, 2014, from $69.7 billion as of December 31, 2013. This increase was primarily attributable to lower short-term FHLB advances as we experienced an increase in consumer deposits and also issued new senior note and card securitization funding in the first six months of 2014. See “MD&A—Risk Management” in our 2013 Form 10-K for additional information on our management of liquidity risk.  Funding  The Company’s primary source of funding comes from customer deposits. In addition to customer deposits, the Company raises funding through the purchase of Federal Funds, the issuance of brokered deposits, FHLB advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios, the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, loan securitization transactions and other various types of borrowings. A key objective in our use of these markets is to ensure we maintain access to a diversified mix of wholesale funding sources.  Customer Deposits  Our customer deposits provide a stable and relatively low cost of funds and are our largest source of funding. Table 27 provides a comparison of the composition of our customer deposits, average balances, interest expense and average deposit rates for the first six months of 2014 and full year 2013.               53   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents Table 27: Deposit Composition and Average Deposit Rates                                Six Months Ended June 30, 2014      (Dollars in millions)   Period EndBalance     AverageBalance     InterestExpense     % ofAverageDeposits     AverageDepositRate     Non-interest bearing checking accounts    $  24,920       $ 23,649        N/A        11.5%       N/A      Interest-bearing checking accounts(1)     41,420        43,099       $  106        20.9        0.49%     Saving deposits(2)     130,370        129,615        373        62.9        0.58      Time deposits less than $100,000     5,677        5,911        39        2.9        1.30                                                     Total core deposits     202,387        202,274        518        98.2        0.51      Time deposits of $100,000 or more     2,594        2,702        28        1.3        2.09      Foreign time deposits(3)     909        1,104        2        0.5        0.33                                                     Total customer deposits    $  205,890       $  206,080       $  548         100.0%       0.53                                                           Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2013      (Dollars in millions)   Period EndBalance     AverageBalance     InterestExpense     % ofAverageDeposits     AverageDepositRate     Non-interest bearing checking accounts    $  22,643       $  21,345        N/A        10.2%       N/A      Interest-bearing checking accounts(1)     43,880        43,823       $  254        21.0        0.58%     Saving deposits(2)     127,667        129,373        714        61.8        0.55      Time deposits less than $100,000     6,299        8,955        161        4.3        1.80                                                     Total core deposits     200,489        203,496        1,129        97.3        0.55      Time deposits of $100,000 or more     2,852        3,938        108        1.9        2.74      Foreign time deposits(3)     1,182        1,611        4        0.8        0.25                                                     Total customer deposits    $  204,523       $  209,045       $  1,241         100.0%       0.59                                                            (1)   Includes Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (“NOW”) accounts.

Total deposits increased by $1.4 billion during the first six months of 2014, to $205.9 billion as of June 30, 2014, from $204.5 billion as of December 31, 2013, driven by growth in our Consumer and Commercial Banking businesses, which reflected our focus on deepening deposit relationships with existing customers and our continued marketing strategy to attract new business. Our deposits include brokered deposits, which we obtained through the use of third-party intermediaries. Those brokered deposits are reported in savings deposits and time deposits in the above table and totaled $4.9 billion and $6.0 billion as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.  FDIC limits the use of brokered deposits to “well-capitalized” insured depository institutions and, with a waiver from the FDIC, to “adequately capitalized” institutions. COBNA and CONA were “well-capitalized,” as defined under the federal banking regulatory guidelines, as of both June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, and therefore were permitted to maintain brokered deposits.  Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt  We access the capital markets to meet our funding needs through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, loan securitization transactions, and federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. We participate in the federal funds market regularly to take advantage of attractive offers and to keep a visible presence in the market, which is intended to ensure that we are able to access the federal funds market in               54   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents  a time of need. In addition, we may utilize short-term as well as long-term FHLB advances for our funding needs. FHLB advances are secured by our investment securities, residential home loans, multifamily loans, commercial real estate loans and home equity lines of credit.  Our short-term borrowings include those borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less and do not include the current portion of long-term debt. The short-term borrowings, which consist of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, and short-term FHLB advances, decreased by $5.7 billion in the first six months of 2014, from $16.2 billion as of December 31, 2013, to $10.5 billion as of June 30, 2014. This decrease reflects $21.6 billion in payoffs of FHLB advances, partially offset by $15.8 billion in new advances in the first six months of 2014.  Our long-term debt, which consists of securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, and long-term FHLB advances, increased by $4.2 billion in the first six months of 2014, from $24.4 billion as of December 31, 2013, to $28.6 billion as of June 30, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to new senior note issuances of $4.8 billion, card securitization issuances of $2.5 billion and long-term FHLB advances of $1.0 billion, partially offset by $4.2 billion of maturities.  Table 28 provides the average balances and average interest rates of our short-term borrowings for the second quarter and first six months of 2014 and 2013. This table also presents the period-end balances, weighted average interest rates and the maximum month-end outstanding amounts of our short-borrowings as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013.

We provide additional information on our short-term borrowings and long-term debt above under “Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis—Securitized Debt Obligations,” “Consolidated Balance Sheet Analysis—Other Debt” and in “Note 8—Deposits and Borrowings.”  Borrowing Capacity  Under our shelf registration statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 30, 2012, from time to time, we may offer and sell an indeterminate aggregate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depository shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units. There is no limit under this shelf registration statement to the amount or number of such securities that we may offer and sell, subject to market conditions. Our current shelf registration statement will expire three years from the filing date.  In addition to our issuance capacity under the shelf registration statement, we also have access to FHLB advances with a maximum borrowing capacity of $37.7 billion as of June 30, 2014. This borrowing capacity was secured by posting $30.2 billion of loans and $7.5 billion of securities as collateral. As of June 30, 2014, we had outstanding FHLB advances and letters of credit of $10.9 billion and $26.9 billion still available to us to borrow under this program. The               56   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents  ability to draw down funding is based on membership status and the amount is dependent upon the Banks’ ability to post collateral. Our FHLB membership is secured by our investment in FHLB stock of $500 million and $774 million as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, which are determined in part based on our outstanding advances. We also have access to the Federal Reserve Discount Window but did not utilize this funding source during 2014 or 2013.  Credit Ratings  Our credit ratings have a significant impact on our ability to access capital markets and our non-deposit borrowing costs. Rating agencies base their ratings on numerous factors, including liquidity, capital adequacy, asset quality, quality of earnings and the probability of systemic support. Significant changes in these factors could result in different ratings. Such ratings help to support our cost effective unsecured funding as part of our overall financing programs. Table 30 provides a summary of the credit ratings for the senior unsecured debt of Capital One Financial Corporation, COBNA and CONA as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013.

MARKET RISK PROFILE    Market risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities, including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and derivatives. Below we provide additional information about our primary sources of market risk, our market risk management strategies and the measures we use to evaluate our market risk exposure.  Primary Market Risk Exposures  Our primary source of market risk is interest rate risk. We also have exposure to foreign exchange risk.  Interest Rate Risk  Interest rate risk, which represents exposure to instruments whose yield or price varies with the level or volatility of interest rates, is our most significant source of market risk exposure. Banks are inevitably exposed to interest rate risk due to differences in the timing between the maturities or repricing of assets and liabilities.  Foreign Exchange Risk  Foreign exchange risk represents exposure to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies. Changes in foreign exchange rates affect the reported earnings of our foreign operations and the value of non-dollar denominated equity invested in those foreign operations. We measure our earnings exposure using a stress-based simulation of foreign exchange rates. As of June 30, 2014, our pre-tax earnings exposure to volatility of foreign exchange rates was minimal. The impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our non-dollar equity invested overseas, measured on a quarterly basis, manifests itself in our AOCI and capital ratios.               57   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents Market Risk Management  We employ several techniques to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk, which include, but are not limited to, altering the duration and re-pricing characteristics of our various assets and liabilities through interest rate derivatives or mitigating the foreign exchange exposure of certain non-dollar denominated transactions through foreign exchange derivatives. We execute our derivative contracts in both over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivative markets. Although the majority of our derivatives are interest rate swaps, we also use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage both our interest rate and foreign currency risk. The outstanding notional amount of our derivative contracts totaled $73.2 billion as of June 30, 2014, compared with $63.4 billion as of December 31, 2013.  Market Risk Measurement  We have prescribed risk management policies and limits established by our Market and Liquidity Risk Policy and approved by the Board of Directors. Our objective is to manage our asset/liability risk position and exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and prescribed limits based on prevailing market conditions and long-term expectations. Because no single measure can reflect all aspects of market risk, we use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analyses to measure, assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and foreign exchange rates on our non-dollar denominated earnings. We provide additional information below in “Economic Value of Equity.”  We consider the impact on both net interest income and economic value of equity in measuring and managing our interest rate risk. Because the federal funds rate was lowered to near zero in December 2008 and since then has remained in a target range of 0% to 0.25%, we use a 50 basis point decrease as our declining interest rate scenario, since a scenario where interest rates would decline by 200 basis points is not plausible. In scenarios where a 50 basis point decline would result in a rate less than 0%, we assume a rate of 0%. Below we discuss the assumptions used in calculating each of these measures.  Net Interest Income Sensitivity  This sensitivity measure estimates the impact on our projected 12-month base-line interest rate sensitive revenue resulting from movements in interest rates. Interest rate sensitive revenue consists of net interest income and certain components of other non-interest income significantly impacted by movements in interest rates, including changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and free-standing interest rate swaps. In addition to our existing assets and liabilities, we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions, such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, and plans for projected changes in our funding mix in our baseline forecast. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our projected interest rate sensitive revenue, we assume an instantaneous plus 200 basis point and minus 50 basis point shock, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above.  Economic Value of Equity  Our economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact on the net present value of our assets and liabilities, including derivative hedging activity, resulting from movements in interest rates. Our economic value of equity sensitivity measures are calculated based on our existing assets and liabilities, including derivatives, and do not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected plans for funding mix changes. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our economic value of equity, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates of plus 200 basis points and minus 50 basis points to spot rates, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above.  Table 31 shows the estimated percentage impact on our projected base-line interest rate sensitive revenue and economic value of equity, calculated under the hypothetical interest rate scenarios described above, as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013. In addition to these industry standard measures, we will continue to factor into our internal interest rate risk management decisions the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios, such as stressed rate shocks as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios.               58   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents Table 31: Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis                     June 30, 2014      December 31, 2013      Impact on projected base-line net interest income:             +200 basis points     4.4%       4.9%     –50 basis points     (1.9)        (1.5)      Impact on economic value of equity:             +200 basis points     (4.3)        (5.7)      –50 basis points     (0.7)        0.3     Our projected net interest income and economic value of equity sensitivity measures were within our prescribed policy limits as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013.  Limitations of Market Risk Measures  The interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information, internally-developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies, which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments. Other market inputs, such as interest rates, market prices and interest rate volatility, are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures. We regularly evaluate, update and enhance these assumptions, models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities.  There are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. The above sensitivity analysis contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is performed at a particular point in time based on the existing balance sheet and, in some cases, expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions. The strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections, which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ substantially from the above sensitivity analysis.       SUPERVISION AND REGULATION    On June 12, 2014, the Federal Reserve and OCC released notices of proposed rulemakings that would incorporate changes to their capital plan and stress testing regulations, respectively (the “Proposed Rules”). These proposals would change the annual capital plan and stress test cycle start date from October 1 to January 1, effective for the cycle beginning January 1, 2016. In order to provide a transition to the proposed timing, the Federal Reserve’s decision on a bank holding company’s (“BHC”) 2015 capital plan submission would cover a five-quarter period—from the second quarter of 2015 through the second quarter of 2016. Subsequent submissions each would cover a four-quarter period. The change in the start date of the annual cycle impacts the as-of dates for data used to project results as well as the dates that stress test results must be submitted to the regulators and disclosed to the public. The proposals also provide a one-year deferral on the use of advanced approaches methodology and will not require banking institutions—even those that have exited the parallel run—to use the advanced approaches methodology to estimate their capital ratios for the 2015 capital plan and stress test cycles. In addition, among other proposed changes, the Federal Reserve’s proposal would provide for the Federal Reserve to shift its focus from annual capital issuances and distributions to quarterly capital issuances and distributions by establishing a new requirement that—to the extent a BHC does not issue the amount of regulatory capital projected in its capital plan in any given quarter—the BHC must adjust its capital issuances or distributions as required by the proposal such that the net amounts of a BHC’s actual capital issuances and capital distributions in a calendar quarter cannot be less than the net amounts of capital issuances and capital distributions projected in the BHC’s capital plan for that calendar quarter. The Proposed Rules currently are in a public comment period and are subject to change.

Glossary and Acronyms    2012 U.S. card acquisition: On May 1, 2012, pursuant to the agreement with HSBC Finance Corporation, HSBC USA Inc. and HSBC Technology and Services (USA) Inc. (collectively, “HSBC”), we closed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumed liabilities of HSBC’s credit card and private label credit card business in the United States (other than the HSBC Bank USA, consumer credit card program and certain other retained assets and liabilities).  Acquired Loans: A limited portion of the credit card loans acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition and the substantial majority of consumer and commercial loans acquired in the ING Direct and Chevy Chase Bank acquisitions, which were recorded at fair value at acquisition and subsequently accounted for based on expected cash flows to be collected (under the accounting standard formerly known as “Statement of Position 03-3, Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer,” commonly referred to as “SOP 03-3”). The difference between the fair value at acquisition and expected cash flows represents the accretable yield, which is recognized into interest income over the life of the loans. The difference between the contractual payments on the loans and expected cash flows represents the nonaccretable difference or the amount of principal and interest not considered collectible, which incorporates future expected credit losses over the life of the loans. Decreases in expected cash flows resulting from further credit deterioration will generally result in an impairment charge recognized in our provision for credit losses and an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses. Charge-offs are not recorded until the expected credit losses within the nonaccretable difference is depleted. In addition, Acquired Loans are not classified as delinquent or nonperforming as we expect to collect our net investment in these loans and the nonaccretable difference will absorb the majority of the losses associated with these loans.  Annual Report: References to our “2013 Form 10-K” or “2013 Annual Report” are to our “Annual Report” on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013.               64   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents Banks: Refers to COBNA and CONA.

Carrying Value (with respect to loans): The amount at which a loan is recorded on the balance sheet. For loans recorded at amortized cost, carrying value is the unpaid principal balance net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and costs, and unamortized purchase premium or discount. For loans that are or have been on nonaccrual status, the carrying value is also reduced by any net charge-offs that have been recorded and the amount of interest payments applied as a reduction of principal under the cost recovery method. For credit card loans, the carrying value also includes interest that has been billed to the customer. For loans classified as held for sale, carrying value is the lower of carrying value as described in the sentences above, or fair value. For Acquired Loans, the carrying value equals fair value upon acquisition adjusted for subsequent cash collections and yield accreted to date.

Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) offers a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through branches, the internet and other distribution channels. As of June 30, 2014, our principal subsidiaries included:        •    Capital One Bank (USA), National Association (“COBNA”), which offers credit and debit card products, other lending products and deposit products; and        •    Capital One, National Association (“CONA”), which offers a broad spectrum of banking products and financial services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients.  The Company and its subsidiaries are hereafter collectively referred to as “we,” “us” or “our.” COBNA and CONA are collectively referred to as the “Banks.”  We also offer products outside of the United States principally through Capital One (Europe) plc (“COEP”), an indirect subsidiary of COBNA organized and located in the U.K., and through a branch of COBNA in Canada. COEP has authority, among other things, to provide credit card loans. Our branch of COBNA in Canada also has the authority to provide credit card loans.  Our principal operations are currently organized for management reporting purposes into three primary business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. We provide details on our business segments, the integration of recent acquisitions into our business segments and the allocation methodologies and accounting policies used to derive our business segment results in “Note 13—Business Segments.”  Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP” ). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. While management makes its best judgment, actual amounts or results could differ from these estimates. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.  Principles of Consolidation  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Capital One Financial Corporation and all other entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. We determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE” ). All significant intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated.               77   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)    New Accounting Standards Adopted  Accounting for Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects  In January 2014, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (“FASB”) issued guidance permitting an entity to account for Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects using the proportional amortization method if certain criteria are met. The proportional amortization method amortizes the cost of the investment over the period in which the investor receives tax credits and other tax benefits, and the resulting amortization is recognized as a component of income tax expense attributable to continuing operations. Historically, these investments were under the equity method of accounting and the passive losses related to the investments were recognized within non-interest expense. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2014 with retrospective application. As a result, total assets, total liabilities, and retained earnings were reduced by $115 million, $3 million and $112 million from $297.0 billion, $255.3 billion and $20.4 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2013. In addition, net income was reduced by $9 million from $1.1 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2013 and by $19 million from $2.2 billion for the first six months ended June 30, 2013.  During the second quarter and first six months of 2014, we recognized amortization of $72 million and $144 million, respectively and tax credits of $88 million and $178 million, respectively, associated with these investments within income taxes. The carrying value of our investments in these qualified affordable housing projects was $2.9 billion and $2.8 billion as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. We are periodically required to provide additional financial or other support during the period of the investments. We recorded a liability of $1.1 billion for the unfunded commitments as of June 30, 2014, which are expected to be paid during the years from 2014 to 2017.  Obligations Resulting from Joint and Several Liability Arrangements  In February 2013, the FASB issued guidance for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of obligations resulting from joint and several liability arrangements for which the total amount of the obligation, within the scope of this guidance, is fixed at the reporting date, except for obligations addressed within existing guidance in U.S. GAAP. The guidance clarifies that an entity shall measure the obligations as the sum of the amount the reporting entity agreed to pay on the basis of its arrangement among its co-obligors and any additional amount the reporting entity expects to pay on behalf of its co-obligors. The guidance also requires an entity to disclose the nature and amounts of the obligations as well as other information about those obligations. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2013. The adoption of this guidance in the first quarter of 2014 did not have a significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity as the guidance is consistent with our current practice.  Recently Issued but Not Yet Adopted Accounting Standards  Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period  In June 2014, the FASB issued guidance clarifying that a performance target contained within a share-based payment award that affects vesting and can be achieved after the requisite service period has been completed is to be accounted for as a performance condition. Accordingly, the grantor of such awards would recognize compensation cost in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved. The amount of the compensation cost recognized should represent the cost attributable to the requisite service period fulfilled. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. Entities may elect to adopt the guidance on either a prospective or modified retrospective basis. We do not expect our adoption of this guidance in the first quarter of 2015 to have a significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity as the guidance is consistent with our current practice.               78   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)    Accounting for Repurchase Transactions  In June 2014, the FASB issued guidance that requires repurchase-to-maturity transactions to be accounted for as secured borrowings rather than sales. New disclosures for certain transactions accounted for as secured borrowings and transfers accounted for as sales when the transferor retains substantially all of the exposure to the economic return on the transferred financial assets will also be required. We do not expect our adoption of the accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2015 to have a significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity as the guidance is consistent with our current practice. The new disclosures will be provided beginning in the second quarter of 2015.  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  In May 2014, the FASB issued revised guidance for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure of revenue from contracts with customers. The guidance is applicable to all entities and, once effective, will replace significant portions of existing industry and transaction-specific revenue recognition rules with a more principles-based recognition model. Most revenue associated with financial instruments, including interest and loan origination fees, is outside the scope of the guidance. Gains and losses on investment securities, derivatives and sales of financial instruments are similarly excluded from the scope. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption prohibited. Entities can elect to adopt the guidance either on a full or modified retrospective basis. Full retrospective adoption will require a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. Modified retrospective adoption will require a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the entity first applies the new guidance. We are currently evaluating the guidance to identify which of our revenue streams are within its scope and determine which transition method we plan to elect. Accordingly, we cannot yet quantify the impact our adoption of this guidance will have in the first quarter of 2017.  Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity  In April 2014, the FASB issued guidance changing the criteria for reporting discontinued operations. As a result of the change, only those disposals of components of an entity that represent a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results will be reported as discontinued operations. Expanded disclosures of discontinued operations and disposals of individually significant components of an entity that do not currently qualify for discontinued operations reporting will be required. The guidance is effective for disposals or classifications as held for sale of components of an entity that occur within annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2014, with early adoption permitted in certain circumstances. Our adoption of this guidance in the first quarter of 2015 will not impact what we currently report as discontinued operations due to the prospective transition provisions.  Reclassification of Collateralized Mortgage Loan Upon Foreclosure  In January 2014, the FASB issued guidance clarifying when an entity should reclassify a consumer mortgage loan collateralized by residential real estate to foreclosed property. Reclassification should occur when the creditor obtains legal title to the residential real estate property or when the borrower conveys all interest in the residential real estate property to the creditor to satisfy that loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement. An entity should not wait until a redemption period, if any, has expired to reclassify a consumer mortgage loan to foreclosed property. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2014, with early adoption permitted. We do not expect our adoption of this guidance in the first quarter of 2015 to have a significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity as the guidance is materially consistent with our current practice.               79   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)       NOTE 2—DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS    Shutdown of Mortgage Origination Operations of our Wholesale Mortgage Banking Unit  In the third quarter of 2007, we closed the mortgage origination operations of our wholesale mortgage banking unit, GreenPoint, which we acquired in December 2006 as part of the North Fork acquisition. The results of the wholesale banking unit have been accounted for as a discontinued operation and are therefore not included in our results from continuing operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013. We have no significant continuing involvement in these operations.  The following table summarizes the results from discontinued operations related to the closure of the mortgage origination operations of our wholesale mortgage banking unit:  Table 2.1: Results of Discontinued Operations                            Three Months EndedJune 30,     Six Months EndedJune 30,      (Dollars in millions)    2014       2013       2014       2013      Non-interest income (expense), net    $ (15)      $ (190)      $ 32       $ (315)                                               Income (loss) from discontinued operations before taxes     (15)       (190)       32        (315)     Income tax provision (benefit)     (5)       (71)       12        (118)                                               Income (loss) from discontinued operations    $ (10)      $ (119)      $ 20       $ (197)                                              The discontinued mortgage origination operations of our wholesale mortgage banking unit had remaining assets of $352 million and $370 million as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. Liabilities, which primarily consisted of reserves for representations and warranties on loans previously sold to third parties, totaled $912 million and $960 million as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.       NOTE 3—INVESTMENT SECURITIES    Our investment portfolio consists primarily of the following: U.S. Treasury debt, U.S. agency debt and corporate debt securities guaranteed by U.S. government agencies; Agency and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) and commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”); other asset-backed securities (“ABS”), and other investments. The U.S. government agencies include Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) and Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”). The carrying value of our investments in U.S. Treasury, Agency securities and other securities guaranteed by the U.S. government or agencies of the U.S. government represents 79% and 77% of our total investment securities as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.  Our investment portfolio includes securities available for sale and securities held to maturity.

Effective in the second quarter of 2014, we began reporting the effective yield for the investment securities. Prior to second quarter of 2014, we reported the purchase yield for the investment securities. The impact of this change on prior periods is not material.  Other-Than-Temporary Impairment  We evaluate all securities in an unrealized loss position at least on a quarterly basis, and more often as market conditions require, to assess whether the impairment is other-than-temporary. Our Other-Than-Temporary Impairment (“OTTI”) assessment is based on a discounted cash flow analysis which requires careful use of judgments and assumptions. A number of qualitative and quantitative criteria may be considered in our assessment as applicable, including the size and the nature of the portfolio; historical and projected performance such as prepayment, default and loss severity for the RMBS portfolio; recent credit events specific to the issuer and/or industry to which the issuer belongs; the payment structure of the security; external credit ratings of the issuer and any failure or delay of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments; the value of underlying collateral; our intent and ability to hold the security for the long term; and current and projected market and macro-economic conditions.  For a debt security that has experienced a decline in the fair value below amortized cost basis, we recognize OTTI in earnings if we have the intent to sell the security, or if we believe it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security in the near term. For those securities that we do not intend to sell or expect to be required to sell, an analysis is performed to determine if any of the impairment is due to credit or whether it is due to other factors, such as interest rates. Credit-related impairment is recognized in earnings, with the remaining unrealized non-credit related impairment recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). We determine the credit component based on the difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected cash flows, discounted based on the effective yield.  The table below presents the accumulative credit loss and activities for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, related to the credit component of OTTI recognized in earnings on debt securities:  Table 3.8 Credit Impairment Rollforward                            Three Months EndedJune 30,     Six Months EndedJune 30,      (Dollars in millions)    2014       2013       2014       2013      Credit loss component, beginning of period    $ 165       $ 145       $ 160       $ 120      Additions:                       Initial credit impairment     0        3        1        11      Subsequent credit impairment     1        1        5        18                                                Total additions     1        4        6        29                                                Reduction due to payoffs, disposals, transfers & other     (1)       —        (1)       —                                                Credit loss component, end of period    $ 165       $ 149       $ 165       $ 149                                               Gross unrealized losses on our investment securities have generally decreased since December 31, 2013. We believe the unrealized losses related to investment securities for which we have not recognized credit impairment are primarily attributable to changes in market interest rates. In addition, we do not intend to sell these securities with unrealized losses, and we believe it is not likely that we will be required to sell these securities prior to recovery of their amortized cost. Except for the securities reported in the table above for which credit losses have been recognized in earnings, we believe the securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI are not other than temporarily impaired as of June 30, 2014.               86   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)    Realized Gains and Losses on Securities  The following table presents the gross realized gains and losses on the sale and redemption of securities available for sale recognized in earnings for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.

We also pledge securities to secure trust and public deposits and for other purposes as required or permitted by law. We pledged securities available for sale with a fair value of $7.5 billion and $10.7 billion as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. We pledged securities held to maturity with a carrying value of $11.9 billion and $8.2 billion as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. Of the total securities pledged as collateral, we have encumbered $17.0 billion and $17.3 billion as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, primarily related to FHLB transactions and Public Fund deposits. We accepted pledges of securities with a fair value of $11 million and $53 million as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, primarily related to our derivative transactions.

Our loan portfolio, by segment, consists of credit card, consumer banking and commercial banking loans. Credit card loans consist of domestic and international credit card loans. Consumer banking loans consist of auto, home, and retail banking loans. Commercial banking loans consist of commercial and multifamily real estate, commercial and industrial, and small-ticket commercial real estate loans.  Loans Acquired in Business Acquisitions  Loans Acquired and Accounted for Based on Expected Cash Flows  Our portfolio of loans held for investment includes loans acquired in the Chevy Chase Bank (“CCB”), ING Direct and 2012 U.S. card acquisitions. These loans were recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition.  Acquired Loans accounted for based on expected cash flows to be collected was $26.0 billion as of June 30, 2014, compared with $28.6 billion as of December 31, 2013.  We regularly update our estimate of the amount of expected principal and interest to be collected from these loans and evaluate the results for each accounting pool that was established at acquisition based on loans with common risk characteristics. Probable decreases in expected cash flows would trigger the recognition of a loan loss through our provision for credit losses. Probable and significant increases in expected cash flows would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan and lease losses established subsequent to acquisition, with any remaining increase in expected cash flows recognized prospectively in interest income over the remaining estimated life of the underlying loans.               88   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)    Loans Acquired and Accounted for Based on Contractual Cash Flows  The substantial majority of the loans purchased in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition had existing revolving privileges, therefore they were excluded from the Acquired Loans above and accounted for based on contractual cash flows at acquisition. After the acquisition date, these loans were accounted for using the same methodology utilized for our existing credit card portfolio prior to the 2012 U.S. card acquisition. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2013 Form 10-K for additional information on accounting guidance for these loans.

(2)  Includes construction loans and land development loans totaling $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.  We had total loans held for sale of $709 million and $218 million as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.  Credit Quality  We closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to manage and evaluate our exposure to credit risk. Trends in delinquency ratios are an indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk within our               89   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)     loan portfolios. The level of nonperforming loans represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. Accordingly, key metrics we track and use in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming loan rates, as well as charge-off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger balance commercial loans.  The following table summarizes the payment status of our loan portfolio, including an aging of delinquent loans, loans 90 days or more past due that continue to accrue interest and loans classified as nonperforming. We present the information below on the credit performance of our loan portfolio, by major portfolio segment, including key metrics that we use in tracking changes in the credit quality of each of our loan portfolios. The delinquency aging includes all past due loans, both performing and nonperforming, as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013.

Acquired Loans are excluded from loans reported as 90 days and accruing interest as well as nonperforming loans.  Credit Card  Our credit card loan portfolio is generally highly diversified across millions of accounts and multiple geographies without significant individual exposures. We therefore generally manage credit risk on a portfolio basis. The risk in our credit card portfolio is correlated with broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates, gross domestic product (“GDP”), and home values, as well as customer liquidity, which can have a material effect on credit performance. The primary factors we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our credit card portfolio are delinquency and charge-off trends, including an analysis of the migration of loans between delinquency categories over time. The table below displays the geographic profile of our credit card loan portfolio and delinquency statistics as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013. We also present the delinquency rates of our credit card loan portfolio and comparative net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013.               91   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)    Table 4.3: Credit Card: Risk Profile by Geographic Region and Delinquency Status                                    June 30, 2014      (Dollars in millions)   Loans     % of Total(1)      AcquiredLoans     % of Total(1)      Total     % of Total(1)      Domestic credit card:                                 California    $ 7,784        9.9%      $ 4        0.0%      $ 7,788        9.9%     New York     5,114        6.5        4        0.0        5,118        6.5      Texas     4,874        6.2        3        0.0        4,877        6.2      Florida     4,251        5.4        2        0.0        4,253        5.4      Illinois     3,460        4.4        2        0.0        3,462        4.4      Pennsylvania     3,274        4.1        2        0.0        3,276        4.1      Ohio     2,820        3.6        2        0.0        2,822        3.6      New Jersey     2,630        3.3        1        0.0        2,631        3.3      Michigan     2,483        3.1        1        0.0        2,484        3.1      Other     34,438        43.5        16        0.1        34,454        43.6                                                                    Total domestic credit card     71,128        90.0        37        0.1        71,165        90.1                                                                    International credit card:                                 Canada     4,257        5.4        0        0.0        4,257        5.4      United Kingdom     3,596        4.5        0        0.0        3,596        4.5                                                                    Total international credit card     7,853        9.9        0        0.0        7,853        9.9                                                                    Total credit card    $  78,981        99.9%      $ 37        0.1%      $  79,018        100.0%                                                                                                    December 31, 2013      (Dollars in millions)   Loans     % of Total(1)      AcquiredLoans     % of Total(1)      Total     % of Total(1)      Domestic credit card:                                 California    $ 7,934        9.8%      $ 6        0.0%      $ 7,940        9.8%     New York     5,271        6.5        6        0.0        5,277        6.5      Texas     4,989        6.1        4        0.0        4,993        6.1      Florida     4,321        5.3        4        0.0        4,325        5.3      Illinois     3,600        4.4        3        0.0        3,603        4.4      Pennsylvania     3,439        4.2        3        0.0        3,442        4.2      Ohio     2,963        3.6        2        0.0        2,965        3.6      New Jersey     2,734        3.4        2        0.0        2,736        3.4      Michigan     2,593        3.2        2        0.0        2,595        3.2      Other     35,348        43.5        31        0.1        35,379        43.6                                                                    Total domestic credit card     73,192        90.0        63        0.1        73,255        90.1                                                                    International credit card:                                 Canada     4,503        5.5        0        0.0        4,503        5.5      United Kingdom     3,547        4.4        0        0.0        3,547        4.4                                                                    Total international credit card     8,050        9.9        0        0.0        8,050        9.9                                                                    Total credit card    $  81,242        99.9%      $ 63        0.1%      $  81,305        100.0%                                                                               92   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)                            June 30, 2014     December 31, 2013      (Dollars in millions)    Total       % of Total(2)       Total       % of Total(2)      Selected credit metrics:                       30+ day delinquencies    $ 2,343        2.97%      $ 2,881        3.54%     90+ day delinquencies     1,007        1.27        1,328        1.63             (1)  Percentages by geographic region within the domestic and international credit card portfolios are calculated based on the total held for investment credit card loans as of the end of the reported period.

Consumer Banking  Our consumer banking loan portfolio consists of auto, home loan and retail banking loans. Similar to our credit card loan portfolio, the risk in our consumer banking loan portfolio is correlated with broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates, GDP, and home values, as well as customer liquidity, all of which can have a material effect on credit performance. Delinquency, nonperforming loans and charge-off trends are key factors we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our consumer banking loan portfolio. The table below displays the geographic profile of our consumer banking loan portfolio. We also present the delinquency and nonperforming loan rates of our consumer banking loan portfolio, excluding Acquired Loans’ impact, as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, and net charge-offs

Home Loan  Our home loans portfolio consists of both first-lien and second-lien residential mortgage loans. In evaluating the credit quality and risk of our home loans portfolio, we continually monitor a variety of mortgage loan characteristics that may affect the default experience on our overall home loans portfolio, such as vintage, geographic concentrations, lien priority and product type. Certain loan concentrations have experienced higher delinquency rates as a result of the significant decline in home prices since the home price peak in 2006 and the rise in unemployment. These loan concentrations include loans originated between 2006 and 2008 in an environment of decreasing home sales, broadly declining home prices and more relaxed underwriting standards. The following table presents the distribution of our home loans portfolio as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, based on selected key risk characteristics.               96   Capital One

We assign internal risk ratings to loans based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt. In determining the risk rating of a particular loan, among the factors considered are the borrower’s current financial condition, historical credit performance, projected future credit performance, prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors, the estimated realizable value of any collateral and current economic trends. The ratings scale based on our internal risk-rating system is as follows:      •    Noncriticized: Loans that have not been designated as criticized, frequently referred to as “pass” loans.      •    Criticized performing: Loans in which the financial condition of the obligor is stressed, affecting earnings, cash flows or collateral values. The borrower currently has adequate capacity to meet near-term obligations; however, the stress, left unabated, may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects at some future date.      •    Criticized nonperforming: Loans that are not adequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as criticized nonperforming have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, which jeopardize the repayment of the debt. These loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain a credit loss if the deficiencies are not corrected and are generally placed on nonaccrual status.  We use our internal risk-rating system for regulatory reporting, determining the frequency of review of the credit exposures and evaluation and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans. Loans of $1 million or more designated as criticized performing and criticized nonperforming are reviewed quarterly by management for further deterioration or improvement to determine if they are appropriately classified/graded and whether impairment exists. Noncriticized loans greater than $1 million are specifically reviewed, at least annually, to determine the appropriate loan grading. In addition, during the renewal process of any loan or if a loan becomes past due, we evaluate the risk rating.               99   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)    The following table presents the geographic distribution and internal risk ratings of our commercial loan portfolio as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013.

As a result, loans entering long-term TDR payment programs in the U.K. typically continue to age and ultimately charge-off even when fully in compliance with the TDR program terms.

(2)  Represents changes in accretable yields for those pools that are driven primarily by changes in actual and estimated prepayments.  Unfunded Lending Commitments  We manage the potential risk in credit commitments by limiting the total amount of arrangements, both by individual customer and in total, by monitoring the size and maturity structure of these portfolios and by applying the same credit standards for all of our credit activities. Unused credit card lines available to our customers totaled $285.8 billion and $276.7 billion as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. While these amounts represented the total available unused credit card lines, we have not experienced and do not anticipate that all of our customers will access their entire available line at any given point in time.  In addition to available unused credit card lines, we enter into commitments to extend credit that are legally binding conditional agreements having fixed expirations or termination dates and specified interest rates and purposes. These commitments generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards. Collateral requirements and loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios are the same as those for funded transactions and are established based on management’s credit assessment of the customer. These commitments may expire without being drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future funding requirements. The outstanding unfunded commitments to extend credit, other than credit card lines, were approximately $22.8 billion and $20.9 billion as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.       NOTE 5—ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES    Our allowance for loan and lease losses represents management’s best estimate of incurred loan and lease losses inherent in our held for investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date. In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments, such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, and binding unfunded loan commitments. The provision for unfunded lending commitments is included in the provision for credit losses on our consolidated statements of income and the related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.               111   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)    See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of our 2013 Form 10-K for further discussion on the methodologies and policies for determining our allowance for loan and lease losses for each of our loan portfolio segments.  Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Activity  The allowance for loan and lease losses is increased through the provision for credit losses and reduced by net charge-offs. The provision for credit losses, which is charged to earnings, reflects credit losses we believe have been incurred and will eventually be reflected over time in our charge-offs. Charge-offs of uncollectible amounts are deducted from the allowance for loan and lease losses and subsequent recoveries are included.

(2)   Primarily represents foreign currency translation adjustments and the net impact of loan transfers and sales. In the first quarter of 2013, the allowance of loan and lease losses was reduced by $289 million attributable to the transfer of the Best Buy portfolio from loans held for investment to loans held for sale, which was subsequently sold in the third quarter of 2013.

The component of the allowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans, which we collectively evaluate for impairment, is based on historical loss experience for loans with similar characteristics and consideration of credit quality supplemented by management judgment and interpretation.        (2)   The asset-specific component of the allowance for loan and lease losses for smaller-balance impaired loans is calculated on a pool basis using historical loss experience for the respective class of assets. The asset-specific component of the allowance for loan and lease losses for larger-balance commercial loans is individually calculated for each loan.        (3)   The Acquired Loans component of the allowance for loan and lease losses is accounted for based on expected cash flows. See “Note 4—Loans” for details on these loans.       NOTE 6—VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES AND SECURITIZATIONS    In the normal course of business, we enter into various types of transactions with entities that are considered to be VIEs. Our primary involvement with VIEs has been related to our securitization transactions in which we transferred assets from our balance sheet to securitization trusts. We have primarily securitized credit card loans and home loans, which have provided a source of funding for us and enabled us to transfer a certain portion of the economic risk of the loans or debt securities to third parties.  The entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is referred to as the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE. The majority of the VIEs in which we are involved have been consolidated in our financial statements.  Summary of Consolidated and Unconsolidated VIEs  The table below presents a summary of VIEs, aggregated based on VIEs with similar characteristics, in which we had continuing involvement or held a variable interest as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013. We separately present information for consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs.  For consolidated VIEs, we present the carrying amount of assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. The assets of consolidated VIEs primarily consist of cash and loans, which we report on our consolidated balance sheets under restricted cash and restricted loans, respectively, for securitization investors. The assets of a particular VIE are the primary source of funds to settle its obligations. The creditors of the VIEs typically do not have recourse to the general credit of the company. The liabilities primarily consist of debt securities issued by the VIEs, which we report under securitized debt obligations.

(2)  Represents the gross assets and liabilities owned by the VIE, which includes seller’s interest and retained and repurchased notes held by other related parties.        (3)  The carrying amount of assets of unconsolidated securitization-related VIEs consists of retained interests associated with the securitization of option-adjustable rate mortgage loans (“option-ARM”) and letters of credit related to manufactured housing securitizations. These are reported on our consolidated balance sheets under other assets. The carrying amount of liabilities of unconsolidated securitization-related VIEs is comprised of obligations on certain swap agreements associated with the securitization of manufactured housing loans and other obligations. These are reported on our consolidated balance sheets under other liabilities.               115   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)    Securitization-Related VIEs  In a securitization transaction, assets from our balance sheet are transferred to a trust we establish, which typically meets the definition of a VIE. Our continuing involvement in the majority of our securitization transactions consists primarily of holding certain retained interests and acting as the primary servicer. We have the option to repurchase receivables from the trust if the outstanding balance of the receivables falls to a level where the cost exceeds the benefits of servicing such receivables. In some cases, we are contractually required to exercise the repurchase option if the primary servicer fails to do so. We also may have exposure associated with contractual obligations to repurchase previously transferred loans due to breaches of representations and warranties. See “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees, and Others” for information related to reserves we have established for our potential mortgage representation and warranty exposure.  The table below presents the securitization-related VIEs in which we had continuing involvement as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013:  Table 6.2: Continuing Involvement in Securitization-Related VIEs                            Non-Mortgage     Mortgage      (Dollars in millions)   CreditCard     OptionARM     GreenPointHELOCs     GreenPointManufacturedHousing     June 30, 2014:                       Securities held by third-party investors.   $ 10,010      $ 2,189      $ 108      $ 939      Receivables in the trust     37,304        2,264        105        945      Cash balance of spread or reserve accounts     0        8        0        145      Retained interests     Yes        Yes        Yes        Yes      Servicing retained     Yes        Yes(1)       No        No(2)     Amortization event(3)     No        No        No        No      December 31, 2013:                       Securities held by third-party investors.   $ 10,289      $ 2,320      $ 122      $ 994      Receivables in the trust     39,548        2,399        116        1,000      Cash balance of spread or reserve accounts     3        8        N/A        144      Retained interests     Yes        Yes        Yes        Yes      Servicing retained     Yes        Yes(1)       Yes(1)       No(2)     Amortization event(3)     No        No        No        No               (1)   We retained servicing of the outstanding balance for a portion of securitized mortgage receivables.        (2)   The core servicing activities for the manufactured housing securitizations are completed by a third party.        (3)  Amortization events vary according to each specific trust agreement but generally are triggered by declines in performance or credit metrics such as charge-off rates or delinquency rates below certain predetermined thresholds. Generally, the occurrence of an amortization event changes the sequencing and amount of trust-related cash flows to the benefit of senior noteholders.  Non-Mortgage Securitizations  As of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, we were deemed to be the primary beneficiary of all of our non-mortgage securitization trusts. Accordingly, all of these trusts have been consolidated in our financial statements.               116   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)    Mortgage Securitizations  Option-ARM Loans  We had previously securitized option-ARM mortgage loans by transferring the mortgage loans to securitization trusts that had issued mortgage-backed securities to investors. The outstanding balance of debt securities held by third-party investors related to our mortgage loan securitization trusts was $2.2 billion and $2.3 billion as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.  We continue to service a portion of the outstanding balance of securitized mortgage receivables. We also retain rights to future cash flows arising from the receivables, the most significant being certificated interest-only bonds issued by the trusts. We generally estimate the fair value of these retained interests based on the estimated present value of expected future cash flows from securitized and sold receivables, using our best estimates of the key assumptions which include credit losses, prepayment speeds and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. For the trusts that we continue to service, we do not consolidate these entities because we do not have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant nor the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts. For the remaining trusts, for which we no longer service the underlying mortgage loans, we do not consolidate these entities because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts.  In connection with the securitization of certain option-ARM loans, a third party is obligated to advance a portion of any “negative amortization” resulting from monthly payments that are less than the interest accrued for that payment period. We have an agreement in place with the third party that mirrors this advance requirement. The amount advanced is tracked through mortgage-backed securities retained as part of the securitization transaction. As advances occur, we record an asset in the form of negative amortization bonds, which are held at fair value in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Our maximum exposure is affected by rate caps and monthly payment change caps, but the funding obligation cannot exceed the difference between the original loan balance multiplied by a preset negative amortization cap and the current unpaid principal balance. We have also entered into certain derivative contracts related to the securitization activities. These are classified as free standing derivatives, with fair value adjustments recorded in non-interest income. See “Note 9—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” for further details on these derivatives.  GreenPoint Mortgage Home Equity Lines of Credit (“HELOCs”)  Our discontinued wholesale mortgage banking unit, GreenPoint, previously sold home equity lines of credit in whole loan sales and subsequently acquired residual interests in certain trusts which securitized some of those loans. As the residual interest holder, GreenPoint is required to fund advances on the home equity lines of credit when certain performance triggers are met due to deterioration in asset performance. We have funded cumulative advances of $29 million as of both June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013. These advances are generally expensed as funded due to the low likelihood of recovery. We also have unfunded commitments of $7 million related to those interests for our non-consolidated VIEs as of both June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013.  GreenPoint Mortgage Manufactured Housing  We retain the primary obligation for certain provisions of corporate guarantees, recourse sales and clean-up calls related to the discontinued manufactured housing operations of GreenPoint Credit LLC, which was sold to a third party in 2004. Although we are the primary obligor, recourse obligations related to aforementioned whole loan sales, commitments to exercise mandatory clean-up calls on certain securitization transactions and servicing were transferred to a third party in the sale transaction. We do not consolidate the trusts used for the securitization of manufactured housing loans because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts since we no longer service the loans.               117   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)    We were required to fund letters of credit in 2004 to cover losses and are obligated to fund future amounts under swap agreements for certain transactions. We have the right to receive any funds remaining in the letters of credit after the securities are released.  The unpaid principal balance of manufactured housing securitization transactions where we are the residual interest holder was $945 million and $1.0 billion as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. In the event the third-party servicer does not fulfill on its obligation to exercise the clean-up calls on certain transactions, the obligation reverts to us and we would assume approximately $420 million of loans receivable upon our execution of the clean-up call with the requirement to absorb any losses on the loans receivable.  We monitor the underlying assets for trends in delinquencies and related losses and review the purchaser’s financial strength as well as servicing performance. These factors are considered in assessing the adequacy of the liabilities established for these obligations and the valuations of the assets.  Other VIEs  Affordable Housing Entities  As part of our community reinvestment initiatives, we invest in private investment funds that make equity investments in multi-family affordable housing properties. We receive affordable housing tax credits for these investments. The activities of these entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. For those investment funds considered to be VIEs, we are not required to consolidate them if we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of those entities. We record our interests in these unconsolidated VIEs in loans held for investment, other assets and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our interests consisted of assets of approximately $3.1 billion and $3.0 billion as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. Our maximum exposure to these entities is limited to our variable interests in the entities and was $3.1 billion as of June 30, 2014. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit and we do not provide additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide. The total assets of the unconsolidated VIE investment funds were $9.8 billion as of both June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013.  Entities that Provide Capital to Low-Income and Rural Communities  We hold variable interests in entities (“Investor Entities”) that invest in community development entities (“CDEs”) that provide debt financing to businesses and non-profit entities in low-income and rural communities. Variable interests in the CDEs held by the consolidated Investor Entities are also our variable interests. The activities of the Investor Entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. The activities of the CDEs are financed solely with invested equity capital. We receive federal and state tax credits for these investments. We consolidate the VIEs in which we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE. We have also consolidated other investments and CDEs that we do not consider VIEs. The assets of the VIEs that we consolidated as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013 totaled approximately $390 million and $389 million, respectively, and are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets in cash, loans held for investment, interest receivable and other assets. The liabilities are reflected in other liabilities. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit. We have not provided additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide.  Other  Other VIEs primarily includes a variable interest that we hold in a trust that has a royalty interest in certain oil and gas properties. The activities of the trust are financed solely with debt. The total assets of the trust were               118   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)     $180 million and $204 million as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. We were not required to consolidate the trust because we do not have the power to direct the activities of the trust that most significantly impact the trust’s economic performance. Our retained interest in the trust, which totaled approximately $83 million and $93 million as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, is reflected on our consolidated balance sheets under loans held for investment. Our maximum exposure to this entity is limited to our variable interest of $83 million as of June 30, 2014. The creditors of the trust have no recourse to our general credit. We have not provided additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide.

Securitized and Unsecured Debt Obligations  We use a variety of funding sources other than customer deposits, including short-term borrowings, the issuance of senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings, and securitization transactions. In addition, we utilize FHLB advances, which are secured by certain portions of our loan and investment securities portfolios, for our funding needs. The securitization debt obligations are separately presented on our consolidated balance sheets, while federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings, including FHLB advances, are included in other debt on our consolidated balance sheets.  Securitized Debt Obligations  Our outstanding borrowings due to securitization investors were $10.0 billion and $10.3 billion of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. During the six months ended June 30, 2014, $2.5 billion of new debt was issued to third-party investors from the credit card securitization trusts offset by $2.8 billion of debt maturities.  Senior and Subordinated Notes  As of June 30, 2014, we had $16.6 billion of senior and subordinated notes outstanding, net of fair value hedging losses of $121 million. As of December 31, 2013, we had $13.1 billion of senior and subordinated notes outstanding, net of fair value hedging losses of $8 million. During the first six months of 2014, we issued $4.8 billion of long-term senior unsecured debt, comprised of $250 million of floating rate notes and $4.5 billion of fixed rate notes. During the first six months of 2014, $1.4 billion of outstanding unsecured notes matured. See “Note 9—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” for information about our fair value hedging activities.  FHLB Advances and Other  In addition to the issuance capacity under the registration statement, we also have access to funding through the FHLB system and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Our FHLB and Federal Reserve memberships require us to hold FHLB and Federal Reserve stock which totaled $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, and are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.               120   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)    We had outstanding FHLB advances and lines of credit, which were secured by our investment securities, residential home loans, multifamily loans, commercial real estate loans and home equity lines of credit, totaling $10.4 billion and $16.3 billion as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. We did not access the Federal Reserve Discount Window during 2014 or 2013.  Composition of Customer Deposits, Short-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt  The table below summarizes the components of our deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013. Our total short-term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased and securities loaned and sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less. Our long-term debt consists of borrowings with an original contractual maturity of greater than one year. The amounts presented for outstanding borrowings include unamortized debt premiums and discounts, net of fair value hedge accounting adjustments.

NOTE 9—DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES    Use of Derivatives  We manage our asset and liability position and market risk exposure in accordance with prescribed risk management policies and limits established by our Market and Liquidity Risk Policy which is approved by our Board of Directors. Our primary market risk stems from the impact on our earnings and economic value of equity from changes in interest rates, and to a lesser extent, changes in foreign exchange rates. We employ several techniques to manage our interest rate sensitivity, which include changing the duration and re-pricing characteristics of various assets and liabilities by using interest rate derivatives. Our current asset and liability management policy also includes the use of derivatives to hedge foreign currency denominated transactions to limit our earnings exposure to foreign exchange risk. We execute our derivative contracts in both the over-the-counter (“OTC”) and exchange-traded derivative markets. The majority of our derivatives are interest rate swaps. In addition, we may use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We also offer various derivatives to our customers as part of our Commercial Banking business but usually offset our exposure through derivative transactions with other counterparties.  Accounting for Derivatives  Our derivatives are designated as either qualifying accounting hedges or free-standing derivatives. Free-standing derivatives consist of customer-accommodation derivatives and economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Qualifying accounting hedges are designated as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges.      •    Fair Value Hedges: We designate derivatives as fair value hedges to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, which fluctuate in value as a result of movements in               122   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)          interest rates. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded in earnings together with offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item and any resulting ineffectiveness. Our fair value hedges consist of interest rate swaps that are intended to modify our exposure to interest rate risk on various fixed-rate assets and liabilities.      •    Cash Flow Hedges: We designate derivatives as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to variability in cash flows related to forecasted transactions. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of AOCI, to the extent that the hedge relationships are effective, and amounts are reclassified from AOCI to earnings as the forecasted transactions occur. To the extent that any ineffectiveness exists in the hedge relationships, the amounts are recorded in current period earnings. Our cash flow hedges consist of interest rate swaps that are intended to hedge the variability in interest payments on some of our variable-rate assets through 2019. These hedges have the effect of converting some of our variable-rate assets to a fixed rate. We also have entered into forward foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to foreign currency denominated intercompany borrowings.      •    Free-Standing Derivatives: We use free-standing derivatives to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of residential MSRs, mortgage loan origination and purchase commitments and other interests held. We also categorize our customer accommodation derivatives and the related offsetting contracts as free-standing derivatives. Changes in the fair value of free-standing derivatives are recorded in earnings as a component of other non-interest income.  Balance Sheet Presentation  The following table summarizes the notional and fair values of our derivative instruments reported on our consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013. The fair value amounts are segregated by derivatives that are designated as accounting hedges and those that are not, and are further segregated by type of contract within those two categories.               123   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)    Table 9.1: Derivative Assets and Liabilities at Fair Value                                    June 30, 2014     December 31, 2013        Notional orContractualAmount     Derivative     Notional orContractualAmount     Derivatives      (Dollars in millions)      Assets       Liabilities         Assets       Liabilities      Derivatives designated as accounting hedges:                                 Interest rate contracts:                                 Fair value hedges    $ 19,871       $ 271       $ 69       $ 15,695       $ 289       $ 223      Cash flow hedges     16,925        49        49        12,825        0        149                                                                    Total interest rate contracts     36,796        320        118        28,520        289        372      Foreign exchange contracts:                                 Cash flow hedges     5,104        0        147        4,806        49        53                                                                    Total derivatives designated as accounting hedges     41,900        320        265        33,326        338        425                                                                    Derivatives not designated as accounting hedges:                                 Interest rate contracts covering:                                 MSRs(1)     733        5        1        353        0        7      Customer accommodation     26,869        369        190        25,365        405        209      Other interest rate exposures(2)     2,967        32        20        1,864        29        17                                                                    Total interest rate contracts     30,569        406        211        27,582        434        233      Foreign exchange contracts     212        22        0        1,422        184        37      Other contracts     522        0        12        1,094        3        15                                                                    Total derivatives not designated as accounting hedges     31,303        428        223        30,098        621        285                                                                    Total derivatives    $ 73,203       $ 748       $ 488       $ 63,424       $ 959       $ 710                                                                             (1)   MSRs include interest rate swaps and To Be Announced contracts used to hedge our MSR portfolio.        (2)  Other interest rate exposures include mortgage related derivatives.  Offsetting of Financial Assets and Liabilities  We execute the majority of our derivative transactions and repurchase agreements under master netting arrangements. Under our existing enforceable master netting arrangements, we generally have the right to offset exposure with the same counterparty. In addition, either counterparty can generally request the net settlement of all contracts through a single payment upon default on, or termination of, any one contract.  We present all of our derivative assets and liabilities and repurchase agreements on a gross basis on our consolidated balance sheets. The following table presents as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the gross and net fair values of our derivative assets and liabilities and repurchase agreements, as well as the related offsetting amount permitted under the accounting standards for offsetting assets and liabilities. Under the accounting standard, gross positive fair values could be offset against gross negative fair values by counterparty pursuant to legally enforceable master netting agreements, if the netting presentation method is elected. The table also includes cash and non-cash collateral received or pledged associated with such arrangements. The collateral amount related to repurchase agreements is limited to the outstanding balance, thus instance of overcollateralization is not shown.               124   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)    Table 9.2: Offsetting of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities                                                      Offsetting Amounts NotNetted            (Dollars in millions)   Gross Amounts      Offsetting Amounts      Net Amounts as Recognized      Financial Instruments      Collateral Received(1)      Net Exposure      As of June 30, 2014                                 Derivatives assets   $  748     $  0     $  748     $  (222)     $  (410)     $  116  (2)    As of December 31, 2013                                 Derivatives assets   $ 959     $ 0     $ 959     $ (262)     $ (450)     $ 247  (2)                            Offsetting Amounts NotNetted            (Dollars in millions)   Gross Amounts      Offsetting Amounts      Net Amounts as Recognized      Financial Instruments      Collateral Pledged      Net Exposure      As of June 30, 2014                                 Derivatives liabilities   $ 488     $ 0     $ 488     $ (222 )    $ (203 ) (1)    $ 63     Repurchase agreements     882       0       882       0       (882 )      0     As of December 31, 2013                                 Derivatives liabilities   $ 710     $ 0     $ 710     $ (262 )    $ (371 ) (1)    $ 77     Repurchase agreements     907       0       907       0       (907 )      0            (1)   When we receive or pledge collateral, we factor in accrued interest when calculating net positions with counterparties.        (2)   The majority of the net position relates to customer-accommodation derivatives. Customer-accommodation derivatives are cross-collateralized by the associated commercial loans and we do not require additional collateral on these transactions.  Credit Risk-Related Contingency Features and Collateral  Certain of our derivative contracts include provisions requiring that our debt maintain a credit rating of investment grade or above by each of the major credit rating agencies. In the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating below investment grade, some of our derivative counterparties would have the right to terminate the derivative contract and close out the existing positions, or demand immediate and ongoing full overnight collateralization on derivative instruments in a net liability position. Certain of our derivative contracts may also allow, in the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating of any kind, our derivative counterparties to demand additional collateralization on such derivative instruments in a net liability position. We have posted $203 million and $371 million as collateral for this exposure in the normal course of business as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. If our debt credit rating had fallen below investment grade, we would have been required to post an additional variation margin, which represents the impact of daily position mark-to-market calculations, of less than $1 million as of both June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013. In addition, we would have been required to post independent margin of $57 million and $58 million as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, in compliance with the terms of certain of our swap agreements. The fair value of derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features in a net liability position was less than $1 million and $1 million as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.  Derivative Counterparty Credit Risk  Derivative instruments contain an element of credit risk that arises from the potential failure of a counterparty to perform according to the contractual terms of the contract. Our exposure to derivative counterparty credit risk, at any point in time, is represented by the fair value of derivatives in a gain position, or derivative assets, assuming no recoveries of underlying collateral. To mitigate the risk of counterparty default, we maintain collateral agreements with certain derivative counterparties. These agreements typically require both parties to maintain               125   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)     collateral in the event the fair values of derivative financial instruments exceed established thresholds. We received cash collateral from derivatives counterparties totaling $399 million and $397 million as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. We also received securities from derivatives counterparties totaling $11 million and $53 million as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively, which we have the ability to re-pledge.  We record counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments on our derivative assets to properly reflect the credit quality of the counterparty. We consider collateral and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate our credit exposure to each counterparty in determining the counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment, which may be adjusted in future periods due to changes in the fair value of the derivative contract, collateral and creditworthiness of the counterparty. The cumulative counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as a reduction in the derivative asset balance was $5 million and $7 million as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. We also adjust the fair value of our derivative liabilities to reflect the impact of our credit quality. We calculate this adjustment by comparing the spreads on our credit default swaps to the discount benchmark curve. The cumulative credit risk valuation adjustment related to our credit quality recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as a reduction in the derivative liability balance was $1 million and $6 million as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.  During the second quarter of 2013, it became mandatory for Capital One to clear certain categories of derivative transactions through a central clearinghouse. We anticipate our cleared derivatives notional and margin amounts outstanding to grow in the future and expect our bilateral over-the-counter derivatives portfolio to shrink as additional categories of derivatives are mandated for clearing by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). As a result, over time, our counterparty credit risk is expected to shift from our bilateral counterparties and consolidate at central clearinghouses.

We expect to reclassify net after-tax losses of $108 million recorded in AOCI as of June 30, 2014, related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges to earnings over the next 12 months, which we expect to offset against the cash flows associated with the hedged forecasted transactions. The maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions were hedged was five years as of June 30, 2014. The amount we expect to reclassify into earnings may change as a result of changes in market conditions and ongoing actions taken as part of our overall risk management strategy.               128   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)       NOTE 10—ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME    The following table presents the components of accumulated other comprehensive income as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, as well as the current period activity related to our other comprehensive income.

The fair value accounting guidance provides a three-level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments. This hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable. Fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned to a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:           Level 1:    Valuation is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.      Level 2:    Valuation is based on observable market-based inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or models using inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data of substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.      Level 3:    Valuation is generated from techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. Valuation techniques include pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques.  The accounting guidance for fair value measurements requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in determining fair value. The accounting guidance provides for the irrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-contract basis, to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value at inception of the contract and record any subsequent changes in fair value in earnings. We have not made any material fair value option elections as of or for the periods disclosed herein.  Fair Value Governance and Control  We have a governance framework and a number of key controls that are intended to ensure that our fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable. Our governance framework provides for independent oversight and segregation of duties. Our control processes include review and approval of new transaction types, price verification and review of valuation judgments, methods, models, process controls and results. Groups independent from our trading and investing functions, including our Corporate Valuations Group (“CVG”), Fair Value Committee (“FVC”) and Model Validation Group (“MVG”), participate in the review and validation process. The fair valuation governance process is set up in a manner that allows the Chairperson of the FVC to escalate valuation disputes that cannot be resolved at the FVC to a more senior committee called the Valuations Advisory Committee (“VAC”) for resolution. The VAC is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and includes other members of senior management.  The CVG performs periodic independent verification of fair value measurements to determine if assigned fair values are reasonable. For example, in cases where we rely on third-party pricing services to obtain fair value measures, we analyze pricing variances among different pricing sources and validate the final price used by comparing the information to additional sources, including dealer pricing indications in transaction results and other internal sources, where necessary. Additional validation procedures performed by the CVG include reviewing (either directly or indirectly through the reasonableness of assigned fair values) valuation inputs and assumptions and monitoring acceptable variances between recommended prices and validation prices. The CVG and the Trade Analytics and Valuation (“TAV”) team perform due diligence reviews of the third-party pricing services by comparing their prices to those from other sources and reviewing other control documentation. Additionally, when necessary, the CVG and TAV challenge prices from third-party vendors to ensure reasonableness of prices through a pricing challenge process. This may include a request for transparency of the assumptions used by the third party.               133   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)    The FVC, which includes representation from our Risk Management and Finance divisions, is a forum for discussing fair market valuations, inputs, assumptions, methodologies, variance thresholds, valuation control environments and material risks or concerns related to fair market valuations. Additionally, the FVC is empowered to resolve valuation disputes between the primary valuation providers and the CVG. It provides guidance and oversight to ensure an appropriate valuation control environment. The FVC regularly reviews and approves our valuation methodologies to ensure that our methodologies and practices are consistent with industry standards and adhere to regulatory and accounting guidance. The Chief Financial Officer determines when material issues or concerns regarding valuations shall be raised to the Audit Committee or other delegated committee of the Board of Directors.  We have a model policy, established by an independent Model Risk Office, which governs the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for pricing. The MVG is part of the Model Risk Office and validates all models and provides ongoing monitoring of their performance, including the validation and monitoring of the performance of all valuation models.

Non-performance risk is reflected in other assets/liabilities on the balance sheet and offset through the income statement in other income.  The determination of the classification of financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy is performed at the end of each reporting period. We consider all available information, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs. Based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category, judgments are made regarding the significance of the unobservable inputs to the instruments’ fair value measurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. The process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 we had minimal movements between Levels 1 and 2.  Level 3 Recurring Fair Value Rollforward  The tables below present a reconciliation for all assets and liabilities measured and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). When assets and liabilities are transferred between levels, we recognize the transfer as of the end of the period.               135   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents

non-interest income. Gains (losses) related to Level 3 retained interests in securitizations are reported in servicing and securitizations income, which is a component of non-interest income.        (2)   The transfers out of Level 3 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 were primarily driven by greater consistency among multiple pricing sources. The transfers into Level 3 were primarily driven by less consistency among vendor pricing on individual securities.               137   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)        (3)   The amount presented for unrealized gains (losses) for assets still held as of the reporting date primarily represents impairments for securities available for sale, accretion on certain fixed maturity securities, change in fair value of derivative instruments and mortgage servicing rights transaction. Impairment is reported in total other-than-temporary impairment as a component of non-interest income.  Significant Level 3 Fair Value Asset and Liability Input Sensitivity  Changes in unobservable inputs may have a significant impact on fair value. Certain of these unobservable inputs will, in isolation, have a directionally consistent impact on the fair value of the instrument for a given change in that input. Alternatively, the fair value of the instrument may move in an opposite direction for a given change in another input. In general, an increase in the discount rate, default rates, loss severity and credit spreads, in isolation, would result in a decrease in the fair value measurement. In addition, an increase in default rates would generally be accompanied by a decrease in recovery rates, slower prepayment rates and an increase in liquidity spreads.  Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value Measurements  The following table presents the significant unobservable inputs relied upon to determine the fair values of our recurring Level 3 financial instruments. We utilize multiple third-party pricing services to obtain fair value measures for our securities. Several of our third-party pricing services are only able to provide unobservable input information for a limited number of securities due to software licensing restrictions. Other third-party pricing services are able to provide unobservable input information for all securities for which they provide a valuation. As a result, the unobservable input information for the securities available for sale presented below represents a composite summary of all information we are able to obtain for a majority of our securities. The unobservable input information for all other Level 3 financial instruments is based on the assumptions used in our internal valuation models.               138   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)    Table 12.3: Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements                         Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements      (Dollars in millions)   Fair Value atJune 30,2014     SignificantValuationTechniques    Significant Unobservable Inputs   Range     WeightedAverage     Assets:                        Securities available for sale:                        RMBS    $ 836       Discounted cash flows   (3rd party pricing)     Yield  Constant prepayment rate   Default rate  Loss severity            1-24%  0-20%  0-14%  0-75%                    5%  3%  7%  49%           CMBS    $ 449       Discounted cash flows   (3rd party pricing)     Yield  Constant prepayment rate               0-4%  0-100%  2-7%  1-3%  3-12%                        2%  9%  4%  2%  10%             Other ABS    $ 175       Discounted cash flows   (3rd party pricing)     Yield  Constant prepayment rate   Default rate   Loss severity       42-88%        71%      U.S. government guaranteed debt and other securities    $ 759       Discounted cash flows   (3rd party pricing)    Yield       0-4%        2%     Other assets:                        Consumer MSRs    $ 57       Discounted cash flows      Total prepayment rate  Discount rate  Servicing cost ($ per loan)         $  8-28%  9-21% 60.40-$185.22               $  11%  13% 76.16          Derivative assets    $ 50       Discounted cash flows     Swap rates       3%        3%      Retained interests in securitization(1)    $ 195       Discounted cash flows      Life of receivables (months)   Constant prepayment rate  Discount rate  Default rate  Loss severity              30-89   1-9%  4-14%  2-7%  18-99%                N/A      Liabilities:                        Other liabilities:                        Derivative liabilities    $ 37       Discounted cash flows    Swap rates      3%        3%                 139   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)                            Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements      (Dollars in millions)    Fair Value at  December 31, 2013       Significant Valuation  Techniques    Significant Unobservable Inputs   Range      Weighted Average     Assets:                        Securities available for sale:                        RMBS    $ 1,304        Discounted cash flows   (3rd party pricing)     Yield  Constant prepayment rate   Default rate  Loss severity            0-23%  0-21%  0-18%  0-95%                    5%  5%  8%  49%           CMBS    $ 739        Discounted cash flows   (3rd party pricing)     Yield  Constant prepayment rate        1-4%  0-20%            2%  3%       Other ABS    $ 343        Discounted cash flows  (3rd party pricing)     Yield  Constant prepayment rate  Default rate  Loss severity            1-8%  1-6%  1-19%  44-80%                    3%  2%  12%  69%            U.S. government guaranteed debt and other securities    $ 944        Discounted cash flows  (3rd party pricing)    Yield      0-3%        2%     Other assets:                        Consumer MSRs    $ 69       Discounted cash flows     Total prepayment rate  Discount rate  Servicing cost ($per loan)        $  9-32%  10-17% 81.39-$393.52               $  14%  11% 89.32          Derivative assets    $ 50       Discounted cash flows     Swap rates      3-4%        4%      Retained interests in securitization(1)    $ 199       Discounted cash flows     Life of receivables (months)   Constant prepayment rate  Discount rate  Default rate  Loss severity              34-101   2-7%  5-14%  2-7%  15-89%                N/A      Liabilities:                        Other liabilities:                        Derivative liabilities    $ 38       Discounted cash flows     Swap rates      3-4%        4%              (1)   Due to the nature of the various mortgage securitization structures in which we have retained interests, it is not meaningful to present a consolidated weighted average for the significant unobservable inputs.  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis  We are required to measure and recognize certain other assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in the consolidated balance sheets. These assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, when we evaluate for impairment). The following table presents the carrying amount of the assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and still held as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, and for which a nonrecurring fair value measurement was recorded during the six and twelve months then ended:               140   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)    Table 12.4: Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements Related to Assets Still Held at Period End                            June 30, 2014        Estimated Fair Value Hierarchy            (Dollars in millions)   Level 1     Level 2     Level 3     Total     Assets:                       Loans held for investment    $ 0       $ 0       $ 87       $ 87      Loans held for sale     0        31        0        31      Other assets(1)     0        0        48        48                                                Total    $ 0       $ 31       $ 135       $  166                                                                         December 31, 2013        Estimated Fair Value Hierarchy            (Dollars in millions)   Level 1     Level 2     Level 3     Total     Assets:                       Loans held for investment    $ 0       $ 0       $ 84       $ 84      Loans held for sale     0        145        0        145      Other assets(1)     0        0        64        64                                                Total    $ 0       $ 145       $ 148       $  293                                                         (1)  Includes foreclosed property and repossessed assets of $36 million and long-lived assets held for sale of $12 million as of June 30, 2014. Comparatively, includes foreclosed property and repossessed assets of $42 million and long-lived assets held for sale of $22 million as of December 31, 2013.  In the above table, loans held for investment primarily include nonperforming loans for which specific reserves or charge-offs have been recognized. These loans are classified as Level 3 as they are valued based in part on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral and the non-recoverable rate, which is considered to be a significant unobservable input. Collateral fair value sources include the appraisal value obtained from independent appraisers, broker pricing opinions, or other available market information. The non-recoverable rate ranged from 0% to 15%, with a weighted average of 10%, and from 0% to 42%, with a weighted average of 13% as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. The fair value of the other assets classified as Level 3 is determined based on appraisal value or listing price which involves significant judgment; the significant unobservable inputs and related quantitative information are not meaningful to disclose as they vary significantly across properties and collateral.  The following table presents total nonrecurring fair value measurements for the period, included in earnings, attributable to the change in fair value relating to assets that are still held at June 30, 2014 and 2013.

We applied the fair value provisions to the financial instruments not recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value, which include securities held to maturity, loans held for investment, interest receivable, interest-bearing deposits, securitized debt obligations, other borrowings and senior and subordinated notes. The provisions requiring us to maximize the use of observable inputs and to measure fair value using a notion of exit price were factored into our selection of inputs for our established valuation techniques.  Cash and Cash Equivalents  The carrying amounts of cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell and interest-bearing deposits with banks approximate fair value.  Restricted Cash for Securitization Investors  The carrying amounts of restricted cash for securitization investors approximate their fair value due to their relatively short-term nature.  Investment Securities  Quoted prices in active markets are used to measure the fair value of U.S. Treasury debt obligations. For other investment categories, we utilize multiple third-party pricing services to obtain fair value measurements for the large majority of our securities. A pricing service may be considered as the primary pricing provider for certain types of securities, and the designation of the primary pricing provider may vary depending on the type of securities. The determination of the primary pricing provider is based on our experience and validation benchmark of the pricing service’s performance in terms of providing fair value measurements for the various types of securities.               143   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)    Certain securities are classified as Level 2 and 3, the majority of which are collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage-backed securities. Level 2 and 3 classifications indicate that significant valuation assumptions are not consistently observable in the market. When significant assumptions are not consistently observable, fair values are derived using the best available data.  Such data may include quotes provided by a dealer, the use of external pricing services, independent pricing models, or other model-based valuation techniques such as calculation of the present values of future cash flows incorporating assumptions such as benchmark yields, spreads, prepayment speeds, credit ratings, and losses. The techniques used by the pricing services utilize observable market data to the extent available. Pricing models may be used, which can vary by asset class and may incorporate available trade, bid and other market information. Across asset classes, information such as trader/dealer input, credit spreads, forward curves, and prepayment speeds are used to help determine appropriate valuations. Because many fixed income securities do not trade on a daily basis, the evaluated pricing applications may apply available information through processes such as benchmarking curves, like securities, sector groupings, and matrix pricing to prepare valuations. In addition, model processes are used by the pricing services to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios.  We validate the pricing obtained from the primary pricing providers through comparison of pricing to additional sources, including other pricing services, dealer pricing indications in transaction results, and other internal sources. Pricing variances among different pricing sources are analyzed and validated. Additionally, on an on-going basis, we may select a sample of securities and test the third-party valuation by obtaining more detailed information about the pricing methodology, sources of information, and assumptions used to value the securities.  The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of our residential, asset-backed and commercial securities include yield, prepayment rate, default rate and loss severity in the event of default. Significant increases or decreases in any of those inputs in isolation or combination would result in a significant change in fair value measurement. Generally, an increase in the yield assumption will result in a decrease in fair value measurement, however, an increase or decrease in prepayment rate, default rate or loss severity may have a different impact on the fair value given various characteristics of the security including the capital structure of the deal, credit enhancement for the security or other factors.  Net Loans Held For Investment  Loans held for investment that are individually impaired are carried at the lower of cost or fair value of the underlying collateral, less the estimated cost to sell. The fair values of credit card loans, installment loans, auto loans, home loans and commercial loans are estimated using a discounted cash flow method, which is a form of the income approach. Discount rates are determined considering rates at which similar portfolios of loans would be made under current conditions and considering liquidity spreads applicable to each loan portfolio based on the secondary market. The fair value of credit card loans excludes any value related to customer account relationships. For those loans held for investment that are recorded at fair value within our consolidated balance sheets on a nonrecurring basis, the fair value is determined using appraisal values that are obtained from independent appraisers, broker pricing opinions or other available market information, adjusted for the estimated costs to transact the sale.  Due to the use of significant unobservable inputs, loans held for investment are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. Fair value adjustments for individually impaired collateralized loans held for investment are recorded in provision for credit losses on the consolidated statements of income.  Loans Held For Sale  Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost, net of deferred fees and deferred origination costs, or fair value. We originate loans with the intent to sell to government sponsored enterprises as part of a delegated underwriting and servicing (“DUS”) program. For DUS commercial loans, we believe the fair value               144   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)     approximates par value as this is the contractual price we receive from the purchaser. For all other loans classified as held for sale, the fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model or current secondary market prices for loan pools with similar characteristics. Loans held for sale that are valued at par or using a discounted cash flow model are classified as Level 2. Fair value adjustments to loans held for sale are recorded in other non-interest income on our consolidated statements of income.  Interest Receivable  The carrying amount of interest receivable approximates the fair value of this asset due to its relatively short-term nature.  Derivative Assets and Liabilities  We use both exchange-traded derivatives and OTC derivatives to manage our interest rate and foreign currency risk exposure. Quoted market prices are available and used for our exchange-traded derivatives, which we classify as Level 1. However, substantially all of our derivatives are traded in OTC markets where quoted market prices are not always readily available. Therefore, we value most OTC derivatives using valuation techniques, which include internally-developed models. We primarily rely on market observable inputs for our models, such as interest rate yield curves, credit curves, option volatility and currency rates, that vary depending on the type of derivative and nature of the underlying rate, price or index upon which the derivative’s value is based. Where model inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the model does not require significant judgment, such derivatives are typically classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. When instruments are traded in less liquid markets and significant inputs are unobservable, such as interest rate swaps whose remaining terms do not correlate with market observable interest rate yield curves, the derivatives are classified as Level 3.  The impact of counterparty non-performance risk is considered when measuring the fair value of derivative assets. These derivatives are included in other assets on the balance sheet.  We validate the pricing obtained from the internal models through comparison of pricing to additional sources, including external valuation agents and other internal sources. Pricing variances among different pricing sources are analyzed and validated.  Mortgage Servicing Rights  We record consumer MSRs at fair value on a recurring basis, while commercial MSRs are subsequently measured at amortized cost with impairment recognized as a reduction in other non-interest income. MSRs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices. Accordingly, we determine the fair value of MSRs using a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The model incorporates assumptions that market participants use in estimating future net servicing income, including estimates of prepayment speeds, discount rate, cost to service, contractual servicing fee income, ancillary income and late fees. Fair value measurements of MSRs use significant unobservable inputs and, accordingly, are classified as Level 3.  Retained Interests in Securitizations  We have retained interests in various mortgage securitization deals from previous acquisitions. Our retained interest includes rights to future cash flows arising from the receivables, the most significant being certificated interest-only bonds issued by the trust. We record our interest in these deals at fair value using valuation models to calculate the present value of future income. The model incorporates various assumptions that market participants use in estimating future income including weighted-average life, constant prepayment rate, discount rate, default rate and severity.               145   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)    Other Assets  Included in other assets are foreclosed property, other repossessed assets and long-lived assets held for sale. Foreclosed property and other repossessed assets are carried at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. The fair value is determined based on the appraisal value or listing price of the property or collateral provided by independent appraisers, and is adjusted for the estimated costs to transact the sale. Due to the use of significant unobservable inputs, foreclosed property is classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. Fair value adjustments for foreclosed property are recorded in other non-interest expense on the consolidated statements of income. Foreclosed property and repossessed assets, which we report on our consolidated balance sheets under other assets, totaled $117 million and $158 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2014, compared with $113 million and $160 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2013.  Long-lived assets held for sale are also subject to fair value measurement on a nonrecurring basis, and carried at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. The fair value is determined based on the appraisal value or listing price of the property or collateral provided by independent appraisers, and is adjusted for the estimated costs to transact the sale. Due to the use of significant unobservable inputs, long-lived assets held for sale are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. Fair value adjustments for long-lived assets are recorded in other non-interest expense on the consolidated statements of income.  Non-Interest Bearing Deposits  The carrying amount of non-interest bearing deposits approximates fair value.  Interest-bearing Deposits  The fair value of interest-bearing deposits is determined based on discounted expected cash flows using discount rates consistent with current market rates for similar products with similar remaining terms.  Securitized Debt Obligations  We utilized multiple third-party pricing services to obtain fair value measurements for the large majority of our securitized debt obligations. The techniques used by the pricing services utilize observable market data to the extent available; and pricing models may be used which incorporate available trade, bid and other market information as described in the above section. We used internal pricing models, discounted cash flow models or similar techniques to estimate the fair value of certain securitization trusts where third-party pricing was not available.  Senior and Subordinated Notes  We engage multiple third-party pricing services in order to estimate the fair value of senior and subordinated notes. The pricing service utilizes a pricing model that incorporates available trade, bid and other market information. It also incorporates spread assumptions, volatility assumptions and relevant credit information into the pricing models.  Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Loaned or Sold under Agreements to Repurchase and Other Borrowings  The carrying amount of federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements approximates fair value. The fair value of FHLB advances is determined based on discounted expected cash flows using discount rates consistent with current market rates for FHLB advances with similar remaining terms.  Interest Payable  The carrying amount of interest payable approximates the fair value of this liability due to its relatively short-term nature.               146   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)       NOTE 13—BUSINESS SEGMENTS    Our principal operations are currently organized into three major business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group, are included in the “Other” category.  Basis of Presentation  We report the results of each of our business segments on a continuing operations basis. See “Note 2—Discontinued Operations” for a discussion of discontinued operations. The results of our individual businesses reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources.  Business Segment Reporting Methodology  The results of our business segments are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. Our internal management and reporting process used to derive our segment results employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. Our funds transfer pricing process provides a funds credit for sources of funds, such as deposits generated by our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses, and a funds charge for the use of funds by each segment. Due to the integrated nature of our business segments, estimates and judgments have been made in allocating certain revenue and expense items. Transactions between segments are based on specific criteria or approximate third-party rates. We regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods. We provide additional information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in “Note 19—Business Segments” in our 2013 Form 10-K.  Segment Results and Reconciliation  We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment.  The following tables present our business segment results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, selected balance sheet data as of June 30, 2014 and 2013, and a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated income from continuing operations, assets and deposits. Prior period amounts have been recast to conform to the current period.               147   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO

(COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)            (1)  In the first quarter of 2014, we adopted the proportional amortization method of accounting for Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for expanded discussion. Prior periods have been recast to conform to this presentation.       NOTE 14—COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES, GUARANTEES, AND OTHERS    Guarantees  We have credit exposure on agreements that we entered into to absorb a portion of the risk of loss on certain manufactured housing securitizations issued by GreenPoint Credit LLC in 2000. Our maximum credit exposure related to these agreements totaled $14 million and $16 million as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. These agreements are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities. The value of our obligations under these agreements was $13 million and $15 million as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.  See “Note 6—Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations” for additional information about our manufactured housing securitization transactions.  Letters of Credit and Loss Sharing Agreements  We issue letters of credit (financial standby, performance standby and commercial) to meet the financing needs of our customers. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party in a borrowing arrangement. Commercial letters of credit are short-term commitments issued primarily to facilitate trade finance activities for customers and are generally collateralized by the goods being shipped to the client. Collateral requirements are similar to those for funded transactions and are established based on management’s credit assessment of the customer. Management conducts regular reviews of all outstanding letters of credit and customer acceptances, and the results of these reviews are considered in assessing the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses.  On November 1, 2013, we acquired Beech Street Capital, a privately-held, DUS lender that originates multifamily commercial loans with the intent to sell to a government-sponsored enterprise (“GSE”). We enter into loss sharing agreements with Fannie Mae upon the sale of the DUS commercial loans. Under these agreements, losses on the covered loans are shared on a pari passu basis over the life of the loans. At inception, we record a liability representing the fair value of our obligation which is subsequently amortized as we are released from risk of payment under the loss sharing agreement. If payment under the loss sharing agreement becomes probable and estimable, an additional liability may be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and a non-interest expense may be recognized on the consolidated statements of income. The associated MSRs will also be reviewed for impairment annually.  We had standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit with contractual amounts of $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. The carrying value of outstanding letters of credit, which we include in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, was $3 million and $4 million as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. These financial guarantees had expiration dates ranging from 2014 to 2025 as of June 30, 2014. The amount of liability recognized on our balance sheet for Fannie Mae and other loss sharing agreements was $33 million and $14 million as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. No additional collateral or recourse provisions exist to reduce this exposure.  U.K. Cross Sell  In the U.K., we previously sold payment protection insurance (“PPI”) and other ancillary cross sell products. In response to an elevated level of customer complaints across the industry, heightened media coverage and pressure from consumer advocacy groups, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) investigated and raised               150   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)     concerns about the way some companies have handled complaints related to the sale of these insurance policies. In connection with this matter, we have established a reserve related to U.K. cross sell products, including PPI, which totaled $169 million as of both June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013. The addition to the reserve this quarter has been offset by utilization through anticipated redress payments in the first half of the year. The increase in the reserve reflects an increased expectation of claims as a result of the rate of decline in the volume of claims being lower than previously expected. While the reserve currently reflects management’s best estimate, there remains uncertainty about the number of customer claims, It is possible that we may further add to reserves if we determine that we need to change the calculation used to determine customer refunds.  Potential Mortgage Representation and Warranty Liabilities  We acquired three subsidiaries that originated residential mortgage loans and sold these loans to various purchasers, including purchasers who created securitization trusts. These subsidiaries are Capital One Home Loans, LLC, which was acquired in February 2005; GreenPoint, which was acquired in December 2006 as part of the North Fork acquisition; and CCB, which was acquired in February 2009 and subsequently merged into CONA (collectively, “the subsidiaries”).  In connection with their sales of mortgage loans, the subsidiaries entered into agreements containing varying representations and warranties about, among other things, the ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing the loan, the loan’s compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the purchaser, including underwriting guidelines and the existence of mortgage insurance, and the loan’s compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws. The representations and warranties do not address the credit performance of the mortgage loans, but mortgage loan performance often influences whether a claim for breach of representation and warranty will be asserted and has an effect on the amount of any loss in the event of a breach of a representation or warranty.  Each of these subsidiaries may be required to repurchase mortgage loans in the event of certain breaches of these representations and warranties. In the event of a repurchase, the subsidiary is typically required to pay the unpaid principal balance of the loan together with interest and certain expenses (including, in certain cases, legal costs incurred by the purchaser and/or others). The subsidiary then recovers the loan or, if the loan has been foreclosed, the underlying collateral. The subsidiary is exposed to any losses on the repurchased loans after giving effect to any recoveries on the collateral. In some instances, rather than repurchase the loans, a subsidiary may agree to make cash payments to make an investor whole on losses or to settle repurchase claims, possibly including claims for attorneys’ fees and interest. In addition, our subsidiaries may be required to indemnify certain purchasers and others against losses they incur as a result of certain breaches of representations and warranties.  These subsidiaries, in total, originated and sold to non-affiliates approximately $111 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans between 2005 and 2008, which are the years (or “vintages”) with respect to which our subsidiaries have received the vast majority of the repurchase requests and other related claims.  The following table presents the original principal balance of mortgage loan originations, by vintage for 2005 through 2008, for the three general categories of purchasers of mortgage loans and the estimated unpaid principal balance as of June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013:               151   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)    Table 14.1: Unpaid Principal Balance of Mortgage Loans Originated and Sold to Third Parties Based on Category of Purchaser                                        EstimatedUnpaid Principal Balance     Original Principal Balance      (Dollars in billions)   June 30,2014     December 31,2013      Total       2008       2007       2006       2005      Government-sponsored enterprises (“GSEs”)(1)    $ 3       $ 3       $ 11       $ 1       $ 4       $ 3       $ 3      Insured Securitizations     4        5        20        0        2        8        10      Uninsured Securitizations and Other     17        18        80        3        15        30        32                                                                              Total    $  24       $  26       $  111       $  4       $  21       $  41       $  45                                                                                     (1)   GSEs include Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  Between 2005 and 2008, our subsidiaries sold an aggregate amount of $11 billion in original principal balance mortgage loans to the GSEs.  Of the $20 billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans sold directly by our subsidiaries to private-label purchasers who placed the loans into securitizations supported by bond insurance (“Insured Securitizations”), approximately 48% of the original principal balance was covered by bond insurance. Further, approximately $16 billion original principal balance was placed in securitizations as to which the monoline bond insurers have made repurchase requests or loan file requests to one of our subsidiaries (“Active Insured Securitizations”) and the remaining approximately $4 billion original principal balance was placed in securitizations as to which the monoline bond insurers have not made repurchase requests or loan file requests to one of our subsidiaries (“Inactive Insured Securitizations”). Insured Securitizations often allow the monoline bond insurer to act independently of the investors. Bond insurers typically have indemnity agreements directly with both the mortgage originators and the securitizers, and they often have super-majority rights within the trust documentation that allow them to direct trustees to pursue mortgage repurchase requests without coordination with other investors.  Because we do not service most of the loans our subsidiaries sold to others, we do not have complete information about the current ownership of a portion of the $80 billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans not sold directly to GSEs or placed in Insured Securitizations. We have determined based on information obtained from third-party databases that about $48 billion original principal balance of these mortgage loans is currently held by private-label publicly issued securitizations not supported by bond insurance (“Uninsured Securitizations”). An additional approximately $22 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans were initially sold to private investors as whole loans. Various known and unknown investors purchased the remaining $10 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans.  With respect to the $111 billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans originated and sold to others between 2005 and 2008, we estimate that approximately $24 billion in unpaid principal balance remains outstanding as of June 30, 2014, of which approximately $5 billion in unpaid principal balance is at least 90 days delinquent. Approximately $21 billion in losses have been realized by third parties. Because we do not service most of the loans we sold to others, we do not have complete information about the underlying credit performance levels for some of these mortgage loans. These amounts reflect our best estimates, including extrapolations of underlying credit performance where necessary. These estimates could change as we get additional data or refine our analysis.  The subsidiaries had open repurchase requests relating to approximately $2.7 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans as of June 30, 2014, compared with $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2013. Currently, repurchase demands predominantly relate to the 2006 and 2007 vintages. We have received relatively few repurchase demands from the 2008 and 2009 vintages, mostly because GreenPoint ceased originating mortgages in August 2007.               152   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)    The following table presents information on pending repurchase requests by counterparty category and timing of initial repurchase request.

Accordingly, repurchase requests denied by our subsidiaries and not pursued by the counterparty remain in the open pipeline, with the exception of certain aged repurchase requests submitted by parties without contractual standing to pursue such requests, which may be removed from the pipeline. Finally, the amounts reflected in this chart are the original principal balance amounts of the mortgage loans at issue and do not correspond to the losses our subsidiary would incur upon the repurchase of these loans.  The following table summarizes changes in our representation and warranty reserves for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013:  Table 14.3: Changes in Representation and Warranty Reserve                            Three Months EndedJune 30,     Six Months EndedJune 30,      (Dollars in millions)    2014       2013       2014       2013      Representation and warranty repurchase reserve, beginning of period(1)    $ 1,128      $ 994       $ 1,172       $ 899      Provision (benefit) for mortgage representation and warranty losses:                       Recorded in continuing operations     (29)       (4)       (15)       (14)     Recorded in discontinued operations     11        187        (36)       294                                                Total provision (benefit) for mortgage representation and warranty losses     (18)       183        (51)       280      Net realized losses     (98)       (21)       (109)       (23)                                               Representation and warranty repurchase reserve, end of period(1)    $  1,012      $  1,156       $  1,012       $  1,156                                                         (1)   Reported on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities.  As indicated in the table below, most of the reserves relate to the $27 billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans sold directly to the GSEs or to the Active Insured Securitizations.               153   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)    Table 14.4: Allocation of Representation and Warranty Reserves                        Reserve Liability            (Dollars in millions, except for loans sold)   June 30, 2014     December 31,2013     Loans Sold2005 to 2008(1)     Selected period-end data:                  GSEs and Active Insured Securitizations    $ 783       $ 965       $ 27      Inactive Insured Securitizations and Others     229        207        84                                      Total    $  1,012       $ 1,172       $ 111                                               (1)  Reflects, in billions, the total original principal balance of mortgage loans originated by our subsidiaries and sold to third-party investors between 2005 and 2008.  In establishing reserves for the $11 billion original principal balance of GSE loans, we rely on the historical relationship between GSE loan losses and repurchase outcomes for each GSE, adjusted for any settlements, to estimate: (1) the percentage of current and future GSE loan defaults that we anticipate will result in repurchase requests from the GSEs over the lifetime of the GSE loans; and (2) the percentage of those repurchase requests that we anticipate will result in actual repurchases. We rely on estimated collateral valuations and loss forecast models to estimate our lifetime liability on GSE loans. This reserving approach to the GSE loans reflects the historical interaction with the GSEs around repurchase requests and also includes anticipated repurchases resulting from mortgage insurance rescissions. Although our assumed future claims rate considers the most recent claims experience and actual repurchases, an increase in GSE claims and/or repurchases could result in an increase in our reserve. We have entered into and completed repurchase or settlement agreements with respect to the majority of our exposure within this category.  Our reserves also could be impacted by any claims which may be brought by governmental agencies under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (“FIRREA”), the False Claims Act, or other federal or state statutes. For example, GreenPoint and Capital One have received requests for information and/or subpoenas from various governmental regulators and law enforcement authorities, including members of the RMBS Working Group, relating to the origination of loans for sale to the GSEs and to RMBS participants. We are cooperating with these regulators and other authorities in responding to such requests.  For the $16 billion original principal balance in Active Insured Securitizations, our reserving approach reflects our historical interaction with monoline bond insurers around repurchase requests. Typically, monoline bond insurers allege a very high repurchase rate with respect to the mortgage loans in the Active Insured Securitization category. In response to these repurchase requests, our subsidiaries typically request information from the monoline bond insurers demonstrating that the contractual requirements around a valid repurchase request have been satisfied. In response to these requests for supporting documentation, monoline bond insurers typically initiate litigation. Accordingly, our reserves within the Active Insured Securitization category are not based upon the historical repurchase rate with monoline bond insurers, but rather upon the expected resolution of litigation with the monoline bond insurers. Every bond insurer within this category is pursuing a substantially similar litigation strategy either through active or probable litigation. Accordingly, our representation and warranty reserves for this category are litigation reserves.  In establishing litigation reserves for this category, we consider the current and future monoline insurer losses inherent within the securitization and apply legal judgment to the anticipated factual and legal record to estimate the lifetime legal liability for each securitization. We rely on our own past monoline settlement ratios in addition to considering publicly available industry monoline settlement ratios to establish these reserves. Our reserves with respect to the U.S. Bank Litigation, and the DBSP Litigation, in each case as referenced below, are               154   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)     contained within the Active Insured Securitization reserve category. Further, to the extent we have litigation reserves with respect to indemnification risks from certain representation and warranty lawsuits brought by monoline bond insurers against third-party securitizations sponsors, where one of our subsidiaries provided some or all of the mortgage collateral within the securitization but is not a defendant in the litigation, such reserves are also contained within this category.  For the $4 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans in the Inactive Insured Securitizations category and the $48 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans in the Uninsured Securitizations category, we establish reserves based on an assessment of probable and estimable legal liability, if any, utilizing both our own experience and publicly available industry settlement information to estimate lifetime liability. In contrast with the bond insurers in the Insured Securitizations, investors in Uninsured Securitizations often face a number of legal and logistical hurdles before they can force a securitization trustee to pursue mortgage repurchases, including the need to coordinate with a certain percentage of investors holding the securities and to indemnify the trustee for any litigation it undertakes. Accordingly, we only reserve for such exposures when a trustee or investor with standing brings claims and it is probable we have incurred a loss. Some Uninsured Securitization investors from this category are currently suing investment banks and securitization sponsors under federal and/or state securities laws. Although we face some indirect indemnity risks from these litigations, we generally have not established reserves with respect to these indemnity risks because we do not consider them to be both probable and reasonably estimable liabilities. In addition, to the extent we have litigation reserves with respect to indemnification risks from certain representation and warranty lawsuits brought by parties who purchased loans from our subsidiaries and subsequently re-sold the loans into securitizations, such reserves are also contained within this category.  For the $22 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans sold to private investors as whole loans, we establish reserves by relying on our historical and anticipated claims and repurchase rates to estimate lifetime liability.  The aggregate reserves for all three subsidiaries totaled $1.0 billion as of June 30, 2014, compared with $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2013. We recorded a total benefit for mortgage representation and warranty losses of $51 million in the six months ended June 30, 2014, which was primarily driven by legal developments with respect to probable and estimable losses. During the six months ended June 30, 2014, we had settlements totaling $109 million that were charged against the reserves.  As part of our business planning processes, we have considered various outcomes relating to the potential future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are possible but do not rise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying an incremental accrual under applicable accounting standards. Our current best estimate of reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond what was in our reserve as of June 30, 2014 is approximately $2.5 billion, a decline from our estimate of $2.6 billion at December 31, 2013. The estimate as of June 30, 2014 covers all reasonably possible losses relating to representation and warranty claim activity, including those relating to the U.S. Bank Litigation, the DBSP Litigation, the FHFA Litigation, and the LXS Trust Litigation.  In estimating reasonably possible future losses in excess of our current reserves, we assume a portion of the inactive securitizations become active and for all Insured Securitizations, we assume loss rates on the high end of those observed in monoline settlements or court rulings. For our remaining GSE exposures, Uninsured Securitizations and whole loan exposures, our reasonably possible risk estimates assume lifetime loss rates and claims rates at the highest levels of our past experience and also consider the limited instances of observed settlements. We do not assume claim rates or loss rates for these risk categories will be as high as those assumed for the Active Insured Securitizations, however, based on industry precedent. Should the number of claims or the loss rates on these claims increase significantly, our estimate of reasonably possible risk would increase               155   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)     materially. We also assume that we will resolve any loan repurchase requests relating to loans originated more than six years ago at a discount as compared to those originated within six years of a repurchase claim because of the pending legal arguments in various matters concerning the applicable statute of limitations.  Notwithstanding our ongoing attempts to estimate a reasonably possible amount of future losses beyond our current accrual levels based on current information, it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and our current estimate of the amount of reasonably possible losses. Our reserve and reasonably possible estimates involve considerable judgment and reflect that there is still significant uncertainty regarding numerous factors that may impact the ultimate loss levels, including, but not limited to: litigation outcomes; court rulings; governmental enforcement decisions; future repurchase and indemnification claim levels; securitization trustees pursuing mortgage repurchase litigation unilaterally or in coordination with investors; investors successfully pursuing repurchase litigation independently and without the involvement of the trustee as a party; ultimate repurchase and indemnification rates; future mortgage loan performance levels; actual recoveries on the collateral; and macroeconomic conditions (including unemployment levels and housing prices). In light of the significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability our subsidiaries may incur from these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period.  Litigation  In accordance with the current accounting standards for loss contingencies, we establish reserves for litigation related matters when it is probable that a loss associated with a claim or proceeding has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Litigation claims and proceedings of all types are subject to many uncertain factors that generally cannot be predicted with assurance. Below we provide a description of potentially material legal proceedings and claims.  For some of the matters disclosed below, we are able to determine estimates of potential future outcomes that are not probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying either the establishment of a reserve or an incremental reserve build, but which are reasonably possible outcomes. For other disclosed matters, such an estimate is not possible at this time. For those matters below where an estimate is possible (excluding the reasonably possible future losses relating to the U.S. Bank Litigation, the DBSP Litigation, the FHFA Litigation, and the LXS Trust Litigation, because reasonably possible losses with respect to those litigations are included within the reasonably possible representation and warranty liabilities discussed above) management currently estimates the reasonably possible future losses could be approximately $250 million. Notwithstanding our attempt to estimate a reasonably possible range of loss beyond our current accrual levels for some litigation matters based on current information, it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and the range of reasonably possible losses disclosed here. Given the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from these litigation matters and an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period.  Interchange Litigation  In 2005, a number of entities, each purporting to represent a class of retail merchants, filed antitrust lawsuits (the “Interchange Lawsuits”) against MasterCard and Visa and several member banks, including our subsidiaries and us, alleging among other things, that the defendants conspired to fix the level of interchange fees. The complaints seek injunctive relief and civil monetary damages, which could be trebled. Separately, a number of large merchants have asserted similar claims against Visa and MasterCard only. In October 2005, the class and merchant Interchange Lawsuits were consolidated before the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for certain purposes, including discovery. In July 2012, the parties executed and filed with the court a               156   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)     Memorandum of Understanding agreeing to resolve the litigation on certain terms set forth in a settlement agreement attached to the Memorandum. The class settlement provides for, among other things, (i) payments by defendants to the class and individual plaintiffs totaling approximately $6.6 billion; (ii) a distribution to the class merchants of an amount equal to 10 basis points of certain interchange transactions for a period of eight months; and (iii) modifications to certain Visa and MasterCard rules regarding point of sale practices. This agreement is contingent on final court approval of the class settlement. In November 2012, the court granted preliminary approval of the class settlement. In December 2013, the court granted final approval of the proposed class settlement, which was appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in January 2014. Several merchant plaintiffs have also opted out of the class settlement, some of which have sued MasterCard, Visa and various member banks, including Capital One (collectively “the Opt-Out Plaintiffs”). Relatedly, in December 2013, individual consumer plaintiffs also filed a proposed national class action against a number of banks, including Capital One, alleging that because the banks conspired to fix interchange fees, consumers were forced to pay more for the fees than appropriate. These cases are in their preliminary stages.  As members of Visa, our subsidiary banks have indemnification obligations to Visa with respect to final judgments and settlements, including the Interchange Lawsuits. In the first quarter of 2008, Visa completed an IPO of its stock. With IPO proceeds, Visa established an escrow account for the benefit of member banks to fund certain litigation settlements and claims, including the Interchange Lawsuits. As a result, in the first quarter of 2008, we reduced our Visa-related indemnification liabilities of $91 million recorded in other liabilities with a corresponding reduction of other non-interest expense. We made an election in accordance with the accounting guidance for fair value option for financial assets and liabilities on the indemnification guarantee to Visa, and the fair value of the guarantee as of June 30, 2014 was zero. Separately, in January 2011, we entered into a MasterCard Settlement and Judgment Sharing Agreement, along with other defendant banks, which apportions between MasterCard and its member banks the costs and liabilities of any judgment or settlement arising from the Interchange Lawsuits.  In March 2011, a furniture store owner named Mary Watson filed a proposed class action in the Supreme Court of British Columbia against Visa, MasterCard, and several banks, including Capital One (the “Watson Litigation”). The lawsuit asserts, among other things, that the defendants conspired to fix the merchant discount fees that merchants pay on credit card transactions in violation of Section 45 of the Competition Act and seeks unspecified damages and injunctive relief. In addition, Capital One has been named as a defendant in similar proposed class action claims filed in other jurisdictions in Canada. In March 2014, the court granted a partial motion for class certification, and in April 2014 both plaintiffs and defendants filed a notice to appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia.  Late Fees Litigation  In 2007, a number of individual plaintiffs, each purporting to represent a class of cardholders, filed antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against several issuing banks, including COBNA. These lawsuits allege, among other things, that the defendants conspired to fix the level of late fees and over-limit fees charged to cardholders, and that these fees are excessive. In May 2007, the cases were consolidated for all purposes, and a consolidated amended complaint was filed alleging violations of federal statutes and state law. The amended complaint requests civil monetary damages, which could be trebled, and injunctive relief. In November 2007, the court dismissed the amended complaint. Plaintiffs appealed that order to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The plaintiffs’ appeal challenges the dismissal of their claims under the National Bank Act, the Depository Institutions Deregulation Act of 1980 and the California Unfair Competition Law (the “UCL”), but not their antitrust conspiracy claims. In January, 2014, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower court’s dismissal of the case. In April 2014, plaintiffs filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the United States Supreme Court, which was denied by the Supreme Court in July 2014.               157   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)    Credit Card Interest Rate Litigation  The Capital One Bank Credit Card Interest Rate Multi-district Litigation matter was created as a result of a June 2010 transfer order issued by the United States Judicial Panel on Multi-district Litigation (“MDL”), which consolidated for pretrial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia two pending putative class actions against COBNA-Nancy Mancuso, et al. v. Capital One Bank (USA), N.A., et al., (E.D. Virginia); and Kevin S. Barker, et al. v. Capital One Bank (USA), N.A., (N.D. Georgia), A third action, Jennifer L. Kolkowski v. Capital One Bank (USA), N.A., (C.D. California) was subsequently transferred into the MDL. In August 2010, the plaintiffs in the MDL filed a Consolidated Amended Complaint. The Consolidated Amended Complaint alleges in a putative class action that COBNA breached its contractual obligations, and violated the Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”), the California Consumers Legal Remedies Act, the UCL, the California False Advertising Act, the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act, and the Kansas Consumer Protection Act when it raised interest rates on certain credit card accounts. The MDL plaintiffs seek statutory damages, restitution, attorney’s fees and an injunction against future rate increases. Fact discovery is now closed. In August 2011, Capital One filed a motion for summary judgment, which remains pending with the court. In July 2013, the MDL plaintiffs filed a supplemental opposition to Capital One’s motion for summary judgment. In April 2014, the MDL was reassigned to a new Judge in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. As a result of a settlement in another matter, the California-based UCL and TILA claims in the MDL are extinguished.  Mortgage Repurchase Litigation  In February 2009, GreenPoint was named as a defendant in a lawsuit commenced in the New York County Supreme Court, by U.S. Bank, N. A., Syncora Guarantee Inc. and CIFG Assurance North America, Inc. (the “U.S. Bank Litigation”). Plaintiffs allege, among other things, that GreenPoint breached certain representations and warranties in two contracts pursuant to which GreenPoint sold approximately 30,000 mortgage loans having an aggregate original principal balance of approximately $1.8 billion to a purchaser that ultimately transferred most of these mortgage loans to a securitization trust. Some of the securities issued by the trust were insured by two of the plaintiffs: Syncora and CIFG. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and an order compelling GreenPoint to repurchase the entire portfolio of 30,000 mortgage loans based on alleged breaches of representations and warranties relating to a limited sampling of loans in the portfolio, or, alternatively, the repurchase of specific mortgage loans to which the alleged breaches of representations and warranties relate. In March 2010, the court granted GreenPoint’s motion to dismiss with respect to plaintiffs Syncora and CIFG and denied the motion with respect to U.S. Bank. GreenPoint subsequently answered the complaint with respect to U.S. Bank, denying the allegations, and filed a counterclaim against U.S. Bank alleging breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In February 2012, the court denied plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file an amended complaint and dismissed Syncora and CIFG from the case. Syncora and CIFG appealed their dismissal to the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department (the “First Department”), which affirmed the dismissal in April 2013. The New York Court of Appeals denied Syncora’s and CIFG’s motion for leave to appeal the First Department’s decision in February 2014.  In September 2010, DB Structured Products, Inc. (“DBSP”) named GreenPoint in a third-party complaint, filed in the New York County Supreme Court, alleging breach of contract and seeking indemnification (the “DBSP Litigation”). In the underlying suit, Assured Guaranty Municipal Corp. (“AGM”) sued DBSP for alleged breaches of representations and warranties made by DBSP with respect to certain residential mortgage loans that collateralize a securitization insured by AGM and sponsored by DBSP. DBSP purchased the HELOC loans from GreenPoint in 2006. The entire securitization, almost all of which is insured by AGM, is comprised of loans with an aggregate original principal balance of approximately $353 million. DBSP asserts that any liability it faces lies with GreenPoint, alleging that DBSP’s representations and warranties to AGM are substantially similar to the representations and warranties made by GreenPoint to DBSP. GreenPoint filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in October 2010, which the court denied in July 2011.               158   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)    In October 2012, CONA as successor to CCB, was named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the Southern District of New York by Ambac Assurance Corporation and the Segregated Account of Ambac Assurance Corporation (the “Ambac Litigation”). Plaintiffs allege, among other things, that CONA (as successor to CCB) breached certain representations and warranties in contracts relating to six securitizations with an aggregate original principal balance of approximately $5.2 billion which were sponsored by a CCB affiliate in 2006 and 2007 and backed by loans originated by CCB. Almost half of the securities issued by the six trusts are insured by Ambac. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages, an order compelling CONA to indemnify Ambac for all accrued and future damages based on alleged breaches of representations and warranties relating to a limited sampling of loans in the portfolio, the repurchase of specific mortgage loans to which the alleged breaches of representations and warranties relate, and all related fees, costs, and interest. The parties have resolved the matter and the court entered a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice in June 2014.  In May, June, and July 2012, FHFA (acting as conservator for Freddie Mac) filed three summons with notice in the New York state court against GreenPoint, on behalf of the trustees for three RMBS trusts backed by loans originated by GreenPoint with an aggregate original principal balance of $3.4 billion. In January 2013, the plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint in the name of the three trusts, acting by the respective trustees, alleging breaches of contractual representations and warranties regarding compliance with GreenPoint underwriting guidelines relating to certain loans (the “FHFA Litigation”). Plaintiffs seek specific performance of the repurchase obligations with respect to the loans for which they have provided notice of alleged breaches as well as all other allegedly breaching loans, rescissory damages, indemnification, costs and interest. The court denied GreenPoint’s motion to dismiss in March 2014.  In July 2013, Lehman XS Trust, Series 2006-4N, by its trustee U.S. Bank, N.A. filed a lawsuit in the Southern District of New York against GreenPoint alleging breaches of representations and warranties made in certain loan sale agreements, pursuant to which GreenPoint sold mortgage loans with an original principal balance of $915 million to Lehman Brothers for securitization and sale to investors. The lawsuit (“the LXS Trust Litigation”) seeks specific performance of GreenPoint’s obligation to repurchase certain allegedly breaching loans, or in the alternative, the repurchase of all loans in the trust, the award of rescissory damages, costs, fees and interest. In January 2014, the court granted GreenPoint’s motion to dismiss based on the statute of limitations, ruling that New York’s six-year statute of limitations began running no later than the time of the mortgage securitization. The plaintiff has appealed the dismissal of the complaint.  As noted above in the section entitled Potential Mortgage Representation and Warranty Liabilities, the Company’s subsidiaries establish reserves with respect to representation and warranty litigation matters, where appropriate, within the Company’s overall representation and warranty reserves. Please see above for more details.  New York District Attorney’s Office Investigation  Capital One has received subpoenas and testimony requests from the New York District Attorney’s office with respect to certain check casher clients of the Commercial Banking business and Capital One’s anti-money laundering program. Capital One is cooperating with the investigation.  Checking Account Overdraft Litigation  In May 2010, Capital One Financial Corporation and COBNA were named as defendants in a putative class action named Steen v. Capital One Financial Corporation, et al., filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Plaintiff challenges practices relating to fees for overdraft and non-sufficient funds fees on consumer checking accounts. Plaintiff alleges that our methodology for posting transactions to customer accounts was designed to maximize the generation of overdraft fees, supporting claims for breach of contract, breach of               159   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)     the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unconscionability, conversion, unjust enrichment and violations of state unfair trade practices laws. Plaintiff seeks a range of remedies, including restitution, disgorgement, injunctive relief, punitive damages and attorneys’ fees. In May 2010, the case was transferred to the Southern District of Florida for coordinated pre-trial proceedings as part of a multi-district litigation (MDL) involving numerous defendant banks, captioned In re Checking Account Overdraft Litigation. In January 2011, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint against CONA in the MDL court. In February 2011, CONA filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. In March 2011, the MDL court granted CONA’s motion to dismiss claims of breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Texas law, but denied the motion to dismiss in all other respects. In June 2012, the MDL court granted plaintiff’s motion for class certification. The modified scheduling order entered by the MDL court contemplates the conclusion of discovery in the third quarter of 2014 and we anticipate a remand to the Eastern District of Louisiana in the fourth quarter of 2014.  Hawaii, Mississippi, Missouri and New Mexico State Attorney General Payment Protection Matters  In April 2012, the Attorney General of Hawaii filed a lawsuit in First Circuit Court in Hawaii against Capital One Bank (USA) N.A., and Capital One Services, LLC. The case is one of several similar lawsuits filed by the Attorney General of Hawaii against various banks challenging the marketing and sale of payment protection and credit monitoring products. In June 2012, the Attorney General of Mississippi filed substantially similar suits against Capital One and several other banks. In April 2013, the Attorney General of New Mexico also filed substantially similar suits against Capital One and several other banks. All three state attorney general complaints allege that Capital One enrolls customers in such programs without their consent and that Capital One enrolls customers in such programs in circumstances in which the customer is not eligible to receive benefits for the product in question. All suits allege unjust enrichment and violation of Unfair and Deceptive Practices Act statutes. The remedies sought in the lawsuits include an injunction prohibiting the Company from engaging in the alleged violations, restitution for all persons allegedly injured by the complained of practices, civil penalties and costs.  In May 2012, Capital One removed the Hawaii AG case to U.S. District Court, District of Hawaii. In November 2012, the court denied the Hawaii AG’s motion to remand. The Ninth Circuit overturned the District Court’s denial of the AG’s motion to remand in August 2014, and the case will proceed in state court.  In August 2012, Capital One removed the Mississippi AG case to the U.S. District Court, Southern District of Mississippi. In July 2013, the court denied the Mississippi AG’s motion to remand. The Fifth Circuit overturned the District Court’s denial of the AG’s motion to remand in December 2013, and the case will proceed in state court.  In June 2013, Capital One removed the New Mexico AG case to the U.S. District Court, District of New Mexico. In response, the New Mexico AG filed an Amended Complaint in federal court, adding a claim for alleged violations of the Truth in Lending Act. In November 2013, the court granted in part and denied in part Capital One’s motion to dismiss. The court dismissed the state deceptive practices act claim but allowed the New Mexico AG to proceed on its claims under the Truth In Lending Act. In a separate order, the court also granted Capital One’s motion precluding the New Mexico AG from recovery of alleged damages for New Mexico residents who were class members in a prior class action against Capital One.  Relatedly, Capital One has provided information to the Attorney General of Missouri as part of an industry-wide informal inquiry initiated in August 2011, relating to the marketing of payment protection products.               160   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued)    Intellectual Ventures Corp., et al.  In June 2013, Intellectual Ventures I, LLC and Intellectual Ventures II, LLC (collectively “IV”) sued Capital One Financial Corp., Capital One Bank (USA), N.A. and Capital One, N.A. (collectively “Capital One”) for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. In the Complaint, IV alleges infringement of patents related to various business processes across the Capital One enterprise. IV simultaneously filed patent infringement actions against numerous other financial institutions on the same and other patents in several other federal courts. Capital One’s motion to dismiss was denied without prejudice in August 2013. Capital One filed an answer and counterclaim alleging antitrust violations. In December 2013, the court dismissed Capital One’s counterclaim and decided the parties’ arguments on claim construction. IV agreed to dismiss two patents in suit, and following claim construction, asked for a stipulation of non-infringement for one patent with an opportunity to appeal the court’s decision regarding claim construction. In April 2014, the court granted Capital One’s motion for summary judgment and found that the two remaining patents were either unpatentable or indefinite. In May 2014, IV appealed to the Federal Circuit and Capital One cross-appealed the dismissal of its antitrust claims.  In January 2014, IV filed a second suit against Capital One for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. In the complaint, IV again alleges infringement of patents related to various business practices across the Capital One enterprise. The court denied Capital One’s motion to transfer venue to the Eastern District of Virginia in March 2014. IV voluntarily dismissed one of the patents against Capital one, and the parties are currently engaged in discovery on the remaining patents in suit.  Telephone Consumer Protection Act Litigation  In December 2012, the Capital One Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) Litigation Multi-district Litigation matter was created as a result of a transfer order issued by the United States Judicial Panel on Multi-district Litigation (“TCPA MDL”), which consolidated for pretrial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois three pending putative class actions-Bridgett Amadeck, et al. v. Capital One Financial Corporation, et al. (W.D. Washington); Nicholas Martin, et al. v. Capital One Bank (USA), N.A., et al. (N.D. Illinois); and Charles C. Patterson v. Capital One Bank (USA), N.A., et al. (N.D. Illinois)-and several individual lawsuits. In February 2013, the putative class action plaintiffs in the TCPA MDL filed a Consolidated Master Class Action Complaint. The Consolidated Master Class Action Complaint and individual lawsuits allege that COBNA and/or entities acting on its behalf violated the TCPA by contacting consumers on their cellular telephones using an automatic telephone dialing system and/or artificial or prerecorded voice without first obtaining prior express consent to do so. The plaintiffs seek statutory damages for alleged negligent and willful violations of the TCPA, attorneys’ fees, costs, and injunctive relief. In June 2014, the parties executed and filed with the court a Memorandum of Understanding agreeing to resolve the litigation for an amount within previously established reserves. In July 2014, the court granted preliminary approval of the class settlement. The court is scheduled to determine whether to provide final approval of the class settlement in the fourth quarter of 2014.  Other Pending and Threatened Litigation  In addition, we are commonly subject to various pending and threatened legal actions relating to the conduct of our normal business activities. In the opinion of management, the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of all such other pending or threatened legal actions will not be material to our consolidated financial position or our results of operations.               161   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents Item 3.

Controls and Procedures  Overview  We are required under applicable laws and regulations to maintain controls and procedures, which include disclosure controls and procedures as well as internal control over financial reporting, as further described below.  (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures  Disclosure Controls and Procedures  Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our financial reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding our required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we must apply judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures.  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  As required by Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of June 30, 2014, the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2014, at a reasonable level of assurance, in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting information required to be disclosed within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms.  (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  We regularly review our disclosure controls and procedures and make changes intended to ensure the quality of our financial reporting. There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred in the second quarter of 2014 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.               162   Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)   Table of Contents PART II—OTHER INFORMATION  Item 1.
