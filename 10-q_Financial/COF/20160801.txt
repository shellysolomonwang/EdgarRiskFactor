Unless otherwise specified, references to notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2016 included in this Report. Management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial condition. The following MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes in this Report and the more detailed information contained in our 2015 Form 10-K.INTRODUCTIONWe are a diversified financial services holding company with banking and non-banking subsidiaries. Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through branches, the internet and other distribution channels. As of June 30, 2016, our principal subsidiaries included:•Capital One Bank (USA), National Association (“COBNA”), which offers credit and debit card products, other lending products and deposit products; and•Capital One, National Association (“CONA”), which offers a broad spectrum of banking products and financial services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients.The Company is hereafter collectively referred to as “we,” “us” or “our.” COBNA and CONA are collectively referred to as the “Banks.” Certain business terms used in this document are defined in the “MD&A—Glossary and Acronyms” and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.Our consolidated total net revenues are derived primarily from lending to consumer and commercial customers net of funding costs associated with interest on deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. We also earn non-interest income which primarily consists of interchange income net of rewards expenses and service charges and other customer-related fees. Our expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating expenses, marketing expenses and income taxes.Our principal operations are currently organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group, are included in the Other category.•Credit Card: Consists of our domestic consumer and small business card lending, national closed-end installment lending and the international card lending businesses in Canada and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”).•Consumer Banking: Consists of our branch-based lending and deposit gathering activities for consumers and small businesses, national deposit gathering, auto lending and consumer home loan lending and servicing activities.•Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending, deposit gathering and servicing activities provided to commercial real estate and commercial and industrial customers. Our commercial and industrial customers typically include companies with annual revenues between $10 million and $1 billion. 1Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsRecent Acquisitions and DispositionsWe regularly explore and evaluate opportunities to acquire financial services and financial assets, including credit card and other loan portfolios, and enter into strategic partnerships as part of our growth strategy. We also explore opportunities to acquire digital companies and related assets to improve our information technology infrastructure and to deliver on our digital strategy. We also regularly consider the potential disposition of certain of our assets, branches, partnership agreements or lines of businesses. We may issue equity or debt in connection with acquisitions, including public offerings, to fund such acquisitions. On December 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the Healthcare Financial Services business of General Electric Capital Corporation (“HFS acquisition”). During the second quarter of 2016, we finalized purchase accounting for the HFS acquisition, and recognized approximately $9.2 billion in assets, including $8.2 billion of loans. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of this Report and “Note 2—Business Developments” in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional information.We had no significant acquisitions or dispositions in the first six months of 2016.  2Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsSUMMARY OF SELECTED FINANCIAL DATAThe following table presents selected consolidated financial data from our results of operations for the second quarter and first six months of 2016 and 2015 and selected comparative balance sheet data as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. We also provide selected key metrics we use in evaluating our performance including certain metrics that are computed using non-GAAP measures.

In comparison, we reported net income of $863 million ($1.50 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $5.7 billion and net income of $2.0 billion ($3.51 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $11.3 billion for the second quarter and first six months of 2015, respectively. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio as calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach including transition provisions was 10.9% and 11.1% as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. See “MD&A—Capital Management” below for additional information.On March 11, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.125 billion of shares of our common stock (“2015 Stock Repurchase Program”). On February 17, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $300 million of shares of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2016 under the 2015 Stock Repurchase Program. We completed the 2015 Stock Repurchase Program in the second quarter of 2016. Additionally, on June 29, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of shares of our common stock (“2016 Stock Repurchase Program”) from the third quarter of 2016 through the end of the second quarter of 2017. See “MD&A—Capital Management” below for additional information.Below are additional highlights of our performance in the second quarter and first six months of 2016. These highlights are generally based on a comparison between the results of the second quarter and first six months of 2016 and 2015, except as otherwise noted. The changes in our financial condition and credit performance are generally based on our financial condition and credit performance as of June 30, 2016 compared to our financial condition and credit performance as of December 31, 2015. We provide a more detailed discussion of our financial performance in the sections following this “Executive Summary and Business Outlook.”Total Company Performance•Earnings: Our net income increased by $79 million to $942 million in the second quarter of 2016, compared to the second quarter of 2015, and decreased by $61 million to $2.0 billion in the first six months of 2016, compared to the first six months of 2015. The increase in net income in the second quarter of 2016 was primarily due to (i) higher interest income due to growth in our credit card and commercial loan portfolios, partially offset by the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio; and (ii) higher non-interest income primarily attributable to higher net interchange fees driven by higher purchase volume, partially offset by lower service charges and other customer-related fees primarily due to the exit of our legacy payment protection products in our Domestic Card business during the first quarter of 2016. These increases were partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015 due to higher charge-offs and a larger allowance build in our credit card and auto loan portfolios due to continued loan growth and portfolio seasoning, as well as higher charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolio as a result of continued adverse industry conditions impacting our oil and gas portfolio. The decrease in net income in the first six months of 2016 was primarily due to (i) an increase in the provision for credit losses in the first six months of 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015 due to higher charge-offs and a larger allowance build in our credit card and auto loan portfolios due to continued loan growth and portfolio seasoning, as well as a larger allowance build and higher charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolio as a result of continued adverse industry conditions impacting our oil and gas and taxi medallion lending portfolios; and (ii) higher non-interest expense primarily due to higher marketing and operating expenses associated with loan growth and continued investments in technology and infrastructure. These decreases were partially offset by (i) higher interest income due to growth in our credit card and commercial loan portfolios; and (ii) higher non-interest income primarily attributable to higher net interchange fees driven by higher purchase volume, partially offset by lower service charges and other customer-related fees primarily due to the exit of our legacy payment protection products in our Domestic Card business during the first quarter of 2016.•Loans Held for Investment: Loans held for investment increased by $4.8 billion to $234.6 billion as of June 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015 primarily driven by growth in our auto, commercial and credit card loan portfolios, partially offset by the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio and seasonal paydowns in our credit card loan portfolio. Average loans held for investment increased by $24.0 billion to $230.4 billion in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, and increased by $22.8 billion to $228.6 billion in the first six months of 2016 compared to the first six  6Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contentsmonths of 2015, primarily driven by continued growth in our credit card, auto and commercial loan portfolios, including loans acquired from the HFS acquisition, partially offset by the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio.•Net Charge-off and Delinquency Metrics: Our net charge-off rate increased by 37 basis points to 2.01% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, and increased by 36 basis points to 2.04% in the first six months of 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015, primarily due to growth and seasoning of recent credit card loan originations and rising losses in our oil and gas and taxi medallion lending portfolios within our Commercial Banking business. Our 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 21 basis points to 2.79% as of June 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015 primarily due to seasonally lower delinquency inventories in our domestic card and auto loan portfolios. We provide additional information on our credit quality metrics below under “MD&A—Business Segment Financial Performance” and “MD&A —Credit Risk Profile.”•Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses: Our allowance for loan and lease losses increased by $751 million to $5.9 billion as of June 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015. The increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses was primarily driven by continued domestic card and auto loan growth and the effects of growth leading to an increasing overall loss rate, and continued adverse industry conditions impacting our oil and gas and taxi medallion lending portfolios in our Commercial Banking business. These factors also contributed to a higher allowance coverage ratio, which increased by 28 basis points to 2.51% as of June 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015.Business Segment Financial PerformanceTable 2 summarizes our business segment results, which we report based on revenue and income from continuing operations, net of tax, for the second quarter and first six months of 2016 and 2015. We provide information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in “Note 20—Business Segments” in our 2015 Form 10-K. We also provide a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our consolidated generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) results in “Note 13—Business Segments” of this Report.Table 2: Business Segment Results   Three Months Ended June 30,  2016 2015  Total Net Revenue (Loss)(1) Net Income (Loss)(2) Total Net Revenue (Loss)(1) Net Income (Loss)(2)(Dollars in millions) Amount % ofTotal Amount % ofTotal Amount % ofTotal Amount % ofTotalCredit Card $3,904 62% $484 51% $3,478 61% $463 55%Consumer Banking 1,614 26 257 27 1,640 29 291 34Commercial Banking(3) 688 11 138 15 589 11 172 20Other(4)  48 1 64 7 (35) (1) (74) (9)Total from continuing operations $6,254 100% $943 100% $5,672 100% $852 100%  Six Months Ended June 30,  2016 2015  Total Net Revenue (Loss)(1) Net Income (Loss)(2) Total Net Revenue (Loss)(1) Net Income (Loss)(2)(Dollars in millions) Amount % ofTotal Amount % ofTotal Amount % ofTotal Amount % ofTotalCredit Card $7,784 62% $1,093 56% $6,960 61% $1,131 57%Consumer Banking 3,225 26 506 26 3,232 29 557 28Commercial Banking(3) 1,343 11 205 10 1,164 10 327 16Other(4)  122 1 157 8 (37) — (29) (1)Total from continuing operations $12,474 100% $1,961 100% $11,319 100% $1,986 100%__________(1) Total net revenue (loss) consists of net interest income and non-interest income.(2) Net income (loss) for our business segments and the Other category is based on income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax. 7Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents(3) Some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits. Accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory tax rate of 35% with offsetting reclassifications to the Other category. (4) Includes the residual impact of the allocation of our centralized Corporate Treasury group activities, unallocated corporate expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments and other items as described in “Note 20—Business Segments” in our 2015 Form 10-K.Credit Card: Our Credit Card business generated net income from continuing operations of $484 million and $1.1 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, respectively, compared to net income from continuing operations of $463 million and $1.1 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2015, respectively. The increase in net income in the second quarter of 2016 was primarily attributable to (i) higher net interest income primarily driven by loan growth; and (ii) higher non-interest income attributable to an increase in net interchange fees driven by higher purchase volume, partially offset by a decline in service charges and other customer-related fees primarily due to the exit of our legacy payment protection products in our Domestic Card business during the first quarter of 2016. These increases were partially offset by (i) higher provision for credit losses driven by higher charge-offs and a larger allowance build, both due to continued loan growth and portfolio seasoning; and (ii) higher non-interest expense due to higher operating and marketing expenses associated with loan growth as well as continuing digital investments. Net income in the first six months of 2016 was substantially flat as a result of (i) higher provision for credit losses driven by higher charge-offs and a larger allowance build, both due to continued loan growth and portfolio seasoning; and (ii) higher non-interest expense due to higher operating and marketing expenses associated with loan growth as well as continuing digital investments; offset by (i) higher net interest income primarily driven by loan growth; and (ii) higher non-interest income attributable to an increase in net interchange fees driven by higher purchase volume, partially offset by a decline in service charges and other customer-related fees primarily due to the exit of our legacy payment protection products in our Domestic Card business during the first quarter of 2016. Period-end loans held for investment increased by $779 million to $96.9 billion as of June 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015, primarily due to continued loan growth in our Domestic Card business, net of expected seasonal paydowns.Consumer Banking: Our Consumer Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $257 million and $506 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, respectively, compared to net income from continuing operations of $291 million and $557 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2015, respectively. The decreases in net income were primarily attributable to (i) higher provision for credit losses primarily driven by higher charge-offs in our auto loan portfolio due to continued loan growth, portfolio seasoning and our expectation that used car auction prices will decline from current levels; (ii) higher non-interest expense largely driven by increased marketing expenses in our retail banking business and higher operating expenses driven by growth in our auto loan portfolio; and (iii) lower revenue primarily attributable to the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio. Period-end loans held for investment increased by $1.0 billion to $71.4 billion as of June 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015, driven by growth in our auto loan portfolio, partially offset by the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio.Commercial Banking: Our Commercial Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $138 million and $205 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, respectively, compared to net income from continuing operations of $172 million and $327 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2015, respectively. The decreases in net income were primarily attributable to (i) higher provision for credit losses due to higher charge-offs as a result of continued adverse industry conditions impacting our oil and gas portfolio, as well as a larger allowance build in the first six months of 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015 as a result of continued adverse industry conditions impacting our oil and gas and taxi medallion lending portfolios; and (ii) higher non-interest expense largely driven by higher operating expenses due to costs associated with the HFS acquisition and continued growth in our Commercial Banking business. These expenses were partially offset by higher net interest income primarily driven by loan growth, including loans acquired in the HFS acquisition. Period-end loans held for investment increased by $2.9 billion to $66.2 billion as of June 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015, driven by growth across our commercial loan portfolios. 8Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsBusiness Outlook We discuss below our current expectations regarding our total company performance and the performance of each of our business segments over the near-term based on market conditions, the regulatory environment and our business strategies as of the time we filed this Report.

Year-to-date, we have recognized approximately $45 million of the $160 million in expected costs for 2016. These costs appear in the “Other” category rather than in the Consumer Banking business results.In addition to these expected bank optimization costs, we also expect the net impact of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) surcharges and premium changes to add to quarterly operating expenses beginning in the second half of 2016. Including the higher expenses associated with these two items, we still expect some improvement in our full-year 2016 efficiency ratio relative to our full-year 2015 efficiency ratio, with continuing improvement in 2017, excluding adjusting items.We believe our actions have created a well-positioned balance sheet with strong capital and liquidity. Pursuant to our approved 2016 capital plan, our board has authorized repurchases of up to $2.5 billion of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2017. As we completed the 2015 Stock Repurchase Program, we reduced our net share count by 8.6 million shares in the second quarter of 2016. Additionally, on June 29, 2016, we announced the 2016 Stock Repurchase Program. The timing and exact amount of any common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including market conditions, opportunities for growth, utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time. See “MD&A—Capital Management—Dividend Policy and Stock Purchases” for more information.Business Segment ExpectationsCredit Card: In our Domestic Card business, we expect the full-year 2016 charge-off rate to be around four percent, with quarterly seasonal variability. Based on current information and assuming relative stability in consumer behavior, the domestic economy and competitive conditions, we expect full-year 2017 charge-off rate in the low four percent range, with quarterly seasonal variability. Loan growth coupled with our expectations for a rising charge-off rate drove an allowance build in the current quarter, and we expect these same factors to drive allowance additions going forward.Consumer Banking: In our Consumer Banking business, persistently low interest rates continue to pressure returns in our deposit businesses. We expect the planned run-off in our acquired home loan portfolio, as well as revenue margin compression and gradually rising charge-offs in our auto business, to have a negative effect on Consumer Banking revenues, efficiency ratio and net income in 2016, even as we continue to tightly manage costs. Commercial Banking: While competition continues to put pressure on loan terms and pricing in our Commercial Banking business, we continue to see good growth opportunities in select specialty industry verticals. Credit pressures continue to be focused in our oil and gas and taxi medallion lending portfolios. 9Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses on the consolidated financial statements. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We provide a summary of our significant accounting policies under “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2015 Form 10-K.We have identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. These critical accounting policies govern:•Loan loss reserves•Asset impairment•Fair value of financial instruments•Representation and warranty reserves•Customer rewards reservesWe evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them, as necessary, based on changing conditions. Management has discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since the 2015 Form 10-K.We provide additional information on our critical accounting policies and estimates under “MD&A—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our 2015 Form 10-K.ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTSSee “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for information on accounting standards adopted in 2016, as well as recently issued accounting standards not yet required to be adopted and the expected impact of these changes in accounting standards. 10Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe section below provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated financial performance for the second quarter and first six months of 2016 and 2015. Following this section, we provide a discussion of our business segment results. You should read this section together with our “MD&A—Executive Summary and Business Outlook,” where we discuss trends and other factors that we expect will affect our future results of operations.Net Interest IncomeNet interest income represents the difference between the interest income, including certain fees, earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense on our interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, and other borrowings. Generally, we include in interest income any past due fees on loans that we deem collectible. Our net interest margin, based on our consolidated results, represents the difference between the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, including the notional impact of non-interest-bearing funding. We expect net interest income and our net interest margin to fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 11Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 3 below presents, for each major category of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the average outstanding balances, interest income earned, interest expense incurred, average yield and rate for the second quarter and first six months of 2016 and 2015.Table 3: Average Balances, Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin   Three Months Ended June 30,  2016 2015(Dollars in millions) AverageBalance InterestIncome/Expense(1)(2) Average Yield/Rate(2) AverageBalance InterestIncome/Expense(1)(2) Average Yield/Rate(2)Assets:            Interest-earning assets:            Loans:            Credit card:            Domestic credit card $85,974 $3,095 14.40% $76,088 $2,648 13.92%International credit card 8,400 325 15.48 7,977 285 14.29Total credit card 94,374 3,420 14.50 84,065 2,933 13.96Consumer banking 71,170 1,116 6.27 71,618 1,122 6.27Commercial banking(3) 65,872 567 3.44 51,549 419 3.25Other 80 45 225.00 103 57 221.36Total loans, including loans held for sale 231,496 5,148 8.90 207,335 4,531 8.74Investment securities 65,754 405 2.46 63,771 382 2.40Cash equivalents and other interest-earning assets 5,514 18 1.31 5,479 24 1.75Total interest-earning assets 302,764 5,571 7.36 276,585 4,937 7.14Cash and due from banks 3,129     2,839    Allowance for loan and lease losses (5,425)     (4,412)    Premises and equipment, net 3,645     3,714    Other assets 30,366     28,480    Total assets $334,479     $307,206    Liabilities and stockholders’ equity:            Interest-bearing liabilities:            Deposits $195,641 $292 0.60 $183,946 $272 0.59Securitized debt obligations 15,226 47 1.23 13,219 36 1.09Senior and subordinated notes 21,717 111 2.04 20,336 80 1.57Other borrowings and liabilities 18,255 28 0.61 8,857 12 0.54Total interest-bearing liabilities 250,839 478 0.76 226,358 400 0.71Non-interest-bearing deposits 25,505     25,197    Other liabilities 9,201     8,396    Total liabilities 285,545     259,951    Stockholders’ equity 48,934     47,255    Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $334,479     $307,206    Net interest income/spread   $5,093 6.60   $4,537 6.43Impact of non-interest-bearing funding     0.13     0.13Net interest margin     6.73%     6.56% 12Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents  Six Months Ended June 30,  2016 2015(Dollars in millions) AverageBalance InterestIncome/Expense(1)(2) Average Yield/Rate(2) AverageBalance InterestIncome/Expense(1)(2) Average Yield/Rate(2)Assets:            Interest-earning assets:            Loans:            Credit card:            Domestic credit card $85,646 $6,166 14.40% $75,484 $5,308 14.06%International credit card 8,120 647 15.94 7,895 576 14.59Total credit card 93,766 6,813 14.53 83,379 5,884 14.11Consumer banking 70,805 2,204 6.23 71,607 2,241 6.26Commercial banking(3) 64,878 1,107 3.41 51,505 834 3.24Other 85 109 256.47 107 112 209.35Total loans, including loans held for sale 229,534 10,233 8.92 206,598 9,071 8.78Investment securities 65,455 820 2.51 63,477 788 2.48Cash equivalents and other interest-earning assets 6,117 35 1.14 7,426 52 1.40Total interest-earning assets 301,106 11,088 7.36 277,501 9,911 7.14Cash and due from banks 3,244     2,965    Allowance for loan and lease losses (5,278)     (4,391)    Premises and equipment, net 3,643     3,708    Other assets 30,482     28,512    Total assets $333,197     $308,295    Liabilities and stockholders’ equity:            Interest-bearing liabilities:            Deposits $194,883 $575 0.59 $183,475 $543 0.59Securitized debt obligations 15,293 95 1.24 12,396 69 1.11Senior and subordinated notes 21,855 217 1.99 20,465 159 1.55Other borrowings and liabilities 17,716 52 0.59 11,771 27 0.46Total interest-bearing liabilities 249,747 939 0.75 228,107 798 0.70Non-interest-bearing deposits 25,280     25,026    Other liabilities 9,163     8,334    Total liabilities 284,190     261,467    Stockholders’ equity 49,007     46,828    Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $333,197     $308,295    Net interest income/spread   $10,149 6.61   $9,113 6.44Impact of non-interest-bearing funding     0.13     0.13Net interest margin     6.74%     6.57%__________(1)  Past due fees included in interest income totaled approximately $354 million and $706 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, respectively, and $344 million and $697 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2015, respectively.(2) Interest income and interest expense and the calculation of average yields on interest-earning assets and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities include the impact of hedge accounting.(3) Some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits. Accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory rate of 35% with offsetting reclassifications to the Other category.Net interest income increased by $556 million to $5.1 billion in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, and increased by $1.0 billion to $10.1 billion in the first six months of 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015 primarily driven by growth in our credit card and commercial loan portfolios and an additional day in the first six months of 2016. Net interest margin increased by 17 basis points to 6.73% and 6.74% in the second quarter of 2016 and the first six months of 2016, respectively, primarily driven by continued growth in our credit card loan portfolio, the planned run-off of our acquired home loan  13Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contentsportfolio in our Consumer Banking business and an additional day in the first six months of 2016, partially offset by margin compression in our auto loan portfolio.Table 4 displays the change in our net interest income between periods and the extent to which the variance is attributable to (i) changes in the volume of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; or (ii) changes in the interest rates related to these assets and liabilities.Table 4: Rate/Volume Analysis of Net Interest Income(1)   Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,  2016 vs. 2015 2016 vs. 2015(Dollars in millions) Total Variance Volume Rate Total Variance Volume RateInterest income:            Loans:            Credit card $487 $370 $117 $929 $750 $179Consumer banking (6) (7) 1 (37) (25) (12)Commercial banking(2) 148 122 26 273 226 47Other (12) (13) 1 (3) (23) 20Total loans, including loans held for sale 617 472 145 1,162 928 234Investment securities 23 12 11 32 24 8Cash equivalents and other interest-earning assets (6) — (6) (17) (8) (9)Total interest income 634 484 150 1,177 944 233Interest expense:            Deposits 20 17 3 32 34 (2)Securitized debt obligations 11 6 5 26 17 9Senior and subordinated notes 31 6 25 58 11 47Other borrowings and liabilities 16 14 2 25 16 9Total interest expense 78 43 35 141 78 63Net interest income $556 $441 $115 $1,036 $866 $170 __________(1) We calculate the change in interest income and interest expense separately for each item. The portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate is allocated proportionately when the calculation results in a positive value. When the portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate results in a negative value, the total amount is allocated to volume or rate, depending on which amount is positive.(2) Some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits. Accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory rate of 35% with offsetting reclassifications to the Other category.Non-Interest IncomeNon-interest income primarily consists of interchange fees net of rewards expense, service charges and other customer-related fees and other non-interest income. Other non-interest income includes the pre-tax net benefit (provision) for mortgage representation and warranty losses related to continuing operations, gains and losses from the sale of investment securities, gains and losses on derivatives not accounted for in hedge accounting relationships and hedge ineffectiveness. 14Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 5 displays the components of non-interest income for the second quarter and first six months of 2016 and 2015.Table 5: Non-Interest Income  Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 2016 2015Interchange fees, net $616 $567 $1,212 $1,063Service charges and other customer-related fees 371 429 775 866Net other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings (2) (7) (10) (22)Other non-interest income:        Benefit (provision) for mortgage representation and warranty losses(1) 1 9 2 8Net gains (losses) from the sale of investment securities 2 (1) 2 1Net fair value gains (losses) on free-standing derivatives 22 12 52 22Other 151 126 292 268Total other non-interest income 176 146 348 299Total non-interest income $1,161 $1,135 $2,325 $2,206 __________(1) Represents the benefit (provision) for mortgage representation and warranty losses recorded in continuing operations. For the total impact to the net benefit (provision) for mortgage representation and warranty losses, including the portion recognized in our consolidated statements of income as a component of discontinued operations, see “MD&A—Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis—Table 14—Changes in Representation and Warranty Reserve.”Non-interest income increased by $26 million to $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, and increased by $119 million to $2.3 billion in the first six months of 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015, primarily driven by (i) increases in interchange fees driven by higher purchase volume in our Credit Card business; (ii) a customer rewards liability release in the first quarter of 2016 within the retail banking business related to the discontinuation of certain debit card and deposit products; and (iii) a gain recorded in the second quarter of 2016 related to the exchange of our ownership interest in Visa Europe with Visa Inc. as a result of Visa Inc.’s acquisition of Visa Europe. These increases were partially offset by (i) increased rewards expense in our Credit Card business due to higher purchase volume and the continued expansion of our rewards franchise; and (ii) lower service charges and other customer-related fees primarily due to the exit of our legacy payment protection products in our Domestic Card business during the first quarter of 2016.Provision for Credit LossesOur provision for credit losses in each period is driven by net charge-offs, changes to the allowance for loan and lease losses and changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $1.6 billion and $3.1 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, respectively, compared to $1.1 billion and $2.1 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2015, respectively. The provision for credit losses as a percentage of net interest income was 31.3% and 30.7% in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, respectively, compared to 24.9% and 22.6% in the second quarter and first six months of 2015, respectively.The increase in the provision for credit losses in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015 was primarily driven by higher charge-offs and a larger allowance build in our credit card and auto loan portfolios due to continued loan growth and portfolio seasoning, as well as higher charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolio as a result of continued adverse industry conditions impacting our oil and gas portfolio. The increase in provision in the first six months of 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015 was primarily driven by higher charge-offs and a larger allowance build in our credit card and auto loan portfolios due to continued loan growth and portfolio seasoning, as well as higher charge-offs and a larger allowance build in our commercial loan portfolio as a result of continued adverse industry conditions impacting our oil and gas and taxi medallion lending portfolios.We provide additional information on the provision for credit losses and changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses within “MD&A—Credit Risk Profile—Summary of Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses,” “Note 4—Loans” and “Note 5—Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments.” For information on the allowance methodology for each of our loan categories, see “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2015 Form 10-K. 15Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsNon-Interest ExpenseNon-interest expense consists of ongoing operating expenses, such as salaries and associate benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, professional services, communications and data processing expenses and other non-interest expenses, as well as marketing costs and amortization of intangibles.Table 6 displays the components of non-interest expense for the second quarter and first six months of 2016 and 2015.Table 6: Non-Interest Expense  Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 2016 2015Salaries and associate benefits $1,279 $1,360 $2,549 $2,571Occupancy and equipment 465 439 923 874Marketing 415 387 843 762Professional services 304 334 582 630Communications and data processing 262 208 505 410Amortization of intangibles 95 111 196 221Other non-interest expense:        Collections 77 86 158 170Fraud losses 89 74 179 141Bankcard, regulatory and other fee assessments 129 108 236 217Other 180 200 347 360Other non-interest expense 475 468 920 888Total non-interest expense $3,295 $3,307 $6,518 $6,356Non-interest expense was unchanged at $3.3 billion in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, and increased by $162 million to $6.5 billion in the first six months of 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015. The increase in the first six months of 2016 was primarily due to higher marketing and operating expenses associated with loan growth and continued investments in technology and infrastructure. Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of TaxIncome (loss) from discontinued operations consists of results from the discontinued mortgage origination operations of our wholesale mortgage banking unit, GreenPoint Mortgage Funding Inc. (“GreenPoint”) and the discontinued manufactured housing operations of GreenPoint Credit, LLC, a subsidiary of GreenPoint, both of which were acquired as part of the North Fork Bancorporation, Inc. (“North Fork”) acquisition in December 2006. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $1 million and $6 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, respectively, compared to income of $11 million and $30 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2015, respectively. We recorded a provision net of tax for mortgage representation and warranty reserve of $1 million ($2 million before tax) and $3 million ($5 million before tax) in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, respectively, compared to a benefit net of tax of $17 million ($27 million before tax) and $29 million ($46 million before tax) in the second quarter and first six months of 2015, respectively.We provide additional information on the discontinued operations in “Note 2—Discontinued Operations” and on the net benefit (provision) for mortgage representation and warranty losses and the related reserve for representation and warranty claims in “MD&A—Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis—Mortgage Representation and Warranty Reserve” and “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others.”Income TaxesWe recorded income tax provisions of $424 million (31.0% effective income tax rate) and $876 million (30.9% effective income tax rate) in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, respectively, compared to $384 million (31.1% effective income tax rate) and $913 million (31.5% effective income tax rate) in the second quarter and first six months of 2015, respectively. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations varies between periods due, in part, to fluctuations in our pre-tax earnings, which affects the relative tax benefit of tax-exempt income, tax credits and other permanent tax items. 16Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsThe decreases in our effective income tax rate in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2015, were primarily due to an increased relative benefit of tax exempt income and tax credits, partially offset by a reduced benefit of lower taxed foreign earnings and an increase in discrete tax expense.We provide additional information on items affecting our income taxes and effective tax rate under “Note 18—Income Taxes” in our 2015 Form 10-K. 17Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsBUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEOur principal operations are currently organized into three major business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group, are included in the Other category.The results of our individual businesses, which we report on a continuing operations basis, reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. We provide additional information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in “Note 20—Business Segments” in our 2015 Form 10-K.We refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our “managed” presentation, which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on U.S. GAAP. There is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to U.S. GAAP; therefore, the managed presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial services companies. In addition, our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Below we summarize our business segment results for the second quarter and first six months of 2016 and 2015 and provide a comparative discussion of these results. We also discuss changes in our financial condition and credit performance metrics as of June 30, 2016, compared to December 31, 2015. We provide a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated results in “Note 13—Business Segments.” Additionally, we provide information on the outlook for each of our business segments as described above under “MD&A—Executive Summary and Business Outlook.”Credit Card BusinessThe primary sources of revenue for our Credit Card business are interest income, net interchange income and fees collected from customers. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs and marketing expenses.Our Credit Card business generated net income from continuing operations of $484 million and $1.1 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, respectively, and $463 million and $1.1 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2015, respectively. 18Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 7 summarizes the financial results of our Credit Card business, which is comprised of Domestic Card and International Card, and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.Table 7: Credit Card Business Results  Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 Change 2016 2015 ChangeSelected income statement data:            Net interest income $3,045 $2,633 16% $6,078 $5,299 15%Non-interest income 859 845 2 1,706 1,661 3Total net revenue(1) 3,904 3,478 12 7,784 6,960 12Provision (benefit) for credit losses 1,261 895 41 2,332 1,564 49Non-interest expense 1,883 1,857 1 3,746 3,633 3Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 760 726 5 1,706 1,763 (3)Income tax provision (benefit) 276 263 5 613 632 (3)Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax $484 $463 5 $1,093 $1,131 (3)Selected performance metrics:            Average loans held for investment(2) $94,382 $83,901 12 $93,684 $83,244 13Average yield on loans held for investment(3) 14.49% 13.98% 51bps 14.55% 14.14% 41bpsTotal net revenue margin(4) 16.55 16.58 (3) 16.62 16.72 (10)Net charge-offs $949 $703 35% $1,899 $1,422 34%Net charge-off rate 4.02% 3.35% 67bps 4.05% 3.42% 63bpsPurchased credit card relationship (“PCCR”) intangible amortization $67 $80 (16)% $137 $164 (16)%Purchase volume(5) 78,019 68,559 14 146,208 125,942 16             (Dollars in millions) June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015 Change      Selected period-end data:            Loans held for investment(2) $96,904 $96,125 1%      30+ day performing delinquency rate 3.15% 3.36% (21)bps      30+ day delinquency rate 3.18 3.40 (22)      Nonperforming loan rate 0.05 0.06 (1)      Allowance for loan and lease losses $4,086 $3,654 12%      Allowance coverage ratio(6) 4.22% 3.80% 42bps      __________(1) We recognize billed finance charges and fee income on open-ended loans in accordance with the contractual provisions of the credit arrangements and estimate the uncollectible amount on a quarterly basis.

The increases were primarily attributable to (i) increases in interchange fees driven by higher purchase volume; and (ii) a gain recorded in the second quarter of 2016 related to the exchange of our ownership interest in Visa Europe with Visa Inc. as a result of Visa Inc.’s acquisition of Visa Europe; partially offset by (i) increased rewards expense due to higher purchase volume and the continued expansion of our rewards franchise; and (ii) lower service charges and other customer-related fees primarily due to the exit of our legacy payment protection products in our Domestic Card business during the first quarter of 2016.•Provision for Credit Losses: The provision for credit losses increased by $366 million to $1.3 billion in the second quarter of 2016, and increased by $768 million to $2.3 billion in the first six months of 2016, primarily driven by higher charge-offs and a larger allowance build, both due to continued loan growth and portfolio seasoning.•Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $26 million to $1.9 billion in the second quarter of 2016, and increased by $113 million to $3.7 billion in the first six months of 2016, due to higher marketing and operating expenses associated with loan growth as well as continuing digital investments, partially offset by a smaller build in our U.K. Payment Protection Insurance (“PPI”) Reserve recorded in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015.•Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment increased by $779 million to $96.9 billion as of June 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015, primarily due to continued loan growth in our Domestic Card business, net of expected seasonal paydowns. Average loans held for investment increased by $10.5 billion to $94.4 billion in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015 and increased by $10.4 billion to $93.7 billion in the first six months of 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015, primarily due to growth across our domestic and international card loan portfolios, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates in our international card loan portfolio driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the first six months of 2016.•Net Charge-off and Delinquency Metrics: The net charge-off rate increased by 67 basis points to 4.02% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, and increased by 63 basis points to 4.05% in the first six months of 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015, due to the seasoning of our domestic card portfolio growth. The 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 22 basis points to 3.18% as of June 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015 due to seasonally lower delinquency inventories.Domestic Card BusinessDomestic Card generated net income from continuing operations of $463 million and $1.0 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, respectively, compared to net income from continuing operations of $458 million and $1.1 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2015, respectively. Over the second quarter and first six months of 2016 as well as the second quarter and first six months of 2015, Domestic Card accounted for greater than 90% of total net revenues of our Credit Card business, and greater than 90% of net income of our Credit Card business. 20Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 7.1 summarizes the financial results for Domestic Card and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.Table 7.1: Domestic Card Business Results  Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 Change 2016 2015 ChangeSelected income statement data:            Net interest income $2,769 $2,395 16% $5,525 $4,816 15%Non-interest income 792 796 (1) 1,566 1,539 2Total net revenue(1) 3,561 3,191 12 7,091 6,355 12Provision (benefit) for credit losses 1,164 853 36 2,136 1,463 46Non-interest expense 1,669 1,621 3 3,340 3,201 4Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 728 717 2 1,615 1,691 (4)Income tax provision (benefit) 265 259 2 588 612 (4)Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax $463 $458 1 $1,027 $1,079 (5)Selected performance metrics:            Average loans held for investment(2) $85,981 $75,924 13 $85,564 $75,349 14Average yield on loans held for investment(3) 14.40% 13.95% 45bps 14.41% 14.09% 32bpsTotal net revenue margin(4) 16.57 16.81 (24) 16.58 16.87 (29)Net charge-offs $874 $650 34% $1,761 $1,314 34%Net charge-off rate 4.07% 3.42% 65bps 4.12% 3.49% 63bpsPCCR intangible amortization $67 $80 (16)% $137 $164 (16)%Purchase volume(5) 71,050 62,198 14 133,667 114,223 17             (Dollars in millions) June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015 Change      Selected period-end data:            Loans held for investment(2) $88,581 $87,939 1%      30+ day delinquency rate 3.14% 3.39% (25)bps      Allowance for loan and lease losses $3,730 $3,355 11%      Allowance coverage ratio(6) 4.21% 3.82% 39bps      __________(1) We recognize billed finance charges and fee income on open-ended loans in accordance with the contractual provisions of the credit arrangements and estimate the uncollectible amount on a quarterly basis. The estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees is reflected as a reduction in revenue and is not included in our net charge-offs.(2) Period-end loans held for investment and average loans held for investment include accrued finance charges and fees, net of the estimated uncollectible amount.(3) Calculated by dividing annualized interest income for the period by average loans held for investment during the period.

Net income for our Domestic Card business increased in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015 due to higher net interest income resulting from continued loan growth, partially offset by higher provision for credit losses and higher operating and marketing expenses associated with continued loan growth, as well as continued digital investments. Net income decreased in the first six months of 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015 due to higher provision for credit losses, higher operating and marketing expenses associated with continued loan growth as well as continued investments, partially offset by higher net interest income resulting from loan growth. 21Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsInternational Card BusinessInternational Card generated net income from continuing operations of $21 million and $66 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, respectively, compared to net income from continuing operations of $5 million and $52 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2015, respectively. The increases in net income were primarily due to (i) higher net interest income resulting from loan growth and higher loan yield due to changes in the product mix of the portfolio; (ii) a smaller build in our U.K. PPI Reserve in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, which impacted both revenue and non-interest expense; and (iii) a gain recorded in the second quarter of 2016 related to the exchange of our ownership interest in Visa Europe with Visa Inc. as a result of Visa Inc.’s acquisition of Visa Europe. These drivers were partially offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses due to an allowance build and higher charge-offs during the second quarter and first six months of 2016 compared to allowance releases in the second quarter and first six months of 2015.

The average balance of consumer banking loans held for investment includes PCI loans of $16.9 billion and $21.3 billion in the second quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $17.5 billion and $21.9 billion in the first six months of 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The decrease in the first six months of 2016 was primarily driven by declining yield in our auto loan portfolio, partially offset by changes in the product mix in Consumer Banking as a result of the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio and growth in our auto loan portfolio. Average yield on auto loans decreased by 42 basis points to 7.7% and decreased by 47 basis points to 7.7% in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, respectively. These decreases were primarily attributable to (i) a higher proportion of prime auto loans in the second quarter and first six months of 2016 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2015; and (ii) continued competition that drove margin compression across the auto business. The average yield on the home loan portfolio increased by 2 basis points to 3.9% and decreased by 6 basis points to 3.8% in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, respectively. 24Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents•Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income decreased by $21 million to $175 million in the second quarter of 2016, primarily attributable to a decrease in loans originated and sold within our home loan portfolio. Non-interest income increased by $12 million to $366 million in the first six months of 2016, primarily due to a customer rewards liability release in the first quarter of 2016 within the retail banking business related to the discontinuation of certain debit card and deposit products.•Provision for Credit Losses: The provision for credit losses increased by $19 million to $204 million in the second quarter of 2016, and increased by $43 million to $434 million in the first six months of 2016, primarily driven by higher charge-offs and a larger allowance build in our auto loan portfolio due to continued loan growth, portfolio seasoning and our expectation that used car auction prices will decline from current levels.•Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $8 million to $1.0 billion in the second quarter of 2016, and increased by $28 million to $2.0 billion in the first six months of 2016, primarily due to increased marketing expenses in our retail banking business and higher operating expenses driven by growth in our auto loan portfolio.•Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment increased by $1.0 billion to $71.4 billion as of June 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015, primarily due to growth in our auto loan portfolio, partially offset by the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio. Average loans held for investment decreased by $379 million to $71.0 billion in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, and decreased by $762 million to $70.6 billion in the first six months of 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015, primarily due to the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio, partially offset by growth in our auto loan portfolio.•Deposits: Period-end deposits increased by $3.6 billion to $176.3 billion as of June 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015, as a result of our continued focus on deposit relationships with existing customers and our ability to attract new customers.•Net Charge-off and Delinquency Metrics: The net charge-off rate increased by 7 basis points to 0.83% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, and increased by 10 basis points to 0.93% in the first six months of 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015. The increases in the net charge-off rate reflect the greater proportion of auto loans in our total consumer banking loan portfolio, which generally have higher charge-off rates than other products within this portfolio. The 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 60 basis points to 4.07% as of June 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015, primarily attributable to seasonally lower auto delinquency inventories.Commercial Banking BusinessThe primary sources of revenue for our Commercial Banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits and non-interest income from customer fees and other transactions. Because we have some investments that generate tax-exempt income or tax credits, we make certain reclassifications to our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues on a taxable-equivalent basis. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs and marketing expenses.Our Commercial Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $138 million and $205 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2016, respectively, and $172 million and $327 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2015, respectively.

(2) The provision for losses on unfunded lending commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income and the related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our reserve for unfunded lending commitments totaled $161 million as of both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.(3) The period-end commercial banking loans held for investment include PCI loans with carrying value of $770 million and $958 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The average balance of commercial banking loans held for investment includes PCI loans of $842 million and $156 million in the second quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $884 million and $163 million in the first six months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. See “MD&A—Glossary and Acronyms” for the definition of “PCI loans.” 26Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents(4) Calculated by dividing annualized interest income for the period by average loans held for investment during the period.

The increase in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015 was primarily driven by higher charge-offs due to continued adverse industry conditions impacting our oil and gas portfolio. The provision increase in the first six months of 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015 was primarily driven by higher charge-offs and a larger allowance build, both due to continued adverse industry conditions impacting our oil and gas and taxi medallion lending portfolios. See “MD&A—Table 18—Commercial Loans by Industry” for additional information about the composition of our commercial banking loan portfolio, and “Note 4—Loans” for additional information about credit metrics for our commercial banking loan portfolio.•Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $73 million to $343 million in the second quarter of 2016, and increased by $123 million to $665 million in the first six months of 2016, driven by higher operating expenses due to costs associated with the HFS acquisition and continued growth in our Commercial Banking business.•Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment increased by $2.9 billion to $66.2 billion as of June 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015 driven by growth across our commercial loan portfolios. Average loans held for investment increased by $14.0 billion to $64.9 billion in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, and increased by $13.1 billion to $64.2 billion in the first six months of 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015, primarily driven by the HFS acquisition and growth across our commercial loan portfolios.•Deposits: Period-end deposits were flat at $34.3 billion as of June 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015.•Net Charge-off and Nonperforming Metrics: The net charge-off rate increased by 32 basis points to 0.37% in the second quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2015, and increased by 29 basis points to 0.33% in the first six months of 2016 compared to the first six months of 2015, and the nonperforming loan rate increased by 72 basis points to 1.59% as of June 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015. The increases in these rates reflect rising losses and credit risk rating downgrades in our oil and gas and taxi medallion lending portfolios.Other CategoryOther includes unallocated amounts related to our centralized Corporate Treasury group activities, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio, asset/liability management and certain capital management activities. Other also includes (i) foreign exchange-rate fluctuations on foreign currency-denominated balances; (ii) unallocated corporate expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance, such as certain acquisition and restructuring charges; (iii) a portion of the net benefit (provision) for representation and warranty losses related to continuing operations; and (iv) offsets related to certain line-item reclassifications. 27Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 10 summarizes the financial results of our Other category for the periods indicated.Table 10: Other Category Results  Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 Change 2016 2015 ChangeSelected income statement data:            Net interest income (expense) $50 $(6) ** $116 $9 **Non-interest income (2) (29) (93)% 6 (46) **Total net revenue (loss)(1) 48 (35) ** 122 (37) **Provision (benefit) for credit losses (1) — ** (3) — **Non-interest expense 63 182 (65) 111 213 (48)%Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes (14) (217) (94) 14 (250) **Income tax provision (benefit) (78) (143) (45) (143) (221) (35)Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax $64 $(74) ** $157 $(29) **__________(1) Some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits.

The increases in net income were primarily driven by (i) lower restructuring charges for severance and related benefits pursuant to our ongoing benefit programs as a result of the realignment of our workforce; and (ii) higher net interest income due to the impact of balance sheet growth and rates on treasury revenue. These increases were partially offset by (i) increased bank optimization charges; and (ii) a reduced income tax benefit as a result of higher income before taxes and increased discrete tax expense, partially offset by increased tax credits.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ANALYSISTotal assets increased by $5.1 billion to $339.1 billion as of June 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015 primarily attributable to an increase of $4.8 billion in loans held for investment primarily driven by growth in our auto, commercial and credit card loan portfolios, partially offset by the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio and seasonal paydowns in our credit card loan portfolio. Total liabilities increased by $4.2 billion to $291.0 billion as of June 30, 2016, primarily driven by an increase in deposits generated by our Consumer Banking business. Stockholders’ equity increased by $824 million to $48.1 billion as of June 30, 2016, primarily due to our net income of $2.0 billion in the first six months of 2016 and $857 million of other comprehensive income, partially offset by $1.6 billion of share repurchases under our 2015 Stock Repurchase Program, which we completed in the second quarter of 2016, and $521 million of dividend payments.The following is a discussion of material changes in the major components of our assets and liabilities during the first six months of 2016. Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management activities that are intended to ensure the adequacy of capital while managing our liquidity requirements for the Company and our customers and our market risk exposure in accordance with our risk appetite.Investment SecuritiesOur investment portfolio consists primarily of the following: U.S. Treasury securities; U.S. government-sponsored enterprise (“Agency”) and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) and commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”); other asset-backed securities (“ABS”); and other securities. The carrying value of our investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities represented 91% and 90% of our total investment securities portfolio as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.The fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio was $40.0 billion as of June 30, 2016, an increase of $899 million from December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to growth in this portfolio as purchases outpaced sales, maturities and  28Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contentspaydowns, as well as a decrease in interest rates. The fair value of our held to maturity securities portfolio was $26.8 billion as of June 30, 2016, an increase of $1.5 billion from $25.3 billion as of December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to lower interest rates and growth in this portfolio as purchases outpaced maturities and paydowns.Gross unrealized gains on our available for sale securities portfolio increased to $860 million as of June 30, 2016 compared to $578 million as of December 31, 2015 and gross unrealized losses on this portfolio decreased to $94 million as of June 30, 2016 compared to $321 million as of December 31, 2015, both of which were primarily driven by a decrease in interest rates. Of the $94 million gross unrealized losses as of June 30, 2016, $64 million was related to securities that had been in a loss position for 12 months or longer. We provide information on OTTI recognized in earnings on our investment securities above in “MD&A—Consolidated Results of Operations—Non-Interest Income.”Table 11 presents the amortized cost, carrying value and fair value for the major categories of our investment securities portfolio as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Table 11: Investment Securities  June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions) AmortizedCost  FairValue AmortizedCost  FairValueInvestment securities available for sale:        U.S. Treasury securities $5,140 $5,189 $4,664 $4,660RMBS:        Agency(1) 24,885 25,158 24,332 24,285Non-agency 2,516 2,857 2,680 3,026Total RMBS 27,401 28,015 27,012 27,311CMBS:        Agency(1) 3,587 3,628 3,690 3,664Non-agency 1,729 1,782 1,723 1,715Total CMBS 5,316 5,410 5,413 5,379Other ABS(2) 1,000 1,005 1,345 1,340Other securities(3) 337 341 370 371Total investment securities available for sale $39,194 $39,960 $38,804 $39,061         (Dollars in millions) Carrying Value FairValue Carrying Value FairValueInvestment securities held to maturity:        U.S. Treasury securities $199 $201 $199 $198Agency RMBS 21,847 23,322 21,513 22,133Agency CMBS 3,074 3,276 2,907 2,986Total investment securities held to maturity $25,120 $26,799 $24,619 $25,317__________(1) Includes Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) and Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) guaranteed securities.(2) ABS collateralized by credit card loans constituted approximately 65% and 71% of the other ABS portfolio as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and ABS collateralized by auto dealer floor plan inventory loans and leases constituted approximately 17% and 11% of the other ABS portfolio as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.(3) Includes foreign government bonds and equity investments.Credit RatingsOur portfolio of investment securities continues to be concentrated in securities that generally have high credit ratings and low credit risk, such as securities issued and guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury and Agencies. Approximately 95% of our total investment securities portfolio was rated AA+ or its equivalent, or better, as of both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, while approximately 4% and 5% was below investment grade as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We categorize the credit ratings  29Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contentsof our investment securities based on the lowest credit rating as issued by the following rating agencies: Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services, Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”).Table 12 provides information on the credit ratings of our non-agency RMBS, non-agency CMBS, other ABS and other securities in our portfolio as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Table 12: Non-Agency Investment Securities Credit Ratings  June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions) Fair Value AAA OtherInvestmentGrade BelowInvestmentGrade(1) Fair Value AAA OtherInvestmentGrade BelowInvestmentGrade(1)Non-agency RMBS $2,857 — 3% 97% $3,026 — 3% 97%Non-agency CMBS 1,782 100% — — 1,715 100% — —Other ABS 1,005 99 1 — 1,340 99 1 —Other securities 341 16 51 33 371 8 64 28__________(1)  Includes investment securities that were not rated.For additional information on our investment securities, see “Note 3—Investment Securities.”Loans Held for InvestmentTotal loans held for investment (“HFI”) consists of both unsecuritized loans and loans held in our consolidated trusts. Table 13 summarizes our portfolio of loans held for investment by portfolio segment, net of the allowance for loan and lease losses, as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Table 13: Loans Held for Investment   June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions) Loans Allowance Net Loans Loans Allowance Net LoansCredit Card $96,904 $4,086 $92,818 $96,125 $3,654 $92,471Consumer Banking 71,415 972 70,443 70,372 868 69,504Commercial Banking 66,202 821 65,381 63,266 604 62,662Other 82 2 80 88 4 84Total $234,603 $5,881 $228,722 $229,851 $5,130 $224,721Loans held for investment increased by $4.8 billion to $234.6 billion as of June 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015, primarily driven by growth in our auto, commercial and credit card loan portfolios, partially offset by the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio and seasonal paydowns in our credit card loan portfolio.We provide additional information on the composition of our loan portfolio and credit quality below in “MD&A—Credit Risk Profile,” “MD&A—Consolidated Results of Operations” and “Note 4—Loans.”Loans Held for SaleLoans held for sale, which are carried at lower of cost or fair value, increased by $316 million to $1.2 billion as of June 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily driven by (i) higher originations in our multifamily finance business in our Commercial Banking business and the timing of sales of these loans; and (ii) the transfer of certain commercial loans from loans held for investment to loans held for sale, partially offset by the sale of certain domestic credit card loan portfolios.DepositsOur deposits represent our largest source of funding for our operations, providing a consistent source of low-cost funds. Total deposits increased by $3.3 billion to $221.1 billion as of June 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015. The increase in deposits was primarily driven by growth in our Consumer Banking businesses as a result of our continued focus on deposit relationships with existing customers and our ability to attract new customers. We provide information on the composition of our deposits, average outstanding balances, interest expense and yield below in “MD&A—Liquidity Risk Profile.” 30Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsSecuritized Debt ObligationsSecuritized debt obligations decreased to $16.1 billion as of June 30, 2016, from $16.2 billion as of December 31, 2015, as maturities exceeded debt issuances during the first six months of 2016. We provide additional information on our borrowings below in “MD&A—Liquidity Risk Profile.”Other DebtOther debt, which consists primarily of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, senior and subordinated notes, and Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLB”) advances, totaled $43.1 billion as of June 30, 2016, of which $42.1 billion represented long-term debt and the remainder represented short-term borrowings. Other debt totaled $42.9 billion as of December 31, 2015, of which $42.0 billion represented long-term debt and the remainder represented short-term borrowings. The increase in other debt of $102 million in the first six months of 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase in our FHLB advances outstanding. We provide additional information on our borrowings below in “MD&A—Liquidity Risk Profile” and in “Note 8—Deposits and Borrowings.”Mortgage Representation and Warranty ReserveWe acquired three subsidiaries that originated residential mortgage loans and sold these loans to various purchasers, including purchasers who created securitization trusts. These subsidiaries are Capital One Home Loans, LLC, which was acquired in February 2005; GreenPoint, which was acquired in December 2006 as part of the North Fork Bancorporation, Inc. (“North Fork”) acquisition; and CCB, which was acquired in February 2009 and subsequently merged into CONA.We have established representation and warranty reserves for losses associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable, including both litigation and non-litigation liabilities. These reserves are reported on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities. The reserve setting process relies heavily on estimates, which are inherently uncertain, and requires judgment. We evaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis. We build our representation and warranty reserves through the provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses, which we report in our consolidated statements of income as a component of non-interest income for loans originated and sold by CCB and Capital One Home Loans, LLC and as a component of discontinued operations for loans originated and sold by GreenPoint. The aggregate reserve for all three entities totaled $614 million as of June 30, 2016, compared to $610 million as of December 31, 2015.The table below summarizes changes in our representation and warranty reserve in the second quarter and first six months of 2016 and 2015.Table 14: Changes in Representation and Warranty Reserve  Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 2016 2015Representation and warranty reserve, beginning of period $613 $673 $610 $731Provision (benefit) for mortgage representation and warranty losses:        Recorded in continuing operations (1) (9) (2) (8)Recorded in discontinued operations 2 (27) 5 (46)Total provision (benefit) for mortgage representation and warranty losses 1 (36) 3 (54)Net realized recoveries (losses) — (1) 1 (41)Representation and warranty reserve, end of period $614 $636 $614 $636 As part of our business planning processes, we have considered various outcomes relating to the future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are possible but do not rise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying an incremental reserve under applicable accounting standards. Our current best estimate of reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond what was in our reserve as of June 30, 2016, is approximately $1.5 billion, a decline from our estimate of $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2015. The decrease in this estimate was primarily driven by favorable rulings in representation and warranty-related litigation.  31Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsWe provide additional information related to the representation and warranty reserve, including factors that may impact the adequacy of the reserve and the ultimate amount of losses incurred by our subsidiaries, in “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others.”OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIESIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various types of arrangements with limited liability companies, partnerships or trusts that often involve special purpose entities and variable interest entities (“VIEs”). Some of these arrangements are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or may be recorded in amounts different from the full contract or notional amount of the arrangements, depending on the nature or structure of, and the accounting standards required to be applied to, the arrangement. These arrangements may expose us to potential losses in excess of the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Our involvement in these arrangements can take many forms, including securitization and servicing activities, the purchase or sale of mortgage-backed or other asset-backed securities in connection with our home loan portfolio and loans to VIEs that hold debt, equity, real estate or other assets.Our continuing involvement in unconsolidated VIEs primarily consists of certain home loan securitization trusts and affordable housing entities. We provide a discussion of our activities related to these VIEs in “Note 6—Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations.”CAPITAL MANAGEMENTThe level and composition of our capital are determined by multiple factors, including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements and internal risk-based capital assessments such as internal stress testing and economic capital. The level and composition of our capital may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment, conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments.Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective ActionWe are subject to capital adequacy standards adopted by the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and FDIC (collectively, the “Federal Banking Agencies”), including the capital rules that implemented the Basel III capital framework (“Final Basel III Capital Rule”) developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“Basel Committee”). Moreover, the Banks, as insured depository institutions, are subject to Prompt Corrective Action (“PCA”) capital regulations. In July 2013, the Federal Banking Agencies adopted the Final Basel III Capital Rule, which, in addition to implementing the Basel III capital framework, also implemented certain Dodd-Frank Act and other capital provisions, and updated the PCA capital framework to reflect the new regulatory capital minimums. The Final Basel III Capital Rule amended both the Basel I and Basel II Advanced Approaches frameworks, established a new common equity Tier 1 capital requirement and set higher minimum capital ratio requirements. We refer to the amended Basel I framework as the “Basel III Standardized Approach,” and the amended Advanced Approaches framework as the “Basel III Advanced Approaches.” At the end of 2012, we met one of the two independent eligibility criteria set by banking regulators for becoming subject to the Advanced Approaches capital rules. As a result, we have undertaken a multi-year process of implementing the Advanced Approaches regime for calculating risk-weighted assets and regulatory capital levels. We entered parallel run under Advanced Approaches on January 1, 2015, during which we will calculate capital ratios under both the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches, though we will continue to use the Standardized Approach for purposes of meeting regulatory capital requirements. The Basel Committee has recently released proposed changes to the Basel III capital framework. There is uncertainty as to how the Federal Banking Agencies may adopt and implement those and any other potential changes in the United States capital rules and how such changes may impact the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches once they become finalized. Separately, we also disclose a non-GAAP TCE ratio in “MD&A—Summary of Selected Financial Data.” While the TCE ratio is a capital measure widely used by investors, analysts, rating agencies, and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies, it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We provide  32Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contentsinformation on the calculation of this ratio in “MD&A—Table A—Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures and Calculation of Regulatory Capital Measures.”Table 15 provides a comparison of our regulatory capital ratios under the Basel III Standardized Approach subject to transition provisions, the regulatory minimum capital adequacy ratios and the PCA well-capitalized targets as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Table 15: Capital Ratios under Basel III(1)(2)  June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015  CapitalRatio MinimumCapitalAdequacy Well-Capitalized CapitalRatio MinimumCapitalAdequacy Well-CapitalizedCapital One Financial Corp:            Common equity Tier 1 capital(3) 10.9% 4.5% N/A 11.1% 4.5% N/ATier 1 capital(4) 12.2 6.0 6.0% 12.4 6.0 6.0%Total capital(5)  14.4 8.0 10.0 14.6 8.0 10.0Tier 1 leverage(6) 10.2 4.0 N/A 10.6 4.0 N/ASupplementary leverage(7) 8.9 N/A N/A 9.2 N/A N/ACapital One Bank (USA), N.A.:           Common equity Tier 1 capital(3) 12.3% 4.5% 6.5% 12.2% 4.5% 6.5%Tier 1 capital(4) 12.3 6.0 8.0 12.2 6.0 8.0Total capital(5)  15.2 8.0 10.0 15.2 8.0 10.0Tier 1 leverage(6) 10.7 4.0 5.0 10.8 4.0 5.0Supplementary leverage(7) 8.8 N/A N/A 9.0 N/A N/ACapital One, N.A.:           Common equity Tier 1 capital(3) 11.4% 4.5% 6.5% 11.8% 4.5% 6.5%Tier 1 capital(4) 11.4 6.0 8.0 11.8 6.0 8.0Total capital(5)  12.6 8.0 10.0 12.9 8.0 10.0Tier 1 leverage(6) 8.2 4.0 5.0 8.8 4.0 5.0Supplementary leverage(7) 7.4 N/A N/A 7.9 N/A N/A__________ (1) Capital ratios are calculated based on the Basel III Standardized Approach framework, subject to applicable transition provisions, such as the inclusion of the unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale included in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and adjustments related to intangible assets other than goodwill. The inclusion of AOCI and the adjustments related to intangible assets are phased-in at 40% for 2015, 60% for 2016, 80% for 2017 and 100% for 2018.(2) Ratios as of June 30, 2016 are preliminary. As we continue to validate our data, the calculations are subject to change until we file our June 30, 2016 Form FR Y-9C—Consolidated Financial Statements for Holding Companies and Call Reports.(3) Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on common equity Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets.(4) Tier 1 capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets.(5) Total capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on total capital divided by risk-weighted assets.(6) Tier 1 leverage ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by average assets, after certain adjustments.(7) Supplementary leverage ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by total leverage exposure.The Company exceeded the minimum capital requirements and each of the Banks exceeded the minimum regulatory requirements and were “well-capitalized” under PCA requirements as of both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Final Basel III Capital Rule requires banks to maintain a capital conservation buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital of 2.5% above the regulatory minimum ratio and an incremental countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to be set at the discretion of the U.S. banking regulators (currently zero percent as of June 30, 2016). Both the capital conservation buffer and the countercyclical capital buffer (if applicable) will be phased-in over a transition period of four years commencing on January 1, 2016. The applicable combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer is 0.625% in 2016. 33Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsA common equity Tier 1 capital ratio below the regulatory minimum ratio and the combined capital conservation buffer and the countercyclical buffer (if applicable) might restrict a bank’s ability to distribute capital and make discretionary bonus payments. As of June 30, 2016, the Company, COBNA and CONA are all above the combined threshold. Additionally, banks designated as Globally Systemically Important Banks (“GSIBs”) are subject to an additional regulatory capital surcharge above the combined capital conservation and countercyclical capital buffers established by the Final Basel III Capital Rule. We are currently not designated as a GSIB and therefore not subject to this surcharge.The following table compares our common equity Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as of June 30, 2016, subject to applicable transition provisions, to our estimated fully phased-in common equity Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets, as it applies for Advanced Approaches banks like us that have not yet exited parallel run. Our estimated common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the fully phased-in Basel III Standardized Approach is based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and is subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. As we continue to engage with our regulators, there could be further changes to the calculation.Table 16: Estimated Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio under Fully Phased-In Basel III Standardized Approach(1) (Dollars in millions) June 30, 2016Common equity Tier 1 capital under Basel III Standardized Approach $29,486Adjustments related to AOCI(2) (91)Adjustments related to intangibles(2) (322)Estimated common equity Tier 1 capital under fully phased-in Basel III Standardized Approach $29,073Risk-weighted assets under Basel III Standardized Approach $269,667Adjustments for fully phased-in Basel III Standardized Approach(3) 59Estimated risk-weighted assets under fully phased-in Basel III Standardized Approach $269,726Estimated common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under fully phased-in Basel III Standardized Approach(4) 10.8%__________(1) Estimated common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the fully phased-in Basel III Standardized Approach is a non-GAAP financial measure.(2) Assumes adjustments are fully phased-in.(3) Adjustments include higher risk weights for items that are included in capital based on the threshold deduction approach, such as mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets. The adjustments also include removal of risk weights for items that are deducted from common equity Tier 1 capital.(4) Calculated by dividing estimated common equity Tier 1 capital by estimated risk-weighted assets, which are both calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach, as it applies when fully phased-in for Advanced Approaches banks that have not yet exited parallel run.Under the Final Basel III Capital Rule, when we complete our parallel run for the Advanced Approaches, our minimum risk-based capital requirement will be the greater of the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches. See “Part I—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation” in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional information. Once we exit parallel run, based on clarification of the Final Basel III Capital Rule from our regulators, any amount by which our expected credit losses exceed eligible credit reserves, as each term is defined under the Final Basel III Capital Rule, will be deducted from our Basel III Standardized Approach numerator, subject to transition provisions. Inclusive of this impact, based on current capital rules and our business mix, we estimate that our Basel III Advanced Approaches ratios will be lower than our Basel III Standardized Approach ratios. However, there is uncertainty whether this will remain the case in light of potential changes to the United States capital rules. Capital Planning and Regulatory Stress TestingOn April 5, 2016, we submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve as part of the 2016 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) cycle. On June 29, 2016, the Federal Reserve informed us that they had ‘no objection’ to our CCAR 2016 Capital Plan submission. As a result of this non-objection to our capital plan, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of shares of our common stock from the third quarter of 2016 through the end of the second quarter of 2017, in addition to share repurchases related to employee compensation. The Board of Directors also authorized the quarterly dividend on our common stock of $0.40 per share. For the description of the regulatory capital planning rules we are subject to, see “Part I—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation” in our 2015 Form 10-K. 34Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsDividend Policy and Stock PurchasesOn July 28, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.40 per share. The dividend is payable on August 18, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of the business on August 8, 2016. The Board of Directors also approved quarterly dividends on the Company’s 6.00% fixed-rate non-cumulative Series B perpetual preferred stock, the Company’s 6.25% fixed-rate non-cumulative Series C perpetual preferred stock, the Company’s 6.70% fixed-rate non-cumulative Series D perpetual preferred stock, and the Company’s 6.20% fixed-rate non-cumulative Series F perpetual preferred stock. These dividends are payable on September 1, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 17, 2016. Based on these declarations, the Company will pay approximately $203 million in common equity dividends and approximately $37 million in total preferred dividends in the third quarter of 2016. Under the terms of the Company’s outstanding preferred stock, the Company’s ability to pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or to repurchase, redeem or acquire its common stock or any preferred stock ranking on parity with or junior to the preferred stock, is subject to restrictions in the event that the Company does not declare and either pay or set aside a sum sufficient for payment of dividends on the preferred stock for the immediately preceding dividend period.We paid common stock dividends of $0.40 per share in the second quarter of 2016. We paid preferred stock dividends of $15.00 per share on the outstanding shares of our Series B Preferred Stock; $15.625 per share on the outstanding shares of our Series C Preferred Stock; $16.75 per share on the outstanding shares of our Series D Preferred Stock; $27.75 per share on the outstanding shares of our Series E Preferred Stock and $15.50 per share on the outstanding shares of our Series F Preferred Stock during the second quarter of 2016. The declaration and payment of dividends to our stockholders, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. As a bank holding company (“BHC”), our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries. Regulatory restrictions exist that limit the ability of the Banks to transfer funds to our BHC. As of June 30, 2016, funds available for dividend payments from COBNA and CONA were $3.0 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends to stockholders.Consistent with our 2015 Stock Repurchase Program, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.125 billion of shares of common stock beginning in the second quarter of 2015 through the end of the second quarter of 2016. On February 17, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $300 million of shares of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2016 under the 2015 Stock Repurchase Program. We notified the Federal Reserve of our intention to engage in additional share repurchases and the Federal Reserve did not object. We completed the 2015 Stock Repurchase Program in the second quarter of 2016.The timing and exact amount of any future common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including market conditions, opportunities for growth, our capital position and amount of retained earnings. Our stock repurchase program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time. For additional information on dividends and stock repurchases, see “Part I—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation—Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Transfer of Funds” in our 2015 Form 10-K. 35Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsRISK MANAGEMENTOverview We use a risk framework to provide an overall enterprise-wide approach for effectively managing risk. We execute against our risk framework with the “Three Lines of Defense” risk management model to demonstrate and structure the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities in the organization for taking and managing risk. The “First Line of Defense” is comprised of the business areas that through their day-to-day business activities take risk on our behalf. As the business owner, the first line is responsible for identifying, assessing, managing and controlling that risk. This principle places ultimate accountability for the management of risks and ownership of risk decisions with the CEO and business heads. The “Second Line of Defense” provides oversight of first line risk taking and management, and is primarily comprised of our Risk Management organization. The second line assists in determining risk appetite and the strategies, policies and structures for managing risks. The second line is both an ‘expert advisor’ to the first line and an ‘effective challenger’ of first line risk activities. The “Third Line of Defense” is comprised of our Internal Audit and Credit Review functions. The third line provides independent and objective assurance to senior management and to the Board of Directors that first and second line risk management and internal control systems and its governance processes are well-designed and working as intended.The risk framework is also used to guide design of risk programs and performance of risk activity within each risk category and across the entire enterprise. When the elements of the framework are executed effectively, we operate according to our expectations for strong risk management. There are eight elements that comprise the risk framework: •Establish Governance Processes, Accountabilities and Risk Appetites •Identify and Assess Risks and Ownership •Develop and Operate Controls, Monitoring and Mitigation Plans •Test and Detect Control Gaps and Perform Corrective Action •Escalate Key Risks and Gaps to Executive Management and, when appropriate, the Board of Directors •Calculate and Allocate Capital in Alignment with Risk Management and Measurement Processes (including Stress Testing) •Support with the Right Culture, Talent and Skills •Enabled by the Right Data, Infrastructure and Programs We provide additional discussion of our risk management principles, roles and responsibilities, framework and risk appetite under “MD&A—Risk Management” in our 2015 Form 10-K.CREDIT RISK PROFILEOur loan portfolio accounts for the substantial majority of our credit risk exposure. Our lending activities are governed under our credit policy and are subject to independent review and approval. Below we provide information about the composition of our loan portfolio, key concentrations and credit performance metrics.We also engage in certain non-lending activities that may give rise to credit and counterparty settlement risk, including the purchase of securities for our investment securities portfolio, entering into derivative transactions to manage our market risk exposure and to accommodate customers, short-term advances on syndication activity (including bridge financing transactions we have underwritten), certain operational cash balances in other financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and customer overdrafts. We provide additional information on credit risk related to our investment securities portfolio under “MD&A—Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis—Investment Securities” and credit risk related to derivative transactions in “Note 9—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” 36Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsLoans Held for Investment Portfolio CompositionWe provide a variety of lending products.

For information on our total unfunded lending commitments to extend credit see “Note 4—Loans” .(3) Includes our taxi medallion lending portfolio among other portfolios.Purchased Credit-Impaired LoansOur portfolio of loans includes certain of our consumer and commercial loans acquired in business acquisitions that were recorded at fair value at acquisition and subsequently accounted for using the guidance for accounting for PCI loans and debt securities, which is based upon expected cash flows. These PCI loans totaled $17.4 billion as of June 30, 2016 compared to $19.5 billion as of December 31, 2015. See “MD&A—Glossary and Acronyms” for the definition of “PCI loans.”The difference between the fair value at acquisition and expected cash flows represents the accretable yield, which is recognized in interest income over the life of the loans. The difference between the contractual payments on the loans and expected cash flows represents the nonaccretable difference or the amount of principal and interest not considered collectible, which incorporates future expected credit losses over the life of the loans. We regularly update our estimate of expected principal and interest to be collected from these loans and evaluate the results for each accounting pool that was established at acquisition based on loans with common risk characteristics. Probable decreases in expected cash flows would trigger the recognition of an allowance for loan and lease losses through our provision for credit losses. Probable and significant increases in expected cash flows would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan and lease losses established subsequent to acquisition, with any remaining increase in expected cash flows recognized prospectively in interest income over the remaining estimated life of the underlying loans. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional information on PCI loans.Home LoansThe majority of our home loan portfolio are PCI loans acquired from the ING Direct and CCB acquisitions, representing 71% and 73% of our total home loan portfolio as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. See “MD&A—Glossary and Acronyms” for the definition of ING Direct and CCB acquisitions. The expected cash flows for the PCI loans in our home loan portfolio are significantly impacted by future expectations of home prices and interest rates. Decreases in expected cash flows that result from declining conditions, particularly associated with these variables, could result in an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses and reduction in accretable yield. Charge-offs on these loans are not recorded until the expected credit losses within the nonaccretable difference are depleted. In addition, PCI loans are not classified as delinquent or nonperforming as we  38Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contentsexpect to collect our net investment in these loans and the nonaccretable difference is expected to absorb the majority of the losses associated with these loans.Table 19 presents our total home loan portfolio and the break out of the PCI loans and remaining loans within our home loan portfolio by lien priority.Table 19: Home Loans—Risk Profile by Lien Priority  June 30, 2016  Home Loans PCI Loans Total Home Loans(Dollars in millions) Amount % ofTotal Amount % ofTotal Amount % ofTotalLien type:            1st lien $5,808 24.9% $16,262 69.6% $22,070 94.5%2nd lien 992 4.2 296 1.3 1,288 5.5Total $6,800 29.1% $16,558 70.9% $23,358 100.0%  December 31, 2015  Home Loans PCI Loans Total Home Loans(Dollars in millions) Amount % ofTotal Amount % ofTotal Amount % ofTotalLien type:            1st lien $5,705 22.6% $18,207 72.2% $23,912 94.8%2nd lien 995 4.0 320 1.2 1,315 5.2Total $6,700 26.6% $18,527 73.4% $25,227 100.0%See “Note 4—Loans” in this Report for additional credit quality information.

The analysis reflects a hypothetical decline of 10% in the home price index and its impact on lifetime future cash flow expectations, accretable yield and allowance for loan and lease losses. Any significant economic events or variables not considered could impact results that are presented below.Table 20: Sensitivity Analysis—PCI Home Loans(1)(Dollars in millions) June 30, 2016 Estimated ImpactIncrease (Decrease)Expected cash flows $19,899 $(49)Accretable yield 3,368 78Allowance for loan and lease losses 27 127__________(1) Changes in the accretable yield would be recognized in interest income in our consolidated statements of income over the life of the loans. Changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses would be recognized immediately in the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income.Credit Risk MeasurementWe closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to assess and manage our exposure to credit risk. Key metrics we track in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming asset rates, as well as net charge-off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger balance commercial loans. Trends in delinquency rates are a primary indicator of credit risk within our consumer loan portfolios, as changes in delinquency rates provide an early warning of changes in credit quality. The primary indicator of credit risk in our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings. Because we generally classify loans that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming, the level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. In addition to delinquency  39Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contentsrates, the geographic distribution of our loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on regional economic conditions. We underwrite most consumer loans using proprietary models, which are typically based on credit bureau data, including borrower credit scores, along with application information and, where applicable, collateral and deal structure data. We continuously adjust our management of credit lines and collection strategies based on customer behavior and risk profile changes. We also use borrower credit scores for subprime classification, for competitive benchmarking and, in some cases, to drive product segmentation decisions. The following table provides details on the credit scores of our domestic card loans held for investment and auto loan portfolios as of June 30, 2016, December 31, 2015 and June 30, 2015.Table 21: Credit Score Distribution(Percentage of portfolio) June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015 June 30, 2015Domestic credit card—Refreshed FICO scores:(1)      Greater than 660 65% 66% 67%660 or below 35 34 33Total 100% 100% 100%Auto—At origination FICO scores:(2)      Greater than 660 51% 51% 49%621 - 660 17 17 17620 or below 32 32 34Total 100% 100% 100%__________ (1) Credit scores generally represent Fair Isaac Corporation (“FICO”) scores. These scores are obtained from one of the major credit bureaus at origination and are refreshed monthly thereafter. We approximate non-FICO credit scores to comparable FICO scores for consistency purposes. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 660 or below category.(2) Credit scores represent FICO scores. These scores are obtained from three credit bureaus at the time of application and are not refreshed thereafter. The FICO score distribution is based on the average scores. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 620 or below category.We present information in the section below on the credit performance of our loan portfolio, including the key metrics we use in tracking changes in the credit quality of our loan portfolio.See “Note 4—Loans” in this Report for additional credit quality information. Also, see “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2015 Form 10-K for information on our accounting policies for delinquent and nonperforming loans, net charge-offs and TDRs for each of our loan categories.Delinquency RatesWe consider the entire balance of an account to be delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the customer’s due date, measured at the reporting date. Our 30+ day delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due, whereas our 30+ day performing delinquency metrics include loans that are 30 or more days past due but are currently classified as performing and accruing interest. The 30+ day delinquency and 30+ day performing delinquency metrics are the same for domestic credit card loans, as we continue to classify the substantial majority of domestic credit card loans as performing until the account is charged off, typically when the account is 180 days past due.

These loans consist primarily of credit card accounts between 90 days and 179 days past due. As permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”), we continue to accrue interest and fees on domestic credit card loans through the date of charge-off, which is typically in the period the account becomes 180 days past due. While domestic credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until the loan is charged off, we reduce the balance of our credit card receivables by the amount of finance charges and fees billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from revenue.Table 24: 90+ Day Delinquent Loans Accruing Interest   June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions) Amount % ofTotal Loans(1) Amount % ofTotal Loans(1)Loan category:        Credit card $1,316 1.36% $1,500 1.56%Consumer banking 1 0.00 — 0.00Commercial banking 6 0.01 5 0.01Total $1,323 0.56 $1,505 0.65Geographic region:        Domestic $1,232 0.54 $1,426 0.64International 91 1.10 79 0.96Total $1,323 0.56 $1,505 0.65__________ (1) Delinquency rates are calculated for each loan category by dividing 90+ day delinquent loans accruing interest by period-end loans held for investment for the specified loan category.Nonperforming Loans and Nonperforming AssetsNonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, foreclosed properties and repossessed assets and the net realizable value of auto loans that have been charged off as a result of a bankruptcy.

Interest income foregone related to nonperforming loans was $36 million and $28 million in the first six months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Foregone interest income represents the amount of interest income that would have been recorded during the period for nonperforming loans as of the end of the period had the loans performed according to their contractual terms.(2) Excluding the impact of PCI loans, the nonperforming loan rates for our home loan and total consumer banking portfolios were 4.25% and 0.90%, respectively, as of June 30, 2016, compared to 4.68% and 1.08%, respectively, as of December 31, 2015.(3) Excluding the impact of domestic credit card loans, nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment was 1.09% and 0.83% as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.(4) The denominator used in calculating the nonperforming asset ratios consists of total loans held for investment and total other nonperforming assets.(5) Includes acquired REOs of $75 million and $101 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.(6) Includes the net realizable value of auto loans that have been charged off as a result of a bankruptcy and repossessed assets obtained in satisfaction of auto loans. 43Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsNet Charge-OffsNet charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine to be uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We charge off loans as a reduction to the allowance for loan and lease losses when we determine the loan is uncollectible and record subsequent recoveries of previously charged off amounts as increases to the allowance for loan and lease losses. We exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and certain fraud losses from charge-offs. Generally costs to recover charged-off loans are recorded as collection expenses and included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest expense as incurred. Our charge-off policy for loans varies based on the loan type. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2015 Form 10-K for information on our charge-off policy for each of our loan categories.Table 26 presents our net charge-off amounts and rates, by portfolio segment, in the second quarter and first six months of 2016 and 2015.Table 26: Net Charge-Offs (Recoveries)  Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,  2016 2015 2016 2015(Dollars in millions) Amount Rate(1) Amount Rate(1) Amount Rate(1) Amount Rate(1)Credit Card:                Domestic credit card $874 4.07% $650 3.42% $1,761 4.12% $1,314 3.49%International credit card 75 3.54 53 2.65 138 3.39 108 2.73Total credit card 949 4.02 703 3.35 1,899 4.05 1,422 3.42Consumer Banking:                Auto 130 1.20 121 1.22 298 1.39 269 1.38Home loan(2) 5 0.09 3 0.04 8 0.07 5 0.03Retail banking 11 1.26 12 1.39 23 1.31 21 1.18Total consumer banking(2) 146 0.83 136 0.76 329 0.93 295 0.83Commercial Banking:                Commercial and multifamily real estate (1) (0.02) (2) (0.04) (2) (0.02) (4) (0.03)Commercial and industrial 60 0.62 9 0.13 107 0.56 13 0.09Total commercial lending 59 0.37 7 0.05 105 0.33 9 0.03Small-ticket commercial real estate 1 0.33 0 0.15 1 0.23 1 0.32Total commercial banking 60 0.37 7 0.05 106 0.33 10 0.04Other loans 0 (3.06) 0 (0.79) (1) (3.46) 0 0.44Total net charge-offs $1,155 2.01 $846 1.64 $2,333 2.04 $1,727 1.68Average loans held for investment $230,379   $206,337   $228,557   $205,768  __________ (1) Calculated for each loan category by dividing annualized net charge-offs by average loans held for investment for the period.(2) Excluding the impact of PCI loans, the net charge-off rates for our home loan and total consumer banking portfolios were 0.31% and 1.09%, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to 0.16% and 1.09%, respectively, for the three months ended June 30, 2015; and 0.24% and 1.24%, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to 0.13% and 1.19%, respectively, for the six months ended June 30, 2015.For information regarding management’s expectations of net charge-offs, see “MD&A—Business Segment Expectations.” 44Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTroubled Debt RestructuringsAs part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may provide short-term (three to twelve months) or long-term (greater than twelve months) modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to improve long-term collectability of the loan and to avoid the need for foreclosure or repossession of collateral.Table 27 presents our recorded investment of loans modified in TDRs as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

The interest rate in effect immediately prior to the loan modification is used as the effective interest rate for purposes of measuring impairment using the present value of expected cash flows. In some cases, the interest rate on a credit card account automatically increases due to non-payment, late payment or similar events. In all cases, we cancel the customer’s available line of credit on the credit card. If the customer does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement may revert to its original payment terms, likely resulting in any loan outstanding reflected in the appropriate delinquency category, and charged off in accordance with our standard charge-off policy.In the Consumer Banking business, the majority of our loans modified in TDRs receive an extension, an interest rate reduction or principal reduction, or a combination of both. In addition, TDRs also occur in connection with bankruptcy of the borrower. In certain bankruptcy discharges, the loan is written down to the collateral value and the charged off amount is reported as principal reduction. Their impairment is determined using the present value of expected cash flows or a collateral evaluation for certain auto and home loans where the collateral value is lower than the recorded investment. In the Commercial Banking business, the majority of loans modified in TDRs receive an extension, with a portion of these loans receiving an interest rate reduction. The impairment on modified commercial loans is generally determined based on the underlying collateral value. We provide additional information on modified loans accounted for as TDRs, including the performance of those loans subsequent to modification, in “Note 4—Loans.”Impaired LoansA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan. Generally, we report loans as impaired based on the method for measuring impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. Loans defined as individually impaired include larger balance commercial nonperforming loans and TDRs. Loans held for sale are not reported as impaired, as these loans are recorded at lower of cost or fair value. Impaired loans also exclude PCI loans accounted for based on expected cash flows because this accounting methodology takes into consideration future credit losses expected to be incurred. 45Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsImpaired loans, including TDRs, totaled $3.0 billion and $2.5 billion as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Modified TDR loans accounted for $2.1 billion and $1.8 billion of impaired loans as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We provide additional information on our impaired loans, including the allowance for loan and lease losses established for these loans, in “Note 4—Loans” and “Note 5—Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments.”Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending CommitmentsOur allowance for loan and lease losses represents management’s best estimate of incurred loan and lease credit losses inherent in our held for investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date. The allowance for loan and lease losses is increased through the provision for credit losses and reduced by net charge-offs. We provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses under “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2015 Form 10-K.Our allowance for loan and lease losses increased by $751 million to $5.9 billion as of June 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015. The allowance coverage ratio increased by 28 basis points to 2.51% as of June 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015. The increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses was primarily driven by continued domestic card and auto loan growth and the effects of growth leading to an increasing overall loss rate, and continued adverse industry conditions impacting our oil and gas and taxi medallion lending portfolios in our Commercial Banking business.Table 28 presents changes in our allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the second quarter and first six months of 2016 and 2015, and details by portfolio segment the provision for credit losses, charge-offs and recoveries recognized in our consolidated statements of income. 46Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 28: Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending

that are intended to ensure that we have sufficient asset-based liquidity to withstand the potential impact of deposit attrition or diminished liquidity in the funding markets. Our practices are intended to maintain adequate liquidity reserves to cover our funding requirements as well as any potential deposit run-off and maintain access to diversified funding sources to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. Our liquidity reserves consist of readily-marketable or pledgable assets which can be used as a source of liquidity, if needed.Table 30 below presents the composition of our liquidity reserves as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Table 30: Liquidity Reserves(Dollars in millions) June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015Cash and cash equivalents $7,149 $8,023Investment securities available for sale, at fair value 39,960 39,061Investment securities held to maturity, at fair value 26,799 25,317Total investment securities portfolio(1)(2) 66,759 64,378FHLB borrowing capacity secured by loans 26,313 30,661Outstanding FHLB advances and letters of credit secured by loans (20,659) (20,514)Investment securities encumbered for Public Funds and others (10,411) (10,602)Total liquidity reserves $69,151 $71,946__________(1) The weighted-average life of our securities was approximately 5.0 years and 5.8 years as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.(2) As part of our liquidity management strategy, we pledge securities to secure borrowings from counterparties and to secure trust and public deposits and other purposes as required or permitted by law. We pledged securities available for sale with a fair value of $1.2 billion and $1.7 billion as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We also pledged securities held to maturity with a carrying value of $8.5 billion and $8.7 billion as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.Our liquidity reserves decreased by $2.8 billion to $69.2 billion as of June 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to reduced FHLB borrowing capacity due to the exclusion of certain loans pledged. See “MD&A—Risk Management” in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional information on our management of liquidity risk.We are subject to the Final Liquidity Coverage Rules (“Final LCR Rule”) issued by the Federal Banking Agencies. The Final LCR Rule came into effect in January 2015 and requires us to calculate the LCR as of the last business day of each month from January 2015 until July 2016, and then on a daily basis thereafter. The minimum LCR standard is phased in as follows: 90% by January 1, 2016; and 100% by January 1, 2017 and thereafter. At June 30, 2016, we exceeded the fully phased-in LCR requirement. The calculation and the underlying components are based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations,  49Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contentsas well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and are subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. Borrowing CapacityWe filed a shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 31, 2015, which expires in March 2018. Under this shelf registration, we may periodically offer and sell an indeterminate aggregate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units. There is no limit under this shelf registration to the amount or number of such securities that we may offer and sell, subject to market conditions. We also filed a new shelf registration statement with the SEC on January 12, 2016, which expires in January 2019 and allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $23 billion of securitized debt obligations.In addition to our issuance capacity under the shelf registration statements, we also have access to FHLB advances with a maximum borrowing capacity of $26.3 billion as of June 30, 2016, of which $5.7 billion was still available to us to borrow as of June 30, 2016. We pledged loan collateral with an outstanding balance of $31.2 billion to secure this borrowing capacity. The ability to draw down funding is based on membership status and the amount is dependent upon the Banks’ ability to post collateral. Our FHLB membership is secured by our investment in FHLB stock of $886 million and $884 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which was determined in part based on our outstanding advances. We also have access to the Federal Reserve Discount Window through which we had a borrowing capacity of $9.9 billion as of June 30, 2016. Although available, we do not view this borrowing capacity as a primary source of liquidity and did not utilize it during 2015 or the first six months of 2016.FundingThe Company’s primary source of funding comes from deposits, which provide us with a stable and relatively low cost of funds. In addition to deposits, the Company raises funding through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, FHLB advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios, the issuance of securitized debt obligations, the issuance of brokered deposits, the federal funds purchased and other borrowings. A key objective in our use of these markets is to maintain access to a diversified mix of wholesale funding sources.DepositsTable 31 provides the composition of deposits as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, as well as a comparison of average balances, interest expense and average deposit rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.Table 31: Deposit Composition and Average Deposit Rates(Dollars in millions) June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015Non-interest-bearing deposits $25,424 $25,847Interest-bearing checking accounts(1) 45,268 44,720Saving deposits(2) 136,401 134,075Time deposits less than $100,000 10,756 10,347Total core deposits 217,849 214,989Time deposits of $100,000 or more 2,556 1,889Foreign time deposits(3) 654 843Total deposits $221,059 $217,721 50Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents  Three Months Ended June 30,  2016 2015(Dollars in millions) AverageBalance InterestExpense AverageDepositRate AverageBalance InterestExpense AverageDepositRateInterest-bearing checking accounts(1) $45,786 $55 0.48% $42,974 $52 0.48%Saving deposits(2) 136,067 198 0.58 132,332 196 0.59Time deposits less than $100,000 10,640 30 1.13 5,571 14 1.01Total interest-bearing core deposits 192,493 283 0.59 180,877 262 0.58Time deposits of $100,000 or more 2,467 9 1.46 2,023 9 1.78Foreign time deposits(3) 681 — — 1,046 1 0.38Total interest-bearing deposits $195,641 $292 0.60 $183,946 $272 0.59  Six Months Ended June 30,  2016 2015(Dollars in millions) AverageBalance InterestExpense AverageDepositRate AverageBalance InterestExpense AverageDepositRateInterest-bearing checking accounts(1) $45,882 $110 0.48% $42,644 $103 0.49%Saving deposits(2) 135,372 389 0.57 131,958 387 0.59Time deposits less than $100,000 10,597 59 1.12 5,727 31 1.09Total interest-bearing core deposits 191,851 558 0.58 180,329 521 0.58Time deposits of $100,000 or more 2,339 16 1.39 2,116 20 1.88Foreign time deposits(3) 693 1 0.34 1,030 2 0.34Total interest-bearing deposits $194,883 $575 0.59 $183,475 $543 0.59__________(1) Includes Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (“NOW”) accounts.(2) Includes Money Market Deposit Accounts (“MMDA”).(3) Substantially all of our foreign time deposits were greater than $100,000 as of both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Our deposits include brokered deposits, which we obtained through the use of third-party intermediaries. Those brokered deposits are reported as interest-bearing checking, saving deposits and time deposits in the above table and totaled $11.8 billion and $12.0 billion as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.The FDIC limits the acceptance of brokered deposits by “well-capitalized” insured depository institutions and, with a waiver from the FDIC, by “adequately capitalized” institutions. COBNA and CONA were “well-capitalized,” as defined under the federal banking regulatory guidelines, as of both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. See “Part I—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation” for additional information.Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term DebtWe access the capital markets to meet our funding needs through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations, and federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. In addition, we may utilize short-term and long-term FHLB advances secured by our investment securities, residential home loans, multifamily real estate loans, commercial real estate loans and home equity lines of credit. Substantially all of our long-term FHLB advances are structured with either a one-month or a three-month call option at our discretion.Our short-term borrowings include those borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less and do not include the current portion of long-term debt. The short-term borrowings, which consist of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, and short-term FHLB advances, increased by $18 million to $999 million as of June 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015.  51Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsOur long-term debt, which primarily consists of securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, and long-term FHLB advances, increased by $48 million to $58.2 billion as of June 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015, as issuances slightly outpaced maturities.Table 32 displays the maturity profile, based on contractual maturities, of our long-term debt including securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings as of June 30, 2016, and the outstanding balances as of December 31, 2015.Table 32: Contractual Maturity Profile of Outstanding Long-Term Debt   June 30, 2016  (Dollars in millions) Up to1 Year > 1 Yearto 2 Years > 2 Yearsto 3 Years > 3 Yearsto 4 Years > 4 Yearsto 5 Years > 5 Years Total December 31, 2015Securitized debt obligations $4,979 $5,018 $3,016 $1,641 $1,131 $345 $16,130 $16,166Senior and subordinated notes:                Unsecured senior debt 2,631 3,955 4,670 1,026 — 5,341 17,623 17,757Fixed unsecured subordinated debt 1,008 — — 323 — 2,918 4,249 4,080Total senior and subordinated notes 3,639 3,955 4,670 1,349 — 8,259 21,872 21,837Other long-term borrowings:                FHLB advances 31 11 3 — 750 19,352 20,147 20,098Capital lease obligations 1 1 1 1 1 28 33 33Total other long-term borrowings 32 12 4 1 751 19,380 20,180 20,131Total long-term debt(1) $8,650 $8,985 $7,690 $2,991 $1,882 $27,984 $58,182 $58,134Percentage of total 15% 16% 13% 5% 3% 48% 100% 100%__________(1) Includes unamortized discounts, premiums and other cost basis adjustments, which together result in a net addition of $57 million and a net reduction of $224 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.We provide additional information on our short-term borrowings and long-term debt under “MD&A—Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis—Securitized Debt Obligations,” “MD&A—Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis—Other Debt” and in “Note 8—Deposits and Borrowings.”Credit RatingsOur credit ratings impact our ability to access capital markets and our non-deposit borrowing costs. Rating agencies base their ratings on numerous factors, including liquidity, capital adequacy, asset quality, quality of earnings and the probability of systemic support. Significant changes in these factors could result in different ratings. Such ratings help to support our cost effective unsecured funding as part of our overall financing programs. Table 33 provides a summary of the credit ratings for the senior unsecured debt of Capital One Financial Corporation, COBNA and CONA as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Table 33: Senior Unsecured Debt Credit Ratings  June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015  Capital OneFinancialCorporation COBNA CONA Capital OneFinancialCorporation COBNA CONAMoody’s Baa1 Baa1 Baa1 Baa1 Baa1 Baa1S&P BBB BBB+ BBB+ BBB BBB+ BBB+Fitch A- A- A- A- A- A-As of July 28, 2016, Moody’s, S&P and Fitch have us on a stable outlook. 52Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsMARKET RISK PROFILEMarket risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities, including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and derivatives. Below we provide additional information about our primary sources of market risk, our market risk management strategies and the measures we use to evaluate our market risk exposure.Primary Market Risk ExposuresOur primary source of market risk is interest rate risk. We also have exposure to foreign exchange risk.Interest Rate RiskInterest rate risk, which represents exposure to instruments whose yield or price varies with the volatility of interest rates, is our most significant source of market risk exposure. Banks are inevitably exposed to interest rate risk due to differences in the timing between the maturities or re-pricing of assets and liabilities.Foreign Exchange RiskForeign exchange risk represents exposure to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies. Our primary exposure is related to the funding of our non-dollar net investments in our International Card business in the U.K. and Canada. Changes in foreign exchange rates affect the value of non-dollar-denominated equity invested in our foreign operations and impact our AOCI and related capital ratios. Our intercompany funding exposes our consolidated statements of income to foreign exchange transaction risk, while our equity investments in our foreign operations results in translation risk in AOCI. We manage our transaction risk by entering into forward foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to foreign currency-denominated intercompany borrowings. In the third quarter of 2014, we began using foreign currency derivative contracts as net investment hedges to manage our AOCI exposure. We apply hedge accounting to both intercompany funding hedges and net investment hedges.In regard to our non-dollar-denominated equity, we measure our total exposure by regularly tracking the equity value of our net equity invested in our U.K. and Canadian operations . We apply a 30% U.S. dollar appreciation shock against each of our Great British pound (“GBP”) and Canadian dollar (“CAD”) net investment exposures, which we believe approximates a significant adverse foreign exchange movement over a one-year time horizon. Our gross equity exposures were 1.4 billion GBP as of both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and 751 million CAD and 686 million CAD as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. As a result of our derivative management activities, we believe our net exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal.Market Risk ManagementWe employ several techniques to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk, which include, but are not limited to, altering the duration and re-pricing characteristics of our various assets and liabilities through interest rate derivatives and mitigating the foreign exchange exposure of certain non-dollar-denominated equity or transactions through derivatives. Derivatives are one of the primary tools we use in managing interest rate and foreign exchange risk. Our current market risk management policies include the use of derivatives. We execute our derivative contracts in both over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivative markets and have exposure to both bilateral and clearinghouse counterparties. Although the majority of our derivatives are interest rate swaps, we also use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage both our interest rate and foreign currency risk. The outstanding notional amount of our derivative contracts totaled $119.8 billion as of June 30, 2016, compared to $105.9 billion as of December 31, 2015, driven by an increase in our hedging activities.  53Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsMarket Risk MeasurementWe have risk management policies and limits established by our market risk management policies and approved by the Board of Directors. Our objective is to manage our asset and liability risk position and exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and prescribed limits based on prevailing market conditions and long-term expectations. Because no single measure can reflect all aspects of market risk, we use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analysis to measure, assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our non-dollar-denominated earnings and non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations. We provide additional information below in “Economic Value of Equity.”We consider the impact on both net interest income and economic value of equity in measuring and managing our interest rate risk. Because the federal funds rate was lowered to near zero in December 2008, the rate remained in a target range of 0% to 0.25% until December 2015, and then increased to a range of 0.25% to 0.50% in the first quarter of 2016, we use a 50 basis points decrease as our declining interest rate scenario, since a scenario where interest rates would decline by 200 basis points is unlikely. In scenarios where a 50 basis points decline would result in a rate less than 0%, we assume a rate of 0%. Below we discuss the assumptions used in calculating each of these measures. Net Interest Income SensitivityThis sensitivity measure estimates the impact on our projected 12-month base-line interest rate-sensitive revenue resulting from movements in interest rates. Interest rate-sensitive revenue consists of net interest income and certain components of other non-interest income significantly impacted by movements in interest rates, including changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and free-standing interest rate swaps. Adjusted net interest income consists of net interest income and changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, including related derivative hedging activity, and changes in the fair value of free-standing interest rate swaps. In addition to our existing assets and liabilities, we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions, such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, and plans for projected changes in our funding mix in our baseline forecast. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our projected interest rate-sensitive revenue, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates of +200 basis points, +100 basis points, +50 basis points and -50 basis points to spot rates, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above. Economic Value of EquityOur economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact on the net present value of our assets and liabilities, including derivative hedging activity, resulting from movements in interest rates. Our economic value of equity sensitivity measures are calculated based on our existing assets and liabilities, including derivatives, and do not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected plans for funding mix changes. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our economic value of equity, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates of +200 basis points, +100 basis points, +50 basis points and -50 basis points to spot rates, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above. 54Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsDuring the second quarter of 2016, we updated our projected deposit re-pricing assumptions as part of our regular evaluation and assessment of the assumptions and models used to measure our interest rate risk sensitivity. This update reduced our estimated asset sensitivity as shown in our projected base-line net interest income measure and had a minor impact to our economic value of equity measures.Table 34 shows the estimated percentage impact on our projected base-line net interest income and economic value of equity, calculated under both our revised and previous methodologies described above, as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Table 34: Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis  Previous Methodology Revised Methodology  June 30, 2016 March 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 June 30, 2016 March 31, 2016 December 31, 2015Estimated impact on projected base-line net interest income            +200 basis points 3.8% 3.5 % 2.6% 1.7% 1.3% 0.3%+100 basis points 2.5 2.2 1.6 1.9 1.5 0.8+50 basis points 1.7 1.4 0.9 1.4 1.2 0.6–50 basis points (2.0) (2.1) (1.6) (1.9) (1.9) (1.4)Estimated impact on economic value of equity            +200 basis points (0.1)% (2.6)% (5.2)% 0.3% (3.0)% (4.8)%+100 basis points 1.8 0.2 (1.5) 1.8 (0.1) (1.3)+50 basis points 1.4 0.6 (0.4) 1.4 0.4 (0.3)–50 basis points (2.8) (1.7) (0.6) (2.6) (1.4) (0.6)Our projected net interest income and economic value of equity sensitivity measures were within our policy limits as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. In addition to these industry standard measures, we will continue to factor into our internal interest rate risk management decisions the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios, such as stressed rate shocks as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios.Limitations of Market Risk MeasuresThe interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information, internally-developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies, which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments. Other market inputs, such as interest rates, market prices and interest rate volatility, are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures. We regularly evaluate, update and enhance these assumptions, models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities.There are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. The sensitivity analysis described above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is performed at a particular point in time based on the existing balance sheet and, in some cases, expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions. The strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections, which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ substantially from the above sensitivity analysis.SUPERVISION AND REGULATIONCustomer Due Diligence Requirements for Financial InstitutionsOn May 11, 2016, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued a final rule entitled “Customer Due Diligence Requirements for Financial Institutions” with an effective date of July 11, 2016 and a full compliance date of May 11, 2018 for all covered financial institutions, including Capital One. The rule made customer due diligence a required, stand-alone part of the anti-money laundering programs financial institutions must maintain under the Bank Secrecy Act. For these purposes, the term “customer due diligence” refers to customer identification and verification, beneficial ownership identification and verification, understanding the nature and purpose of customer relationships to develop a customer risk profile, ongoing monitoring for reporting suspicious transactions, and on a risk-basis, maintaining and updating customer information. 55Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsMarket Risk Capital RuleThe market risk capital rule supplements both the general risk-based capital rules and the Basel III Advanced Approaches rules by requiring institutions subject to the rule to adjust their risk-based capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading activities. The rule applies to institutions with aggregate trading assets and liabilities equal to the lesser of (i) 10% or more of total assets or (ii) $1 billion or more. We will begin calculating capital using the market risk capital rule for positions covered by such rule in the third quarter of 2016. We do not expect that this change will have any material impact on our risk-based capital ratios.We provide additional information on our Supervision and Regulation in our 2015 Form 10-K and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2016 under “Part I—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation” and “MD&A—Supervision and Regulation,” respectively.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSFrom time to time, we have made and will make forward-looking statements, including those that discuss, among other things, strategies, goals, outlook or other non-historical matters;

These non-GAAP measures are individually identified and calculations are explained in footnotes below the table. These metrics are considered key financial performance measures for the Company. We believe they provide useful insight to investors and users of our financial information in assessing the results of the Company. The table below provide the details of the calculation of our non-GAAP measures and regulatory capital. While some of our non-GAAP measures are widely used by investors, analysts and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies, they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

For loans that are or have been on nonaccrual status, the carrying value is also reduced by any net charge-offs that have been recorded and the amount of interest payments applied as a reduction of principal under the cost recovery method. For credit card loans, the carrying value also includes interest that has been billed to the customer. For loans classified as held for sale, carrying value is the lower of carrying value as described in the sentences above, or fair value. For PCI loans, the carrying value equals fair value upon acquisition adjusted for subsequent cash collections and yield accreted to date.CCB: Chevy Chase Bank, F.S.B., which was acquired by the Company in 2009.COBNA: Capital One Bank (USA), National Association, one of our fully owned subsidiaries, which offers credit and debit card products, other lending products and deposit products.Common equity Tier 1 capital: Common equity, related surplus and retained earnings less accumulated other comprehensive income net of applicable phase-ins, less goodwill and intangibles net of associated deferred tax liabilities and applicable phase-ins, less other deductions, as defined by regulators.Company: Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries.CONA: Capital One, National Association, one of our fully owned subsidiaries, which offers a broad spectrum of banking products and financial services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients.Credit risk: The risk of loss from an obligor’s failure to meet the terms of any contract or otherwise fail to perform as agreed.Derivative: A contract or agreement whose value is derived from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, prices of securities or commodities, credit worthiness for credit default swaps or financial or commodity indices.Discontinued operations: The operating results of a component of an entity, as defined by Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 205, that are removed from continuing operations when that component has been disposed of or it is management’s intention to sell the component.Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”): Regulatory reform legislation signed into law on July 21, 2010.

Instruments that fall below these levels are considered to be non-investment grade.Investments in qualified affordable housing projects: Capital One invests in private investment funds that make equity investments in multifamily affordable housing properties that provide affordable housing tax credits for these investments. The activities of these entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt.Investor entities: Entities that invest in community development entities (“CDE”) that provide debt financing to businesses and non-profit entities in low-income and rural communities. 61Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsLeverage ratio: Tier 1 capital divided by average assets after certain adjustments, as defined by the regulators.

After the initial payment option period, usually five years, the recalculated minimum payment represents a fully-amortizing principal and interest payment that would effectively repay the loan by the end of its contractual term.Other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”): An impairment charge taken on a security whose fair value has fallen below the carrying value on the balance sheet and its value is not expected to recover through the holding period of the security.PCI loans: Refers to the loans acquired in a business combination that were recorded at fair value at acquisition and subsequently accounted for based on cash flows expected to be collected in accordance with ASC 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality (formerly known as “Statement of Position 03-3, Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer,” commonly referred to as “SOP 03-3”). Acquired loans are considered PCI loans if they have a discount attributable, at least in part, to credit deterioration and they are not specifically scoped out of this guidance. Our PCI loans include a limited portion of commercial loans acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015 in the HFS acquisition and the substantial majority of consumer and commercial loans acquired in the ING Direct and Chevy Chase acquisitions.The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated fair value of purchased loans represents the accretable yield, which is recognized into interest income over the life of the loans. The difference between total contractual payments on the loans and all expected cash flows represents the nonaccretable difference or the amount of principal and interest not considered collectible, which incorporates future expected credit losses over the life of the loans. Decreases in expected cash flows from credit deterioration subsequent to acquisition will generally result in an impairment charge recognized in our provision for credit losses and an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses. Charge-offs are not recorded until the expected credit losses within the nonaccretable difference are depleted. PCI loans are not classified as delinquent or nonperforming as we expect to collect our net investment in these loans and the nonaccretable difference will absorb the majority of the losses associated with these loans. In addition, PCI loans are excluded from impaired loans because the applicable accounting methodology takes into consideration expected future credit losses.Public Fund deposits: Deposits that are derived from a variety of political subdivisions such as school districts and municipalities.  62Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsPurchase volume: Dollar amount of customer purchases, net of returns.Rating agency: An independent agency that assesses the credit quality and likelihood of default of an issue or issuer and assigns a rating to that issue or issuer.Recorded investment: The amount of the investment in a loan which includes any direct write-down of the investment.Repurchase agreement: An instrument used to raise short-term funds whereby securities are sold with an agreement for the seller to buy back the securities at a later date. Restructuring charges: Charges typically from the consolidation or relocation of operations, and reductions in work force.Return on average assets: Calculated based on income from continuing operations, net of tax, for the period divided by average total assets for the period.Return on average common equity: Calculated based on the sum of (i) income from continuing operations, net of tax; (ii) less dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities; (iii) less preferred stock dividends, for the period, divided by average common equity. Our calculation of return on average common equity may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.Return on average tangible common equity: Calculated based on the sum of (i) income from continuing operations, net of tax; (ii) less dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities; and (iii) less preferred stock dividends, for the period, divided by average tangible common equity. Our calculation of return on average tangible common equity may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.Risk-weighted assets: Consist of on- and off-balance sheet assets that are assigned to one of several broad risk categories and weighted by factors representing their risk and potential for default.

For purposes of auto lending in our Consumer Banking business we generally consider FICO scores of 620 or below to be subprime.Tangible common equity (“TCE”): Common equity less goodwill and intangible assets adjusted for deferred tax liabilities associated with non-tax deductible intangible assets and tax deductible goodwill.Troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”): A TDR is deemed to occur when the Company modifies the contractual terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty.U.K. PPI Reserve: U.K. payment protection insurance customer refund reserve.U.S. GAAP: Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Corporation established in 1994 and headquartered in McLean, Virginia, is a diversified financial services holding company with banking and non-banking subsidiaries. Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through branches, the internet and other distribution channels. As of June 30, 2016, our principal subsidiaries included:•Capital One Bank (USA), National Association (“COBNA”), which offers credit and debit card products, other lending products and deposit products; and•Capital One, National Association (“CONA”), which offers a broad spectrum of banking products and financial services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients.The Company and its subsidiaries are hereafter collectively referred to as “we,” “us” or “our.” COBNA and CONA are collectively referred to as the “Banks.”We also offer products outside of the United States of America (“U.S.”) principally through Capital One (Europe) plc (“COEP”), an indirect subsidiary of COBNA organized and located in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and through a branch of COBNA in Canada. COEP has authority, among other things, to provide credit card loans. Our branch of COBNA in Canada also has the authority to provide credit card loans.Our principal operations are currently organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. We provide details on our business segments, the integration of recent acquisitions into our business segments and the allocation methodologies and accounting policies used to derive our business segment results in “Note 13—Business Segments.”On December 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the Healthcare Financial Services business of General Electric Capital Corporation (“HFS acquisition”). During the second quarter of 2016, we finalized purchase accounting. Including post-closing purchase price adjustments during the first six months of 2016, total cash consideration for the acquisition was $9.0 billion, including $180 million of cash acquired, and we recognized approximately $9.2 billion in assets, primarily consisting of $8.2 billion in loans, $134 million in intangible assets and $518 million in goodwill.Basis of Presentation and Use of EstimatesThe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and in the related disclosures. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. While management makes its best judgment, actual amounts or results could differ from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included for a fair statement of this interim financial information. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.Principles of Consolidation The unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Capital One Financial Corporation and all other entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. We determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity (“VIE”). All significant intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated.New Accounting Standards AdoptedConsolidation: Amendments to the Consolidation AnalysisIn February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued revised guidance for evaluating whether organizations should consolidate certain legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations and securitization structures. The guidance also removed the indefinite deferral of specialized guidance for certain investment funds. We adopted the guidance effective in the first quarter of 2016 on a modified retrospective basis. Our adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. See “Note 6—Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations” for information regarding our involvement with VIEs.Recently Issued but Not Yet Adopted Accounting Standards Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial InstrumentsIn June 2016, the FASB issued revised guidance for impairments on financial instruments. The guidance requires an impairment model (known as the current expected credit loss [“CECL”] model) that is based on expected rather than incurred losses, with an anticipated result of more timely loss recognition. The CECL model applies to loans held for investment, securities held to maturity, lease receivables, financial guarantee contracts and certain unconditional loan commitments. The CECL model will replace our current accounting for purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) and impaired loans. The guidance also amends the available for sale (“AFS”) debt securities other-than-temporary impairments (“OTTI”) model. Credit losses (and subsequent recoveries) on AFS debt securities will be recorded through an allowance approach, rather than the current U.S. GAAP practice of permanent write-downs for credit losses and accreting positive changes through interest income over time. This guidance will be effective for us on January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted no earlier than January 1, 2019. We are currently assessing the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.Improvements to Employee Share-Based AccountingIn March 2016, the FASB issued revised guidance for accounting for employee share-based payments, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective beginning on January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We do not believe the impact of this guidance will be material to our consolidated financial statements. LeasesIn February 2016, the FASB issued revised guidance for leases. The guidance requires lessees to recognize right of use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements for all leases, with certain practical expedients. This will be effective for us on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.Revenue from Contracts with CustomersIn May 2014, the FASB issued revised guidance for the recognition, measurement and disclosure of revenue from contracts with customers. The guidance is applicable to all entities and, once effective, will replace significant portions of existing industry and transaction-specific revenue recognition rules with a more principles-based recognition model. Most revenue associated with financial instruments, including interest and loan origination fees, is outside the scope of the guidance. Gains and losses on investment securities, derivatives and sales of financial instruments are similarly excluded from the scope. Subsequent to issuance of the revenue recognition guidance, the FASB has issued several updates, most notably that (i) deferred by one year the effective date for revenue recognition guidance to January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted effective January 1, 2017; (ii) clarified its guidance for performing the principle-versus-agent analysis; and (iii) clarified guidance for identifying performance obligations allowing entities to ignore immaterial promised goods and services in the context of a contract with a customer. Entities can elect to adopt the guidance either on a full or modified retrospective basis. Full retrospective adoption will require a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. Modified retrospective adoption will require a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the entity first applies the new guidance. We do not plan to early adopt the guidance. We are currently assessing the potential impact of this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and which transition method we plan to elect. 72Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents NOTE 2—DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSOur discontinued operations consist of the mortgage origination operations of our wholesale mortgage banking unit, GreenPoint Mortgage Funding Inc. (“GreenPoint”) and the manufactured housing operations of GreenPoint Credit, LLC, a subsidiary of GreenPoint, both of which were acquired as part of the North Fork Bancorporation, Inc. (“North Fork”) acquisition in December 2006. Although the manufactured housing operations were sold to a third party in 2004 prior to our acquisition of North Fork, we acquired certain retained interests and obligations related to those operations as part of the acquisition. Separately, in the third quarter of 2007 we closed the mortgage origination operations of the wholesale mortgage banking unit. The results of both the wholesale banking unit and the manufactured housing operations have been accounted for as discontinued operations and are reported as income or loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, on the consolidated statements of income. We have no significant continuing involvement in these operations.The following table summarizes the results from discontinued operations for the second quarter and first six months of 2016 and 2015: Table 2.1: Results of Discontinued Operations   Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 2016 2015Non-interest income (expense), net $(2) $18 $(10) $48Income (loss) from discontinued operations before income taxes (2) 18 (10) 48Income tax provision (benefit) (1) 7 (4) 18Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax $(1) $11 $(6) $30The discontinued mortgage origination operations of our wholesale mortgage banking unit had remaining assets which primarily consisted of a deferred tax asset related to the reserve for representations and warranties on loans previously sold to third parties. We also have contingent obligations to exercise certain mandatory clean-up calls associated with securitization transactions undertaken by the discontinued GreenPoint Credit, LLC manufactured housing operations in the event the third party servicer does not fulfill its obligation to exercise these clean-up calls. See “Note 6—Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations” for information related to our retained interests and obligations associated with GreenPoint Credit, LLC manufactured housing operations, and see “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others” for information related to reserves we have established for our mortgage representation and warranty exposure. 73Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents NOTE 3—INVESTMENT SECURITIESOur investment portfolio consists primarily of the following: U.S. Treasury securities; U.S. government-sponsored enterprise (“Agency”) and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) and commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”); other asset-backed securities (“ABS”); and other securities.

As of June 30, 2016, the carrying value of approximately 10 securities classified as held to maturity exceeded their fair value by $3 million. Gross unrealized losses on our investment securities have decreased since December 31, 2015. The unrealized losses related to investment securities for which we have not recognized credit impairment were primarily attributable to changes in market interest rates. As discussed in more detail below, we conduct periodic reviews of all investment securities with unrealized losses to assess whether impairment is other-than-temporary.

Our OTTI assessment is based on a discounted cash flow analysis which requires careful use of judgments and assumptions. A number of qualitative and quantitative criteria may be considered in our assessment as applicable, including the size and the nature of the portfolio; historical and projected performance such as prepayment, default and loss severity for the RMBS portfolio; recent credit events specific to the issuer and/or industry to which the issuer belongs; the payment structure of the security; external credit ratings of the issuer and any failure or delay of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments; the value of underlying collateral; our intent and ability to hold the security; and current and projected market and macro-economic conditions.If we intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, the entire difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and its fair value is recognized in earnings. As of June 30, 2016, for any securities with unrealized losses recorded in AOCI, we do not intend to sell nor believe that we will be required to sell these securities prior to recovery of their amortized cost.For those securities that we do not intend to sell nor expect to be required to sell, an analysis is performed to determine if any of the impairment is due to credit-related factors or whether it is due to other factors, such as interest rates. Credit-related impairment  78Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents is recognized in earnings, with the remaining unrealized non-credit-related impairment recorded in AOCI. We determine the credit component based on the difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected cash flows, discounted based on the effective yield.The table below presents a rollforward of the credit-related OTTI recognized in earnings for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 on investment securities for which we had no intent to sell.Table 3.8: Credit Impairment Rollforward  Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 2016 2015Credit loss component, beginning of period $204 $190 $199 $175Additions:        Initial credit impairment 1 0 1 5Subsequent credit impairment 1 2 7 12Total additions 2 2 8 17Reductions due to payoffs, disposals, transfers and other (2) 0 (3) 0Credit loss component, end of period $204 $192 $204 $192Realized Gains and Losses on Securities and OTTI Recognized in EarningsThe following table presents the gross realized gains and losses on the sale and redemption of securities available for sale, and the OTTI losses recognized in earnings for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.

Credit card loans consist of domestic and international credit card loans. Consumer banking loans consist of auto, home and retail banking loans. Commercial banking loans consist of commercial and multifamily real estate, commercial and industrial, and small-ticket commercial real estate loans.Our portfolio of loans held for investment also includes certain of our consumer and commercial loans acquired through business combinations that were recorded at fair value at acquisition and subsequently accounted for based on cash flows expected to be collected, which were referred to as “purchased credit-impaired loans” or “PCI loans.” See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional information on the accounting guidance for these loans.Credit QualityWe closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to manage and evaluate our exposure to credit risk. Trends in delinquency rates are an indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk within our loan portfolio. The level of nonperforming loans represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. Accordingly, key metrics we track and use in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming loan rates, as well as net charge-off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger balance commercial loans. The table below presents the composition and an aging analysis of our loans held for investment portfolio as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The delinquency aging includes all past due loans, both performing and nonperforming.Table 4.1: Loan Portfolio Composition and Aging Analysis  June 30, 2016(Dollars in millions) Current 30-59Days 60-89Days > 90Days TotalDelinquentLoans PCILoans TotalLoansCredit Card:              Domestic credit card(1) $85,801 $936 $619 $1,225 $2,780 $0 $88,581International credit card 8,019 119 69 116 304 0 8,323Total credit card 93,820 1,055 688 1,341 3,084 0 96,904Consumer Banking:              Auto 41,843 1,725 764 170 2,659 0 44,502Home loan 6,596 35 16 153 204 16,558 23,358Retail banking 3,480 18 7 20 45 30 3,555Total consumer banking 51,919 1,778 787 343 2,908 16,588 71,415Commercial Banking:              Commercial and multifamily real estate 26,287 10 7 7 24 30 26,341Commercial and industrial 38,051 121 92 309 522 740 39,313Total commercial lending 64,338 131 99 316 546 770 65,654Small-ticket commercial real estate 537 4 2 5 11 0 548Total commercial banking 64,875 135 101 321 557 770 66,202Other loans 74 2 1 5 8 0 82Total loans(2) $210,688 $2,970$1,577$2,010 $6,557 $17,358 $234,603% of Total loans 89.81% 1.26% 0.67% 0.86% 2.79% 7.40% 100.00%   81Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents   December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions) Current 30-59Days 60-89Days > 90Days TotalDelinquentLoans PCI Loans TotalLoansCredit Card:              Domestic credit card(1) $84,954 $906 $658 $1,421 $2,985 $0 $87,939International credit card 7,903 110 67 106 283 0 8,186Total credit card 92,857 1,016 725 1,527 3,268 0 96,125Consumer Banking:              Auto 38,549 1,901 880 219 3,000 0 41,549Home loan 6,465 41 18 176 235 18,527 25,227Retail banking 3,514 21 8 20 49 33 3,596Total consumer banking 48,528 1,963 906 415 3,284 18,560 70,372Commercial Banking:              Commercial and multifamily real estate 25,449 34 0 4 38 31 25,518Commercial and industrial 35,920 51 34 203 288 927 37,135Total commercial lending 61,369 85 34 207 326 958 62,653Small-ticket commercial real estate 607 3 1 2 6 0 613Total commercial banking 61,976 88 35 209 332 958 63,266Other loans 77 2 2 7 11 0 88Total loans(2) $203,438 $3,069 $1,668 $2,158 $6,895 $19,518 $229,851% of Total loans 88.51% 1.33% 0.73% 0.94% 3.00% 8.49% 100.00%__________(1) Includes installment loans of $11 million and $16 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.(2) Loans are presented net of unearned income, unamortized premiums and discounts, and unamortized deferred fees and costs totaling $926 million and $989 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.We pledge loan collateral at the FHLB to secure borrowing capacity.

PCI loans are excluded from loans reported as 90 days or more past due and accruing interest as well as nonperforming loans. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional information on our policies for nonperforming loans.Credit CardOur credit card loan portfolio is highly diversified across millions of accounts and numerous geographies without significant individual exposure. We therefore generally manage credit risk on a portfolio basis. The risk in our credit card loan portfolio correlates to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates and home values, as well as customer liquidity, all of which can have a material effect on credit performance. The primary factors we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our credit card portfolio are delinquency and charge-off trends, including an analysis of the migration of loans between delinquency categories over time.The table below displays the geographic profile of our credit card loan portfolio as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. We also present net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.Table 4.3: Credit Card Risk Profile by Geographic Region  June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions) Amount % ofTotal(1) Amount % ofTotal(1)Domestic credit card:        California $10,199 10.5% $10,029 10.5%Texas 6,493 6.7 6,344 6.6New York 6,451 6.7 6,446 6.7Florida 5,849 6.0 5,712 5.9Illinois 4,111 4.2 4,121 4.3Pennsylvania 3,707 3.8 3,764 3.9Ohio 3,324 3.4 3,371 3.5New Jersey 3,190 3.3 3,210 3.3Michigan 2,898 3.0 2,922 3.0Other 42,359 43.8 42,020 43.8Total domestic credit card 88,581 91.4 87,939 91.5International credit card:        Canada 5,312 5.5 4,889 5.1United Kingdom 3,011 3.1 3,297 3.4Total international credit card 8,323 8.6 8,186 8.5Total credit card $96,904 100.0% $96,125 100.0%__________(1) Percentages by geographic region are calculated based on period-end amounts. 83Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents Table 4.4: Credit Card Net Charge-Offs  Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,  2016 2015 2016 2015(Dollars in millions) Amount Rate Amount Rate Amount Rate Amount RateNet charge-offs:(1)                Domestic credit card $874 4.07% $650 3.42% $1,761 4.12% $1,314 3.49%International credit card 75 3.54 53 2.65 138 3.39 108 2.73Total credit card $949 4.02 $703 3.35 $1,899 4.05 $1,422 3.42__________(1) Net charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance that we determine to be uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. The net charge-off rate is calculated for each loan category by dividing annualized net charge-offs by average balance of loans held for investment for the period. Net charge-offs and the net charge-off rate are impacted periodically by fluctuations in recoveries, including loan sales.Consumer BankingOur consumer banking loan portfolio consists of auto, home and retail banking loans. Similar to our credit card loan portfolio, the risk in our consumer banking loan portfolio correlates to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates, gross domestic product (“GDP”) and home values, as well as customer liquidity, all of which can have a material effect on credit performance. Delinquency, nonperforming loans and charge-off trends are key factors we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our consumer banking loan portfolio. The table below displays the geographic profile of our consumer banking loan portfolio, including PCI loans. We also present the delinquency and nonperforming loan rates of our consumer banking loan portfolio as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, as well as net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.Table 4.5: Consumer Banking Risk Profile by Geographic Region   June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions) Amount % of Total(1) Amount % ofTotal(1)Auto:        Texas $5,847 8.2% $5,463 7.8%California 5,065 7.1 4,611 6.5Florida 3,673 5.1 3,315 4.7Georgia 2,359 3.3 2,245 3.2Louisiana 2,024 2.8 1,882 2.7Illinois 1,952 2.7 1,859 2.6Ohio 1,844 2.6 1,738 2.5Other 21,738 30.5 20,436 29.0Total auto 44,502 62.3 41,549 59.0Home loan:        California 5,406 7.6 5,884 8.4New York 2,054 2.9 2,171 3.1Maryland 1,480 2.0 1,539 2.2Illinois 1,365 1.9 1,490 2.1Virginia 1,281 1.8 1,354 1.9New Jersey 1,197 1.7 1,293 1.8Louisiana 1,043 1.5 1,146 1.6Other 9,532 13.3 10,350 14.8Total home loan 23,358 32.7 25,227 35.9 84Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents   June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions) Amount % of Total(1) Amount % ofTotal(1)Retail banking:        Louisiana $1,042 1.5% $1,071 1.5%New York 919 1.3 921 1.3Texas 753 1.1 757 1.1New Jersey 243 0.3 259 0.4Maryland 186 0.3 180 0.3Virginia 150 0.2 151 0.2Other 262 0.3 257 0.3Total retail banking 3,555 5.0 3,596 5.1Total consumer banking $71,415 100.0% $70,372 100.0%__________(1) Percentages by geographic region are calculated based on period-end amounts.Table 4.6: Consumer Banking Net Charge-Offs and Nonperforming Loans  Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,  2016 2015 2016 2015(Dollars in millions) Amount Rate(1) Amount Rate(1) Amount Rate(1) Amount Rate(1)Net charge-offs:                Auto $130 1.20% $121 1.22% $298 1.39% $269 1.38%Home loan(2) 5 0.09 3 0.04 8 0.07 5 0.03Retail banking 11 1.26 12 1.39 23 1.31 21 1.18Total consumer banking(2) $146 0.83 $136 0.76 $329 0.93 $295 0.83  June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions) Amount Rate(3) Amount Rate(3)Nonperforming loans:        Auto $170 0.38% $219 0.53%Home loan(4) 289 1.24 311 1.23Retail banking 32 0.89 28 0.77Total consumer banking(4) $491 0.69 $558 0.79__________(1) Calculated for each loan category by dividing annualized net charge-offs by average balance of loans held for investment for the period.

In evaluating the credit quality and risk of our home loan portfolio, we continually monitor a variety of mortgage loan characteristics that may affect the default experience on this loan portfolio, such as vintage, geographic concentrations, lien priority and product type. Certain loan concentrations have experienced higher delinquency rates as a result of the significant decline in home prices after the peak in 2006 and subsequent rise in unemployment. These loan concentrations include loans originated between 2006 and 2008 in an environment of decreasing home sales, broadly declining home prices and more relaxed underwriting standards. The following table presents the distribution of our home loan portfolio as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, based on selected key risk characteristics.Table 4.7: Home Loan Risk Profile by Vintage, Geography, Lien Priority and Interest Rate Type  June 30, 2016  Loans PCI Loans(3) Total Home Loans(Dollars in millions) Amount % ofTotal(1) Amount % ofTotal(1) Amount % ofTotal(1)Origination year:(2)            < = 2007 $2,327 9.9% $8,239 35.3% $10,566 45.2%2008 144 0.6 2,577 11.1 2,721 11.72009 90 0.4 1,286 5.5 1,376 5.92010 89 0.4 1,894 8.1 1,983 8.52011 159 0.7 2,087 8.9 2,246 9.62012 1,139 4.9 329 1.4 1,468 6.32013 511 2.2 67 0.3 578 2.52014 622 2.7 33 0.1 655 2.82015 1,096 4.7 32 0.1 1,128 4.82016 623 2.6 14 0.1 637 2.7Total $6,800 29.1% $16,558 70.9% $23,358 100.0%Geographic concentration:(4)            California $869 3.7% $4,537 19.4% $5,406 23.1%New York 1,275 5.5 779 3.3 2,054 8.8Maryland 548 2.3 932 4.0 1,480 6.3Illinois 96 0.4 1,269 5.4 1,365 5.8Virginia 455 1.9 826 3.6 1,281 5.5New Jersey 355 1.5 842 3.6 1,197 5.1Louisiana 1,018 4.4 25 0.1 1,043 4.5Florida 152 0.7 880 3.8 1,032 4.5Arizona 88 0.4 900 3.8 988 4.2Washington 116 0.5 703 3.0 819 3.5Other 1,828 7.8 4,865 20.9 6,693 28.7Total $6,800 29.1% $16,558 70.9% $23,358 100.0%Lien type:            1st lien $5,808 24.9% $16,262 69.6% $22,070 94.5%2nd lien 992 4.2 296 1.3 1,288 5.5Total $6,800 29.1% $16,558 70.9% $23,358 100.0%Interest rate type:            Fixed rate $2,961 12.7% $2,042 8.7% $5,003 21.4%Adjustable rate 3,839 16.4 14,516 62.2 18,355 78.6Total $6,800 29.1% $16,558 70.9% $23,358 100.0% 86Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents   December 31, 2015  Loans PCI Loans(3) Total Home Loans(Dollars in millions) Amount % ofTotal(1) Amount % ofTotal(1) Amount % ofTotal(1)Origination year:(2)  < = 2007 $2,559 10.1% $8,956 35.5% $11,515 45.6%2008 157 0.6 2,866 11.4 3,023 12.02009 97 0.4 1,498 5.9 1,595 6.32010 97 0.4 2,208 8.8 2,305 9.22011 176 0.7 2,476 9.8 2,652 10.52012 1,276 5.1 389 1.5 1,665 6.62013 557 2.2 71 0.3 628 2.52014 680 2.7 31 0.1 711 2.82015 1,101 4.4 32 0.1 1,133 4.5Total $6,700 26.6% $18,527 73.4% $25,227 100.0%Geographic concentration:(4)            California $871 3.5% $5,013 19.9% $5,884 23.4%New York 1,295 5.1 876 3.5 2,171 8.6Maryland 511 2.0 1,028 4.1 1,539 6.1Illinois 89 0.4 1,401 5.5 1,490 5.9Virginia 428 1.7 926 3.7 1,354 5.4New Jersey 353 1.4 940 3.7 1,293 5.1Louisiana 1,069 4.2 27 0.1 1,096 4.3Florida 157 0.6 989 3.9 1,146 4.5Arizona 81 0.4 995 3.9 1,076 4.3Washington 113 0.4 806 3.2 919 3.6Other 1,733 6.9 5,526 21.9 7,259 28.8Total $6,700 26.6% $18,527 73.4% $25,227 100.0%Lien type:            1st lien $5,705 22.6% $18,207 72.2% $23,912 94.8%2nd lien 995 4.0 320 1.2 1,315 5.2Total $6,700 26.6% $18,527 73.4% $25,227 100.0%Interest rate type:            Fixed rate $2,751 10.9% $2,264 9.0% $5,015 19.9%Adjustable rate 3,949 15.7 16,263 64.4 20,212 80.1Total $6,700 26.6% $18,527 73.4% $25,227 100.0%__________(1) Percentages within each risk category are calculated based on period-end amounts.(2) Modified loans are reported in the origination year of the initial borrowing. (3) The PCI loan balances with an origination date in the years subsequent to 2012 represent refinancing of previously acquired home loans.(4) States listed represent those that have the highest individual concentration of home loans.Our recorded investment in home loans that are in process of foreclosure was $403 million and $474 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We commence the foreclosure process on home loans when a borrower becomes at least 120 days delinquent in accordance with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau regulations. Foreclosure procedures and timelines vary according to state laws. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying value of the foreclosed residential real estate properties we hold and report as other assets on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $93 million and $123 million, respectively.  87Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents Commercial BankingWe evaluate the credit risk of commercial loans individually and use a risk-rating system to determine credit quality. We assign internal risk ratings to loans based on relevant information about the ability of the borrowers to repay their debt. In determining the risk rating of a particular loan, some of the factors considered are the borrower’s current financial condition, historical and projected future credit performance, prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors, the estimated realizable value of any collateral and current economic trends. The scale based on our internal risk rating system is as follows:•Noncriticized: Loans that have not been designated as criticized, frequently referred to as “pass” loans.•Criticized performing: Loans in which the financial condition of the obligor is stressed, affecting earnings, cash flows or collateral values. The borrower currently has adequate capacity to meet near-term obligations; however, the stress, left unabated, may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects at some future date.•Criticized nonperforming: Loans that are not adequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as criticized nonperforming have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, which jeopardize the full repayment of the debt. These loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain a credit loss if the deficiencies are not corrected and are generally placed on nonaccrual status.We use our internal risk rating system for regulatory reporting, determining the frequency of credit exposure reviews, and evaluating and determining the allowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans. Loans of $1 million or more that are designated as criticized performing and criticized nonperforming are reviewed quarterly by management to determine if they are appropriately classified/rated and whether any impairment exists. Noncriticized loans greater than $1 million are specifically reviewed, at least annually, to determine the appropriate risk rating. In addition, we evaluate the risk rating during the renewal process of any loan or if a loan becomes past due.The following table presents the geographic distribution and internal risk ratings of our commercial loan portfolio as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Table 4.8: Commercial Banking Risk Profile by Geographic Region and Internal Risk Rating  June 30, 2016(Dollars in millions) CommercialandMultifamilyReal Estate % ofTotal(1) CommercialandIndustrial % ofTotal(1) Small-ticketCommercialReal Estate % ofTotal(1)  TotalCommercial Banking % ofTotal(1) Geographic concentration:(2)                Northeast $15,488 58.8% $8,797 22.4% $336 61.3% $24,621 37.2%Mid-Atlantic 3,284 12.5 3,376 8.6 21 3.8 6,681 10.1South 4,043 15.3 15,692 39.9 37 6.8 19,772 29.9Other 3,526 13.4 11,448 29.1 154 28.1 15,128 22.8Total $26,341 100.0% $39,313 100.0% $548 100.0% $66,202 100.0%Internal risk rating:(3)                Noncriticized $26,050 98.9% $35,340 89.9% $536 97.9% $61,926 93.5%Criticized performing 235 0.9 2,218 5.6 3 0.5 2,456 3.7Criticized nonperforming 26 0.1 1,015 2.6 9 1.6 1,050 1.6PCI loans(4) 30 0.1 740 1.9 0 0.0 770 1.2Total $26,341 100.0% $39,313 100.0% $548 100.0% $66,202 100.0% 88Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents   December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions) CommercialandMultifamilyReal Estate % ofTotal(1) CommercialandIndustrial % ofTotal(1) Small-ticketCommercialReal Estate % ofTotal(1)  TotalCommercial Banking % ofTotal(1) Geographic concentration:(2)                Northeast $15,949 62.5% $8,074 21.8% $376 61.3% $24,399 38.6%Mid-Atlantic 2,797 11.0 3,010 8.1 25 4.1 5,832 9.2South 4,070 15.9 15,240 41.0 40 6.5 19,350 30.6Other 2,702 10.6 10,811 29.1 172 28.1 13,685 21.6Total $25,518 100.0% $37,135 100.0% $613 100.0% $63,266 100.0%Internal risk rating:(3)                Noncriticized $25,130 98.5% $34,008 91.6% $605 98.7% $59,743 94.4%Criticized performing 350 1.4 1,662 4.5 3 0.5 2,015 3.2Criticized nonperforming 7 0.0 538 1.4 5 0.8 550 0.9PCI loans(4) 31 0.1 927 2.5 0 0.0 958 1.5Total $25,518 100.0% $37,135 100.0% $613 100.0% $63,266 100.0%__________(1) Percentages calculated based on total loans held for investment in each respective loan category using period-end amounts.(2) Geographic concentration is generally determined by the location of the borrower’s business or the location of the collateral associated with the loan.

Impaired loans without an allowance generally represent loans that have been charged down to the fair value of the underlying collateral for which we believe no additional losses have been incurred, or where the fair value of the underlying collateral meets or exceeds the loan’s amortized cost.(2) The average recorded investment of credit card loans includes finance charges and fees.(3) Although auto loans from loan recovery inventory are not reported in our loans held for investment, they are included as impaired loans above since they are reported as TDRs.The total recorded investment of loans modified in TDRs represents $2.1 billion and $1.8 billion of the impaired loans presented above as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Consumer TDRs classified as performing totaled $1.0 billion as of both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Commercial TDRs classified as performing totaled $420 million and $334 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.As part of our loan modification programs to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, we may provide multiple concessions to minimize our economic loss and improve long-term loan performance and collectability.

(3) Represents percentage of loans modified and accounted for as TDRs during the period that were granted a reduced interest rate.(4) Due to multiple concessions granted to some troubled borrowers, percentages may total more than 100% for certain loan types.(5) Represents weighted average interest rate reduction for those loans that received an interest rate concession.(6) Represents percentage of loans modified and accounted for as TDRs during the period that were granted a maturity date extension.(7) Represents weighted average change in maturity date for those loans that received a maturity date extension.(8) Represents percentage of loans modified and accounted for as TDRs during the period that were granted forgiveness or forbearance of a portion of their balance.(9) Total amount represents the gross balance forgiven. For loans modified in bankruptcy, the gross balance reduction represents collateral value write-downs associated with the discharge of the borrower’s obligations.TDR—Subsequent Defaults of Completed TDR ModificationsThe following table presents the type, number and recorded investment amount of loans modified in TDRs that experienced a default during the period and had completed a modification event in the twelve months prior to the default. A default occurs if the loan is either 90 days or more delinquent, has been charged off as of the end of the period presented or has been reclassified from accrual to nonaccrual status. 94Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents Table 4.11: TDR—Subsequent Defaults  Three Months Ended Six Months Ended  June 30, 2016 June 30, 2016(Dollars in millions) Number ofContracts Amount Number ofContracts AmountCredit Card:        Domestic credit card 10,231 $16 20,825 $34International credit card(1) 9,972 21 18,785 41Total credit card 20,203 37 39,610 75Consumer Banking:        Auto 2,061 22 3,913 43Home loan 13 2 23 3Retail banking 10 1 25 3Total consumer banking 2,084 25 3,961 49Commercial Banking:        Commercial and multifamily real estate 0 0 0 0Commercial and industrial 3 14 20 37Total commercial lending 3 14 20 37Small-ticket commercial real estate 2 0 2 0Total commercial banking 5 14 22 37Total 22,292 $76 43,593 $161  Three Months Ended Six Months Ended  June 30, 2015 June 30, 2015(Dollars in millions) Number ofContracts Amount Number ofContracts AmountCredit Card:        Domestic credit card 9,661 $16 19,328 $32International credit card(1) 8,624 23 17,172 43Total credit card 18,285 39 36,500 75Consumer Banking:        Auto 2,128 24 3,875 44Home loan 2 0 7 0Retail banking 4 0 14 1Total consumer banking 2,134 24 3,896 45Commercial Banking:        Commercial and multifamily real estate 0 0 0 0Commercial and industrial 3 17 3 17Total commercial lending 3 17 3 17Small-ticket commercial real estate 0 0 0 0Total commercial banking 3 17 3 17Total 20,422 $80 40,399 $137__________(1) In the U.K., regulators require the acceptance of payment plan proposals in which the modified payments may be less than the contractual minimum amount. As a result, loans entering long-term TDR payment programs in the U.K. typically continue to age and ultimately charge off even when fully in compliance with the TDR program terms. 95Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents PCI Loans Outstanding Balance and Carrying Value of PCI LoansThe table below presents the outstanding balance and the carrying value of PCI loans as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

Unused credit card lines available to our customers totaled $311.6 billion and $308.3 billion as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. While these amounts represented the total available unused credit card lines, we have not experienced and do not anticipate that all of our customers will access their entire available line at any given point in time. 96Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents In addition to available unused credit card lines, we enter into commitments to extend credit that are legally binding conditional agreements having fixed expirations or termination dates and specified interest rates and purposes. These commitments generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards. Collateral requirements and loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios are the same as those for funded transactions and are established based on management’s credit assessment of the customer. These commitments may expire without being drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future funding requirements. The outstanding unfunded commitments to extend credit, other than credit card lines, were approximately $26.8 billion and $27.9 billion, which included $927 million and $1.0 billion of advised lines of credit as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Advised lines of credit are not considered legally binding commitments as funding is subject to our satisfactory evaluation of the customer at the time credit is requested.   97Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents NOTE 5—ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES AND RESERVE FOR UNFUNDED LENDING COMMITMENTSOur allowance for loan and lease losses represents management’s best estimate of incurred loan and lease losses inherent in our loans held for investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date. In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments, such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments. The provision for losses on unfunded lending commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income and the related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of our 2015 Form 10-K for further discussion on the methodology and policy for determining our allowance for loan and lease losses for each of our loan portfolio segments, as well as information on our reserve for unfunded lending commitments.Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments ActivityThe table

Our primary involvement with VIEs has been related to our securitization transactions in which we transferred assets from our balance sheet to securitization trusts. We have primarily securitized credit card and home loans, which have provided a source of funding for us and enabled us to transfer a certain portion of the economic risk of the loans or related debt securities to third parties.The entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is referred to as the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE. The majority of the VIEs in which we are involved have been consolidated in our financial statements.Summary of Consolidated and Unconsolidated VIEsThe table below presents a summary of VIEs, aggregated based on VIEs with similar characteristics, in which we had continuing involvement or held a variable interest as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. We separately present information for consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs.For consolidated VIEs, we present the carrying amount of assets and liabilities of the VIEs, which includes the seller’s interest and repurchased notes held by other related parties. The assets of consolidated VIEs primarily consist of cash and loan receivables, which we report on our consolidated balance sheets under restricted cash and loans held in consolidated trusts, respectively. The assets of a particular VIE are the primary source of funds to settle its obligations. The creditors of the VIEs typically do not have recourse to the general credit of the Company. The liabilities primarily consist of debt securities issued by the VIEs, which we report under securitized debt obligations. For unconsolidated VIEs, we present the carrying amount of assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets and our maximum exposure to loss. Our maximum exposure to loss is estimated based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and we are required to meet our maximum remaining funding obligations.Table 6.1: Carrying Amount of Consolidated and Unconsolidated VIEs  June 30, 2016  Consolidated Unconsolidated(Dollars in millions) CarryingAmountof Assets CarryingAmount ofLiabilities CarryingAmountof Assets CarryingAmount ofLiabilities Maximum Exposure toLossSecuritization-Related VIEs:          Credit card loan securitizations(1) $32,089 $16,802 $0 $0 $0Home loan securitizations(2) 0 0 203 27 1,281Total securitization-related VIEs 32,089 16,802 203 27 1,281Other VIEs:          Affordable housing entities 174 0 3,803 508 3,803Entities that provide capital to low-income and rural communities 732 127 0 0 0Other 0 0 66 0 66Total other VIEs 906 127 3,869 508 3,869Total VIEs $32,995 $16,929 $4,072 $535 $5,150 102Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents   December 31, 2015  Consolidated Unconsolidated(Dollars in millions) CarryingAmountof Assets CarryingAmount ofLiabilities CarryingAmountof Assets CarryingAmount ofLiabilities MaximumExposure toLossSecuritization-Related VIEs:          Credit card loan securitizations(1) $34,800 $16,925 $0 $0 $0Home loan securitizations(2) 0 0 211 27 873Total securitization-related VIEs 34,800 16,925 211 27 873Other VIEs:          Affordable housing entities 0 0 3,852 555 3,852Entities that provide capital to low-income and rural communities 352 101 0 0 0Other 0 0 57 0 57Total other VIEs 352 101 3,909 555 3,909Total VIEs $35,152 $17,026 $4,120 $582 $4,782__________(1) Represents the carrying amount of assets and liabilities owned by the VIE, which includes the seller’s interest and repurchased notes held by other related parties.(2) The carrying amount of assets of unconsolidated securitization-related VIEs consists of retained interests associated with the securitization of option-adjustable rate mortgage (“option-ARM”) loans and letters of credit related to manufactured housing securitizations. These are reported on our consolidated balance sheets within other assets. The carrying amount of liabilities of unconsolidated securitization-related VIEs is comprised of obligations on certain swap agreements associated with the securitizations of manufactured housing loans and other obligations. These are reported on our consolidated balance sheets within other liabilities.Securitization-Related VIEsIn a securitization transaction, assets from our balance sheet are transferred to a trust we establish, which typically meets the definition of a VIE. Our continuing involvement in the majority of our securitization transactions consists primarily of holding certain retained interests and acting as the primary servicer on certain transactions. We also may have exposure associated with contractual obligations to repurchase previously transferred loans due to breaches of representations and warranties. See “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others” for information related to reserves we have established for our mortgage representation and warranty exposure. 103Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents The table below presents the securitization-related VIEs in which we had continuing involvement as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Table 6.2: Continuing Involvement in Securitization-Related VIEs    Mortgage (Dollars in millions) CreditCard Option-ARM GreenPointHELOCs GreenPointManufacturedHousing June 30, 2016:         Securities held by third-party investors $16,130 $1,625 $65 $743 Receivables in the trust 31,825 1,680 59 748 Cash balance of spread or reserve accounts 0 8 N/A 137 Retained interests Yes Yes Yes Yes Servicing retained Yes Yes(1) No No(2) Amortization event(3) No No No No December 31, 2015:         Securities held by third-party investors $16,166 $1,754 $74 $789 Receivables in the trust 33,783 1,814 68 794 Cash balance of spread or reserve accounts 0 8 N/A 134 Retained interests Yes Yes Yes Yes Servicing retained Yes Yes(1) No No(2) Amortization event(3) No No No No __________(1) We continue to service only certain option-ARM securitizations.(2) The core servicing activities for the manufactured housing securitizations are completed by a third party.(3) Amortization events vary according to each specific trust agreement but generally are triggered by declines in performance or credit metrics of the underlying assets, such as net charge-off rates or delinquency rates, beyond certain predetermined thresholds. Generally, the occurrence of an amortization event changes the sequencing and amount of trust-related cash flows to the benefit of more senior interest holders.Credit Card SecuritizationsWe hold certain retained interests in our credit card securitizations and continue to service the receivables in these trusts. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we were deemed to be the primary beneficiary, and accordingly, all of these trusts have been consolidated in our financial statements. Mortgage SecuritizationsOption-ARM LoansWe had previously securitized option-ARM loans by transferring these loans to securitization trusts that had issued mortgage-backed securities to investors. The outstanding balance of debt securities held by third-party investors related to these mortgage loan securitization trusts was $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.We continue to service a portion of the remaining mortgage loans in these securitizations. We also retain rights to future cash flows arising from these securitizations, the most significant being certificated interest-only bonds issued by the trusts. We generally estimate the fair value of these retained interests based on the estimated present value of expected future cash flows, using our best estimates of the key assumptions which include credit losses, prepayment speeds and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. For the mortgage loans that we continue to service, we do not consolidate the related trusts because we do not have the right to receive benefits nor the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts. For the remaining trusts, for which we no longer service the underlying mortgage loans, we do not consolidate these entities since we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts. 104Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents In connection with the securitization of certain option-ARM loans, a third party is obligated to advance a portion of any “negative amortization” resulting from monthly payments that are less than the interest accrued for that payment period. We have an agreement in place with the third party that mirrors this advance requirement. The amount advanced is tracked through mortgage-backed securities retained as part of the securitization transaction. As advances occur, we record an asset in the form of negative amortization bonds, which are held at fair value in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Our maximum exposure is affected by rate caps and monthly payment change caps, but the funding obligation cannot exceed the difference between the original loan balance multiplied by a preset negative amortization cap and the current unpaid principal balance. We have also entered into certain derivative contracts related to the securitization activities. These are classified as free-standing derivatives, with fair value adjustments recorded in non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income. See “Note 9—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” for further details on these derivatives.GreenPoint Mortgage Home Equity Lines of Credit (“HELOCs”)Our discontinued wholesale mortgage banking unit, GreenPoint Mortgage Funding Inc. (“GreenPoint”), previously sold HELOCs in whole loan sales that were subsequently securitized by third parties. GreenPoint acquired residual interests in certain of those securitization trusts. We do not consolidate these trusts because we either lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts or because we do not have the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts. As the residual interest holder, GreenPoint is required to fund advances on the HELOCs when certain performance triggers are met due to deterioration in asset performance. On behalf of GreenPoint, we have funded cumulative advances of $30 million as of both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. These advances are generally expensed as funded due to the low likelihood of recovery. We also have unfunded commitments of $5 million and $6 million related to those interests for our non-consolidated VIEs as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.GreenPoint Credit Manufactured HousingWe have retained certain interests and obligations related to the discontinued manufactured housing operations of GreenPoint Credit, LLC, a subsidiary of GreenPoint. Such discontinued operations, including the related recourse obligations, servicing rights and the primary obligation to execute mandatory clean-up calls in certain securitization transactions were sold to a third party in 2004. We do not consolidate these securitization trusts because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts as we no longer service the loans.The unpaid principal balance of manufactured housing securitization transactions where we are the residual interest holder was $748 million and $794 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. In the event the third party servicer does not fulfill its obligation to exercise the clean-up calls on certain securitizations, the obligation reverts to us and we would be required to acquire a maximum of approximately $420 million of loan receivables and other assets upon our execution of these clean-up calls with the requirement to absorb any losses on the loan receivables and other assets. See “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others” for information related to these obligations. We were required to fund letters of credit to cover losses on certain manufactured housing securitizations. We have the right to receive any funds remaining in the letters of credit after the securities are released. These letters of credit are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets and totaled $79 million and $76 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We also have credit exposure on agreements that we entered into to absorb a portion of the risk of loss on certain manufactured housing securitizations not subject to the funded letters of credit. Our maximum credit exposure related to these agreements totaled $12 million and $13 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These agreements are included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, and our obligation under these agreements was $8 million as of both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Other VIEsAffordable Housing EntitiesAs part of our community reinvestment initiatives, we invest in private investment funds that make equity investments in multi-family affordable housing properties. We receive affordable housing tax credits for these investments. The activities of these entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt.  105Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents We account for certain of our investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method if certain criteria are met. The proportional amortization method amortizes the cost of the investment over the period in which the investor expects to receive tax credits and other tax benefits, and the resulting amortization is recognized as a component of income tax expense attributable to continuing operations. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized amortization of $196 million and $172 million, respectively, and tax credits of $228 million and $191 million, respectively, associated with these investments within income tax provision. The carrying value of our investments in these qualified affordable housing projects was $3.7 billion and $3.5 billion as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We are periodically required to provide additional financial or other support during the period of the investments. We had a recorded liability of $1.3 billion for these unfunded commitments as of both June 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, which is expected to be paid from 2016 to 2019.For those investment funds considered to be VIEs, we are not required to consolidate them if we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of those entities. We record our interests in these unconsolidated VIEs in loans held for investment, other assets and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our interests consisted of assets of approximately $3.8 billion and $3.9 billion as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Our maximum exposure to these entities is limited to our variable interests in the entities of $3.8 billion and $3.9 billion as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit and we do not provide additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it. The total assets of the unconsolidated VIE investment funds were $11.1 billion and $11.4 billion as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.Entities that Provide Capital to Low-Income and Rural Communities We hold variable interests in entities (“Investor Entities”) that invest in community development entities (“CDEs”) that provide debt financing to businesses and non-profit entities in low-income and rural communities. Variable interests in the CDEs held by the consolidated Investor Entities are also our variable interests. The activities of the Investor Entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. The activities of the CDEs are financed solely with invested equity capital. We receive federal and state tax credits for these investments. We consolidate the VIEs in which we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and where we have the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE. We have also consolidated other investments and CDEs that are not considered to be VIEs, but where we hold a controlling financial interest. The assets of the VIEs that we consolidated, which totaled approximately $732 million and $352 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets in cash, loans held for investment, interest receivable and other assets. The liabilities are reflected in other liabilities. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit. We have not provided additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it.OtherOther VIEs include variable interests that we hold in companies that promote renewable energy sources and other equity method investments. We were not required to consolidate these entities because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance. Our maximum exposure to these entities is limited to the investment on our consolidated balance sheets of $66 million and $57 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The creditors of the other VIEs have no recourse to our general credit. We have not provided additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it. 106Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents NOTE 7—GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETSThe table below displays the components of goodwill, intangible assets and mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

Securitized and Unsecured Debt ObligationsIn addition to our deposits, which serve as our primary funding source, we use a variety of other funding sources including short-term borrowings, the issuance of senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings, and securitization transactions. In addition, we utilize FHLB advances, which are secured by certain portions of our loan and investment securities portfolios, for our funding needs. The securitized debt obligations are separately presented on our consolidated balance sheets as they represent obligations of consolidated securitization trusts, while federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings, including FHLB advances, are included in other debt on our consolidated balance sheets.Securitized Debt ObligationsOur outstanding borrowings due to securitization investors decreased to $16.1 billion as of June 30, 2016, from $16.2 billion as of December 31, 2015. During the first six months of 2016, approximately $1.9 billion of new debt was issued to third-party investors from our credit card loan securitization trust offset by $2.0 billion of maturities.Senior and Subordinated NotesAs of June 30, 2016, we had $21.9 billion of senior and subordinated notes outstanding, inclusive of fair value hedging adjustments of $379 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had $21.8 billion of senior and subordinated notes outstanding, inclusive of fair value hedging adjustments of $134 million. During the first six months of 2016, $500 million of outstanding unsecured notes were retired. See “Note 9—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” for information about our fair value hedging activities.FHLB Advances and OtherWe have access to funding through the FHLB system and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Our FHLB and Federal Reserve memberships require us to hold FHLB and Federal Reserve stock which totaled $2.1 billion as of both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.Our FHLB advances and lines of credit are secured by our investment securities, residential home loans, multifamily real estate loans, commercial real estate loans and HELOCs. The outstanding FHLB advances totaled $20.1 billion as of both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, substantially all of which represented long-term advances generally callable on either a one-month or a three-month basis. We did not access the Federal Reserve Discount Window for funding during 2015 or the first six months of 2016.Composition of Deposits, Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term DebtThe table below summarizes the components of our deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Our total short-term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less. Our long-term debt consists of borrowings with an original contractual maturity of greater than one year. The amounts presented for outstanding borrowings include unamortized debt premiums and discounts, net of debt issuance costs and fair value hedge accounting adjustments. 109Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents Table 8.1: Components of Deposits, Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt(Dollars in millions) June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015Deposits:    Non-interest-bearing deposits $25,424 $25,847Interest-bearing deposits 195,635 191,874Total deposits $221,059 $217,721Short-term borrowings:    Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase $999 $981Total short-term borrowings $999 $981  June 30, 2016  (Dollars in millions) MaturityDates Interest Rates Weighted-AverageInterest Rate  Outstanding Amount December 31, 2015Long-term debt:          Securitized debt obligations(1) 2016 - 2025 0.48 - 5.75% 1.46% $16,130 $16,166Senior and subordinated notes:(1)          Fixed unsecured senior debt 2016 - 2025 1.15 - 6.75 2.72 16,924 16,559Floating unsecured senior debt 2018 1.31 - 1.78 1.51 699 1,198Total unsecured senior debt 2.67 17,623 17,757Fixed unsecured subordinated debt 2016 - 2025 3.38 - 8.80 4.70 4,249 4,080Total senior and subordinated notes 21,872 21,837Other long-term borrowings:          FHLB advances 2016 - 2025 0.42 - 6.41 0.52 20,147 20,098Capital lease obligations 2016 - 2035 3.09 - 12.86 4.17 33 33Total other long-term borrowings 20,180 20,131Total long-term debt $58,182 $58,134Total short-term borrowings and long-term debt $59,181 $59,115__________(1) Outstanding amount includes any fair value hedge accounting adjustments.

Our primary market risks stem from the impact on our earnings and economic value of equity from changes in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, changes in foreign exchange rates. We employ several techniques to manage our interest rate sensitivity, which include changing the duration and re-pricing characteristics of various assets and liabilities by using interest rate derivatives. Our current policies also include the use of derivatives to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currency so we may limit our earnings and capital ratio exposures to foreign exchange risk. We execute our derivative contracts in both the over-the-counter (“OTC”) and exchange-traded derivative markets, and clear eligible derivative transactions through Central Counterparty Clearinghouses (“CCPs”) or often referred to as “central clearinghouses” as required under the Dodd-Frank Act. The majority of our derivatives are interest rate swaps. In addition, we may use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks. We offer various interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity derivatives as an accommodation to our customers within our Commercial Banking business, and usually offset our exposure through derivative transactions with other counterparties.Accounting for DerivativesOur derivatives are designated as either qualifying accounting hedges or free-standing derivatives. Qualifying accounting hedges are designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges. Free-standing derivatives primarily consist of customer-accommodation derivatives and economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting. •Fair Value Hedges: We designate derivatives as fair value hedges when they are used to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, which fluctuate in value as a result of movements in interest rates. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded in earnings together with offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item and any resulting ineffectiveness. Our fair value hedges consist of interest rate swaps that are intended to modify our exposure to interest rate risk on various fixed-rate assets and liabilities. •Cash Flow Hedges: We designate derivatives as cash flow hedges when they are used to manage our exposure to variability in cash flows related to forecasted transactions. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of AOCI, to the extent that the hedge relationships are effective, and amounts are reclassified from AOCI to earnings as the forecasted transactions impact earnings. To the extent that any ineffectiveness exists in the hedge relationships, the amounts are recorded in current period earnings. Our cash flow hedges use interest rate swaps and floors that are intended to hedge the variability in interest receipts or interest payments on some of our variable-rate assets or liabilities. We also enter into foreign currency forward derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to intercompany borrowings denominated in foreign currency. •Net Investment Hedges: We use net investment hedges to manage the foreign currency exposure related to our net investments in foreign operations that have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recorded in the translation adjustment component of AOCI, offsetting the translation gain or loss from those foreign operations. We execute net investment hedges using foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the translation exposure of the net investment in our foreign operations.•Free-Standing Derivatives: We use free-standing derivatives to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of residential MSRs, mortgage loan origination and purchase commitments and other interests held. We also categorize our customer accommodation derivatives and the related offsetting contracts as free-standing derivatives. Changes in the fair value of free-standing derivatives are recorded in earnings as a component of other non-interest income. 112Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents Balance Sheet PresentationThe following table summarizes the notional and fair values of our derivative instruments on a gross basis as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, which are segregated by derivatives that are designated as accounting hedges and those that are not, and are further segregated by type of contract within those two categories. The total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and any associated cash collateral received or paid.

See Table 9.2 for further information.Offsetting of Financial Assets and Liabilities Derivative contracts and repurchase agreements that we execute bilaterally in the OTC market are governed by enforceable master netting arrangements where we generally have the right to offset exposure with the same counterparty. Either counterparty can generally request to net settle all contracts through a single payment upon default on, or termination of, any one contract. We elect to offset the derivative assets and liabilities under netting arrangements for balance sheet presentation where a right of setoff exists. Derivative contracts that are cleared with central clearinghouses through our Future Commission Merchants (“FCMs”) are not subject to offsetting due to the uncertainty existing around an end-user’s ability to setoff these derivative contracts. Therefore, as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we did not offset our derivative positions cleared through clearinghouses. 113Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents We also maintain collateral agreements with certain derivative counterparties. We review our collateral positions on a daily basis and exchange collateral with our counterparties in accordance with standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association documentation, central clearing rules and other related agreements. For OTC derivatives, agreements with certain counterparties require both parties to maintain collateral in the event the fair values of derivative instruments exceed established exposure thresholds. For centrally cleared derivatives, we are subject to initial margin posting and variation margin exchange with the central clearinghouses. Acceptable types of collateral are typically in the form of cash or high quality liquid securities.The exchange of collateral is dependent upon the fair value of the derivative instruments as well as the fair value of the pledged collateral. When valuing collateral, an estimate of the variation in price and liquidity over time is subtracted in the form of a “haircut” to discount the value of the collateral pledged.The following table presents as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the gross and net fair values of our derivative assets and liabilities and repurchase agreements, as well as the related offsetting amounts permitted under U.S. GAAP. The table also includes cash and non-cash collateral received or pledged associated with such arrangements. The collateral amounts shown are limited to the extent of the related net derivative fair values or outstanding balances, thus instances of over-collateralization are not shown.Table 9.2: Offsetting of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  GrossAmounts Gross Amounts Offset in the Balance Sheet Net Amounts as Recognized Securities Collateral Held Under Master Netting Agreements  (Dollars in millions)  FinancialInstruments Cash Collateral Received   NetExposureAs of June 30, 2016            Derivatives assets(1) $2,971 $(180) $(354) $2,437 $(14) $2,423As of December 31, 2015            Derivatives assets(1) 1,518 (86) (446) 986 (156) 830  GrossAmounts Gross Amounts Offset in the Balance Sheet Net Amounts as Recognized Securities Collateral Pledged Under Master Netting Agreements  (Dollars in millions)  FinancialInstruments Cash Collateral Pledged   NetExposureAs of June 30, 2016            Derivatives liabilities(1) $905 $(180) $(189) $536 $0 $536Repurchase agreements(2)(3) 999 0 0 999 (999) 0As of December 31, 2015            Derivatives liabilities(1) 520 (86) (57) 377 0 377Repurchase agreements(2) 969 0 0 969 (969) 0__________(1) The gross balances include derivative assets and derivative liabilities as of June 30, 2016 totaling $1.6 billion and $439 million, respectively, related to the centrally cleared derivative contracts. The comparable amounts as of December 31, 2015 totaled $429 million and $314 million, respectively. These contracts were not subject to offsetting as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.(2) As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company only had repurchase obligations outstanding and did not have any reverse repurchase receivables.(3) Represents customer repurchase agreements that mature the next business day. As of June 30, 2016, we pledged collateral with a fair value of $1.0 billion under these customer repurchase agreements, which were primarily agency RMBS securities. Credit Risk-Related Contingency Features and CollateralCertain of our derivative contracts include provisions requiring that our debt maintain a credit rating of investment grade or above by each of the major credit rating agencies. In the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating below investment grade, some of our derivative counterparties would have the right to terminate the derivative contract and close out the existing positions, or demand immediate and ongoing full overnight collateralization on derivative instruments in a net liability position. Certain of our derivative contracts may also allow, in the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating of any kind, our derivative counterparties to demand additional collateralization on such derivative instruments in a net liability position. We posted $215 million and $304 million of cash collateral as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. If our debt credit rating were to fall below investment grade, we would be required to post $46 million and $55 million of additional collateral as of June 30, 2016 and  114Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents December 31, 2015, respectively. The fair value of derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features in a net liability position was less than $1 million as of both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Derivatives Counterparty Credit Risk OTC derivative instruments contain an element of credit risk that arises from the potential failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of the contract. Our exposure to derivative counterparty credit risk, at any point in time, is represented by the fair value of derivatives in a gain position, or derivative asset position, assuming no recoveries of underlying collateral. To mitigate the risk of counterparty default, we enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements and also maintain collateral agreements, where possible, with certain derivative counterparties. We generally enter into these agreements on a bilateral basis with our counterparties. These bilateral agreements typically provide for the right to offset exposures and require both parties to maintain collateral in the event the fair values of derivative instruments exceed established thresholds. However, since June 2013 we have begun to clear eligible OTC derivatives through a central clearinghouse in accordance with the requirements under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. We received cash collateral from derivative counterparties totaling $1.1 billion and $544 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We also received securities from derivative counterparties with a fair value of $15 million and $172 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which we have the ability to re-pledge. The regulatory requirement to clear eligible derivatives with central clearinghouses effectively reduces our overall counterparty credit exposure. It however increases our credit exposure to CCPs and FCMs. We are required to execute Cleared Derivatives Execution Agreements with each of our FCMs. The use of FCMs also helps mitigate operational risks. Certain of our agreements governing derivative transactions include provisions that may require us to post more collateral or otherwise change terms in our agreements under certain circumstances. We record counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments on our OTC derivative contracts to properly reflect the credit quality of the counterparty. We consider collateral and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate our credit exposure to each counterparty in determining the counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment, which may be adjusted in future periods due to changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts, collateral and creditworthiness of the counterparty. The cumulative counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as a reduction to the derivative asset balance was $7 million and $4 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We also adjust the fair value of our derivative liabilities to reflect the impact of our own credit quality. We calculate this adjustment by comparing the spreads on our credit default swaps to the discount benchmark curve. The cumulative credit risk valuation adjustment related to our credit quality recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as a reduction in the derivative liability balance was less than $1 million as of both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Income Statement Presentation and AOCIThe following table summarizes the impact of derivatives and the related hedged items in our consolidated statements of income and AOCI.Fair Value Hedges and Free-Standing DerivativesThe net gains (losses) recognized in earnings related to derivatives in fair value hedging relationships and free-standing derivatives are presented below for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. 115Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents Table 9.3: Gains and Losses on Fair Value Hedges and Free-Standing Derivatives  Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 2016 2015Derivatives designated as accounting hedges:(1)        Fair value interest rate contracts:        Gains (losses) recognized in earnings on derivatives $182 $(223) $390 $(70)Gains (losses) recognized in earnings on hedged items (175) 211 (367) 63Net fair value hedge ineffectiveness gains (losses) 7 (12) 23 (7)Derivatives not designated as accounting hedges:(1)        Interest rate contracts covering:        MSRs 8 (9) 18 (3)Customer accommodation 7 5 12 9Other interest rate exposures 16 16 31 18Total interest rate contracts 31 12 61 24Other contracts (9) 0 (9) (2)Total gains (losses) on derivatives not designated as accounting hedges 22 12 52 22Net derivative gains (losses) recognized in earnings $29 $0 $75 $15__________(1) Amounts are recorded in our consolidated statements of income in other non-interest income.Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges The table below shows the net gains (losses) related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and net investment hedges for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.Table 9.4: Gains and Losses on Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges and Net Investment Hedges   Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 2016 2015Gains (losses) recorded in AOCI:        Cash flow hedges:        Interest rate contracts $192 $(33) $618 $177Foreign exchange contracts 0 (6) 0 (11)Subtotal 192 (39) 618 166Net investment hedges:        Foreign exchange contracts 122 (97) 163 (22)Net derivatives gains (losses) recognized in AOCI $314 $(136) $781 $144Gains (losses) recorded in earnings:        Cash flow hedges:        Gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI into earnings:        Interest rate contracts(1)  $48 $50 $98 $97Foreign exchange contracts(2)  1 (8) 0 (12)Subtotal 49 42 98 85Gains (losses) recognized in earnings due to ineffectiveness:        Interest rate contracts(2)  0 0 3 2Net derivative gains (losses) recognized in earnings $49 $42 $101 $87__________(1) Amounts reclassified are recorded in our consolidated statements of income in interest income or interest expense.(2) Amounts are recorded in our consolidated statements of income in other non-interest income or other interest income.  116Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents In the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify to earnings net after-tax gains of $186 million currently recorded in AOCI as of June 30, 2016. These amounts will offset the cash flows associated with the hedged forecasted transactions. The maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions were hedged was approximately five years as of June 30, 2016. The amount we expect to reclassify into earnings may change as a result of changes in market conditions and ongoing actions taken as part of our overall risk management strategy. 117Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents NOTE 10—STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITYPreferred StockThe following table summarizes the Company’s preferred stock issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Table 10.1: Preferred Stock Issued and Outstanding      Redeemable by Issuer Beginning Per Annum Dividend Rate Dividend Frequency Liquidation Preference per Share   Carrying Value (in millions)Series Description Issuance Date     Total Shares Outstanding June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015Series B(1) 6.00% Non-Cumulative August 20, 2012 September 1, 2017 6.00% Quarterly $1,000 875,000 $853 $853Series C(1) 6.25% Non-Cumulative June 12, 2014 September 1, 2019 6.25 Quarterly 1,000 500,000 484 484Series D(1) 6.70% Non-Cumulative October 31, 2014 December 1, 2019 6.70 Quarterly 1,000 500,000 485 485Series E Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative May 14, 2015 June 1, 2020 5.55% through 5/31/2020; 3-mo.

The fair value accounting guidance provides a three-level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments. This hierarchy is based on the markets in which the assets or liabilities trade and whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable. The fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:Level 1: Valuation is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2: Valuation is based on observable market-based inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or models using inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data of substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3: Valuation is generated from techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. Valuation techniques include pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques.The accounting guidance for fair value measurements requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in determining fair value. The accounting guidance provides for the irrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-contract basis, to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value at inception of the contract and record any subsequent changes in fair value in earnings. We have not made any material fair value option elections as of or for the periods disclosed herein.For additional information on the valuation techniques used in estimating the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities on a recurring or nonrecurring basis and for estimating the fair value for financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value, see “Note 19—Fair Value Measurement” in our 2015 Form 10-K.Fair Value Governance and ControlWe have a governance framework and a number of key controls that are intended to ensure that our fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable. Our governance framework provides for independent oversight and segregation of duties. Our control processes include review and approval of new transaction types, price verification and review of valuation judgments, methods, models, process controls and results. Groups independent of our trading and investing functions, including our Corporate Valuations Group (“CVG”), Fair Value Committee (“FVC”) and Model Validation Group (“MVG”), participate in the review and validation process. The CVG, which is independent of the front office and the valuation providers, performs periodic verification of fair value measurements to determine if assigned fair values are reasonable. Prices based on third party pricing providers are checked against available market information including prices from other market sources.The FVC, which includes representation from business areas, our Risk Management and Finance functions, provides guidance and oversight to ensure an appropriate valuation control environment. The FVC regularly reviews and approves changes in valuation methodologies to ensure that our valuation practices are consistent with industry standards and adhere to regulatory and accounting guidance. We have a model policy, established by an independent Model Risk Office, which governs the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for pricing. The MVG is part of the Model Risk Office and validates all models and provides ongoing monitoring of their performance.The fair valuation governance process is set up in a manner that allows the Chairperson of the FVC to escalate valuation disputes that cannot be resolved by the FVC to a more senior committee called the Valuations Advisory Committee (“VAC”) for resolution. The VAC is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and includes other members of senior management. The VAC is only required to convene to review escalated valuation disputes.  122Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisThe following table displays our assets and liabilities measured on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:Table 12.1: Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis  June 30, 2016  Fair Value Measurements Using  (Dollars in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 TotalAssets:        Securities available for sale:        U.S. Treasury securities $5,189 $0 $0 $5,189RMBS 0 27,460 555 28,015CMBS 0 5,282 128 5,410Other ABS 0 975 30 1,005Other securities 296 26 19 341Total securities available for sale 5,485 33,743 732 39,960Other assets:        Derivative assets(1)(2) 3 2,883 85 2,971Other(3) 199 0 256 455Total assets $5,687 $36,626 $1,073 $43,386Liabilities:        Other liabilities:        Derivative liabilities(1)(2) $6 $832 $67 $905Total liabilities $6 $832 $67 $905  December 31, 2015  Fair Value Measurements Using  (Dollars in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 TotalAssets:        Securities available for sale:        U.S. Treasury securities $4,660 $0 $0 $4,660RMBS 0 26,807 504 27,311CMBS 0 5,282 97 5,379Other ABS 0 1,340 0 1,340Other securities 355 2 14 371Total securities available for sale 5,015 33,431 615 39,061Other assets:        Derivative assets(1)(2) 2 1,459 57 1,518Other(3) 183 0 279 462Total assets $5,200 $34,890 $951 $41,041Liabilities:        Other liabilities:        Derivative liabilities(1)(2) $2 $491 $27 $520Total liabilities $2 $491 $27 $520__________ 123Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents (1) The balances represent gross derivative amounts and are not reduced by the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to net positive and negative positions and the related payables and receivables for cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparty. The net derivative assets were $2.4 billion and $986 million, and the net derivative liabilities were $536 million and $377 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. See “Note 9—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” for further information. (2) Does not reflect $7 million and $4 million recognized as a net valuation allowance on derivative assets and liabilities for non-performance risk as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Non-performance risk is reflected in other assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and offset through non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income. (3) Includes consumer MSRs of $53 million and $68 million, retained interests in securitizations of $203 million and $211 million and deferred compensation plan assets of $199 million and $183 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Consumer MSRs and retained interests in securitizations are both classified within Level 3. Deferred compensation plan assets, which consist of investments in publicly traded mutual funds, are classified within Level 1.The determination of the classification of financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy is performed at the end of each reporting period. We consider all available information, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs. Based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category, judgments are made regarding the significance of the unobservable inputs to the instruments’ fair value measurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. The process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we had minimal movements between Levels 1 and 2.Level 3 Recurring Fair Value RollforwardThe table below presents a reconciliation for all assets and liabilities measured and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.

Level 3 Consumer MSRs, derivative assets and derivative liabilities, and retained interests in securitizations are reported in other non-interest income, which is a component of non-interest income, in our consolidated statements of income.(2) During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the transfers into Level 3 were primarily driven by less consistency among vendor pricing on individual securities, while the transfers out of Level 3 were primarily driven by greater consistency among multiple pricing sources.  126Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents (3) The amount presented for unrealized gains (losses) for assets still held as of the reporting date primarily represents impairments of securities available for sale, accretion on certain fixed maturity securities, changes in fair value of derivative instruments and mortgage servicing rights transactions. Impairment is reported in total OTTI, which is a component of non-interest income, in our consolidated statements of income.(4) All Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis and are not reduced by the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to net positive and negative positions and the related payables and receivables for cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparty. Significant Level 3 Fair Value Asset and Liability Input SensitivityChanges in unobservable inputs may have a significant impact on fair value. Certain of these unobservable inputs will, in isolation, have a directionally consistent impact on the fair value of the instrument for a given change in that input. Alternatively, the fair value of the instrument may move in an opposite direction for a given change in another input. In general, an increase in the discount rate, default rates, loss severity and credit spreads, in isolation, would result in a decrease in the fair value measurement. In addition, an increase in default rates would generally be accompanied by a decrease in recovery rates, slower prepayment rates and an increase in liquidity spreads.Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value MeasurementsThe following table presents the significant unobservable inputs relied upon to determine the fair values of our Level 3 financial instruments on a recurring basis. We utilize multiple third-party pricing services to obtain fair value measures for our securities. Several of our third-party pricing services are only able to provide unobservable input information for a limited number of securities due to software licensing restrictions. Other third-party pricing services are able to provide unobservable input information for all securities for which they provide a valuation. As a result, the unobservable input information for the securities available for sale presented below represents a composite summary of all information we are able to obtain for a majority of our securities. The unobservable input information for all other Level 3 financial instruments is based on the assumptions used in our internal valuation models.Table 12.3: Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements  Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements(Dollars in millions) Fair Value at June 30, 2016 SignificantValuationTechniques SignificantUnobservableInputs Range WeightedAverageAssets:          Securities available for sale:          RMBS $555 Discounted cash flows (3rd party pricing) YieldConstant prepayment rateDefault rateLoss severity 1-18%0-28%0-15%12-92% 5%5%4%54%CMBS 128 Discounted cash flows (3rd party pricing) YieldConstant prepayment rate 2-3%0-15% 2%10%Other ABS 30 Discounted cash flows (3rd party pricing) YieldConstant prepayment rate 1%3% 1%3%Other securities 19 Discounted cash flows Yield 1% 1%Other assets:          Derivative assets(1) 85 Discounted cash flows Swap rates 1-2% 2%Consumer MSRs 53 Discounted cash flows Total prepayment rateDiscount rateOption-adjusted spread rateServicing cost ($ per loan) 10-21%14%580-1500 bps$75-$100 18%14%643 bps$76Retained interests in securitization(2) 203 Discounted cash flows Life of receivables (months) Constant prepayment rateDiscount rateDefault rateLoss severity 13-822-12%3-11%1-5%4-108% N/ALiabilities:          Derivative liabilities(1) $67 Discounted cash flows Swap rates 1-2% 1% 127Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents   Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements(Dollars in millions) Fair Value at December 31, 2015 SignificantValuationTechniques SignificantUnobservableInputs Range WeightedAverageAssets:          Securities available for sale:          RMBS $504 Discounted cash flows (3rd party pricing) YieldConstant prepayment rateDefault rateLoss severity 0-12%0-28%0-8%16-85% 6%4%4%55%CMBS 97 Discounted cash flows (3rd party pricing) YieldConstant prepayment rate 2-3%0-15% 3%9%Other securities 14 Discounted cash flows Yield 1% 1%Other assets:          Derivative assets(1) 57 Discounted cash flows Swap rates 2% 2%Consumer MSRs 68 Discounted cash flows Total prepayment rateDiscount rateOption-adjusted spread rateServicing cost ($ per loan) 11-18%12%435-1,500 bps$93-$201 16%12%474 bps$98Retained interests in securitization(2) 211 Discounted cash flows Life of receivables (months) Constant prepayment rateDiscount rateDefault rateLoss severity 16-751-13%4-9%2-6%15-94% N/ALiabilities:          Derivative liabilities(1) $27 Discounted cash flows Swap rates 2% 2%__________(1) All Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis and are not reduced by the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to net positive and negative positions and the related payables and receivables for cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparty. (2) Due to the nature of the various mortgage securitization structures in which we have retained interests, it is not meaningful to present a consolidated weighted average for the significant unobservable inputs.Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring BasisWe are required to measure and recognize certain other assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on the consolidated balance sheets. These assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, from the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or when we evaluate for impairment). The following table presents the carrying amount of the assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and still held as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and for which a nonrecurring fair value measurement was recorded during the six and twelve months then ended:Table 12.4: Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements Related to Assets Still Held at Period End  June 30, 2016  Estimated Fair Value Hierarchy Total(Dollars in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Loans held for investment $0 $0 $420 $420Loans held for sale 0 5 0 5Other assets(1) 0 0 49 49Total $0 $5 $469 $474 128Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents   December 31, 2015  Estimated Fair Value Hierarchy Total(Dollars in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Loans held for investment $0 $0 $362 $362Loans held for sale 0 149 0 149Other assets(1) 0 0 92 92Total $0 $149 $454 $603__________(1) Includes foreclosed property and repossessed assets of $48 million and long-lived assets held for sale of $1 million as of June 30, 2016, compared to foreclosed property and repossessed assets of $54 million and long-lived assets held for sale of $38 million as of December 31, 2015.In the above table, loans held for investment primarily include nonperforming loans for which specific reserves or charge-offs have been recognized. These loans are classified as Level 3 as they are valued based in part on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral and the non-recoverable rate, which is considered to be a significant unobservable input. Collateral fair value sources include the appraisal value obtained from independent appraisers, broker pricing opinions or other available market information. The non-recoverable rate ranged from 0% to 94%, with a weighted average of 24%, and from 9% to 73%, with a weighted average of 20%, as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The fair value of the other assets classified as Level 3 is determined based on appraisal value or listing price which involves significant judgment; the significant unobservable inputs and related quantitative information are not meaningful to disclose as they vary significantly across properties and collateral.The following table presents total nonrecurring fair value measurements for the period, included in earnings, attributable to the change in fair value relating to assets that are still held at June 30, 2016 and 2015:Table 12.5: Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements Included in Earnings Related to Assets Still Held at Period End  Total Gains (Losses)  Six Months Ended June 30,(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015Loans held for investment $(105) $(48)Loans held for sale 0 (3)Other assets(1) (6) (30)Total $(111) $(81)__________(1) Includes losses related to foreclosed property and repossessed assets.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe following table is a summary of the fair value estimates for our financial instruments, excluding those financial instruments that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as they are included within the “Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis” table included earlier in this Note. 129Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents Table 12.6: Fair Value of Financial Instruments   June 30, 2016  CarryingAmount EstimatedFair Value Estimated Fair Value Hierarchy(Dollars in millions)   Level 1 Level 2 Level 3Financial assets:          Cash and cash equivalents $7,149 $7,149 $7,149 $0 $0Restricted cash for securitization investors 265 265 265 0 0Securities held to maturity 25,120 26,799 201 26,548 50Net loans held for investment 228,722 230,591 0 0 230,591Loans held for sale 1,220 1,222 0 1,222 0Interest receivable 1,236 1,236 0 1,236 0Other investments(1) 2,128 2,128 0 2,128 0Financial liabilities:          Non-interest-bearing deposits $25,424 $25,424 $25,424 $0 $0Interest-bearing deposits 195,635 195,832 0 16,190 179,642Securitized debt obligations 16,130 16,211 0 16,211 0Senior and subordinated notes 21,872 21,956 0 21,956 0Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase 999 999 999 0 0Other borrowings 20,180 20,149 0 20,149 0Interest payable 301 301 0 301 0  December 31, 2015  CarryingAmount EstimatedFair Value Estimated Fair Value Hierarchy(Dollars in millions)   Level 1 Level 2 Level 3Financial assets:          Cash and cash equivalents $8,023 $8,023 $8,023 $0 $0Restricted cash for securitization investors 1,017 1,017 1,017 0 0Securities held to maturity 24,619 25,317 198 25,068 51Net loans held for investment 224,721 222,007 0 0 222,007Loans held for sale 904 933 0 860 73Interest receivable 1,189 1,189 0 1,189 0Other investments(1) 2,060 2,060 0 2,060 0Financial liabilities:          Non-interest-bearing deposits $25,847 $25,847 $25,847 $0 $0Interest-bearing deposits 191,874 185,075 0 15,848 169,227Securitized debt obligations 16,166 16,225 0 16,225 0Senior and subordinated notes 21,837 22,062 0 22,062 0Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase 981 981 981 0 0Other borrowings 20,131 20,134 0 20,134 0Interest payable 299 299 0 299 0__________(1) Includes FHLB and Federal Reserve stock and cost method investments.

The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group, are included in the Other category.     Basis of PresentationWe report the results of each of our business segments on a continuing operations basis. See “Note 2—Discontinued Operations” for a discussion of our discontinued operations. The results of our individual businesses reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. Business Segment Reporting MethodologyThe results of our business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. Our internal management and reporting process used to derive our segment results employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. Our funds transfer pricing process provides a funds credit for sources of funds, such as deposits generated by our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses, and a funds charge for the use of funds by each segment. Due to the integrated nature of our business segments, estimates and judgments have been made in allocating certain revenue and expense items. Transactions between segments are based on specific criteria or approximate third-party rates. We regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods. We provide additional information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in “Note 20—Business Segments” in our 2015 Form 10-K.Segment Results and Reconciliation We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment. The following tables present our business segment results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, selected balance sheet data as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated income from continuing operations, loans held for investment and deposits.  131Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents Table 13.1: Segment Results and Reconciliation  Three Months Ended June 30, 2016(Dollars in millions) CreditCard ConsumerBanking CommercialBanking(1) Other(1) ConsolidatedTotalNet interest income (expense) $3,045 $1,439 $559 $50 $5,093Non-interest income 859 175 129 (2) 1,161Total net revenue (loss) 3,904 1,614 688 48 6,254Provision (benefit) for credit losses 1,261 204 128 (1) 1,592Non-interest expense 1,883 1,006 343 63 3,295Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 760 404 217 (14) 1,367Income tax provision (benefit) 276 147 79 (78) 424Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax $484 $257 $138 $64 $943Loans held for investment $96,904 $71,415 $66,202 $82 $234,603Deposits 0 176,340 34,281 10,438 221,059             Three Months Ended June 30, 2015(Dollars in millions) CreditCard ConsumerBanking CommercialBanking(1) Other(1) ConsolidatedTotalNet interest income (expense) $2,633 $1,444 $466 $(6) $4,537Non-interest income 845 196 123 (29) 1,135Total net revenue (loss) 3,478 1,640 589 (35) 5,672Provision (benefit) for credit losses 895 185 49 0 1,129Non-interest expense 1,857 998 270 182 3,307Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 726 457 270 (217) 1,236Income tax provision (benefit) 263 166 98 (143) 384Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax $463 $291 $172 $(74) $852Loans held for investment $87,203 $71,176 $51,231 $95 $209,705Deposits 0 170,321 32,909 5,550 208,780  132Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents   Six Months Ended June 30, 2016(Dollars in millions) CreditCard ConsumerBanking CommercialBanking(1) Other(1) ConsolidatedTotalNet interest income (expense) $6,078 $2,859 $1,096 $116 $10,149Non-interest income 1,706 366 247 6 2,325Total net revenue (loss) 7,784 3,225 1,343 122 12,474Provision (benefit) for credit losses 2,332 434 356 (3) 3,119Non-interest expense 3,746 1,996 665 111 6,518Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 1,706 795 322 14 2,837Income tax provision (benefit) 613 289 117 (143) 876Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax $1,093 $506 $205 $157 $1,961Loans held for investment $96,904 $71,415 $66,202 $82 $234,603Deposits 0 176,340 34,281 10,438 221,059             Six Months Ended June 30, 2015(Dollars in millions) CreditCard ConsumerBanking CommercialBanking(1) Other(1) ConsolidatedTotalNet interest income (expense) $5,299 $2,878 $927 $9 $9,113Non-interest income 1,661 354 237 (46) 2,206Total net revenue (loss) 6,960 3,232 1,164 (37) 11,319Provision (benefit) for credit losses 1,564 391 109 0 2,064Non-interest expense 3,633 1,968 542 213 6,356Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 1,763 873 513 (250) 2,899Income tax provision (benefit) 632 316 186 (221) 913Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax $1,131 $557 $327 $(29) $1,986Loans held for investment $87,203 $71,176 $51,231 $95 $209,705Deposits 0 170,321 32,909 5,550 208,780__________(1) Some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits. Accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory tax rate of 35% with offsetting reclassifications to the Other category.  133Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents NOTE 14—COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES, GUARANTEES AND OTHERSLetters of Credit, Loss Sharing Agreements and Other ObligationsWe issue letters of credit (financial standby, performance standby and commercial) to meet the financing needs of our customers. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party in a borrowing arrangement. Commercial letters of credit are short-term commitments issued primarily to facilitate trade finance activities for customers and are generally collateralized by the goods being shipped to the client. These collateral requirements are similar to those for funded transactions and are established based on management’s credit assessment of the customer. Management conducts regular reviews of all outstanding letters of credit and the results of these reviews are considered in assessing the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses.We had standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit with contractual amounts of $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The carrying value of outstanding letters of credit, which we include in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets was $4 million and $3 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These financial guarantees had expiration dates ranging from 2016 to 2025 as of June 30, 2016. Within our Commercial Banking business, we originate multifamily commercial real estate loans with the intent to sell them to a government-sponsored enterprise (“GSE”). We enter into loss sharing agreements with the GSE upon the sale of the loans. At inception, we record a liability representing the fair value of our obligation which is subsequently amortized as we are released from risk of payment under the loss sharing agreement. If payment under the loss sharing agreement becomes probable and estimable, an additional liability may be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and a non-interest expense may be recognized in the consolidated statements of income. The amount of liability recognized on our consolidated balance sheets for our loss sharing agreements was $43 million and $40 million as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. In certain securitizations in connection with the discontinued manufactured housing operations of GreenPoint Credit, LLC, the third party servicer has an obligation to exercise mandatory clean-up calls. In the event the third party servicer does not fulfill its obligation to exercise these clean-up calls, the obligation reverts to us. The amount of loan receivables and other assets subject to these clean-up calls is approximately $420 million. Based on our current projections, we expect these securitizations to reach their individual clean-up call thresholds beginning in 2017 and continuing through 2019. According to current information and estimates, we also expect the fair value of the loan receivables and other assets to be less than the contractual amount required to exercise the clean-up calls. We monitor the underlying assets for trends in delinquencies and related losses and review the third party servicer’s financial strength. As of June 30, 2016, our best estimate is that any reasonably possible future losses associated with these clean-up call obligations are not significant to the Company’s financial position.U.K. Cross SellIn the U.K., we previously sold payment protection insurance (“PPI”) and other ancillary cross sell products. In response to an elevated level of customer complaints across the industry, heightened media coverage and pressure from consumer advocacy groups, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), formerly the Financial Services Authority, investigated and raised concerns about the way the industry has handled complaints related to the sale of these insurance policies. For the past several years, the U.K.’s Financial Ombudsman Service (“FOS”) has been adjudicating customer complaints relating to PPI, escalated to it by consumers who disagree with the rejection of their complaint by firms, leading to customer remediation payments by us and others within the industry. On October 2, 2015, the FCA issued a Statement on PPI (“FCA Proposal”) announcing it has decided to consult on the introduction of a time bar for PPI complaints and on new rules and guidance about how banks should handle unfair relationship PPI complaints covered by s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act of 1974 (“Consumer Credit Act”). The industry consultation period ended in February 2016, and we await the final rules to be issued by the FCA. In determining our best estimate of incurred losses for future remediation payments, management considers numerous factors, including (i) the number of customer complaints we expect in the future; (ii) our expectation of upholding those complaints; (iii) the expected number of complaints customers escalate to the FOS; (iv) our expectation of the FOS upholding such escalated complaints; (v) the number of complaints that fall under the s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act; and (vi) the estimated remediation payout to customers. We monitor these factors each quarter and adjust our reserves to reflect the latest data.  134Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents Management’s best estimate of incurred losses related to U.K. cross sell products, including PPI, totaled $176 million as of both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. In the second quarter of 2016, we added $54 million to our reserve primarily because of an increase in our claims rate assumption. Other movements to the reserve were a combination of utilization of the reserve through customer refund payments and foreign exchange movements. Our best estimate of reasonably possible future losses beyond our reserve as of June 30, 2016 is approximately $250 million. Mortgage Representation and Warranty LiabilitiesWe acquired three subsidiaries that originated residential mortgage loans and sold these loans to various purchasers, including purchasers who created securitization trusts. These subsidiaries are Capital One Home Loans, LLC, which was acquired in February 2005; GreenPoint, which was acquired in December 2006 as part of the North Fork acquisition; and CCB, which was acquired in February 2009 and subsequently merged into CONA (collectively, the “subsidiaries”).In connection with their sales of mortgage loans, the subsidiaries entered into agreements containing varying representations and warranties about, among other things, the ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing the loan, the loan’s compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the purchaser, including underwriting guidelines and the existence of mortgage insurance, and the loan’s compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws. The representations and warranties do not address the credit performance of the mortgage loans, but mortgage loan performance often influences whether a claim for breach of representation and warranty will be asserted and has an effect on the amount of any loss in the event of a breach of a representation or warranty.Each of these subsidiaries may be required to repurchase mortgage loans in the event of certain breaches of these representations and warranties. In the event of a repurchase, the subsidiary is typically required to pay the unpaid principal balance of the loan together with interest and certain expenses (including, in certain cases, legal costs incurred by the purchaser and/or others). The subsidiary then recovers the loan or, if the loan has been foreclosed, the underlying collateral. The subsidiary is exposed to any losses on the repurchased loans, taking into account any recoveries on the collateral. In some instances, rather than repurchase the loans, a subsidiary may agree to make cash payments to make a purchaser whole on losses or to settle repurchase claims, possibly including claims for attorneys’ fees and interest. In addition, our subsidiaries may be required to indemnify certain purchasers and others against losses they incur as a result of certain breaches of representations and warranties.These subsidiaries, in total, originated and sold to non-affiliates approximately $111 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans between 2005 and 2008, which are the years (or “vintages”) with respect to which our subsidiaries have received the vast majority of the repurchase-related requests and other related claims.The following table presents the original principal balance of mortgage loan originations, by vintage for 2005 through 2008, for the three general categories of purchasers of mortgage loans and the estimated unpaid principal balance as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:Table 14.1: Unpaid Principal Balance of Mortgage Loans Originated and Sold to Third Parties Based on Category of Purchaser   Estimated Unpaid Principal Balance Original Principal Balance(Dollars in billions) June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015 Total 2008 2007 2006 2005GSEs $2 $2 $11 $1 $4 $3 $3Insured Securitizations 3 4 20 0 2 8 10Uninsured Securitizations and Other 13 14 80 3 15 30 32Total $18 $20 $111 $4 $21 $41 $45Of the $20 billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans sold directly by our subsidiaries to private-label purchasers who placed the loans into securitizations supported by bond insurance (“Insured Securitizations”), approximately 48% of the original principal balance was covered by bond insurance. Further, approximately $16 billion original principal balance was placed in securitizations as to which the monoline bond insurers have made repurchase-related requests or loan file requests to one of our subsidiaries (“Active Insured Securitizations”) and the remaining approximately $4 billion original principal balance was placed in securitizations as to which the monoline bond insurers have not made repurchase-related requests or loan file requests to one of our subsidiaries (“Inactive Insured Securitizations”). Insured Securitizations often allow the monoline bond insurer to act  135Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents independently of the investors. Bond insurers typically have indemnity agreements directly with both the mortgage originators and the securitizers, and they often have super-majority rights within the trust documentation that allow them to direct trustees to pursue mortgage repurchase-related requests without coordination with other investors.Because we do not service most of the loans our subsidiaries sold to others, we do not have complete information about the current ownership of a portion of the $80 billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans not sold directly to GSEs or placed in Insured Securitizations. We have determined based on information obtained from third-party databases that about $48 billion original principal balance of these mortgage loans was placed in private-label publicly issued securitizations not supported by bond insurance (“Uninsured Securitizations”). An additional approximately $22 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans were initially sold to private investors as whole loans. Various known and unknown investors purchased the remaining $10 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans.With respect to the $111 billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans originated and sold to others between 2005 and 2008, we estimate that approximately $18 billion in unpaid principal balance remains outstanding as of June 30, 2016, of which approximately $3 billion in unpaid principal balance is at least 90 days delinquent. Approximately $22 billion in losses have been realized by third parties. Because we do not service most of the loans we sold to others, we do not have complete information about the underlying credit performance levels for some of these mortgage loans. These amounts reflect our best estimates, including extrapolations of underlying credit performance where necessary. These estimates could change as we get additional data or refine our analysis.The subsidiaries had open repurchase-related requests with regard to approximately $1.4 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans as of June 30, 2016, flat from December 31, 2015. Currently, repurchase-related demands predominantly relate to the 2006 and 2007 vintages. We have received relatively few repurchase-related demands for vintages after 2007, mostly because GreenPoint ceased originating mortgages in August 2007.The following table presents information on pending repurchase-related requests by counterparty category and timing of initial request. The amounts presented are based on original loan principal balances.Table 14.2: Open Pipeline All Vintages (All Entities)(1)(Dollars in millions) GSEs InsuredSecuritizations UninsuredSecuritizationsand Other TotalOpen claims as of December 31, 2014 $16 $649 $1,847 $2,512Gross new demands received 23 0 23 46Loans repurchased/made whole (17) 0 (1) (18)Demands rescinded (21) (115) (1,054) (1,190)Open claims as of December 31, 2015 1 534 815 1,350Gross new demands received 9 0 12 21Loans repurchased/made whole (3) 0 0 (3)Demands rescinded (1) 0 (1) (2)Open claims as of June 30, 2016 $6 $534 $826 $1,366__________(1) The open pipeline includes all timely repurchase-related requests ever received by our subsidiaries where the requesting party has not formally rescinded the repurchase-related request or our subsidiary has not agreed to either repurchase the loan at issue or make the requesting party whole with respect to its losses. The demands rescinded in 2015 reflect the ruling from New York’s highest court in June 2015 that the statute of limitations for repurchase claims begins when the relevant representations and warranties were made, as opposed to some later date during the life of the loan. Finally, the amounts reflected in this chart are the original principal balance amounts of the mortgage loans at issue and do not correspond to the losses our subsidiary would incur upon the repurchase of these loans. 136Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents The following table summarizes changes in our representation and warranty reserve for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015:Table 14.3: Changes in Representation and Warranty Reserve(1)  Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 2016 2015Representation and warranty reserve, beginning of period $613 $673 $610 $731Provision (benefit) for mortgage representation and warranty losses:        Recorded in continuing operations (1) (9) (2) (8)Recorded in discontinued operations 2 (27) 5 (46)Total provision (benefit) for mortgage representation and warranty losses 1 (36) 3 (54)Net realized recoveries (losses) 0 (1) 1 (41)Representation and warranty reserve, end of period $614 $636 $614 $636__________(1) Reported on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities.The following table summarizes the allocation of our representation and warranty reserve as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:Table 14.4: Allocation of Representation and Warranty Reserve  Reserve Liability Loans Sold2005 to 2008(1) (Dollars in millions, except for loans sold) June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015 Selected period-end data:      Active Insured Securitizations and GSEs $483 $480 $27Inactive Insured Securitizations and Others 131 130 84Total(2) $614 $610 $111__________(1) Reflects, in billions, the total original principal balance of loans originated by our subsidiaries and sold to third-party investors between 2005 and 2008.(2) The total reserve liability includes an immaterial amount related to loans that were originated after 2008.We established reserves for the $11 billion original principal balance of GSE loans, based on open claims and historic repurchase rates. We have entered into and completed repurchase or settlement agreements with respect to the majority of our repurchase exposure within this category. Our reserves could also be impacted by any claims which may be brought by governmental agencies under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (“FIRREA”), the False Claims Act or other federal or state statutes. For example, GreenPoint and Capital One have received requests for information and/or subpoenas from various governmental regulators and law enforcement authorities, including members of the RMBS Working Group, relating to the origination of loans for sale to the GSEs and to RMBS participants. We are cooperating with these regulators and other authorities in responding to such requests.For the $16 billion original principal balance in Active Insured Securitizations, our reserving approach is based upon the expected resolution of litigation with the monoline bond insurers. Accordingly, our representation and warranty reserves for this category are litigation reserves. In establishing litigation reserves for this category, we consider the current and future monoline insurer losses inherent within the securitization and apply legal judgment to the developing factual and legal record to estimate the liability for each securitization. We consider as factors within the analysis our own past monoline settlements in addition to publicly available industry monoline settlements. Our reserves with respect to the U.S. Bank Litigation, referenced below, are contained within the Active Insured Securitization reserve category. Further, to the extent we have litigation reserves with respect to indemnification risks from certain representation and warranty lawsuits brought by monoline bond insurers against third-party securitizations sponsors, where one of our subsidiaries provided some or all of the mortgage collateral within the securitization but is not a defendant in the litigation, such reserves are also contained within this category. 137Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents For the $4 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans in the Inactive Insured Securitizations category and the $48 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans in the Uninsured Securitizations category, we establish reserves based on an assessment of probable and estimable legal liability, if any, utilizing both our own experience and publicly available industry settlement information to estimate lifetime liability. In contrast with the bond insurers in the Insured Securitizations, investors in Uninsured Securitizations often face a number of legal and logistical hurdles before they can force a securitization trustee to pursue mortgage repurchases, including the need to coordinate with a certain percentage of investors holding the securities and to indemnify the trustee for any litigation it undertakes. Accordingly, we only reserve for such exposures when a trustee or investor with standing brings claims and it is probable we have incurred a loss. Some Uninsured Securitization investors from this category are currently suing investment banks and securitization sponsors under federal and/or state securities laws. Although we face some indirect indemnity risks from these litigations, we generally have not established reserves with respect to these indemnity risks because we do not consider them to be both probable and reasonably estimable liabilities. In addition, to the extent we have litigation reserves with respect to indemnification risks from certain representation and warranty lawsuits brought by parties who purchased loans from our subsidiaries and subsequently re-sold the loans into securitizations, such reserves are also contained within this category.For the $22 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans sold to private investors as whole loans, we establish reserves based on open claims and historical repurchase rates.The aggregate reserve for all three subsidiaries totaled $614 million as of June 30, 2016, compared to $610 million as of December 31, 2015. We recorded a net provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses of $3 million (which includes a benefit of $2 million before taxes in continuing operations and a provision of $5 million before taxes in discontinued operations) in the first six months of 2016.As part of our business planning processes, we have considered various outcomes relating to the future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are possible but do not rise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying an incremental accrual under applicable accounting standards. Our current best estimate of reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond our reserves as of June 30, 2016 is approximately $1.5 billion, a decrease from our $1.6 billion estimate at December 31, 2015. The decrease in this estimate was primarily driven by favorable rulings in representation and warranty-related litigation. The estimate as of June 30, 2016 covers all reasonably possible losses relating to representation and warranty claim activity, including those relating to the cases more specifically described below in Mortgage Repurchase Litigation.In estimating reasonably possible future losses in excess of our current reserves, we assume a portion of the inactive securitizations become active and for all Insured Securitizations, we assume loss rates on the high end of those observed in monoline settlements or court rulings. For our remaining GSE exposures, Uninsured Securitizations and whole loan exposures, our reasonably possible risk estimates assume lifetime loss rates and claims rates at the highest levels of our past experience and also consider the limited instances of observed settlements. We do not assume claim rates or loss rates for these risk categories will be as high as those assumed for the Active Insured Securitizations, however, based on industry precedent. Should the number of claims or the loss rates on these claims increase significantly, our estimate of reasonably possible risk would increase materially. We also assume that repurchase-related requests will be resolved at discounts reflecting the nature of the claims, the vintage of the underlying loans and evolving legal precedents. Notwithstanding our ongoing attempts to estimate a reasonably possible amount of future losses beyond our current accrual levels based on current information, it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and our current estimate of the amount of reasonably possible losses. Our reserve and reasonably possible estimates involve considerable judgment and reflect that there is still significant uncertainty regarding numerous factors that may impact the ultimate loss levels, including, but not limited to: litigation outcomes; court rulings; governmental enforcement decisions; future repurchase and indemnification claim levels; securitization trustees pursuing mortgage repurchase litigation unilaterally or in coordination with investors; investors successfully pursuing repurchase litigation independently and without the involvement of the trustee as a party; ultimate repurchase and indemnification rates; future mortgage loan performance levels; actual recoveries on the collateral; and macroeconomic conditions (including unemployment levels and housing prices). In light of the significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability our subsidiaries may incur from these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period. 138Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents LitigationIn accordance with the current accounting standards for loss contingencies, we establish reserves for litigation related matters that arise from the ordinary course of our business activities when it is probable that a loss associated with a claim or proceeding has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. None of the amounts we currently have recorded individually or in the aggregate are considered to be material to our financial condition. Litigation claims and proceedings of all types are subject to many uncertain factors that generally cannot be predicted with assurance. Below we provide a description of potentially material legal proceedings and claims.For some of the matters disclosed below, we are able to determine estimates of potential future outcomes that are not probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying either the establishment of a reserve or an incremental reserve build, but which are reasonably possible outcomes. For other disclosed matters, such an estimate is not possible at this time. For those matters below where an estimate is possible (excluding the reasonably possible future losses relating to the U.S. Bank Litigation and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (“FHFA”) Litigation because reasonably possible losses with respect to those litigations are included within the reasonably possible representation and warranty liabilities discussed above) management currently estimates the reasonably possible future losses beyond our reserves as of June 30, 2016 is approximately $200 million. Notwithstanding our attempt to estimate a reasonably possible range of loss beyond our current accrual levels for some litigation matters based on current information, it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and the range of reasonably possible losses disclosed here. Given the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters, especially those involving governmental agencies, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from these litigation matters and an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period.Interchange LitigationIn 2005, a number of entities, each purporting to represent a class of retail merchants, filed antitrust lawsuits (“Interchange Lawsuits”) against MasterCard and Visa and several member banks, including our subsidiaries and us, alleging among other things, that the defendants conspired to fix the level of interchange fees. The complaints seek injunctive relief and civil monetary damages, which could be trebled. Separately, a number of large merchants have asserted similar claims against Visa and MasterCard only. In October 2005, the class and merchant Interchange Lawsuits were consolidated before the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for certain purposes, including discovery. In July 2012, the parties executed and filed with the court a Memorandum of Understanding agreeing to resolve the litigation on certain terms set forth in a settlement agreement attached to the Memorandum. The class settlement provides for, among other things, (i) payments by defendants to the class and individual plaintiffs totaling approximately $6.6 billion; (ii) a distribution to the class merchants of an amount equal to 10 basis points of certain interchange transactions for a period of eight months; and (iii) modifications to certain Visa and MasterCard rules regarding point of sale practices. In December 2013, the district court granted final approval of the proposed class settlement, which was appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in January 2014 and argued before the court on September 28, 2015. On June 30, 2016, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the district court’s certification of the class, reversed approval of the proposed class settlement, and remanded the litigation to the district court for further proceedings, ruling that some of the merchants that were part of the proposed class settlement were not adequately represented. Because the Second Circuit ruling remands the litigation to the district court for further proceedings, the ultimate outcome in this matter is uncertain. Several merchant plaintiffs also opted out of the class settlement before it was overturned, some of which have sued MasterCard, Visa and various member banks, including Capital One. The opt-out cases are consolidated before the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for certain purposes, including discovery. Visa and MasterCard have settled a number of individual opt-out cases, requiring non-material payments from all banks, including Capital One. Separate settlement and judgment sharing agreements between Capital One, MasterCard and Visa allocate the liabilities of any judgment or settlement arising from the Interchange Lawsuits and associated opt-out cases. Visa created a litigation escrow account following its IPO of stock in 2008, which funds any settlements for its member banks, and any settlements related to MasterCard allocated losses are reflected in Capital One’s reserves. 139Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents Mortgage Repurchase LitigationIn February 2009, GreenPoint was named as a defendant in a lawsuit commenced in the New York County Supreme Court, by U.S. Bank, N. A., Syncora Guarantee Inc. and CIFG Assurance North America, Inc. (“U.S. Bank Litigation”). Plaintiffs allege, among other things, that GreenPoint breached certain representations and warranties in two contracts pursuant to which GreenPoint sold approximately 30,000 mortgage loans having an aggregate original principal balance of approximately $1.8 billion to a purchaser that ultimately transferred most of these mortgage loans to a securitization trust. Some of the securities issued by the trust were insured by Syncora and CIFG. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and an order compelling GreenPoint to repurchase the entire portfolio of 30,000 mortgage loans based on alleged breaches of representations and warranties relating to a limited sampling of loans in the portfolio, or, alternatively, the repurchase of specific mortgage loans to which the alleged breaches of representations and warranties relate. In March 2010, the court granted GreenPoint’s motion to dismiss with respect to plaintiffs Syncora and CIFG but denied the motion with respect to U.S. Bank. GreenPoint subsequently answered the complaint with respect to U.S. Bank, denying the allegations, and filed a counterclaim against U.S. Bank alleging breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In February 2012, the court denied plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file an amended complaint and dismissed Syncora and CIFG from the case. Syncora and CIFG appealed their dismissal to the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department (“First Department”), which affirmed the dismissal in April 2013. The New York Court of Appeals denied Syncora’s and CIFG’s motion for leave to appeal the First Department’s decision in February 2014. Therefore, the case is now proceeding with U.S. Bank as the sole plaintiff. On May 20, 2015, Lehman Brothers Holding, Inc. (“LBHI”) filed an adversary proceeding in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York against U.S. Bank, Syncora and GreenPoint regarding bankruptcy proofs of claims filed by U.S. Bank and Syncora on the same securitization at issue in the U.S. Bank Litigation.In May, June and July 2012, FHFA (acting as conservator for Freddie Mac) filed three summonses with notice in the New York state court against GreenPoint, on behalf of the trustees for three RMBS trusts backed by loans originated by GreenPoint with an aggregate original principal balance of $3.4 billion. In January 2013, the plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint in the name of the three trusts, acting by the respective trustees, alleging breaches of contractual representations and warranties regarding compliance with GreenPoint underwriting guidelines relating to certain loans (“FHFA Litigation”). Plaintiffs seek specific performance of the repurchase obligations with respect to the loans for which they have provided notice of alleged breaches as well as all other allegedly breaching loans, rescissory damages, indemnification, costs and interest.As noted above in the section entitled Mortgage Representation and Warranty Liabilities, the Company’s subsidiaries establish reserves with respect to representation and warranty litigation matters, where appropriate, within the Company’s overall representation and warranty reserves. Please see above for more details.Anti-Money Laundering Capital One has received subpoenas and requests for testimony from the New York District Attorney’s Office (“NYDA”) with respect to certain former check casher clients of the Commercial Banking business and Capital One’s anti-money laundering (“AML”) program. In early 2015, we received similar requests from the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) of the U.S. Department of Treasury. Capital One is cooperating with all agencies involved in the investigation. 140Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents Intellectual Ventures Corp., et al.In June 2013, Intellectual Ventures I, LLC and Intellectual Ventures II, LLC (collectively “IV”) sued Capital One Financial Corp., Capital One Bank (USA), N.A. and Capital One, N.A. (collectively “Capital One”) for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. In the Complaint, IV alleged infringement of patents related to various business processes across the Capital One enterprise. IV simultaneously filed patent infringement actions against numerous other financial institutions on the same and other patents in several other federal courts. Capital One filed an answer and counterclaim alleging antitrust violations. In December 2013, the court dismissed Capital One’s counterclaim and decided the parties’ arguments on claim construction. IV agreed to dismiss two patents in suit, and following claim construction, asked for a stipulation of non-infringement for one patent with an opportunity to appeal the court’s decision regarding claim construction. In April 2014, the court granted Capital One’s motion for summary judgment and found that the two remaining patents were either unpatentable or indefinite. In May 2014, IV appealed to the Federal Circuit, which affirmed the district court’s dismissal of all three remaining patents in July 2015. In January 2014, IV filed a second suit against Capital One for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. In the complaint, IV again alleges infringement of patents related to various business practices across the Capital One enterprise. In March 2015, the court granted Capital One’s motion for leave to add a counterclaim for antitrust violations. IV voluntarily dismissed one of the patents against Capital One and in September 2015, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Capital One on the remaining four patents and dismissed IV’s claims. IV has appealed the dismissal of three of its claims to the Federal Circuit.Other Pending and Threatened LitigationIn addition, we are commonly subject to various pending and threatened legal actions relating to the conduct of our normal business activities. In the opinion of management, the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of all such other pending or threatened legal actions will not be material to our consolidated financial position or our results of operations. 141Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskFor a discussion of the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see “MD&A—Risk Management—Market Risk Management” and “MD&A—Market Risk Profile.”Item 4. Controls and Procedures OverviewWe are required under applicable laws and regulations to maintain controls and procedures, which include disclosure controls and procedures as well as internal control over financial reporting, as further described below.(a) Disclosure Controls and ProceduresDisclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our financial reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding our required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we must apply judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures.Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresAs required by Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of June 30, 2016, the end of the period covered by this Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2016, at a reasonable level of assurance, in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting information required to be disclosed within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms.(b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingWe regularly review our disclosure controls and procedures and make changes intended to ensure the quality of our financial reporting. There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred in the second quarter of 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 142Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsPART II—OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1.
