Unless otherwise specified, references to notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2016 included in this Report. Management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial condition. The following MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes in this Report and the more detailed information contained in our 2015 Form 10-K.INTRODUCTIONWe are a diversified financial services holding company with banking and non-banking subsidiaries. Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through branches, the internet and other distribution channels. As of March 31, 2016, our principal subsidiaries included:•Capital One Bank (USA), National Association (“COBNA”), which offers credit and debit card products, other lending products and deposit products; and•Capital One, National Association (“CONA”), which offers a broad spectrum of banking products and financial services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients.The Company is hereafter collectively referred to as “we,” “us” or “our.” COBNA and CONA are collectively referred to as the “Banks.” Certain business terms used in this document are defined in the “MD&A—Glossary and Acronyms” and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.Our consolidated total net revenues are derived primarily from lending to consumer and commercial customers net of funding costs associated with interest on deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. We also earn non-interest income which primarily consists of interchange income net of rewards expenses and service charges and other customer-related fees. Our expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating expenses (including salaries and associate benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, professional services, communication and data processing expenses and other miscellaneous expenses), marketing expenses and income taxes.Our principal operations are currently organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group, are included in the Other category.•Credit Card: Consists of our domestic consumer and small business card lending, national closed-end installment lending and the international card lending businesses in Canada and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”).•Consumer Banking: Consists of our branch-based lending and deposit gathering activities for consumers and small businesses and national deposit gathering, auto lending and consumer home loan lending and servicing activities. 1Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents•Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending, deposit gathering and servicing activities provided to commercial real estate and commercial and industrial customers. Our commercial and industrial customers typically include companies with annual revenues between $10 million and $1 billion.Recent Acquisitions and DispositionsWe regularly explore and evaluate opportunities to acquire financial services and financial assets, including credit card and other loan portfolios, and enter into strategic partnerships as part of our growth strategy. We also explore opportunities to acquire digital companies and related assets to improve our information technology infrastructure and to deliver on our digital strategy. We also regularly consider the potential disposition of certain of our assets, branches, partnership agreements or lines of businesses. We may issue equity or debt in connection with acquisitions, including public offerings, to fund such acquisitions. On December 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the Healthcare Financial Services business of General Electric Capital Corporation (“HFS acquisition”). As part of this acquisition, we recorded approximately $9.2 billion in assets, including $8.3 billion of loans. See “Note 2—Business Developments” in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional information.We had no significant acquisitions or dispositions in the first quarter of 2016.  2Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsSUMMARY OF SELECTED FINANCIAL DATAThe following table presents selected consolidated financial data from our results of operations for the first quarters of 2016 and 2015 and selected comparative balance sheet data as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

In comparison, we reported net income of $1.2 billion ($2.00 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $5.6 billion for the first quarter of 2015. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, as calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach, including transition provisions, was 11.1% as of both March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. See “MD&A—Capital Management” below for additional information.On March 11, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.125 billion of shares of our common stock (“2015 Stock Repurchase Program”). On February 17, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $300 million of shares of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2016 under the 2015 Stock Repurchase Program. Through the end of the first quarter of 2016, we repurchased approximately $2.8 billion of shares of common stock as part of this program, including completion of the previously announced incremental $300 million in share repurchases, and expect to complete the 2015 Stock Repurchase Program by the end of the second quarter of 2016. See “MD&A—Capital Management” below for additional information.Below are additional highlights of our performance in the first quarter of 2016. These highlights are generally based on a comparison between the results of the first quarters of 2016 and 2015, except as otherwise noted. The changes in our financial condition and credit performance are generally based on our financial condition and credit performance as of March 31, 2016, compared to our financial condition and credit performance as of December 31, 2015. We provide a more detailed discussion of our financial performance in the sections following this “Executive Summary and Business Outlook.”Total Company Performance•Earnings: Our net income decreased by $140 million to $1.0 billion in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015. The decrease in net income from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2016 was driven by (i) an increase in the provision for credit losses in our domestic credit card loan portfolio due to higher charge-offs and an allowance build in the first quarter of 2016 compared to a release in the first quarter of 2015, and in our commercial loan portfolio due to a larger build in both the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments as a result of continued adverse industry conditions impacting our oil and gas portfolio; and (ii) an increase in non-interest expense driven by higher operating and marketing expenses associated with loan growth and continued technology and infrastructure investments. These expenses were partially offset by (i) higher interest income due to growth in our credit card and commercial loan portfolios, partially offset by the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio; and (ii) an increase in non-interest income primarily attributable to higher net interchange fees, partially offset by lower service charges and other customer-related fees primarily due to the continued run-off of our legacy payment protection products in our Domestic Card business, which we exited during the first quarter of 2016. •Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment decreased by $2.2 billion to $227.6 billion as of March 31, 2016 from December 31, 2015 driven by seasonal paydowns in our credit card loan portfolio and the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio, partially offset by growth in our auto and commercial loan portfolios. Average loans held for investment increased by $21.5 billion to $226.7 billion in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015 primarily driven by continued growth in our credit card, auto and commercial loan portfolios, including loans acquired from the HFS acquisition, partially offset by the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio. 5Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents•Net Charge-off and Delinquency Statistics: Our net charge-off rate increased by 36 basis points to 2.08% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015 primarily due to seasoning of recent credit card loan originations and rising losses in our oil and gas and taxi medallion lending portfolios within our Commercial Banking business. Our 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 36 basis points to 2.64% as of March 31, 2016, from December 31, 2015, primarily due to seasonally lower delinquency inventories, partially offset by seasoning of recent credit card loan originations and adverse market conditions impacting our oil and gas and taxi medallion lending portfolios. We provide additional information on our credit quality metrics below under “Business Segment Financial Performance” and “Credit Risk Profile.”•Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses: Our allowance for loan and lease losses increased by $286 million to $5.4 billion as of March 31, 2016 from December 31, 2015. The increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses was primarily driven by continued adverse industry conditions impacting our oil and gas portfolio in our Commercial Banking business as well as continued domestic credit card loan growth and portfolio seasoning. These factors also contributed to a higher allowance coverage ratio, which increased by 15 basis points to 2.38% as of March 31, 2016 from December 31, 2015.Business Segment Financial PerformanceTable 2 summarizes our business segment results, which we report based on revenue and income from continuing operations, net of tax, for the first quarters of 2016 and 2015. We provide information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in “Note 20—Business Segments” in our 2015 Form 10-K. We also provide a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our consolidated generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) results in “Note 13—Business Segments” of this Report.

Accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory tax rate of 35% with offsetting reclassifications to the Other category. (4) Includes the residual impact of the allocation of our centralized Corporate Treasury group activities, unallocated corporate expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments and other items as described in “Note 20—Business Segments” in our 2015 Form 10-K.Credit Card: Our Credit Card business generated net income from continuing operations of $609 million in the first quarter of 2016, compared to net income from continuing operations of $668 million in the first quarter of 2015. The decrease in net income in the first quarter of 2016 was primarily attributable to (i) higher provision for credit losses driven by higher charge-offs and an allowance build, both due to continued loan growth and portfolio seasoning, compared to a release in the first quarter of 2015; and (ii) higher non-interest expense due to higher operating and marketing expenses associated with loan growth. These drivers were partially offset by (i) higher net interest income primarily driven by loan growth; and (ii) higher non-interest income attributable to an increase in net interchange fees, partially offset by a decline in service charges and other customer-related fees primarily due to the continued run-off of our legacy payment protection products in our Domestic Card business, which we exited during the first quarter of 2016. Period-end loans held for investment decreased by $3.4 billion to $92.7 billion as of March 31, 2016 from December 31, 2015, primarily due to expected seasonal paydowns.Consumer Banking: Our Consumer Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $249 million in the first quarter of 2016, compared to net income from continuing operations of $266 million in the first quarter of 2015. The decrease in  6Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contentsnet income in the first quarter of 2016 was primarily attributable to (i) higher provision for credit losses primarily driven by higher charge-offs on auto loans; and (ii) higher non-interest expense largely driven by increased marketing expenses in our retail banking business and higher operating expenses driven by growth in our auto loan portfolio. Period-end loans held for investment were substantially flat, increasing by $219 million, or 0.3%, to $70.6 billion as of March 31, 2016 from December 31, 2015.Commercial Banking: Our Commercial Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $67 million in the first quarter of 2016, compared to net income from continuing operations of $155 million in the first quarter of 2015. The decrease in net income in the first quarter of 2016 was primarily attributable to (i) higher provision for credit losses due to a larger build in both the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments as a result of continued adverse industry conditions impacting our oil and gas portfolio; and (ii) higher non-interest expense largely driven by higher operating expenses due to costs associated with the HFS acquisition and continued growth in our Commercial Banking business. These expenses were partially offset by higher net interest income primarily driven by loan growth, including loans acquired in the HFS acquisition, partially offset by spread compression. Period-end loans held for investment increased by $975 million to $64.2 billion as of March 31, 2016 from December 31, 2015, driven by growth across our commercial loan portfolios.Business Outlook We discuss below our current expectations regarding our total company performance and the performance of each of our business segments over the near-term based on market conditions, the regulatory environment and our business strategies as of the time we filed this Report. The statements contained in this section are based on our current expectations regarding our outlook for our financial results and business strategies. Our expectations take into account, and should be read in conjunction with, our expectations regarding economic trends and analysis of our business as discussed in “Part I—Item 1. Business” and “Part I—Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2015 Form 10-K. Certain statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise disclosed, forward-looking statements do not reflect: (i) any change in current dividend or repurchase strategies; (ii) the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures or similar transactions that have not been previously disclosed; or (iii) any changes in laws, regulations or regulatory interpretations, in each case after the date as of which such statements are made. See “Forward-Looking Statements” in this Report for more information on the forward-looking statements included in this Report and “Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2015 Form 10-K for factors that could materially influence our results. Total Company ExpectationsWe delivered revenue growth and attractive risk-adjusted returns in the first quarter of 2016, highlighted by strong growth in our Domestic Card business. We believe we are positioned to deliver attractive shareholder returns over the long term, driven by growth and sustainable returns at the higher end of banks, as well as significant capital distribution, subject to regulatory approval.Changing customer needs and preferences in our retail deposit businesses are driving changes to the function, format and number of our branches. Like all banks, we have been optimizing the format and number of our branches to better meet our evolving customer needs and expect to accelerate these efforts in 2016. While we are still formulating specific plans and timing, we expect to recognize bank optimization charges of approximately $160 million in the “Other” category during 2016.In addition to these expected bank optimization costs, we also expect the net impact of FDIC surcharges and premium changes to add about $20 million to quarterly operating expenses beginning in the third quarter of 2016. Including the higher expenses associated with these two items, we still expect some improvement in our full-year 2016 efficiency ratio relative to our full-year 2015 efficiency ratio, with continuing improvement in 2017, excluding adjusting items.We believe our actions have created a well-positioned balance sheet with strong capital and liquidity. Pursuant to our approved 2015 capital plan, we increased our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.30 per share to $0.40 per share starting in the second quarter of 2015. We also expect to repurchase up to $3.125 billion of shares of our common stock pursuant to the 2015 Stock Repurchase Program through the second quarter of 2016. As we continued to repurchase shares pursuant to this program, we reduced our net share count by 12.8 million shares in the first quarter of 2016 and completed the previously announced incremental $300 million in repurchases. We are on track to complete our remaining CCAR authorization by the end of the second quarter of 2016. The timing and exact amount of any common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including market conditions, opportunities for growth, and our capital position and amount of retained earnings. The 2015 Stock Repurchase Program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including  7Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contentsutilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time. See “MD&A—Capital Management—Dividend Policy and Stock Purchases” for more information.Business Segment ExpectationsCredit Card: In our Domestic Card business, we expect the full-year 2016 charge-off rate to be around four percent, with quarterly seasonal variability. Based on current information and assuming relative stability in consumer behavior, the domestic economy and competitive conditions, we expect full-year 2017 charge-off rate in the low four percent range, with quarterly seasonal variability. Loan growth coupled with our expectations for a rising charge-off rate drove an allowance build in the current quarter, and we expect these same factors to drive allowance additions going forward.Consumer Banking: In our Consumer Banking business, persistently low interest rates continue to pressure returns in our deposit businesses. We expect the planned run-off in our acquired home loan portfolio, as well as revenue margin compression and gradually rising charge-offs in our auto business, to have a negative effect on Consumer Banking revenues, efficiency ratio and net income in 2016, even as we continue to tightly manage costs. Commercial Banking: While competition continues to put pressure on loan terms and pricing in our Commercial Banking business, we continue to see good growth opportunities in select specialty industry verticals. Credit pressures continue to be focused in our oil and gas and taxi medallion lending portfolios and we expect that our oil and gas portfolio will continue to present challenges. While our current reserves fully reflect all the information we have today, future developments and continued turmoil in the energy industry could lead to further reserve builds and possibly increasing charge-offs.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses on the consolidated financial statements. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We provide a summary of our significant accounting policies under “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2015 Form 10-K.We have identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. These critical accounting policies govern:•Loan loss reserves•Asset impairment•Fair value of financial instruments•Representation and warranty reserves•Customer rewards reservesWe evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them, as necessary, based on changing conditions. Management has discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since the 2015 Form 10-K.We provide additional information on our critical accounting policies and estimates under “MD&A—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our 2015 Form 10-K.ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTSSee “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for information on accounting standards adopted in 2016, as well as recently issued accounting standards not yet required to be adopted and the expected impact of these changes in accounting standards. 8Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe section below provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated financial performance for the first quarters of 2016 and 2015. Following this section, we provide a discussion of our business segment results. You should read this section together with our “Executive Summary and Business Outlook,” where we discuss trends and other factors that we expect will affect our future results of operations.Net Interest IncomeNet interest income represents the difference between the interest income, including certain fees, earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense on our interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, and other borrowings. Generally, we include in interest income any past due fees on loans that we deem collectible. Our net interest margin, based on our consolidated results, represents the difference between the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, including the notional impact of non-interest bearing funding. We expect net interest income and our net interest margin to fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 9Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 3 below presents, for each major category of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the average outstanding balances, interest income earned, interest expense incurred, average yield and rate for the first quarters of 2016 and 2015.Table 3: Average Balances, Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin  Three Months Ended March 31,  2016 2015(Dollars in millions) AverageBalance InterestIncome/Expense(1)(2) Average Yield/Rate AverageBalance InterestIncome/Expense(1)(2) Average Yield/RateAssets:            Interest-earning assets:            Loans:            Credit card:            Domestic credit card $85,319 $3,071 14.40% $74,875 $2,660 14.21%International credit card 7,839 323 16.48 7,811 291 14.90Total credit card 93,158 3,394 14.57 82,686 2,951 14.28Consumer banking 70,441 1,088 6.18 71,595 1,120 6.26Commercial banking(3) 63,884 539 3.37 51,461 415 3.23Other 90 64 284.44 112 54 192.86Total loans, including loans held for sale 227,573 5,085 8.94 205,854 4,540 8.82Investment securities 65,156 415 2.55 63,181 406 2.57Cash equivalents and other interest-earning assets 6,727 17 1.01 9,392 28 1.19Total interest-earning assets $299,456 $5,517 7.37 $278,427 $4,974 7.15Cash and due from banks 3,355     3,099    Allowance for loan and lease losses (5,131)     (4,371)    Premises and equipment, net 3,642     3,701    Other assets 30,597     28,545    Total assets $331,919     $309,401    Liabilities and stockholders’ equity:            Interest-bearing liabilities:            Deposits $194,125 $283 0.58 $182,998 $271 0.59Securitized debt obligations 15,361 48 1.25 11,563 33 1.14Senior and subordinated notes 21,993 106 1.93 20,595 79 1.53Other borrowings and liabilities 17,176 24 0.56 14,721 15 0.41Total interest-bearing liabilities $248,655 $461 0.74 $229,877 $398 0.69Non-interest-bearing deposits 25,055     24,853    Other liabilities 9,131     8,274    Total liabilities 282,841     263,004    Stockholders’ equity 49,078     46,397    Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $331,919     $309,401    Net interest income/spread   $5,056 6.63   $4,576 6.46Impact of non-interest-bearing funding     0.12     0.11Net interest margin     6.75%     6.57%__________(1)  Past due fees included in interest income totaled approximately $351 million and $354 million in the first quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively.(2) Interest income and interest expense and the calculation of average yields on interest-earning assets and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities include the impact of hedge accounting.(3) Some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits. Accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory rate of 35% with offsetting reclassifications to the Other category.Net interest income increased by $480 million to $5.1 billion in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015 primarily driven by growth in our credit card and commercial loan portfolios and an additional day in the first quarter of 2016.  10Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsNet interest margin increased by 18 basis points to 6.75% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, primarily driven by continued growth in our domestic credit card loan portfolio, the planned run-off of the acquired home loan portfolio in our Consumer Banking business and an additional day in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by declining yields in our auto portfolio.             Table 4 displays the change in our net interest income between periods and the extent to which the variance is attributable to (i) changes in the volume of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; or (ii) changes in the interest rates related to these assets and liabilities.Table 4: Rate/Volume Analysis of Net Interest Income(1)   Three Months Ended March 31,  2016 vs. 2015(Dollars in millions) Total Variance Volume RateInterest income:Loans:      Credit card $443 $380 $63Consumer banking (32) (18) (14)Commercial banking(2) 124 104 20Other 10 (11) 21Total loans, including loans held for sale 545 455 90Investment securities 9 13 (4)Cash equivalents and other interest-earning assets (11) (7) (4)Total interest income 543 461 82Interest expense:      Deposits 12 16 (4)Securitized debt obligations 15 11 4Senior and subordinated notes 27 6 21Other borrowings and liabilities 9 3 6Total interest expense 63 36 27Net interest income $480 $425 $55 __________ (1) We calculate the change in interest income and interest expense separately for each item. The portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate is allocated proportionately when the calculation results in a positive value. When the portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate results in a negative value, the total amount is allocated to volume or rate, depending on which amount is positive.(2) Some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits. Accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory rate of 35% with offsetting reclassifications to the Other category.Non-Interest IncomeNon-interest income primarily consists of interchange income net of rewards expense, service charges and other customer-related fees, and other non-interest income. Other non-interest income includes the pre-tax net benefit for mortgage representation and warranty losses related to continuing operations, gains and losses from the sale of investment securities, gains and losses on derivatives not accounted for in hedge accounting relationships and hedge ineffectiveness. 11Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 5 displays the components of non-interest income for the first quarters of 2016 and 2015.Table 5: Non-Interest Income  Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015Interchange fees, net $596 $496Service charges and other customer-related fees 404 437Net other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings (8) (15)Other non-interest income:    Benefit (provision) for mortgage representation and warranty losses(1) 1 (1)Net gains (losses) from the sale of investment securities — 2Net fair value gains (losses) on free-standing derivatives 30 10Other 141 142Total other non-interest income 172 153Total non-interest income $1,164 $1,071 __________(1) Represents the benefit (provision) for mortgage representation and warranty losses recorded in continuing operations. For the total impact to the net benefit for mortgage representation and warranty losses, including the portion recognized in our consolidated statements of income as a component of discontinued operations, see “MD&A—Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis—Table 14: Changes in Representation and Warranty Reserve.”Non-interest income increased by $93 million to $1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015 primarily driven by an increase in interchange fees due to higher purchase volume in our Credit Card business and a customer rewards liability release within the retail banking business related to the discontinuation of certain debit card and deposit products, partially offset by (i) increased rewards expense due to higher purchase volume and continued expansion of our rewards franchise; and (ii) lower service charges and other customer-related fees primarily due to the continued run-off of our legacy payment protection products in our Domestic Card business, which we exited during the first quarter of 2016.Provision for Credit LossesOur provision for credit losses in each period is driven by net charge-offs, changes to the allowance for loan and lease losses and changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $1.5 billion and $935 million in the first quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. The provision for credit losses as a percentage of net interest income was 30.2% and 20.4% in the first quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively.Our provision for credit losses increased by $592 million in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in our domestic credit card loan portfolio due to higher charge-offs and an allowance build in the first quarter of 2016 compared to a release in the first quarter of 2015, and in our commercial loan portfolio due to a larger build in both the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments as a result of continued adverse industry conditions impacting our oil and gas portfolio. We provide additional information on the provision for credit losses and changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses within “Credit Risk Profile—Summary of Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses,” “Note 4—Loans” and “Note 5—Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments.” For information on the allowance methodology for each of our loan categories, see “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2015 Form 10-K.Non-Interest ExpenseNon-interest expense consists of ongoing operating expenses, such as salaries and associate benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, professional services, communications and data processing expenses and other non-interest expenses, as well as marketing costs and amortization of intangibles. 12Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 6 displays the components of non-interest expense for the first quarters of 2016 and 2015.

The increase was primarily due to higher operating and marketing expenses associated with loan growth and continued technology and infrastructure investments.Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of TaxIncome (loss) from discontinued operations reflects ongoing costs, which primarily consist of mortgage loan repurchase representation and warranty charges, related to the mortgage origination operations of our former wholesale mortgage banking unit, GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, Inc. (“GreenPoint”), which was closed in 2007. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $5 million in the first quarter of 2016, compared to income from discontinued operations of $19 million in the first quarter of 2015. We recorded a provision net of tax for mortgage representation and warranty reserve of $2 million ($3 million before tax) in the first quarter of 2016, compared to a $12 million benefit net of tax ($19 million before tax) in the first quarter of 2015.We provide additional information on the net provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses and the related reserve for representation and warranty claims in “Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis—Mortgage Representation and Warranty Reserve” and “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others.”Income TaxesWe recorded income tax provisions of $452 million (30.7% effective income tax rate) and $529 million (31.8% effective income tax rate) in the first quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations varies between periods due, in part, to fluctuations in our pre-tax earnings, which affects the relative tax benefit of tax-exempt income, tax credits and other permanent tax items.The decrease in our effective income tax rate in the first quarter of 2016, from the first quarter of 2015, was primarily due to reduced pre-tax earnings, increased tax credits and increased tax-exempt income.We provide additional information on items affecting our income taxes and effective tax rate under “Note 18—Income Taxes” in our 2015 Form 10-K. 13Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsBUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEOur principal operations are currently organized into three major business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group, are included in the Other category.The results of our individual businesses, which we report on a continuing operations basis, reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. We provide additional information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in “Note 20—Business Segments” in our 2015 Form 10-K.We refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our “managed” presentation, which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on U.S. GAAP. There is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to U.S. GAAP; therefore, the managed presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial services companies. In addition, our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Below we summarize our business segment results for the first quarters of 2016 and 2015 and provide a comparative discussion of these results. We also discuss changes in our financial condition and credit performance statistics as of March 31, 2016, compared to December 31, 2015. We provide a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated results in “Note 13—Business Segments.” Additionally, we provide information on the outlook for each of our business segments as described above under “Executive Summary and Business Outlook.”Credit Card BusinessThe primary sources of revenue for our Credit Card business are interest income, net interchange income and fees collected from customers. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs such as salaries and associate benefits, occupancy and equipment, professional services and communications and data processing expenses, as well as marketing expenses.Our Credit Card business generated net income from continuing operations of $609 million and $668 million in the first quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. 14Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 7 summarizes the financial results of our Credit Card business, which is comprised of Domestic Card and International Card, and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.Table 7: Credit Card Business Results  Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 ChangeSelected income statement data:      Net interest income $3,033 $2,666 14%Non-interest income 847 816 4Total net revenue(1) 3,880 3,482 11Provision (benefit) for credit losses 1,071 669 60Non-interest expense 1,863 1,776 5Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 946 1,037 (9)Income tax provision (benefit) 337 369 (9)Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax $609 $668 (9)Selected performance metrics:      Average loans held for investment(2) $92,987 $82,581 13Average yield on loans held for investment(3) 14.60% 14.30% 30bpsTotal net revenue margin(4) 16.69 16.87 (18)Net charge-offs $950 $719 32%Net charge-off rate 4.09% 3.48% 61bpsPurchased credit card relationship (“PCCR”) intangible amortization $70 $84 (17)%Purchase volume(5) 68,189 57,383 19       (Dollars in millions) March 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 ChangeSelected period-end data:      Loans held for investment(2) $92,699 $96,125 (4)%30+ day performing delinquency rate 3.11% 3.36% (25)bps30+ day delinquency rate 3.15 3.40 (25)Nonperforming loan rate 0.05 0.06 (1)Allowance for loan and lease losses $3,785 $3,654 4%Allowance coverage ratio(6) 4.08% 3.80% 28bps__________(1) We recognize billed finance charges and fee income on open-ended loans in accordance with the contractual provisions of the credit arrangements and estimate the uncollectible amount on a quarterly basis.

The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in interchange fees driven by higher purchase volume, partially offset by (i) increased rewards expense due to higher purchase volume and continued expansion of our rewards franchise; and (ii) lower service charges and other customer-related fees primarily due to the continued run-off of our legacy payment protection products in our Domestic Card business, which we exited during the first quarter of 2016.•Provision for Credit Losses: The provision for credit losses increased by $402 million to $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2016, primarily driven by higher charge-offs and an allowance build, both due to continued loan growth and portfolio seasoning, compared to a release in the first quarter of 2015.•Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $87 million to $1.9 billion in the first quarter of 2016. The increase was due to higher operating and marketing expenses associated with loan growth.•Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment decreased by $3.4 billion to $92.7 billion as of March 31, 2016 from December 31, 2015, primarily due to expected seasonal paydowns. Average loans held for investment increased by $10.4 billion to $93.0 billion in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to loan growth across our domestic and international card loan portfolios, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates in our international card loan portfolio driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the first quarter of 2016.•Net Charge-off and Delinquency Statistics: The net charge-off rate increased by 61 basis points to 4.09% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, due to the seasoning of our domestic card portfolio growth. The 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 25 basis points to 3.15% as of March 31, 2016 from December 31, 2015 due to seasonally lower delinquency inventories.Domestic Card BusinessDomestic Card generated net income from continuing operations of $564 million and $621 million in the first quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Domestic Card accounted for 91% of total net revenues and 93% of net income of our Credit Card business in both the first quarters of 2016 and 2015. 16Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 7.1 summarizes the financial results for Domestic Card and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.Table 7.1: Domestic Card Business Results  Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 ChangeSelected income statement data:      Net interest income $2,756 $2,421 14%Non-interest income 774 743 4Total net revenue(1) 3,530 3,164 12Provision (benefit) for credit losses 972 610 59Non-interest expense 1,671 1,580 6Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 887 974 (9)Income tax provision (benefit) 323 353 (8)Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax $564 $621 (9)Selected performance metrics:      Average loans held for investment(2) $85,148 $74,770 14Average yield on loans held for investment(3) 14.43% 14.23% 20bpsTotal net revenue margin(4) 16.58 16.93 (35)Net charge-offs $887 $664 34%Net charge-off rate 4.16% 3.55% 61bpsPCCR intangible amortization $70 $84 (17)%Purchase volume(5) 62,617 52,025 20       (Dollars in millions) March 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 ChangeSelected period-end data:      Loans held for investment(2) $84,561 $87,939 (4)%30+ day delinquency rate 3.09% 3.39% (30)bpsAllowance for loan and lease losses $3,440 $3,355 3%Allowance coverage ratio(6) 4.07% 3.82% 25bps__________(1) We recognize billed finance charges and fee income on open-ended loans in accordance with the contractual provisions of the credit arrangements and estimate the uncollectible amount on a quarterly basis.

Net income for our Domestic Card business decreased in the first quarter of 2016, compared to the first quarter of 2015 due to higher provision for credit losses, operating and marketing expenses associated with continued loan growth, partially offset by higher net interest income resulting from loan growth. 17Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsInternational Card BusinessInternational Card generated net income from continuing operations of $45 million and $47 million in the first quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in net income in the first quarter of 2016 was primarily due to (i) an increase in the provision for credit losses due to higher loss rates; and (ii) the impact of foreign exchange rates driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the first quarter of 2016. These expenses were largely offset by higher net interest income primarily driven by loan growth and higher loan yield due to changes in the product mix of the portfolio.Table 7.2 summarizes the financial results for International Card and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.Table 7.2: International Card Business Results   Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 ChangeSelected income statement data:      Net interest income $277 $245 13%Non-interest income 73 73 —Total net revenue 350 318 10Provision (benefit) for credit losses 99 59 68Non-interest expense 192 196 (2)Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 59 63 (6)Income tax provision (benefit) 14 16 (13)Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax $45 $47 (4)Selected performance metrics:     Average loans held for investment(1) $7,839 $7,811 —Average yield on loans held for investment(2) 16.47% 14.93% 154bpsTotal net revenue margin(3) 17.85 16.31 154Net charge-offs $63 $55 15%Net charge-off rate 3.24% 2.80% 44bpsPurchase volume(4) $5,572 $5,358 4%       (Dollars in millions) March 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 ChangeSelected period-end data:      Loans held for investment(1) $8,138 $8,186 (1)%30+ day performing delinquency rate 3.32% 2.98% 34bps30+ day delinquency rate 3.76 3.46 30Nonperforming loan rate 0.59 0.65 (6)Allowance for loan and lease losses $345 $299 15%Allowance coverage ratio(5) 4.24% 3.66% 58bps__________ (1) Period-end loans held for investment and average loans held for investment include accrued finance charges and fees, net of the estimated uncollectible amount.(2) Calculated by dividing annualized interest income for the period by average loans held for investment during the period.

Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs, such as salaries and associate benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, professional services and communications and data processing expenses, as well as marketing expenses.Our Consumer Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $249 million and $266 million in the first quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively.Table 8 summarizes the financial results of our Consumer Banking business and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.Table 8: Consumer Banking Business Results   Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 ChangeSelected income statement data:      Net interest income $1,420 $1,434 (1)%Non-interest income 191 158 21Total net revenue 1,611 1,592 1Provision (benefit) for credit losses 230 206 12Non-interest expense 990 970 2Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 391 416 (6)Income tax provision (benefit) 142 150 (5)Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax $249 $266 (6)Selected performance metrics:      Average loans held for investment:(1)      Auto $41,962 $38,387 9Home loan 24,781 29,493 (16)Retail banking 3,553 3,561 —Total consumer banking $70,296 $71,441 (2)Average yield on loans held for investment(2) 6.18% 6.26% (8)bpsAverage deposits $174,254 $169,593 3%Average deposit interest rate 0.54% 0.57% (3)bpsCore deposit intangible amortization $15 $22 (32)%Net charge-offs 183 159 15Net charge-off rate 1.04% 0.89% 15bpsNet charge-off rate (excluding PCI loans)(3) 1.40 1.30 10Auto loan originations $5,844 $5,185 13%        19Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents(Dollars in millions) March 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 ChangeSelected period-end data:      Loans held for investment:(1)      Auto $42,714 $41,549 3%Home loan 24,343 25,227 (4)Retail banking 3,534 3,596 (2)Total consumer banking $70,591 $70,372 —30+ day performing delinquency rate 3.19% 4.05% (86)bps30+ day performing delinquency rate (excluding PCI loans)(3) 4.25 5.50 (125)30+ day delinquency rate 3.67 4.67 (100)30+ day delinquency rate (excluding PCI loans)(3) 4.89 6.34 (145)Nonperforming loan rate 0.66 0.79 (13)Nonperforming loan rate (excluding PCI loans)(3) 0.89 1.08 (19)Nonperforming asset rate(4) 0.95 1.10 (15)Nonperforming asset rate (excluding PCI loans)(3)(4) 1.27 1.50 (23)Allowance for loan and lease losses $914 $868 5%Allowance coverage ratio(5)(6) 1.29% 1.23% 6bpsDeposits $177,803 $172,702 3%Loans serviced for others 7,703 7,530 2__________(1) The period-end consumer banking loans held for investment includes purchased credit-impaired loans (“PCI loans”) with carrying values of $17.6 billion and $18.6 billion as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The average balance of consumer banking loans held for investment includes PCI loans of $18.0 billion and $22.6 billion in the first quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. See “MD&A—Glossary and Acronyms” for the definition of “PCI loans.”(2) Calculated by dividing annualized interest income for the period by average loans held for investment during the period.

The nonperforming asset rate is calculated based on nonperforming assets as of the end of the period divided by the sum of period-end loans held for investment, foreclosed properties and other foreclosed assets, and is adjusted to exclude the impact of acquired REOs.(5) Calculated by dividing the allowance for loan and lease losses as of the end of the period by period-end loans held for investment.(6) Excluding the impact of PCI home loans, the coverage ratios for our home loan portfolio and total consumer banking were 0.45% and 1.66%, respectively, as of March 31, 2016, compared to 0.50% and 1.60%, respectively, as of December 31, 2015.Key factors affecting the results of our Consumer Banking business for the first quarter of 2016, compared to the first quarter of 2015, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 include the following:•Net Interest Income: Net interest income remained flat at $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, as lower net interest income from our home loan portfolio attributable to the planned run-off of the acquired portfolio and margin compression in auto loans was largely offset by growth in our auto loan portfolio.Consumer Banking loan yield decreased by 8 basis points to 6.2% in the first quarter of 2016, the decrease was primarily driven by declining yield in our auto loan portfolio, partially offset by changes in the product mix in Consumer Banking as a result of the planned run-off of the acquired home loan portfolio and growth in our auto loan portfolio. Average yield on auto loans decreased by 51 basis points to 7.7% in the first quarter of 2016. This decrease was primarily attributable to two factors: (i) a higher proportion of prime auto loans since the first quarter of 2015; and (ii) continued competition across the auto business. The average yield on the home loan portfolio decreased by 11 basis points to 3.7% in the first quarter of 2016, as a result of lower yield on our acquired home loan portfolio. 20Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents•Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income increased by $33 million to $191 million in the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to a customer rewards liability release within the retail banking business related to the discontinuation of certain debit card and deposit products.•Provision for Credit Losses: The provision for credit losses increased by $24 million to $230 million in the first quarter of 2016, primarily driven by higher charge-offs on auto loans.•Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $20 million to $990 million in the first quarter of 2016, largely due to increased marketing expenses in our retail banking business and higher operating expenses driven by growth in our auto loan portfolio.•Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment were substantially flat, increasing by $219 million, or 0.3%, to $70.6 billion as of March 31, 2016 from December 31, 2015. Average loans held for investment decreased by $1.1 billion to $70.3 billion in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015 primarily due to the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio, partially offset by growth in our auto loan portfolio.•Deposits: Period-end deposits increased by $5.1 billion to $177.8 billion as of March 31, 2016 from December 31, 2015, as a result of our continued focus on deposit relationships with existing customers and our ongoing success of marketing strategies to attract online direct banking customers.•Net Charge-off and Delinquency Statistics: The net charge-off rate increased by 15 basis points to 1.04% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015. The increase in the net charge-off rate reflects the greater proportion of auto loans in our total consumer banking loan portfolio, which have higher charge-off rates than other products within this portfolio, as well as a modest increase in the auto charge-off rate. The 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 100 basis points to 3.67% as of March 31, 2016 from December 31, 2015, primarily attributable to seasonally lower auto delinquency inventories.Commercial Banking BusinessThe primary sources of revenue for our Commercial Banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits and non-interest income from customer fees and other transactions. Because we have some investments that generate tax-exempt income or tax credits, we make certain reclassifications to our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues on a taxable-equivalent basis. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs, such as salaries and associate benefits, occupancy, equipment, professional services and communications and data processing expenses, as well as marketing expenses.Our Commercial Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $67 million and $155 million in the first quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively.

(2) The provision for losses on unfunded lending commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income and the related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our reserve for unfunded lending commitments totaled $218 million and $161 million as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.(3) The period-end commercial banking loans held for investment include PCI loans with carrying value of $933 million and $958 million as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The average balance of commercial banking loans held for investment includes PCI loans of $926 million and $171 million in the first quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The increase was primarily driven by a larger build in both the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments as a result of continued adverse industry conditions impacting our oil and gas portfolio. See “MD&A—Table 18—Commercial Loans by Industry” for additional information about the composition of our commercial banking loan portfolio, and “Note 4—Loans” for additional information about credit metrics for our commercial banking loan portfolio.•Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $50 million to $322 million in the first quarter of 2016, driven by higher operating expenses due to costs associated with the HFS acquisition and continued growth in our Commercial Banking business.•Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment increased by $975 million to $64.2 billion as of March 31, 2016 from December 31, 2015 driven by growth across our commercial loan portfolios. Average loans held for investment increased by $12.3 billion to $63.4 billion in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015 primarily driven by the HFS acquisition as well as growth across our commercial loan portfolios.•Deposits: Period-end deposits decreased by $874 million to $33.4 billion as of March 31, 2016 from December 31, 2015, primarily driven by seasonal commercial customer withdrawals.•Net Charge-off and Nonperforming Statistics: The net charge-off rate increased by 27 basis points to 0.29% in the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, and the nonperforming loan rate increased by 76 basis points to 1.63% as of March 31, 2016 from December 31, 2015. The increases in these rates reflect rising losses and credit risk rating downgrades in our oil and gas and taxi medallion lending portfolios.Other CategoryOther includes unallocated amounts related to our centralized Corporate Treasury group activities, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management, and certain capital management activities. Other also includes foreign exchange-rate fluctuations on foreign currency-denominated balances; unallocated corporate expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance, such as certain acquisition and restructuring charges; a portion of the net provision (benefit) for representation and warranty losses related to continuing operations; and offsets related to certain line-item reclassifications. 23Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 10 summarizes the financial results of our Other category for the periods indicated.Table 10: Other Category Results  Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015 ChangeSelected income statement data:      Net interest income $66 $15 **Non-interest income 8 (17) **Total net revenue (loss)(1) 74 (2) **Provision (benefit) for credit losses (2) — **Non-interest expense 48 31 55%Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 28 (33) **Income tax provision (benefit) (65) (78) (17)Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax $93 $45 107__________**Change is not meaningful.(1) Some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits.

Net income from continuing operations recorded in the Other category was $93 million in the first quarter of 2016, compared to $45 million in the first quarter of 2015. The increase in net income in 2016 was primarily driven by higher net interest income due to the impact of rates and balance sheet growth on treasury income, partially offset by (i) bank optimization charges; and (ii) a reduced income tax benefit as a result of higher income before taxes, partially offset by higher discrete tax benefits and net tax credits.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ANALYSISTotal assets decreased by $3.7 billion to $330.3 billion as of March 31, 2016 from December 31, 2015 primarily attributable to (i) a decrease of $2.2 billion in loans held for investment driven by seasonal paydowns in our credit card loan portfolio and the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio, partially offset by growth in our auto and commercial loan portfolios; and (ii) a decrease of $2.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by increase in investment securities due to purchases outpacing sales, maturities and paydowns. Total liabilities decreased by $4.1 billion to $282.6 billion as of March 31, 2016, primarily driven by reductions in our Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLB”) advances outstanding and maturities of securitized debt, partially offset by an increase in deposits generated by our Consumer Banking businesses. Stockholders’ equity increased by $423 million to $47.7 billion as of March 31, 2016, primarily due to our net income of $1.0 billion in the first quarter of 2016 and $575 million of other comprehensive income, partially offset by $970 million of share repurchases under our 2015 Stock Repurchase Program, including completion of the previously announced incremental $300 million in share repurchases.The following is a discussion of material changes in the major components of our assets and liabilities during the first quarter of 2016. Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management activities that are intended to ensure the adequacy of capital while managing our liquidity requirements for the Company and our customers and our market risk exposure in accordance with our risk appetite.Investment SecuritiesOur investment portfolio consists primarily of the following: U.S. Treasury securities; U.S. government-sponsored enterprise or agency (“Agency”) and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) and commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”); other asset-backed securities (“ABS”); and other securities. The carrying value of our investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities represented 91% and 90% of our total investment securities portfolio as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.The fair value of our securities available for sale portfolio was $40.1 billion as of March 31, 2016, an increase of $1.0 billion from December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to growth in this portfolio as purchases outpaced sales, maturities and  24Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contentspaydowns, as well as a decrease in interest rates. The fair value of our securities held to maturity portfolio was $26.5 billion as of March 31, 2016, an increase of $1.2 billion from $25.3 billion as of December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to lower interest rates and growth in this portfolio as purchases outpaced maturities and paydowns.Gross unrealized gains on our available for sale portfolio increased to $682 million as of March 31, 2016 compared to $578 million as of December 31, 2015 and gross unrealized losses on this portfolio decreased to $129 million as of March 31, 2016 compared to $321 million as of December 31, 2015, both of which were primarily driven by a decrease in interest rates. Of the $129 million as of March 31, 2016, $85 million was related to securities that had been in a loss position for 12 months or longer.

The increase was primarily driven by the transfer of certain commercial loans from loans held for investment to loans held for sale, partially offset by the sale of certain domestic credit card loan portfolios.DepositsOur deposits represent our largest source of funding for our operations, providing a consistent source of low-cost funds. Total deposits increased by $4.1 billion to $221.8 billion as of March 31, 2016 from December 31, 2015. The increase in deposits was primarily driven by growth in our Consumer Banking businesses as a result of our continued focus on deposit relationships with existing customers and our ongoing success of marketing strategies to attract online direct banking customers. We provide information on the composition of our deposits, average outstanding balances, interest expense and yield below in “Liquidity Risk Profile.” 26Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsSecuritized Debt ObligationsSecuritized debt obligations decreased by $1.3 billion to $14.9 billion as of March 31, 2016 from December 31, 2015, driven by maturities during the first quarter of 2016. We provide additional information on our borrowings below in “Liquidity Risk Profile.”Other DebtOther debt, which consists primarily of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, senior and subordinated notes, and FHLB advances, totaled $35.6 billion as of March 31, 2016, of which $34.7 billion represented long-term debt and the remainder represented short-term borrowings. Other debt totaled $42.9 billion as of December 31, 2015, of which $42.0 billion represented long-term debt and the remainder represented short-term borrowings. The decrease in other debt of $7.4 billion in the first quarter of 2016 was primarily attributable to a $7.2 billion reduction in our FHLB advances outstanding. We provide additional information on our borrowings below in “Liquidity Risk Profile” and in “Note 8—Deposits and Borrowings.”Mortgage Representation and Warranty ReserveWe acquired three subsidiaries that originated residential mortgage loans and sold these loans to various purchasers, including purchasers who created securitization trusts. These subsidiaries are Capital One Home Loans, LLC, which was acquired in February 2005; GreenPoint, which was acquired in December 2006 as part of the North Fork Bancorporation, Inc. (“North Fork”) acquisition; and CCB, which was acquired in February 2009 and subsequently merged into CONA.We have established representation and warranty reserves for losses associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable, including both litigation and non-litigation liabilities. These reserves are reported on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities. The reserve setting process relies heavily on estimates, which are inherently uncertain, and requires judgment. We evaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis. We build our representation and warranty reserves through the provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses, which we report in our consolidated statements of income as a component of non-interest income for loans originated and sold by CCB and Capital One Home Loans, LLC and as a component of discontinued operations for loans originated and sold by GreenPoint. The aggregate reserve for all three entities totaled $613 million as of March 31, 2016, compared to $610 million as of December 31, 2015.The table below summarizes changes in our representation and warranty reserve in the first quarters of 2016 and 2015.Table 14: Changes in Representation and Warranty Reserve  Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015Representation and warranty reserve, beginning of period $610 $731Provision (benefit) for mortgage representation and warranty losses:    Recorded in continuing operations (1) 1Recorded in discontinued operations 3 (19)Total provision (benefit) for mortgage representation and warranty losses 2 (18)Net realized recoveries (losses) 1 (40)Representation and warranty reserve, end of period $613 $673 As part of our business planning processes, we have considered various outcomes relating to the future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are possible but do not rise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying an incremental reserve under applicable accounting standards. Our current best estimate of reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond what was in our reserve as of March 31, 2016, is approximately $1.5 billion, a decline from our estimate of $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2015. The decrease in this estimate was primarily driven by favorable rulings in representation and warranty-related litigation. We provide additional information related to the representation and warranty reserve, including factors that may impact the adequacy of the reserve and the ultimate amount of losses incurred by our subsidiaries, in “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others.” 27Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIESIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various types of arrangements with limited liability companies, partnerships or trusts that often involve special purpose entities and variable interest entities (“VIEs”). Some of these arrangements are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or may be recorded in amounts different from the full contract or notional amount of the arrangements, depending on the nature or structure of, and the accounting standards required to be applied to, the arrangement. These arrangements may expose us to potential losses in excess of the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Our involvement in these arrangements can take many forms, including securitization and servicing activities, the purchase or sale of mortgage-backed or other asset-backed securities in connection with our home loan portfolio and loans to VIEs that hold debt, equity, real estate or other assets.Our continuing involvement in unconsolidated VIEs primarily consists of certain home loan securitization trusts and affordable housing entities. We provide a discussion of our activities related to these VIEs in “Note 6—Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations.”CAPITAL MANAGEMENTThe level and composition of our capital are determined by multiple factors, including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements and internal risk-based capital assessments such as internal stress testing and economic capital. The level and composition of our capital may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment, conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments.Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective ActionWe are subject to capital adequacy standards adopted by the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) (collectively, the “Federal Banking Agencies”), including the capital rules that implemented the Basel III capital framework (“Final Basel III Capital Rule”) developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“Basel Committee”). Moreover, the Banks, as insured depository institutions, are subject to Prompt Corrective Action (“PCA”) capital regulations. In July 2013, the Federal Banking Agencies adopted the Final Basel III Capital Rule, which, in addition to implementing the Basel III capital framework, also implemented certain Dodd-Frank Act and other capital provisions, and updated the PCA capital framework to reflect the new regulatory capital minimums. The Final Basel III Capital Rule amended both the Basel I and Basel II Advanced Approaches frameworks, established a new common equity Tier 1 capital requirement and set higher minimum capital ratio requirements. We refer to the amended Basel I framework as the “Basel III Standardized Approach,” and the amended Advanced Approaches framework as the “Basel III Advanced Approaches.” At the end of 2012, we met one of the two independent eligibility criteria set by banking regulators for becoming subject to the Advanced Approaches capital rules. As a result, we have undertaken a multi-year process of implementing the Advanced Approaches regime for calculating risk-weighted assets and regulatory capital levels. We entered parallel run under Advanced Approaches on January 1, 2015, during which we will calculate capital ratios under both the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches, though we will continue to use the Standardized Approach for purposes of meeting regulatory capital requirements. Separately, we also disclose a non-GAAP TCE ratio in “MD&A—Summary of Selected Financial Data.” While the TCE ratio is a capital measure widely used by investors, analysts, rating agencies, and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies, it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We provide information on the calculation of this ratio in “MD&A—Table A—Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures and Calculation of Regulatory Capital Measures.”Table 15 provides a comparison of our regulatory capital ratios under the Basel III Standardized Approach subject to transition provisions, the regulatory minimum capital adequacy ratios and the PCA well-capitalized targets as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 28Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 15: Capital Ratios Under Basel III (1)(2)  March 31, 2016 December 31, 2015  CapitalRatio MinimumCapitalAdequacy Well-Capitalized CapitalRatio MinimumCapitalAdequacy Well-CapitalizedCapital One Financial Corp:            Common equity Tier 1 capital(3) 11.1% 4.5% N/A 11.1% 4.5% N/ATier 1 capital(4) 12.4 6.0 6.0% 12.4 6.0 6.0%Total capital(5)  14.6 8.0 10.0 14.6 8.0 10.0Tier 1 leverage(6) 10.2 4.0 N/A 10.6 4.0 N/ASupplementary leverage ratio(7) 8.9 N/A N/A 9.2 N/A N/ACapital One Bank (USA), N.A.:           Common equity Tier 1 capital(3) 12.6% 4.5% 6.5% 12.2% 4.5% 6.5%Tier 1 capital(4) 12.6 6.0 8.0 12.2 6.0 8.0Total capital(5)  15.6 8.0 10.0 15.2 8.0 10.0Tier 1 leverage(6) 10.7 4.0 5.0 10.8 4.0 5.0Supplementary leverage ratio(7) 8.9 N/A N/A 9.0 N/A N/ACapital One, N.A.:           Common equity Tier 1 capital(3) 11.6% 4.5% 6.5% 11.8% 4.5% 6.5%Tier 1 capital(4) 11.6 6.0 8.0 11.8 6.0 8.0Total capital(5)  12.9 8.0 10.0 12.9 8.0 10.0Tier 1 leverage(6) 8.3 4.0 5.0 8.8 4.0 5.0Supplementary leverage ratio(7) 7.5 N/A N/A 7.9 N/A N/A__________ (1) Capital ratios are calculated based on the Basel III Standardized Approach framework, subject to applicable transition provisions, such as the inclusion of the unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale included in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and adjustments related to intangible assets other than goodwill. The inclusion of AOCI and the adjustments related to intangible assets are phased-in at 40% for 2015, 60% for 2016, 80% for 2017 and 100% for 2018.(2) Ratios as of March 31, 2016 are preliminary. As we continue to validate our data the calculations are subject to change until we file our March 31, 2016 Form FR Y-9C—Consolidated Financial Statements for Holding Companies and Call Reports.(3) Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on common equity Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets.(4) Tier 1 capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets.(5) Total capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on total capital divided by risk-weighted assets.(6) Tier 1 leverage ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by average assets, after certain adjustments.(7) Supplementary leverage ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by total leverage exposure.The Company exceeded the minimum capital requirements and each of the Banks exceeded the minimum regulatory requirements and were “well-capitalized” under PCA requirements as of both March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Final Basel III Capital Rule requires banks to maintain a capital conservation buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital of 2.5% above the regulatory minimum ratio and an incremental countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to be set at the discretion of the U.S. banking regulators (currently 0 percent as of March 31, 2016). Both the capital conservation buffer and the countercyclical capital buffer (if applicable) will be phased-in over a transition period of four years commencing on January 1, 2016.A common equity Tier 1 capital ratio below the regulatory minimum ratio and the combined capital conservation buffer and the countercyclical buffer (if applicable) might restrict a bank’s ability to distribute capital and make discretionary bonus payments. As of March 31, 2016, the Company, COBNA and CONA are all above the combined threshold. Additionally, banks designated as Globally Systemically Important Banks (“GSIBs”) are subject to an additional regulatory capital surcharge above the conservation and countercyclical buffers established by the Final Basel III Capital Rule. We are currently not designated as a GSIB and therefore not subject to this surcharge. 29Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsThe following table compares our common equity Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as of March 31, 2016, calculated based on the Final Basel III Capital Rule, subject to applicable transition provisions, to our estimated common equity Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as of March 31, 2016, calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach, as it applies when fully phased-in for Advanced Approaches banks like us that have not yet exited parallel run. Our estimated common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the fully phased-in Basel III Standardized Approach is based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and is subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. As we continue to engage with our regulators during our parallel run, there could be further changes to the calculation.Table 16: Estimated Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio under Fully Phased-In Basel III Standardized Approach(1) (Dollars in millions) March 31, 2016Common equity Tier 1 capital under Basel III Standardized $29,231Adjustments related to AOCI(2) (158)Adjustments related to intangibles(2) (355)Other adjustments(2) (1)Estimated common equity Tier 1 capital under fully phased-in Basel III Standardized $28,717Risk-weighted assets under Basel III Standardized $262,368Adjustments for fully phased-in Basel III Standardized(3) 174Estimated risk-weighted assets under fully phased-in Basel III Standardized  $262,542Estimated common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under fully phased-in Basel III Standardized(4) 10.9%__________(1) Estimated common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the fully phased-in Basel III Standardized Approach is a non-GAAP financial measure.(2) Assumes adjustments are fully phased-in.(3) Adjustments include higher risk weights for items that are included in capital based on the threshold deduction approach, such as mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets. The adjustments also include removal of risk weights for items that are deducted from common equity Tier 1 capital.(4) Calculated by dividing estimated common equity Tier 1 capital by estimated risk-weighted assets, which are both calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach, as it applies when fully phased-in for Advanced Approaches banks that have not yet exited parallel run.Under the Final Basel III Capital Rule, when we complete our parallel run for the Advanced Approaches, our minimum risk-based capital requirement will be the greater of the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches. See “Part I—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation” in our 2015 Form10-K for additional information. Once we exit parallel run, based on clarification of the Final Basel III Capital Rule from our regulators, any difference between the Final Basel III Capital Rule definitions of expected credit losses and our eligible credit reserves will be deducted from our Basel III Standardized Approach numerator, subject to transition provisions. Inclusive of this impact, based on current rules and our business mix, we estimate that our Basel III Advanced Approaches ratios will be lower than our Standardized Approach ratios.Capital Planning and Regulatory Stress TestingOn April 5, 2016 we submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve as part of the 2016 CCAR cycle. The stress testing results are expected to be released by the Federal Reserve before June 30, 2016. On February 17, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $300 million of shares of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2016 under the 2015 Stock Repurchase Program. For the description of the regulatory capital planning rules we are subject to, see “Part I—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation” in our 2015 Form 10-K. 30Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsDividend Policy and Stock PurchasesWe paid common stock dividends of $0.40 per share in the first quarter of 2016. We paid preferred stock dividends of $15.00 per share on the outstanding shares of our Series B Preferred Stock; $15.625 per share on the outstanding shares of our Series C Preferred Stock; $16.75 per share on the outstanding shares of our Series D Preferred Stock and $15.50 per share on the outstanding shares of our Series F Preferred Stock during the first quarter of 2016. We did not pay dividends on our Series E Preferred Stock in the first quarter of 2016.The declaration and payment of dividends to our stockholders, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. As a bank holding company (“BHC”), our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries. Regulatory restrictions exist that limit the ability of the Banks to transfer funds to our BHC. As of March 31, 2016, funds available for dividend payments from COBNA and CONA were $2.9 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends to stockholders.Consistent with our 2015 capital plan, our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $3.125 billion of shares of common stock beginning in the second quarter of 2015 through the end of the second quarter of 2016. On February 17, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $300 million of shares of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2016 under the 2015 Stock Repurchase Program. We notified the Federal Reserve of our intention to engage in additional share repurchases and the Federal Reserve did not object. Through the end of the first quarter of 2016, we repurchased approximately $2.8 billion of common stock as part of the 2015 Stock Repurchase Program, including completion of the previously announced incremental $300 million in share repurchases.The timing and exact amount of any future common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including market conditions, opportunities for growth, our capital position and amount of retained earnings. Our stock repurchase program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time. For additional information on dividends and stock repurchases, see “Part I—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation—Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Transfer of Funds” in our 2015 Form 10-K. 31Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsRISK MANAGEMENTOverview We use a risk framework to provide an overall enterprise-wide approach for effectively managing risk. We execute against our risk framework with the “Three Lines of Defense” risk management model to demonstrate and structure the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities in the organization for taking and managing risk. The “First Line of Defense” is comprised of the business areas that through their day-to-day business activities take risk on our behalf. As the business owner, the first line is responsible for identifying, assessing, managing and controlling that risk, and for mitigating our overall risk exposure. The first line formulates strategy and operates within the risk appetite and framework. The “Second Line of Defense” provides oversight of first line risk taking and management, and is comprised primarily of our Risk Management organization. The second line assists in determining risk capacity, risk appetite, and the strategies, policies and structure for managing risks. The second line owns the risk framework. The second line is both an ‘expert advisor’ to the first line and an ‘effective challenger’ of first line risk activities. The “Third Line of Defense” is comprised of our Internal Audit and Credit Review functions. The third line provides independent and objective assurance to senior management and to the Board of Directors that first and second line risk management and internal control systems and its governance processes are well-designed and working as intended.Our risk framework, which is built around governance, processes and people, consists of the following eight key elements:  •Establish Governance Processes, Accountabilities and Risk Appetites •Identify and Assess Risks and Ownership •Develop and Operate Controls, Monitoring and Mitigation Plans •Test and Detect Control Gaps and Perform Corrective Action •Escalate Key Risks and Gaps to Executive Management and, when Appropriate, the Board of Directors •Calculate and Allocate Capital in Alignment with Risk Management and Measurement Processes (including Stress Testing) •Support with the Right Culture, Talent and Skills •Enabled by the Right Data, Infrastructure and Programs We provide additional discussion of our risk management principles, roles and responsibilities, framework and risk appetite under “MD&A—Risk Management” in our 2015 Form 10-K.CREDIT RISK PROFILEOur loan portfolio accounts for the substantial majority of our credit risk exposure. Our lending activities are governed under our credit policy and are subject to independent review and approval. Below we provide information about the composition of our loan portfolio, key concentrations and credit performance metrics.We also engage in certain non-lending activities that may give rise to credit and counterparty settlement risk, including the purchase of securities for our investment securities portfolio, entering into derivative transactions to manage our market risk exposure and to accommodate customers, short-term advances on syndication activity (including bridge financing transactions we have underwritten), certain operational cash balances in other financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and customer overdrafts. We provide additional information on credit risk related to our investment securities portfolio under “Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis—Investment Securities” and credit risk related to derivative transactions in “Note 9—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” 32Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsLoans Held for Investment Portfolio CompositionWe provide a variety of lending products.

See Unfunded Lending Commitments in “Note 4—Loans” for information on our total unfunded lending commitments to extend credit.(3) Includes our taxi medallion lending portfolio among other portfolios.Purchased Credit-Impaired LoansOur portfolio of loans includes certain of our consumer and commercial loans acquired in business acquisitions that were recorded at fair value at acquisition and subsequently accounted for using the guidance for accounting for PCI loans and debt securities, which is based upon cash flows expected to be collected. These PCI loans totaled $18.6 billion as of March 31, 2016 compared to $19.5 billion as of December 31, 2015. See “MD&A—Glossary and Acronyms” for the definition of “PCI loans.”The difference between the fair value at acquisition and expected cash flows represents the accretable yield, which is recognized in interest income over the life of the loans. The difference between the contractual payments on the loans and expected cash flows represents the nonaccretable difference or the amount of principal and interest not considered collectible, which incorporates future expected credit losses over the life of the loans. We regularly update our estimate of expected principal and interest to be collected from these loans and evaluate the results for each accounting pool that was established at acquisition based on loans with common risk characteristics. Probable decreases in expected cash flows would trigger the recognition of an allowance for loan and lease losses through our provision for credit losses. Probable and significant increases in expected cash flows would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan and lease losses established subsequent to acquisition, with any remaining increase in expected cash flows recognized prospectively in interest income over the remaining estimated life of the underlying loans. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional information on PCI loans.Home LoansThe majority of our home loan portfolio are PCI loans acquired from the ING Direct and CCB acquisitions, representing 72% and 73% of our total home loan portfolio as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. See “MD&A—Glossary and Acronyms” for the definition of ING Direct and CCB acquisitions. The expected cash flows for the PCI loans in our home loan portfolio are significantly impacted by future expectations of home prices and interest rates. Decreases in expected cash flows that result from declining conditions, particularly associated with these variables, could result in an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses and reduction in accretable yield. Charge-offs on these loans are not recorded until the expected credit losses within the nonaccretable difference are depleted. In addition, PCI loans are not classified as delinquent or nonperforming as we  34Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contentsexpect to collect our net investment in these loans and the nonaccretable difference is expected to absorb the majority of the losses associated with these loans.Table 19 presents our total home loan portfolio and the break out of the PCI loans and remaining loans within our home loan portfolio by lien priority.Table 19: Home Loans—Risk Profile by Lien Priority  March 31, 2016  Home Loans PCI Loans Total Home Loans(Dollars in millions) Amount % ofTotal Amount % ofTotal Amount % ofTotalLien type:            1st lien $5,747 23.6% $17,294 71.1% $23,041 94.7%2nd lien 992 4.1 310 1.2 1,302 5.3Total $6,739 27.7% $17,604 72.3% $24,343 100.0%  December 31, 2015  Home Loans PCI Loans Total Home Loans(Dollars in millions) Amount % ofTotal Amount % ofTotal Amount % ofTotalLien type:            1st lien $5,705 22.6% $18,207 72.2% $23,912 94.8%2nd lien 995 4.0 320 1.2 1,315 5.2Total $6,700 26.6% $18,527 73.4% $25,227 100.0%See “Note 4—Loans” in this Report for additional credit quality information.

Changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses would be recognized immediately in the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income.Credit Risk MeasurementWe closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to assess and manage our exposure to credit risk. Key metrics we track in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming asset rates, as well as net charge-off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger balance commercial loans. Trends in delinquency rates are a primary indicator of credit risk within our consumer loan portfolios, as changes in delinquency rates provide an early warning of changes in credit quality. The primary indicator of credit risk in our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings. Because we generally classify loans that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming, the level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. In addition to delinquency  35Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contentsrates, the geographic distribution of our loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on regional economic conditions. We underwrite most consumer loans using proprietary models, which are typically based on credit bureau data, including borrower credit scores, along with application information and, where applicable, collateral and deal structure data. We continuously adjust our management of credit lines and collection strategies based on customer behavior and risk profile changes. We also use borrower credit scores for subprime classification, for competitive benchmarking and, in some cases, to drive product segmentation decisions. The following table provides details on the credit scores of our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios as of March 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and March 31, 2015.Table 21: Credit Score Distribution(Percentage of portfolio) March 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 March 31, 2015Domestic credit card - Refreshed FICO scores:(1)      Greater than 660 65% 66% 66%660 or below 35 34 34Total 100% 100% 100%Auto - At origination FICO scores:(2)      Greater than 660 51% 51% 48%621 - 660 17 17 17620 or below 32 32 35Total 100% 100% 100%__________ (1) Credit scores generally represent Fair Isaac Corporation (“FICO”) scores. These scores are obtained from one of the major credit bureaus at origination and are refreshed monthly thereafter. We approximate non-FICO credit scores to comparable FICO scores for consistency purposes. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 660 or below category.(2) Credit scores represent FICO scores. These scores are obtained from three credit bureaus at the time of application and are not refreshed thereafter. The FICO score distribution is based on the average scores. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 620 or below category.We present information in the section below on the credit performance of our loan portfolio, including the key metrics we use in tracking changes in the credit quality of our loan portfolio.See “Note 4—Loans” in this Report for additional credit quality information. Also, see “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2015 Form 10-K for information on our accounting policies for delinquent and nonperforming loans, net charge-offs and TDRs for each of our loan categories.Delinquency RatesWe consider the entire balance of an account to be delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the customer’s due date, measured at the reporting date. Our 30+ day delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due, whereas our 30+ day performing delinquency metrics include loans that are 30 or more days past due but are currently classified as performing and accruing interest. The 30+ day delinquency and 30+ day performing delinquency metrics are the same for domestic credit card loans, as we continue to classify the substantial majority of domestic credit card loans as performing until the account is charged off, typically when the account is 180 days past due. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2015 Form 10-K for information on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming for each of our loan categories.

These loans consist primarily of credit card accounts between 90 days and 179 days past due. As permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”), we continue to accrue interest and fees on domestic credit card loans through the date of charge-off, which is typically in the period the account becomes 180 days past due. While domestic credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until the loan is charged off, we reduce the balance of our credit card receivables by the amount of finance charges and fees billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from revenue.Table 24: 90+ Day Delinquent Loans Accruing Interest   March 31, 2016 December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions) Amount % ofTotal Loans(1) Amount % ofTotal Loans(1)Loan category:        Credit card $1,395 1.51% $1,500 1.56%Consumer banking 1 0.00 — 0.00Commercial banking 11 0.02 5 0.01Total $1,407 0.62 $1,505 0.65Geographic region:        Domestic $1,315 0.60% $1,426 0.64%International 92 1.13 79 0.96Total $1,407 0.62 $1,505 0.65__________ (1) Delinquency rates are calculated for each loan category by dividing 90+ day delinquent loans accruing interest by period-end loans held for investment for the specified loan category.Nonperforming Loans and Nonperforming AssetsNonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, foreclosed property and repossessed assets and the net realizable value of auto loans that have been charged off as a result of a bankruptcy. Nonperforming loans include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2015 Form 10-K for information on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming for each of our loan categories.Table 25 presents comparative information on nonperforming loans, by portfolio segment, and other nonperforming assets as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

Interest income forgone related to nonperforming loans was $19 million and $15 million in the first quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Forgone interest income represents the amount of interest income that would have been recorded during the period for nonperforming loans as of the end of the period had the loans performed according to their contractual terms.(2) Excluding the impact of PCI loans, the nonperforming loan rate for our home loan and total consumer banking portfolios was 4.55% and 0.89%, respectively, as of March 31, 2016, compared to 4.68% and 1.08%, respectively, as of December 31, 2015.(3) Excluding the impact of domestic credit card loans, nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment was 1.10% and 0.83% as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.(4) The denominator used in calculating the nonperforming asset ratios consists of total loans held for investment and total other nonperforming assets.(5) Includes acquired REOs of $94 million and $101 million as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.(6) Includes the net realizable value of auto loans that have been charged off as a result of a bankruptcy and repossessed assets obtained in satisfaction of auto loans. 39Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsNet Charge-OffsNet charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine to be uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We charge off loans as a reduction to the allowance for loan and lease losses when we determine the loan is uncollectible and record subsequent recoveries of previously charged off amounts as increases to the allowance for loan and lease losses. We exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and certain fraud losses from charge-offs. Generally costs to recover charged-off loans are recorded as collection expenses and included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest expense as incurred. Our charge-off policy for loans varies based on the loan type. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2015 Form 10-K for information on our charge-off policy for each of our loan categories.Table 26 presents our net charge-off amounts and rates, by portfolio segment, in the first quarters of 2016 and 2015.Table 26: Net Charge-Offs (Recoveries)  Three Months Ended March 31,  2016 2015(Dollars in millions) Amount Rate(1) Amount Rate(1)Credit Card:        Domestic credit card $887 4.16% $664 3.55%International credit card 63 3.24 55 2.80Total credit card 950 4.09 719 3.48Consumer Banking:        Auto 168 1.60 148 1.55Home loan(2) 3 0.05 2 0.03Retail banking 12 1.36 9 0.96Total consumer banking(2) 183 1.04 159 0.89Commercial Banking:        Commercial and multifamily real estate (1) (0.01) (2) (0.03)Commercial and industrial 47 0.49 4 0.05Total commercial lending 46 0.29 2 0.01Small-ticket commercial real estate 0 0.13 1 0.47Total commercial banking 46 0.29 3 0.02Other loans (1) (3.82) 0 1.56Total net charge-offs $1,178 2.08 $881 1.72Average loans held for investment $226,736   $205,194  __________ (1) Calculated for each loan category by dividing annualized net charge-offs by average loans held for investment for the period.(2) Excluding the impact of PCI loans, the net charge-off rate for our home loan and total consumer banking portfolios was 0.17% and 1.40%, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2016, compared to 0.11% and 1.30%, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2015.For information regarding management’s expectations of net charge-offs, see “MD&A—Business Segment Expectations.” 40Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTroubled Debt RestructuringsAs part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may provide short-term (three to twelve months) or long-term (greater than twelve months) modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to improve long-term collectability of the loan and to avoid the need for foreclosure or repossession of collateral.Table 27 presents our recorded investment of loans modified in TDRs as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. It excludes loan modifications that do not meet the definition of a TDR and PCI loans, which we track and report separately.Table 27: Troubled Debt Restructurings  March 31, 2016 December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions) Amount % of Total Modifications Amount % of Total ModificationsCredit card $658 35.6% $666 36.7%Consumer banking:        Auto 494 26.7 488 26.8Home loan 233 12.6 229 12.6Retail banking 40 2.1 42 2.3Total consumer banking 767 41.4 759 41.7Commercial banking 425 23.0 392 21.6Total $1,850 100.0% $1,817 100.0%Status of TDRs:        Performing $1,345 72.7% $1,367 75.2%Nonperforming 505 27.3 450 24.8Total $1,850 100.0% $1,817 100.0% In the Credit Card business, the majority of our credit card TDRs involve reducing the interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. The interest rate in effect immediately prior to the loan modification is used as the effective interest rate for purposes of measuring impairment using the present value of expected cash flows. In some cases, the interest rate on a credit card account is automatically increased due to non-payment, late payment or similar events. In all cases, we cancel the customer’s available line of credit on the credit card. If the customer does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement may revert to its original payment terms, likely resulting in any loan outstanding reflected in the appropriate delinquency category, and charged off in accordance with our standard charge-off policy.In the Consumer Banking business, the majority of our loans modified in TDRs receive an extension, an interest rate reduction or principal reduction, or a combination of both. In addition, TDRs also occur in connection with bankruptcy of the borrower. In certain bankruptcy discharges, the loan is written down to the collateral value and the charged off amount is reported as principal reduction. Their impairment is determined using the present value of expected cash flows or a collateral evaluation for certain auto and home loans where the collateral value is lower than the recorded investment. In the Commercial Banking business, the majority of loans modified in TDRs receive an extension, with a portion of these loans receiving an interest rate reduction. The impairment on modified commercial loans is generally determined based on the underlying collateral value. We provide additional information on modified loans accounted for as TDRs, including the performance of those loans subsequent to modification, in “Note 4—Loans.”Impaired LoansA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan. Generally, we report loans as impaired based on the method for measuring impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. Loans defined as individually impaired include larger balance commercial nonperforming loans and TDRs. Loans held for sale are not reported as impaired, as these loans are recorded at lower of cost or fair value. Impaired loans also exclude PCI loans accounted for based on expected cash flows because this accounting methodology takes into consideration future credit losses expected to be incurred.Impaired loans, including TDRs, totaled $2.9 billion and $2.5 billion as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Loans modified in TDRs accounted for $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion of impaired loans as of March 31, 2016 and December 31,  41Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents2015, respectively. We provide additional information on our impaired loans, including the allowance for loan and lease losses established for these loans, in “Note 4—Loans” and “Note 5—Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments.”Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending CommitmentsOur allowance for loan and lease losses represents management’s best estimate of incurred loan and lease credit losses inherent in our held for investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date. The allowance for loan and lease losses is increased through the provision for credit losses and reduced by net charge-offs. We provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses under “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2015 Form 10-K.Our allowance for loan and lease losses increased by $286 million to $5.4 billion as of March 31, 2016 from December 31, 2015. The allowance coverage ratio increased by 15 basis points to 2.38% as of March 31, 2016 from December 31, 2015. The increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses was primarily driven by continued adverse industry conditions impacting our oil and gas portfolio in our Commercial Banking business as well as continued domestic credit card loan growth and portfolio seasoning.Table 28 presents changes in our allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the first quarters of 2016 and 2015, and details by portfolio segment the provision for credit losses, charge-offs and recoveries recognized in our consolidated statements of income. 42Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 28: Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments Activity    Consumer Banking      (Dollars in millions) Credit Card Auto HomeLoan RetailBanking TotalConsumerBanking Commercial Banking Other Loans TotalAllowance for loan and lease losses:                Balance as of December 31, 2015 $3,654 $726 $70 $72 $868 $604 $4 $5,130Provision (benefit) for loan and lease losses 1,071 214 (3) 18 229 171 (2) 1,469Charge-offs (1,222) (269) (5) (17) (291) (48) (1) (1,562)Recoveries 272 101 2 5 108 2 2 384Net charge-offs (950) (168) (3) (12) (183) (46) 1 (1,178)Other changes(1) 10 — — — — (15) — (5)Balance as of March 31, 2016 3,785 772 64 78 914 714 3 5,416Reserve for unfunded lending commitments:                Balance as of December 31, 2015 — — — 7 7 161 — 168Provision for losses on unfunded lending commitments — — — 1 1 57 — 58Balance as of March 31, 2016 — — — 8 8 218 — 226Combined allowance and reserve as ofMarch 31, 2016 $3,785 $772 $64 $86 $922 $932 $3 $5,642    Consumer Banking      (Dollars in millions) Credit Card Auto HomeLoan RetailBanking TotalConsumerBanking Commercial Banking Other Loans TotalAllowance for loan and lease losses:                Balance as of December 31, 2014 $3,204 $661 $62 $56 $779 $395 $5 $4,383Provision (benefit) for loan and lease losses 669 184 8 14 206 52 — 927Charge-offs (1,022) (233) (4) (13) (250) (9) (3) (1,284)Recoveries 303 85 2 4 91 6 3 403Net charge-offs (719) (148) (2) (9) (159) (3) — (881)Other changes(1) (24) — — — — — — (24)Balance as of March 31, 2015 3,130 697 68 61 826 444 5 4,405Reserve for unfunded lending commitments:                Balance as of December 31, 2014 — — — 7 7 106 — 113Provision for losses on unfunded lending commitments — — — — — 8 — 8Balance as of March 31, 2015 — — — 7 7 114 — 121Combined allowance and reserve as of March 31, 2015 $3,130 $697 $68 $68 $833 $558 $5 $4,526__________(1) Represents foreign currency translation adjustments and the net impact of loan transfers and sales. 43Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 29 presents the allowance coverage ratios as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Table 29: Allowance Coverage Ratios  March 31, 2016 December 31, 2015Total allowance coverage ratios:    Allowance for loan and lease losses as a % of loans held for investment 2.38% 2.23%Allowance for loan and lease losses as a % of nonperforming loans(1) 343.30 438.70Allowance coverage ratios by loan category:(2)    Credit card (30+ day delinquent loans) 129.55 111.81Consumer banking (30+ day delinquent loans) 35.30 26.42Commercial banking (nonperforming loans) 67.98 109.76__________ (1) The allowance for loan and lease losses for both of nonperforming and performing loans as a percentage of nonperforming loans, excluding the allowance for loan and lease losses related to our domestic credit card loans, was 125.26% and 151.80% as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.(2) Calculated based on the total allowance for loan and lease losses divided by the outstanding balance of loans held for investment within the specified loan category.LIQUIDITY RISK PROFILEWe have established liquidity practices that are intended to ensure that we have sufficient asset-based liquidity to withstand the potential impact of deposit attrition or diminished liquidity in the funding markets. Our practices are intended to maintain adequate liquidity reserves to cover our funding requirements as well as any potential deposit run-off and maintain access to diversified funding sources to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. Our liquidity reserves consist of readily-marketable or pledgable assets which can be used as a source of liquidity, if needed.Table 30 below presents the composition of our liquidity reserves as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Table 30: Liquidity Reserves(Dollars in millions) March 31, 2016 December 31, 2015Cash and cash equivalents $5,235 $8,023Investment securities available for sale, at fair value 40,092 39,061Investment securities held to maturity, at fair value 26,454 25,317Total investment securities portfolio(1)(2) 66,546 64,378FHLB borrowing capacity secured by loans 29,318 30,661Outstanding FHLB advances and letters of credit secured by loans (13,342) (20,514)Investment securities encumbered for Public Funds and others (10,581) (10,602)Total liquidity reserves $77,176 $71,946__________(1) The weighted-average life of our securities was approximately 5.4 years and 5.8 years as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.(2) As part of our liquidity management strategy, we pledge securities to secure borrowings from counterparties and to secure trust and public deposits and other purposes as required or permitted by law. We pledged securities available for sale with a fair value of $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We also pledged securities held to maturity with a carrying value of $8.5 billion and $8.7 billion as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.Our liquidity reserves increased by $5.2 billion to $77.2 billion as of March 31, 2016 from December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the fair value of our investment securities portfolio and a reduction in our FHLB advances. See “MD&A—Risk Management” in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional information on our management of liquidity risk.We are subject to the Final Liquidity Coverage Rules (“Final LCR Rule”) issued by the Federal Banking Agencies. The Final LCR Rule came into effect in January 2015 and requires us to calculate the LCR as of the last business day of each month from January 2015 until July 2016, and then on a daily basis thereafter. The minimum LCR standard is phased in as follows: 90% by January 1, 2016; and 100% by January 1, 2017 and thereafter. At March 31, 2016, we exceeded the fully phased-in LCR requirement. The  44Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contentscalculation and the underlying components are based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and are subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. Borrowing CapacityWe filed a new shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision (“SEC”) on March 31, 2015, which expires in March 2018. Under this shelf registration, we may periodically offer and sell an indeterminate aggregate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units. There is no limit under this shelf registration to the amount or number of such securities that we may offer and sell, subject to market conditions. We also filed a new shelf registration statement with the SEC on July 30, 2015, which does not expire and allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $20 billion of securitized debt obligations.In addition to our issuance capacity under the shelf registration statements, we also have access to FHLB advances with a maximum borrowing capacity of $29.3 billion as of March 31, 2016, of which $16.0 billion was still available to us to borrow as of March 31, 2016. We pledged loan collateral with an outstanding balance of $35.6 billion to secure this borrowing capacity. The ability to draw down funding is based on membership status and the amount is dependent upon the Banks’ ability to post collateral. Our FHLB membership is secured by our investment in FHLB stock of $578 million and $884 million as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which was determined in part based on our outstanding advances. We also have access to the Federal Reserve Discount Window through which we had a borrowing capacity of $12.0 billion as of March 31, 2016. Although available, we do not view this borrowing capacity as a primary source of liquidity and did not utilize it during 2015 or the first quarter of 2016.FundingThe Company’s primary source of funding comes from deposits, which provide us with a stable and relatively low cost of funds. In addition to deposits, the Company raises funding through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, FHLB advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios, the issuance of securitized debt obligations, the issuance of brokered deposits, the purchase of federal funds and other borrowings. A key objective in our use of these markets is to maintain access to a diversified mix of wholesale funding sources.DepositsTable 31 provides the composition of end of period deposits as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, as well as a comparison of average balances, interest expense and average deposit rates for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.Table 31: Deposit Composition and Average Deposit Rates(Dollars in millions) March 31, 2016 December 31, 2015Non-interest bearing accounts $25,182 $25,847Interest-bearing checking accounts(1) 46,626 44,720Saving deposits(2) 136,415 134,075Time deposits less than $100,000 10,489 10,347Total core deposits 218,712 214,989Time deposits of $100,000 or more 2,428 1,889Foreign time deposits(3) 639 843Total deposits $221,779 $217,721 45Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents  Three Months Ended March 31,  2016 2015(Dollars in millions) AverageBalance InterestExpense AverageDepositRate AverageBalance InterestExpense AverageDepositRateInterest-bearing checking accounts(1) $45,978 $55 0.48% $42,309 $51 0.48%Saving deposits(2) 134,677 191 0.57 131,580 191 0.58Time deposits less than $100,000 10,554 29 1.08 5,885 17 1.12Total core deposits 191,209 275 0.51 179,774 259 0.51Time deposits of $100,000 or more 2,212 7 1.39 2,211 11 1.96Foreign time deposits(3) 704 1 0.34 1,013 1 0.34Total interest-bearing deposits $194,125 $283 0.52 $182,998 $271 0.52__________(1) Includes Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (“NOW”) accounts.(2) Includes Money Market Deposit Accounts (“MMDA”).(3) Substantially all of our foreign time deposits were greater than $100,000 as of both March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Our deposits include brokered deposits, which we obtained through the use of third-party intermediaries. Those brokered deposits are reported as interest-bearing checking, saving deposits and time deposits in the above table and totaled $11.9 billion and $12.0 billion as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.The FDIC limits the acceptance of brokered deposits by “well-capitalized” insured depository institutions and, with a waiver from the FDIC, by “adequately capitalized” institutions. COBNA and CONA were “well-capitalized,” as defined under the federal banking regulatory guidelines, as of both March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. See “Part I—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation” for additional information.Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term DebtWe access the capital markets to meet our funding needs through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations, and federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. In addition, we may utilize short-term and long-term FHLB advances secured by our investment securities, residential home loans, multifamily real estate loans, commercial real estate loans and home equity lines of credit. A portion of our long-term FHLB advances are structured with either a one-month or a three-month call option at our discretion.Our short-term borrowings include those borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less and do not include the current portion of long-term debt. The short-term borrowings, which consist of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, and short-term FHLB advances, decreased by $64 million to $917 million as of March 31, 2016 from December 31, 2015. Our long-term debt, which primarily consists of securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, and long-term FHLB advances, decreased by $8.6 billion to $49.6 billion as of March 31, 2016 from December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a net decrease of $7.2 billion in long-term callable FHLB advances and a net decrease of $1.3 billion in securitized debt obligations.  46Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 32 displays the maturity profile, based on contractual maturities, of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt including securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings as of March 31, 2016, and the outstanding balances as of December 31, 2015.Table 32: Contractual Maturity Profile of Outstanding Debt   March 31, 2016  (Dollars in millions) Up to1 Year > 1 Yearto 2 Years > 2 Yearsto 3 Years > 3 Yearsto 4 Years > 4 Yearsto 5 Years > 5 Years Total December 31, 2015Short-term borrowings:                Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase $917 $— $— $— $— $— $917 $981Total short-term borrowings 917 — — — — — 917 981Long-term debt:                Securitized debt obligations 5,479 5,215 1,716 549 1,592 362 14,913 16,166Senior and subordinated notes:                Unsecured senior debt 2,132 4,454 3,127 2,553 — 5,270 17,536 17,757Unsecured subordinated debt 1,019 — — 323 — 2,858 4,200 4,080Total senior and subordinated notes 3,151 4,454 3,127 2,876 — 8,128 21,736 21,837Other long-term borrowings:                FHLB advances 18 23 5 1 250 12,601 12,898 20,098Capital lease obligations 1 1 1 1 1 28 33 33Total other long-term borrowings 19 24 6 2 251 12,629 12,931 20,131Total long-term debt(1) 8,649 9,693 4,849 3,427 1,843 21,119 49,580 58,134Total short-term borrowings and long-term debt $9,566 $9,693 $4,849 $3,427 $1,843 $21,119 $50,497 $59,115Percentage of total 19% 19% 9% 7% 4% 42% 100% 100%__________(1) Includes unamortized discounts, premiums and other cost basis adjustments, which together result in a net addition of $68 million and a net reduction of $224 million as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.We provide additional information on our short-term borrowings and long-term debt under “Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis—Securitized Debt Obligations,” “Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis—Other Debt” and in “Note 8—Deposits and Borrowings.”Credit RatingsOur credit ratings impact our ability to access capital markets and our non-deposit borrowing costs. Rating agencies base their ratings on numerous factors, including liquidity, capital adequacy, asset quality, quality of earnings and the probability of systemic support. Significant changes in these factors could result in different ratings. Such ratings help to support our cost effective unsecured funding as part of our overall financing programs.

Below we provide additional information about our primary sources of market risk, our market risk management strategies and the measures we use to evaluate our market risk exposure.Primary Market Risk ExposuresOur primary source of market risk is interest rate risk. We also have exposure to foreign exchange risk.Interest Rate RiskInterest rate risk, which represents exposure to instruments whose yield or price varies with the volatility of interest rates, is our most significant source of market risk exposure. Banks are inevitably exposed to interest rate risk due to differences in the timing between the maturities or re-pricing of assets and liabilities.Foreign Exchange RiskForeign exchange risk represents exposure to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies. Our primary exposure is related to the funding of our non-dollar net investments in our International Card business in the U.K. and Canada. Changes in foreign exchange rates affect the value of non-dollar-denominated equity invested in our foreign operations and impact our AOCI and related capital ratios. Our intercompany funding exposes our consolidated statements of income to foreign exchange transaction risk, while our equity investments in our foreign operations results in translation risk in AOCI. We manage our transaction risk by entering into forward foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to foreign currency-denominated intercompany borrowings. In the third quarter of 2014, we began entering into net investment hedges to manage our AOCI exposure. We apply hedge accounting to both intercompany funding hedges and net investment hedges.We measure our total exposure by regularly tracking the equity value of our net equity invested in our U.K. and Canadian operations as well as their funding requirements. We apply a 30% U.S. dollar appreciation shock against each of our Great British pound (“GBP”) and Canadian dollar (“CAD”) net investment exposures, which we believe approximates a significant adverse foreign exchange movement over a one-year time horizon. Our gross equity exposures were 1.4 billion GBP as of both March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and 704 million CAD and 686 million CAD as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. As a result of our derivative management activities, we believe our net exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal.Market Risk ManagementWe employ several techniques to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk, which include, but are not limited to, altering the duration and re-pricing characteristics of our various assets and liabilities through interest rate derivatives or mitigating the foreign exchange exposure of certain non-dollar-denominated equity or transactions through derivatives. Derivatives are one of the primary tools we use in managing interest rate and foreign exchange risk. Our current market risk management policies include the use of derivatives. We execute our derivative contracts in both over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivative markets. Although the majority of our derivatives are interest rate swaps, we also use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage both our interest rate and foreign currency risk. The outstanding notional amount of our derivative contracts totaled $114.0 billion as of March 31, 2016, compared to $105.9 billion as of December 31, 2015, driven by an increase in our hedging activities. 48Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsMarket Risk MeasurementWe have risk management policies and limits established by our market risk management policies and approved by the Board of Directors. Our objective is to manage our asset and liability risk position and exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and prescribed limits based on prevailing market conditions and long-term expectations. Because no single measure can reflect all aspects of market risk, we use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analysis to measure, assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and foreign exchange rates on our non-dollar-denominated earnings and non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations. We provide additional information below in “Economic Value of Equity.”We consider the impact on both net interest income and economic value of equity in measuring and managing our interest rate risk. Because the federal funds rate was lowered to near zero in December 2008, the rate remained in a target range of 0% to 0.25% until December 2015, and then increased to a range of 0.25% to 0.50%, we use a 50 basis points decrease as our declining interest rate scenario, since a scenario where interest rates would decline by 200 basis points is unlikely. In scenarios where a 50 basis points decline would result in a rate less than 0%, we assume a rate of 0%. Below we discuss the assumptions used in calculating each of these measures. Net Interest Income SensitivityThis sensitivity measure estimates the impact on our projected 12-month base-line interest rate sensitive revenue resulting from movements in interest rates. Interest rate sensitive revenue consists of net interest income and certain components of other non-interest income significantly impacted by movements in interest rates, including changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and free-standing interest rate swaps. Adjusted net interest income consists of net interest income and changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, including related derivative hedging activity, and changes in the fair value of free-standing interest rate swaps. In addition to our existing assets and liabilities, we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions, such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, and plans for projected changes in our funding mix in our baseline forecast. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our projected interest rate sensitive revenue, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates of +200 basis points, +100 basis points, +50 basis points and -50 basis points to spot rates, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above. Economic Value of EquityOur economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact on the net present value of our assets and liabilities, including derivative hedging activity, resulting from movements in interest rates. Our economic value of equity sensitivity measures are calculated based on our existing assets and liabilities, including derivatives, and do not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected plans for funding mix changes. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our economic value of equity, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates of +200 basis points, +100 basis points, +50 basis points and -50 basis points to spot rates, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above. 49Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 34 shows the estimated percentage impact on our projected base-line net interest income and economic value of equity, calculated under the methodology described above, as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Table 34: Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis(1)  March 31, 2016 December 31, 2015Estimated impact on projected base-line net interest income    +200 basis points 3.5% 2.6%+100 basis points 2.2 1.6+50 basis points 1.4 0.9–50 basis points (2.1) (1.6)Estimated impact on economic value of equity    +200 basis points (2.6) (5.2)+100 basis points 0.2 (1.5)+50 basis points 0.6 (0.4)–50 basis points (1.7) (0.6)__________(1) We are in the process of updating our projected deposit re-pricing assumptions as part of our regular evaluation and assessment of the assumptions and models used to measure our interest rate sensitivity and expect this update to be complete by the end of the second quarter of 2016. If approved, we anticipate that this update would result in less asset sensitivity in the projected base-line net interest income measures.Our projected net interest income and economic value of equity sensitivity measures were within our policy limits as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. In addition to these industry standard measures, we will continue to factor into our internal interest rate risk management decisions the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios, such as stressed rate shocks as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios.Limitations of Market Risk MeasuresThe interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information, internally-developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies, which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments. Other market inputs, such as interest rates, market prices and interest rate volatility, are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures. We regularly evaluate, update and enhance these assumptions, models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities.There are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. The sensitivity analysis described above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is performed at a particular point in time based on the existing balance sheet and, in some cases, expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions. The strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections, which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ substantially from the above sensitivity analysis.SUPERVISION AND REGULATIONOn March 15, 2016, the FDIC issued a final rule implementing Section 334(e) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”). Section 334(e) mandates that the FDIC offset the effect of increasing the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. The final rule imposes a new quarterly deposit insurance surcharge assessment, with an annual rate of 4.5 basis points, on all insured depository institutions with assets of $10 billion or more (including the Banks), in addition to the regular quarterly deposit insurance assessments applicable to all insured depository institutions. The surcharge will begin the quarter after the DIF reserve ratio first reaches or exceeds 1.15% (projected by the FDIC as likely to occur during the second quarter of 2016) and will continue until the reserve ratio first reaches or exceeds 1.35%. The FDIC estimates the reserve ratio will reach 1.35% by June 2018; however, if the reserve ratio does not reach 1.35% by December 31, 2018, the FDIC will impose a one-time shortfall assessment on depository institutions subject to the surcharge, including the Banks, on March 31, 2019. The surcharge is expected to be partially offset by lower FDIC assessment rates, which will be in effect once the DIF reserve ratio reaches 1.15%. 50Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsWe provide additional information on our Supervision and Regulation in our 2015 Form 10-K under “Part I—Item 1.

The activities of these entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt.Investor entities: Entities that invest in community development entities (“CDE”) that provide debt financing to businesses and non-profit entities in low-income and rural communities.Leverage ratio: Tier 1 capital divided by average assets after certain adjustments, as defined by the regulators.

After the initial payment option period, usually five years, the recalculated minimum payment represents a fully-amortizing principal and interest payment that would effectively repay the loan by the end of its contractual term.Other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”): An impairment charge taken on a security whose fair value has fallen below the carrying value on the balance sheet and its value is not expected to recover through the holding period of the security.Patriot Act: The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism).PCI loans: Refers to the loans acquired in a business combination that were recorded at fair value at acquisition and subsequently accounted for based on cash flows expected to be collected in accordance with ASC 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality (formerly known as “Statement of Position 03-3, Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer,” commonly referred to as “SOP 03-3”). Acquired loans are considered PCI loans if they have a discount attributable, at least in part, to credit deterioration and they are not specifically scoped out of this guidance. Our PCI loans include a limited portion of commercial loans acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015 in the HFS acquisition and the substantial majority of consumer and commercial loans acquired in the ING Direct and Chevy Chase acquisitions. 57Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsThe excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated fair value of purchased loans represents the accretable yield, which is recognized into interest income over the life of the loans. The difference between total contractual payments on the loans and all expected cash flows represents the nonaccretable difference or the amount of principal and interest not considered collectible, which incorporates future expected credit losses over the life of the loans. Decreases in expected cash flows from credit deterioration subsequent to acquisition will generally result in an impairment charge recognized in our provision for credit losses and an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses. Charge-offs are not recorded until the expected credit losses within the nonaccretable difference are depleted. PCI loans are not classified as delinquent or nonperforming as we expect to collect our net investment in these loans and the nonaccretable difference will absorb the majority of the losses associated with these loans. In addition, PCI loans are excluded from impaired loans because the applicable accounting methodology takes into consideration expected future credit losses.Public Fund deposits: Deposits that are derived from a variety of political subdivisions such as school districts and municipalities. Purchase volume: Dollar amount of customer purchases, net of returns.Rating agency: An independent agency that assesses the credit quality and likelihood of default of an issue or issuer and assigns a rating to that issue or issuer.Recorded investment: The amount of the investment in a loan which includes any direct write-down of the investment.Repurchase agreement: An instrument used to raise short-term funds whereby securities are sold with an agreement for the seller to buy back the securities at a later date. Restructuring charges: Charges typically from the consolidation or relocation of operations, and reductions in work force.Return on average assets: Calculated based on income from continuing operations, net of tax, for the period divided by average total assets for the period.Return on average common equity: Calculated based on the sum of (i) income from continuing operations, net of tax; (ii) less dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities; (iii) less preferred stock dividends, for the period, divided by average common equity. Our calculation of return on average common equity may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.Return on average tangible common equity: Calculated based on the sum of (i) income from continuing operations, net of tax; (ii) less dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities; and (iii) less preferred stock dividends, for the period, divided by average tangible common equity.

For purposes of auto lending in our Consumer Banking business we generally consider FICO scores of 620 or below to be subprime.Tangible common equity (“TCE”): Common equity less goodwill and intangible assets adjusted for deferred tax liabilities associated with non-tax deductible intangible assets and tax deductible goodwill.Troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”): A TDR is deemed to occur when the Company modifies the contractual terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty.U.K. PPI Reserve: U.K. payment protection insurance customer refund reserve.U.S. GAAP: Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents NOTE 1—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe CompanyCapital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware Corporation established in 1994 and headquartered in McLean, Virginia, is a diversified financial services holding company with banking and non-banking subsidiaries. Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through branches, the internet and other distribution channels. As of March 31, 2016, our principal subsidiaries included:•Capital One Bank (USA), National Association (“COBNA”), which offers credit and debit card products, other lending products and deposit products; and•Capital One, National Association (“CONA”), which offers a broad spectrum of banking products and financial services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients.The Company and its subsidiaries are hereafter collectively referred to as “we,” “us” or “our.” COBNA and CONA are collectively referred to as the “Banks.”We also offer products outside of the United States of America (“U.S.”) principally through Capital One (Europe) plc (“COEP”), an indirect subsidiary of COBNA organized and located in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and through a branch of COBNA in Canada. COEP has authority, among other things, to provide credit card loans. Our branch of COBNA in Canada also has the authority to provide credit card loans.Our principal operations are currently organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. We provide details on our business segments, the integration of recent acquisitions into our business segments and the allocation methodologies and accounting policies used to derive our business segment results in “Note 13—Business Segments.”On December 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the Healthcare Financial Services business of General Electric Capital Corporation (“HFS acquisition”). During the first quarter of 2016, we recorded measurement period adjustments which modestly reduced the value of certain identifiable assets acquired, with a corresponding increase to goodwill. Including post-closing purchase price adjustments during the first quarter of 2016, total cash consideration for the acquisition was $9.0 billion, including $180 million of cash acquired, and we recognized approximately $9.2 billion in assets, including $8.2 billion of loans, $134 million of intangible assets and $514 million in goodwill. We continue to expect to finalize the accounting for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the HFS acquisition by June 30, 2016.Basis of Presentation and Use of EstimatesThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and in the related disclosures. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. While management makes its best judgment, actual amounts or results could differ from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included for a fair statement of this interim financial information. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Capital One Financial Corporation and all other entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. We determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity (“VIE”). All significant intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated.New Accounting Standards AdoptedConsolidation: Amendments to the Consolidation AnalysisIn February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued revised guidance for evaluating whether organizations should consolidate certain legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations and securitization structures. The guidance also removed the indefinite deferral of specialized guidance for certain investment funds. We adopted the guidance effective in the first quarter of 2016 on a modified retrospective basis. Our adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. See “Note 6—Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations”for information regarding our involvement with VIEs.Recently Issued but Not Yet Adopted Accounting Standards Improvements to Employee Share-Based AccountingIn March 2016, the FASB issued revised guidance for accounting for employee share-based payments, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective beginning on January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We do not believe the impact of this guidance will be material to our consolidated financial statements. LeasesIn February 2016, the FASB issued revised guidance for leases. The guidance requires lessees to recognize right of use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements for all leases, with certain practical expedients. This will be effective for us on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.Revenue from Contracts with CustomersIn May 2014, the FASB issued revised guidance for the recognition, measurement and disclosure of revenue from contracts with customers. The guidance is applicable to all entities and, once effective, will replace significant portions of existing industry and transaction-specific revenue recognition rules with a more principles-based recognition model. Most revenue associated with financial instruments, including interest and loan origination fees, is outside the scope of the guidance. Gains and losses on investment securities, derivatives and sales of financial instruments are similarly excluded from the scope. Subsequent to issuance of the revenue recognition guidance, the FASB has issued several updates that (i) deferred by one year the effective date for revenue recognition guidance to January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted effective January 1, 2017; (ii) clarified its guidance for performing the principle-versus-agent analysis; and (iii) clarified guidance for identifying performance obligations allowing entities to ignore immaterial promised goods and services in the context of a contract with a customer. Entities can elect to adopt the guidance either on a full or modified retrospective basis. Full retrospective adoption will require a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. Modified retrospective adoption will require a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the entity first applies the new guidance. We do not plan to early adopt the guidance. We are currently assessing the potential impact of this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and which transition method we plan to elect. 67Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents NOTE 2—DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSShutdown of Mortgage Origination Operations of our Wholesale Mortgage Banking UnitIn the third quarter of 2007, we closed the mortgage origination operations of our wholesale mortgage banking unit, GreenPoint Mortgage Funding Inc. (“GreenPoint”), which we acquired in December 2006 as part of the North Fork Bancorporation, Inc. (“North Fork”) acquisition. The results of the wholesale banking unit have been accounted for as a discontinued operation and are therefore not included in our results from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. We have no significant continuing involvement in these operations.The following table summarizes the results from discontinued operations related to the closure of the mortgage origination operations of our wholesale mortgage banking unit: Table 2.1: Results of Discontinued Operations   Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015Non-interest income (expense), net $(8) $30Income (loss) from discontinued operations before income taxes (8) 30Income tax provision (benefit) (3) 11Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax $(5) $19The discontinued mortgage origination operations of our wholesale mortgage banking unit had remaining assets which primarily consisted of a deferred tax asset related to the reserve for representations and warranties on loans previously sold to third parties. See “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others” for information related to reserves we have established for our mortgage representation and warranty exposure. 68Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents NOTE 3—INVESTMENT SECURITIESOur investment portfolio consists primarily of the following: U.S. Treasury securities; U.S. government-sponsored enterprise or agency (“Agency”) and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) and commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”); other asset-backed securities (“ABS”); and other securities. The carrying value of our investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities represented 91% and 90% of our total investment securities as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.Our investment portfolio includes securities available for sale and securities held to maturity. We classify securities as available for sale or held to maturity based on our investment strategy and management’s assessment of our intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity.

As of March 31, 2016, our investments in non-agency RMBS and CMBS, other ABS and other securities accounted for $36 million, or 28%, of total  71Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents gross unrealized losses on securities available for sale. As of March 31, 2016, the carrying value of approximately 30 securities classified as held to maturity exceeded their fair value by $7 million. Gross unrealized losses on our investment securities have decreased since December 31, 2015. The unrealized losses related to investment securities for which we have not recognized credit impairment were primarily attributable to changes in market interest rates. As discussed in more detail below, we conduct periodic reviews of all investment securities with unrealized losses to assess whether impairment is other-than-temporary. Maturities and Yields of Investment SecuritiesThe following tables summarize the remaining scheduled contractual maturities, assuming no prepayments, of our investment securities as of March 31, 2016.Table 3.5: Contractual Maturities of Securities Available for Sale March 31, 2016 (Dollars in millions) Amortized Cost Fair ValueDue in 1 year or less $505 $505Due after 1 year through 5 years 5,545 5,584Due after 5 years through 10 years 2,194 2,234Due after 10 years(1) 31,295 31,769Total $39,539 $40,092__________(1) Investments with no stated maturities, which consist of equity securities, are included with contractual maturities due after 10 years.Table 3.6: Contractual Maturities of Securities Held to Maturity  March 31, 2016 (Dollars in millions) Carrying Value Fair ValueDue after 1 year through 5 years $199 $200Due after 5 years through 10 years 1,251 1,355Due after 10 years 23,630 24,899Total $25,080 $26,454Because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay certain obligations, the expected maturities of our securities are likely to differ from the scheduled contractual maturities presented above.  72Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents The table below summarizes, by major security type, the expected maturities and weighted-average yields of our investment securities as of March 31, 2016.

Our OTTI assessment is based on a discounted cash flow analysis which requires careful use of judgments and assumptions. A number of qualitative and quantitative criteria may be considered in our assessment as applicable, including the size and the nature of the portfolio; historical and projected performance such as prepayment, default and loss severity for the RMBS portfolio; recent credit events specific to the issuer and/or industry to which the issuer belongs; the payment structure of the security; external credit ratings of the issuer and any failure or delay of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments; the value of underlying collateral; our intent and ability to hold the security; and current and projected market and macro-economic conditions.If we intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, the entire difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and its fair value is recognized in earnings. As of March 31, 2016, for any securities with unrealized losses recorded in AOCI, we do not intend to sell nor believe that we will be required to sell these securities prior to recovery of their amortized cost.For those securities that we do not intend to sell nor expect to be required to sell, an analysis is performed to determine if any of the impairment is due to credit-related factors or whether it is due to other factors, such as interest rates. Credit-related impairment  73Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents is recognized in earnings, with the remaining unrealized non-credit-related impairment recorded in AOCI. We determine the credit component based on the difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected cash flows, discounted based on the effective yield.The table below presents a rollforward of the credit-related OTTI recognized in earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 on investment securities for which we had no intent to sell.Table 3.8: Credit Impairment Rollforward  Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015Credit loss component, beginning of period $199 $175Additions:    Initial credit impairment 0 5Subsequent credit impairment 6 10Total additions 6 15Reductions due to payoffs, disposals, transfers and other (1) 0Credit loss component, end of period $204 $190Realized Gains and Losses on Securities and OTTI Recognized in EarningsThe following table presents the gross realized gains and losses on the sale and redemption of securities available for sale, and the OTTI losses recognized in earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.

We pledged securities available for sale with a fair value of $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We also pledged securities held to maturity with a carrying value of $8.5 billion and $8.7 billion as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Of the total securities pledged as collateral, we have encumbered $10.6 billion as of both March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, primarily related to Public Fund deposits.

Credit card loans consist of domestic and international credit card loans. Consumer banking loans consist of auto, home and retail banking loans. Commercial banking loans consist of commercial and multifamily real estate, commercial and industrial, and small-ticket commercial real estate loans.Our portfolio of loans held for investment also includes certain of our consumer and commercial loans acquired through business combinations that were recorded at fair value at acquisition and subsequently accounted for based on cash flows expected to be collected, which were referred to as “purchased credit-impaired loans” or “PCI loans.” See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional information on the accounting guidance for these loans.Credit QualityWe closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to manage and evaluate our exposure to credit risk. Trends in delinquency rates are an indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk within our loan portfolio. The level of nonperforming loans represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. Accordingly, key metrics we track and use in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming loan rates, as well as net charge-off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger balance commercial loans. The table below presents the composition and an aging analysis of our loans held for investment portfolio, which includes loans underlying our consolidated securitization trusts, as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The delinquency aging includes all past due loans, both performing and nonperforming.Table 4.1: Loan Portfolio Composition and Aging Analysis  March 31, 2016(Dollars in millions) Current 30-59Days 60-89Days > 90Days TotalDelinquentLoans PCILoans TotalLoansCredit Card:              Domestic credit card(1) $81,946 $757 $555 $1,303 $2,615 $0 $84,561International credit card 7,832 116 72 118 306 0 8,138Total credit card 89,778 873 627 1,421 2,921 0 92,699Consumer Banking:              Auto 40,386 1,576 619 133 2,328 0 42,714Home loan 6,521 37 15 166 218 17,604 24,343Retail banking 3,459 19 7 18 44 31 3,534Total consumer banking 50,366 1,632 641 317 2,590 17,635 70,591Commercial Banking:              Commercial and multifamily real estate 25,497 19 2 9 30 32 25,559Commercial and industrial 36,744 52 98 307 457 901 38,102Total commercial lending 62,241 71 100 316 487 933 63,661Small-ticket commercial real estate 572 3 2 3 8 0 580Total commercial banking 62,813 74 102 319 495 933 64,241Other loans 73 2 1 6 9 0 82Total loans(2) $203,030 $2,581$1,371$2,063 $6,015 $18,568 $227,613% of Total loans 89.20% 1.13% 0.60% 0.91% 2.64% 8.16% 100.00%   76Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents   December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions) Current 30-59Days 60-89Days > 90Days TotalDelinquentLoans PCI Loans TotalLoansCredit Card:              Domestic credit card(1) $84,954 $906 $658 $1,421 $2,985 $0 $87,939International credit card 7,903 110 67 106 283 0 8,186Total credit card 92,857 1,016 725 1,527 3,268 0 96,125Consumer Banking:              Auto 38,549 1,901 880 219 3,000 0 41,549Home loan 6,465 41 18 176 235 18,527 25,227Retail banking 3,514 21 8 20 49 33 3,596Total consumer banking 48,528 1,963 906 415 3,284 18,560 70,372Commercial Banking:              Commercial and multifamily real estate 25,449 34 0 4 38 31 25,518Commercial and industrial 35,920 51 34 203 288 927 37,135Total commercial lending 61,369 85 34 207 326 958 62,653Small-ticket commercial real estate 607 3 1 2 6 0 613Total commercial banking 61,976 88 35 209 332 958 63,266Other loans 77 2 2 7 11 0 88Total loans(2) $203,438 $3,069 $1,668 $2,158 $6,895 $19,518 $229,851% of Total loans 88.51% 1.33% 0.73% 0.94% 3.00% 8.49% 100.00%__________(1) Includes installment loans of $13 million and $16 million as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.(2) Loans are presented net of unearned income, unamortized premiums and discounts, and unamortized deferred fees and costs totaling $948 million and $989 million as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.We pledge loan collateral at the FHLB to secure borrowing capacity.

PCI loans are excluded from loans reported as 90 days and accruing interest as well as nonperforming loans. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional information on our policies for nonperforming loans.Credit CardOur credit card loan portfolio is highly diversified across millions of accounts and numerous geographies without significant individual exposure. We therefore generally manage credit risk on a portfolio basis. The risk in our credit card loan portfolio correlates to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates and home values, as well as customer liquidity, all of which can have a material effect on credit performance. The primary factors we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our credit card portfolio are delinquency and charge-off trends, including an analysis of the migration of loans between delinquency categories over time.The table below displays the geographic profile of our credit card loan portfolio as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. We also present net charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.Table 4.3: Credit Card: Risk Profile by Geographic Region  March 31, 2016 December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions) Amount % ofTotal(1) Amount % ofTotal(1)Domestic credit card:        California $9,752 10.5% $10,029 10.5%Texas 6,182 6.7 6,344 6.6New York 6,163 6.6 6,446 6.7Florida 5,574 6.0 5,712 5.9Illinois 3,922 4.2 4,121 4.3Pennsylvania 3,575 3.9 3,764 3.9Ohio 3,180 3.4 3,371 3.5New Jersey 3,061 3.3 3,210 3.3Michigan 2,762 3.0 2,922 3.0Other 40,390 43.6 42,020 43.8Total domestic credit card 84,561 91.2 87,939 91.5International credit card:        Canada 4,963 5.4 4,889 5.1United Kingdom 3,175 3.4 3,297 3.4Total international credit card 8,138 8.8 8,186 8.5Total credit card $92,699 100.0% $96,125 100.0%__________(1) Percentages by geographic region are calculated based on period-end amounts. 78Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents Table 4.4: Credit Card: Net Charge-Offs  Three Months Ended March 31,  2016 2015(Dollars in millions) Amount Rate Amount RateNet charge-offs:(1)        Domestic credit card $887 4.16% $664 3.55%International credit card 63 3.24 55 2.80Total credit card $950 4.09 $719 3.48__________(1) Net charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance that we determine to be uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. The net charge-off rate is calculated for each loan category by dividing annualized net charge-offs by average loans held for investment for the period. Net charge-offs and the net charge-off rate are impacted periodically by fluctuations in recoveries, including debt sales.Consumer BankingOur consumer banking loan portfolio consists of auto, home and retail banking loans. Similar to our credit card loan portfolio, the risk in our consumer banking loan portfolio correlates to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates, gross domestic product (“GDP”) and home values, as well as customer liquidity, all of which can have a material effect on credit performance. Delinquency, nonperforming loans and charge-off trends are key factors we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our consumer banking loan portfolio. The table below displays the geographic profile of our consumer banking loan portfolio, including PCI loans. We also present the delinquency and nonperforming loan rates of our consumer banking loan portfolio as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, as well as net charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.Table 4.5: Consumer Banking: Risk Profile by Geographic Region   March 31, 2016 December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions) Amount % of Total(1) Amount % ofTotal(1)Auto:        Texas $5,597 7.9% $5,463 7.8%California 4,812 6.8 4,611 6.5Florida 3,485 4.9 3,315 4.7Georgia 2,291 3.3 2,245 3.2Louisiana 1,931 2.7 1,882 2.7Illinois 1,891 2.7 1,859 2.6Ohio 1,778 2.5 1,738 2.5Other 20,929 29.7 20,436 29.0Total auto 42,714 60.5 41,549 59.0Home loan:        California 5,652 8.0 5,884 8.4New York 2,119 3.0 2,171 3.1Maryland 1,517 2.1 1,539 2.2Illinois 1,433 2.0 1,490 2.1Virginia 1,320 1.9 1,354 1.9New Jersey 1,246 1.8 1,293 1.8Florida 1,090 1.6 1,146 1.6Other 9,966 14.1 10,350 14.8Total home loan 24,343 34.5 25,227 35.9 79Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents   March 31, 2016 December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions) Amount % of Total(1) Amount % ofTotal(1)Retail banking:        Louisiana $1,054 1.5% $1,071 1.5%New York 919 1.3 921 1.3Texas 757 1.1 757 1.1New Jersey 247 0.3 259 0.4Maryland 187 0.3 180 0.3Virginia 150 0.2 151 0.2Other 220 0.3 257 0.3Total retail banking 3,534 5.0 3,596 5.1Total consumer banking $70,591 100.0% $70,372 100.0%__________(1) Percentages by geographic region are calculated based on period-end amounts.Table 4.6: Consumer Banking: Net Charge-Offs and Nonperforming Loans  Three Months Ended March 31,  2016 2015(Dollars in millions) Amount Rate(1) Amount Rate(1)Net charge-offs:        Auto $168 1.60% $148 1.55%Home loan(2) 3 0.05 2 0.03Retail banking 12 1.36 9 0.96Total consumer banking(2) $183 1.04 $159 0.89  March 31, 2016 December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions) Amount Rate(3) Amount Rate(3)Nonperforming loans:        Auto $133 0.31% $219 0.53%Home loan(4) 307 1.26 311 1.23Retail banking 30 0.83 28 0.77Total consumer banking(4) $470 0.66 $558 0.79__________(1) Calculated for each loan category by dividing annualized net charge-offs by average loans held for investment for the period.

In evaluating the credit quality and risk of our home loan portfolio, we continually monitor a variety of mortgage loan characteristics that may affect the default experience on this loan portfolio, such as vintage, geographic concentrations, lien priority and product type. Certain loan concentrations have experienced higher delinquency rates as a result of the significant decline in home prices after the peak in 2006 and subsequent rise in unemployment. These loan concentrations include loans originated between 2006 and 2008 in an environment of decreasing home sales, broadly declining home prices and more relaxed underwriting standards. The following table presents the distribution of our home loan portfolio as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, based on selected key risk characteristics.Table 4.7: Home Loan: Risk Profile by Vintage, Geography, Lien Priority and Interest Rate Type  March 31, 2016  Loans PCI Loans Total Home Loans(Dollars in millions) Amount % ofTotal(1) Amount % ofTotal(1) Amount % ofTotal(1)Origination year:(2)            < = 2007 $2,449 10.1% $8,613 35.3% $11,062 45.4%2008 151 0.6 2,743 11.3 2,894 11.92009 94 0.4 1,405 5.8 1,499 6.22010 95 0.4 2,054 8.4 2,149 8.82011 168 0.7 2,291 9.4 2,459 10.12012 1,219 5.0 362 1.5 1,581 6.52013 538 2.2 70 0.3 608 2.52014 663 2.7 30 0.1 693 2.82015 1,121 4.6 32 0.2 1,153 4.82016 241 1.0 4 0.0 245 1.0Total $6,739 27.7% $17,604 72.3% $24,343 100.0%Geographic concentration:(3)            California $876 3.6% $4,776 19.6% $5,652 23.2%New York 1,288 5.3 831 3.4 2,119 8.7Maryland 530 2.2 987 4.0 1,517 6.2Illinois 90 0.4 1,343 5.5 1,433 5.9Virginia 439 1.8 881 3.6 1,320 5.4New Jersey 354 1.4 892 3.7 1,246 5.1Florida 153 0.6 937 3.9 1,090 4.5Louisiana 1,043 4.3 26 0.1 1,069 4.4Arizona 83 0.3 958 4.0 1,041 4.3Washington 115 0.5 753 3.1 868 3.6Other 1,768 7.3 5,220 21.4 6,988 28.7Total $6,739 27.7% $17,604 72.3% $24,343 100.0%Lien type:            1st lien $5,747 23.6% $17,294 71.1% $23,041 94.7%2nd lien 992 4.1 310 1.2 1,302 5.3Total $6,739 27.7% $17,604 72.3% $24,343 100.0%Interest rate type:            Fixed rate $2,835 11.7% $2,153 8.8% $4,988 20.5%Adjustable rate 3,904 16.0 15,451 63.5 19,355 79.5Total $6,739 27.7% $17,604 72.3% $24,343 100.0% 81Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents   December 31, 2015  Loans PCI Loans Total Home Loans(Dollars in millions) Amount % ofTotal(1) Amount % ofTotal(1) Amount % ofTotal(1)Origination year:(2)  < = 2007 $2,559 10.1% $8,956 35.5% $11,515 45.6%2008 157 0.6 2,866 11.4 3,023 12.02009 97 0.4 1,498 5.9 1,595 6.32010 97 0.4 2,208 8.8 2,305 9.22011 176 0.7 2,476 9.8 2,652 10.52012 1,276 5.1 389 1.5 1,665 6.62013 557 2.2 71 0.3 628 2.52014 680 2.7 31 0.1 711 2.82015 1,101 4.4 32 0.1 1,133 4.5Total $6,700 26.6% $18,527 73.4% $25,227 100.0%Geographic concentration:(3)            California $871 3.5% $5,013 19.9% $5,884 23.4%New York 1,295 5.1 876 3.5 2,171 8.6Maryland 511 2.0 1,028 4.1 1,539 6.1Illinois 89 0.4 1,401 5.5 1,490 5.9Virginia 428 1.7 926 3.7 1,354 5.4New Jersey 353 1.4 940 3.7 1,293 5.1Florida 157 0.6 989 3.9 1,146 4.5Louisiana 1,069 4.2 27 0.1 1,096 4.3Arizona 81 0.4 995 3.9 1,076 4.3Washington 113 0.4 806 3.2 919 3.6Other 1,733 6.9 5,526 21.9 7,259 28.8Total $6,700 26.6% $18,527 73.4% $25,227 100.0%Lien type:            1st lien $5,705 22.6% $18,207 72.2% $23,912 94.8%2nd lien 995 4.0 320 1.2 1,315 5.2Total $6,700 26.6% $18,527 73.4% $25,227 100.0%Interest rate type:            Fixed rate $2,751 10.9% $2,264 9.0% $5,015 19.9%Adjustable rate 3,949 15.7 16,263 64.4 20,212 80.1Total $6,700 26.6% $18,527 73.4% $25,227 100.0%__________(1) Percentages within each risk category are calculated based on period-end amounts.(2) The PCI loans balances with an origination date in the years subsequent to 2012 are related to refinancing of previously acquired home loans.(3) States listed represents those which have the highest individual concentration of home loans.Our recorded investment in home loans that are in process of foreclosure was $451 million as of March 31, 2016.

We assign internal risk ratings to loans based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt. In determining the risk rating of a particular loan, some of the factors considered are the borrower’s current financial condition, historical and projected future credit performance, prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors, the estimated realizable value of any collateral and current economic trends. The scale based on our internal risk rating system is as follows:•Noncriticized: Loans that have not been designated as criticized, frequently referred to as “pass” loans.•Criticized performing: Loans in which the financial condition of the obligor is stressed, affecting earnings, cash flows or collateral values. The borrower currently has adequate capacity to meet near-term obligations; however, the stress, left unabated, may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects at some future date.•Criticized nonperforming: Loans that are not adequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as criticized nonperforming have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, which jeopardize the full repayment of the debt. These loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain a credit loss if the deficiencies are not corrected and are generally placed on nonaccrual status.We use our internal risk rating system for regulatory reporting, determining the frequency of credit exposure reviews, and evaluating and determining the allowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans. Loans of $1 million or more that are designated as criticized performing and criticized nonperforming are reviewed quarterly by management to determine if they are appropriately classified/rated and whether any impairment exists. Noncriticized loans greater than $1 million are specifically reviewed, at least annually, to determine the appropriate risk rating. In addition, we evaluate the risk rating during the renewal process of any loan or if a loan becomes past due.The following table presents the geographic distribution and internal risk ratings of our commercial loan portfolio as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Table 4.8: Commercial Banking: Risk Profile by Geographic Region and Internal Risk Rating  March 31, 2016(Dollars in millions) CommercialandMultifamilyReal Estate % ofTotal(1) CommercialandIndustrial % ofTotal(1) Small-ticketCommercialReal Estate % ofTotal(1)  TotalCommercial Banking % ofTotal(1) Geographic concentration:(2)                Northeast $15,312 59.8% $8,724 22.9% $358 61.6% $24,394 38.0%Mid-Atlantic 3,032 11.9 3,255 8.5 23 4.0 6,310 9.8South 4,054 15.9 15,303 40.2 37 6.4 19,394 30.2Other 3,161 12.4 10,820 28.4 162 28.0 14,143 22.0Total $25,559 100.0% $38,102 100.0% $580 100.0% $64,241 100.0%Internal risk rating:(3)                Noncriticized $25,219 98.7% $33,872 88.9% $572 98.5% $59,663 92.9%Criticized performing 278 1.1 2,315 6.0 2 0.4 2,595 4.0Criticized nonperforming 30 0.1 1,014 2.7 6 1.1 1,050 1.6PCI loans(4) 32 0.1 901 2.4 0 0.0 933 1.5Total $25,559 100.0% $38,102 100.0% $580 100.0% $64,241 100.0% 83Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents   December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions) CommercialandMultifamilyReal Estate % ofTotal(1) CommercialandIndustrial % ofTotal(1) Small-ticketCommercialReal Estate % ofTotal(1)  TotalCommercial Banking % ofTotal(1) Geographic concentration:(2)                Northeast $15,949 62.5% $8,074 21.8% $376 61.3% $24,399 38.6%Mid-Atlantic 2,797 11.0 3,010 8.1 25 4.1 5,832 9.2South 4,070 15.9 15,240 41.0 40 6.5 19,350 30.6Other 2,702 10.6 10,811 29.1 172 28.1 13,685 21.6Total $25,518 100.0% $37,135 100.0% $613 100.0% $63,266 100.0%Internal risk rating:(3)                Noncriticized $25,130 98.5% $34,008 91.6% $605 98.7% $59,743 94.4%Criticized performing 350 1.4 1,662 4.5 3 0.5 2,015 3.2Criticized nonperforming 7 0.0 538 1.4 5 0.8 550 0.9PCI loans(4) 31 0.1 927 2.5 0 0.0 958 1.5Total $25,518 100.0% $37,135 100.0% $613 100.0% $63,266 100.0%__________(1) Percentages calculated based on total loans held for investment in each respective loan category using period-end amounts.(2) Geographic concentration is generally determined by the location of the borrower’s business or the location of the collateral associated with the loan.

South consists of AL, AR, FL, GA, KY, LA, MO, MS, NC, SC, TN and TX.(3) Criticized exposures correspond to the “Special Mention,” “Substandard” and “Doubtful” asset categories defined by banking regulatory authorities.(4) We evaluate PCI loans based on their actual risk ratings. Were these PCI loans to be classified based on their risk ratings, $204 million and $128 million would be classified as Noncriticized, $694 million and $793 million as Criticized performing, and $35 million and $37 million as Criticized nonperforming as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

Impaired loans without an allowance generally represent loans that have been charged down to the fair value of the underlying collateral for which we believe no additional losses have been incurred, or where the fair value of the underlying collateral meets or exceeds the loan’s amortized cost.(2) The average recorded investment of credit card loans includes finance charges and fees.(3) Although auto loans from loan recovery inventory are not reported in our loans held for investment, they are included as impaired loans above since they are reported as TDRs. 85Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents The total recorded investment of loans modified in TDRs represents $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion of the impaired loans presented above as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Consumer TDRs classified as performing totaled $1.0 billion as of both March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Commercial TDRs classified as performing totaled $305 million and $334 million as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.As part of our loan modification programs to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, we may provide multiple concessions to minimize our economic loss and improve long-term loan performance and collectability.

As not every modification type is included in the table above, the total % of TDR activity may not add up to 100%. (3) Represents percentage of loans modified and accounted for as TDRs during the period that were granted a reduced interest rate.(4) Due to multiple concessions granted to some troubled borrowers, percentages may total more than 100% for certain loan types.(5) Represents weighted average interest rate reduction for those loans that received an interest rate concession.(6) Represents percentage of loans modified and accounted for as TDRs during the period that were granted a maturity date extension.(7) Represents weighted average change in maturity date for those loans that received a maturity date extension.(8) Represents percentage of loans modified and accounted for as TDRs during the period that were granted forgiveness or forbearance of a portion of their balance.(9) Total amount represents the gross balance forgiven. For loans modified in bankruptcy, the gross balance reduction represents collateral value write-downs associated with the discharge of the borrower’s obligations.TDR—Subsequent Defaults of Completed TDR ModificationsThe following table presents the type, number and recorded investment amount of loans modified in TDRs that experienced a default during the period and had completed a modification event in the twelve months prior to the default. A default occurs if the loan is either 90 days or more delinquent, has been charged off as of the end of the period presented or has been reclassified from accrual to nonaccrual status. 87Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents Table 4.11: TDR—Subsequent Defaults  Three Months Ended March 31,  2016 2015(Dollars in millions) Number ofContracts Amount Number ofContracts AmountCredit Card:        Domestic credit card 10,594 $18 9,667 $16International credit card(1) 8,813 20 8,548 20Total credit card 19,407 38 18,215 36Consumer Banking:        Auto 1,852 21 1,747 20Home loan 10 1 5 0Retail banking 15 2 10 1Total consumer banking 1,877 24 1,762 21Commercial Banking:        Commercial and multifamily real estate 0 0 0 0Commercial and industrial 17 23 0 0Total commercial lending 17 23 0 0Small-ticket commercial real estate 0 0 0 0Total commercial banking 17 23 0 0Total 21,301 $85 19,977 $57__________(1) In the U.K., regulators require the acceptance of payment plan proposals in which the modified payments may be less than the contractual minimum amount. As a result, loans entering long-term TDR payment programs in the U.K. typically continue to age and ultimately charge off even when fully in compliance with the TDR program terms.         PCI Loans Outstanding Balance and Carrying Value of PCI LoansThe table below presents the outstanding balance and the carrying value of PCI loans as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The table also displays loans which would have otherwise been considered impaired at acquisition based on our applicable accounting policies. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2015 Form 10-K for information related to our accounting policies for impaired loans.Table 4.12: PCI Loans  March 31, 2016 December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions) Total ImpairedLoans Non-ImpairedLoans Total ImpairedLoans Non-ImpairedLoansOutstanding balance $20,179 $3,704 $16,475 $21,151 $3,840 $17,311Carrying value(1) 18,580 2,537 16,043 19,516 2,629 16,887__________(1) Includes $35 million and $37 million of allowance for loan and lease losses for these loans as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

Unused credit card lines available to our customers totaled $311.1 billion and $308.3 billion as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. While these amounts represented the total available unused credit card lines, we have not experienced and do not anticipate that all of our customers will access their entire available line at any given point in time.In addition to available unused credit card lines, we enter into commitments to extend credit that are legally binding conditional agreements having fixed expirations or termination dates and specified interest rates and purposes. These commitments generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards. Collateral requirements and loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios are the same as those for funded transactions and are established based on management’s credit assessment of the customer. These commitments may expire without being drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future funding requirements. The outstanding unfunded commitments to extend credit, other than credit card lines, were approximately $26.4 billion and $27.9 billion, which included $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion of advised lines of credit as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Advised lines of credit are not considered legally binding commitments as funding is subject to our satisfactory evaluation of the customer at the time credit is requested.   89Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents NOTE 5—ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES AND RESERVE FOR UNFUNDED LENDING COMMITMENTSOur allowance for loan and lease losses represents management’s best estimate of incurred loan and lease losses inherent in our loans held for investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date. In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments, such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments. The provision for losses on unfunded lending commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income and the related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of our 2015 Form 10-K for further discussion on the methodology and policy for determining our allowance for loan and lease losses for each of our loan portfolio segments, as well as information on our reserve for unfunded lending commitments.Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments ActivityThe table below summarizes changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments by portfolio segment for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.Table 5.1: Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments (Dollars in millions) CreditCard ConsumerBanking Commercial Banking Other(1) TotalAllowance for loan and lease losses:          Balance as of December 31, 2015 $3,654 $868 $604 $4 $5,130Provision (benefit) for loan and lease losses 1,071 229 171 (2) 1,469Charge-offs (1,222) (291) (48) (1) (1,562)Recoveries 272 108 2 2 384Net charge-offs (950) (183) (46) 1 (1,178)Other changes(2) 10 0 (15) 0 (5)Balance as of March 31, 2016 3,785 914 714 3 5,416Reserve for unfunded lending commitments:          Balance as of December 31, 2015 0 7 161 0 168Provision for losses on unfunded lending commitments 0 1 57 0 58Balance as of March 31, 2016 0 8 218 0 226Combined allowance and reserve as of March 31, 2016 $3,785 $922 $932 $3 $5,642(Dollars in millions) Credit Card ConsumerBanking Commercial Banking Other(1) TotalAllowance for loan and lease losses:          Balance as of December 31, 2014 $3,204 $779 $395 $5 $4,383Provision (benefit) for loan and lease losses 669 206 52 0 927Charge-offs (1,022) (250) (9) (3) (1,284)Recoveries 303 91 6 3 403Net charge-offs (719) (159) (3) 0 (881)Other changes(2) (24) 0 0 0 (24)Balance as of March 31, 2015 3,130 826 444 5 4,405Reserve for unfunded lending commitments:          Balance as of December 31, 2014 0 7 106 0 113Provision for losses on unfunded lending commitments 0 0 8 0 8Balance as of March 31, 2015 0 7 114 0 121Combined allowance and reserve as of March 31, 2015 $3,130 $833 $558 $5 $4,526__________(1)  Primarily consists of the legacy loan portfolio of our discontinued GreenPoint mortgage operations.(2)  Represents foreign currency translation adjustments and the net impact of loan transfers and sales. 90Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents                      Components of Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses by Impairment MethodologyThe table below presents the components of our allowance for loan and lease losses by portfolio segment and impairment methodology with the recorded investment of the related loans as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Table 5.2: Components of Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses by Impairment Methodology  March 31, 2016(Dollars in millions) CreditCard Consumer Banking Commercial Banking Other TotalAllowance for loan and lease losses:          Collectively evaluated(1) $3,572 $829 $520 $3 $4,924Asset-specific(2) 213 51 193 0 457PCI loans(3) 0 34 1 0 35Total allowance for loan and lease losses $3,785 $914 $714 $3 $5,416Loans held for investment:          Collectively evaluated(1) $92,041 $52,247 $61,954 $82 $206,324Asset-specific(2) 658 709 1,354 0 2,721PCI loans(3) 0 17,635 933 0 18,568Total loans held for investment $92,699 $70,591 $64,241 $82 $227,613Allowance as a percentage of period-end loans held for investment 4.08% 1.29% 1.11% 4.15% 2.38%  December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions) CreditCard Consumer Banking Commercial Banking Other TotalAllowance for loan and lease losses:          Collectively evaluated(1) $3,445 $778 $517 $4 $4,744Asset-specific(2) 209 54 86 0 349PCI loans(3) 0 36 1 0 37Total allowance for loan and lease losses $3,654 $868 $604 $4 $5,130Loans held for investment:          Collectively evaluated(1) $95,459 $51,113 $61,424 $88 $208,084Asset-specific(2) 666 699 884 0 2,249PCI loans(3) 0 18,560 958 0 19,518Total loans held for investment $96,125 $70,372 $63,266 $88 $229,851Allowance as a percentage of period-end loans held for investment 3.80% 1.23% 0.95% 4.94% 2.23%__________(1) The component of the allowance for loan and lease losses for credit card and other consumer loans that we collectively evaluate for impairment is based on a statistical calculation supplemented by management judgment and interpretation. The component of the allowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans that we collectively evaluate for impairment is based on historical loss experience for loans with similar characteristics and consideration of credit quality supplemented by management judgment and interpretation.(2) The asset-specific component of the allowance for loan and lease losses for smaller-balance impaired loans is calculated on a pool basis using historical loss experience for the respective class of assets. The asset-specific component of the allowance for loan and lease losses for larger-balance commercial loans is individually calculated for each loan.(3) The PCI loans component of the allowance for loan and lease losses is accounted for based on expected cash flows. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2015 Form 10-K for details on these loans. 91Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents We have certain credit card partnership arrangements in which our partner agrees to share in a portion of the credit losses associated with the partnership. The loss sharing amounts due from these partners result in reductions to reported net charge-offs and provision for credit losses.

Our primary involvement with VIEs has been related to our securitization transactions in which we transferred assets from our balance sheet to securitization trusts. We have primarily securitized credit card loans and home loans, which have provided a source of funding for us and enabled us to transfer a certain portion of the economic risk of the loans or debt securities to third parties.The entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is referred to as the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE. The majority of the VIEs in which we are involved have been consolidated in our financial statements.Summary of Consolidated and Unconsolidated VIEsThe table below presents a summary of VIEs, aggregated based on VIEs with similar characteristics, in which we had continuing involvement or held a variable interest as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. We separately present information for consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs.For consolidated VIEs, we present the carrying amount of assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. The assets of consolidated VIEs primarily consist of cash and loans, which we report on our consolidated balance sheets under restricted cash and loans held in consolidated trusts, respectively. The assets of a particular VIE are the primary source of funds to settle its obligations. The creditors of the VIEs typically do not have recourse to the general credit of the Company. The liabilities primarily consist of debt securities issued by the VIEs, which we report under securitized debt obligations. For unconsolidated VIEs, we present the carrying amount of assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets and our maximum exposure to loss. Our maximum exposure to loss is estimated based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and we are required to meet our maximum remaining funding obligations.Table 6.1: Carrying Amount of Consolidated and Unconsolidated VIEs  March 31, 2016  Consolidated Unconsolidated(Dollars in millions) CarryingAmountof Assets CarryingAmount ofLiabilities CarryingAmountof Assets CarryingAmount ofLiabilities Maximum Exposure toLossSecuritization-Related VIEs:          Credit card loan securitizations(1) $32,869 $15,600 $0 $0 $0Home loan securitizations(2) 0 0 201 26 863Total securitization-related VIEs 32,869 15,600 201 26 863Other VIEs:          Affordable housing entities 115 0 3,804 528 3,804Entities that provide capital to low-income and rural communities 687 126 71 0 71Other 0 0 116 0 116Total other VIEs 802 126 3,991 528 3,991Total VIEs $33,671 $15,726 $4,192 $554 $4,854 93Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents   December 31, 2015  Consolidated Unconsolidated(Dollars in millions) CarryingAmountof Assets CarryingAmount ofLiabilities CarryingAmountof Assets CarryingAmount ofLiabilities MaximumExposure toLossSecuritization-Related VIEs:          Credit card loan securitizations(1) $34,800 $16,925 $0 $0 $0Home loan securitizations(2) 0 0 211 27 873Total securitization-related VIEs 34,800 16,925 211 27 873Other VIEs:          Affordable housing entities 0 0 3,852 555 3,852Entities that provide capital to low-income and rural communities 352 101 0 0 0Other 0 0 57 0 57Total other VIEs 352 101 3,909 555 3,909Total VIEs $35,152 $17,026 $4,120 $582 $4,782__________(1) Represents the gross amount of assets and liabilities owned by the VIE, which includes the seller’s interest and repurchased notes held by other related parties.(2) The carrying amount of assets of unconsolidated securitization-related VIEs consists of retained interests associated with the securitization of option-adjustable rate mortgage (“option-ARM”) loans and letters of credit related to manufactured housing securitizations. These are reported on our consolidated balance sheets within other assets. The carrying amount of liabilities of unconsolidated securitization-related VIEs is comprised of obligations on certain swap agreements associated with the securitization of manufactured housing loans and other obligations. These are reported on our consolidated balance sheets within other liabilities.Securitization-Related VIEsIn a securitization transaction, assets from our balance sheet are transferred to a trust we establish, which typically meets the definition of a VIE. Our continuing involvement in the majority of our securitization transactions consists primarily of holding certain retained interests and acting as the primary servicer on certain transactions. We also may have exposure associated with contractual obligations to repurchase previously transferred loans due to breaches of representations and warranties. See “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others” for information related to reserves we have established for our mortgage representation and warranty exposure. 94Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents The table below presents the securitization-related VIEs in which we had continuing involvement as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Table 6.2: Continuing Involvement in Securitization-Related VIEs    Mortgage (Dollars in millions) CreditCard Option-ARM GreenPointHELOCs GreenPointManufacturedHousing March 31, 2016:         Securities held by third-party investors $14,913 $1,692 $69 $765 Receivables in the trust 31,908 1,749 63 771 Cash balance of spread or reserve accounts 0 8 N/A 136 Retained interests Yes Yes Yes Yes Servicing retained Yes Yes(1) No No(2) Amortization event(3) No No No No December 31, 2015:         Securities held by third-party investors $16,166 $1,754 $74 $789 Receivables in the trust 33,783 1,814 68 794 Cash balance of spread or reserve accounts 0 8 N/A 134 Retained interests Yes Yes Yes Yes Servicing retained Yes Yes(1) No No(2) Amortization event(3) No No No No __________(1) We continue to service only certain option-ARM securitizations.(2) The core servicing activities for the manufactured housing securitizations are completed by a third party.(3) Amortization events vary according to each specific trust agreement but generally are triggered by declines in performance or credit metrics of the underlying assets, such as net charge-off rates or delinquency rates, beyond certain predetermined thresholds. Generally, the occurrence of an amortization event changes the sequencing and amount of trust-related cash flows to the benefit of more senior interest holders.Credit Card Loan SecuritizationsWe hold certain retained interests in our credit card loan securitizations and continue to service the receivables in these trusts. As of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we were deemed to be the primary beneficiary, and accordingly, all of these trusts have been consolidated in our financial statements. Mortgage SecuritizationsOption-ARM LoansWe had previously securitized option-ARM loans by transferring these loans to securitization trusts that had issued mortgage-backed securities to investors. The outstanding balance of debt securities held by third-party investors related to these mortgage loan securitization trusts was $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.We continue to service a portion of the remaining mortgage loans in these securitizations. We also retain rights to future cash flows arising from these securitizations, the most significant being certificated interest-only bonds issued by the trusts. We generally estimate the fair value of these retained interests based on the estimated present value of expected future cash flows, using our best estimates of the key assumptions which include credit losses, prepayment speeds and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. For the mortgage loans that we continue to service, we do not consolidate the related trusts because we do not have the right to receive benefits nor the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts. For the remaining trusts, for which we no longer service the underlying mortgage loans, we do not consolidate these entities since we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts.In connection with the securitization of certain option-ARM loans, a third party is obligated to advance a portion of any “negative amortization” resulting from monthly payments that are less than the interest accrued for that payment period. We have an agreement  95Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents in place with the third party that mirrors this advance requirement. The amount advanced is tracked through mortgage-backed securities retained as part of the securitization transaction. As advances occur, we record an asset in the form of negative amortization bonds, which are held at fair value in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Our maximum exposure is affected by rate caps and monthly payment change caps, but the funding obligation cannot exceed the difference between the original loan balance multiplied by a preset negative amortization cap and the current unpaid principal balance. We have also entered into certain derivative contracts related to the securitization activities. These are classified as free-standing derivatives, with fair value adjustments recorded in non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income. See “Note 9—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” for further details on these derivatives.GreenPoint Mortgage Home Equity Lines of Credit (“HELOCs”)Our discontinued wholesale mortgage banking unit, GreenPoint, previously sold HELOCs in whole loan sales and subsequently acquired residual interests in certain trusts which securitized some of those loans. We do not consolidate these trusts because we either lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts or because we do not have the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts. As the residual interest holder, GreenPoint is required to fund advances on the HELOCs when certain performance triggers are met due to deterioration in asset performance. On behalf of GreenPoint, we have funded cumulative advances of $30 million as of both March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. These advances are generally expensed as funded due to the low likelihood of recovery. We also have unfunded commitments of $6 million related to those interests for our non-consolidated VIEs as of both March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.GreenPoint Credit Manufactured HousingWe retain the primary obligation for certain provisions of corporate guarantees, recourse sales and clean-up calls related to the discontinued manufactured housing operations of GreenPoint Credit, LLC, which was a subsidiary of GreenPoint and was sold to a third party in 2004. Although we are the primary obligor, recourse obligations related to aforementioned whole loan sales, commitments to exercise mandatory clean-up calls on certain securitization transactions and servicing were transferred to a third party in the sale transaction. We do not consolidate the trusts used for the securitization of manufactured housing loans because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts since we no longer service the loans.We were required to fund letters of credit in 2004 to cover losses and are obligated to fund future amounts under swap agreements for certain transactions. We have the right to receive any funds remaining in the letters of credit after the securities are released. The unpaid principal balance of manufactured housing securitization transactions where we are the residual interest holder was $771 million and $794 million as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. In the event the third-party servicer does not fulfill its obligation to exercise the clean-up calls on certain transactions, the obligation reverts to us and we would assume approximately $420 million of loans receivable upon our execution of the clean-up call with the requirement to absorb any losses on the loans receivable. We monitor the underlying assets for trends in delinquencies and related losses, and these factors are considered in assessing the adequacy of the liabilities established for these obligations and the valuations of the assets. We also have credit exposure on agreements that we entered into to absorb a portion of the risk of loss on certain manufactured housing securitizations issued by GreenPoint Credit, LLC in 2000. Our maximum credit exposure related to the agreements totaled $13 million as of both March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. These agreements are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities and our obligation under these agreements was $7 million and $8 million as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.Other VIEsAffordable Housing EntitiesAs part of our community reinvestment initiatives, we invest in private investment funds that make equity investments in multi-family affordable housing properties. We receive affordable housing tax credits for these investments. The activities of these entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt.  96Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents We account for certain of our investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method if certain criteria are met. The proportional amortization method amortizes the cost of the investment over the period in which the investor expects to receive tax credits and other tax benefits, and the resulting amortization is recognized as a component of income tax expense attributable to continuing operations. For the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized amortization of $98 million and $86 million, respectively, and tax credits of $113 million and $102 million, respectively, associated with these investments within income tax provision. The carrying value of our investments in these qualified affordable housing projects was $3.6 billion and $3.5 billion as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We are periodically required to provide additional financial or other support during the period of the investments. We had a recorded liability of $1.3 billion for these unfunded commitments as of March 31, 2016, which is expected to be paid from 2016 to 2019.For those investment funds considered to be VIEs, we are not required to consolidate them if we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of those entities. We record our interests in these unconsolidated VIEs in loans held for investment, other assets and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our interests consisted of assets of approximately $3.8 billion and $3.9 billion as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Our maximum exposure to these entities is limited to our variable interests in the entities of $3.8 billion and $3.9 billion as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit and we do not provide additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it. The total assets of the unconsolidated VIE investment funds were $11.3 billion and $11.4 billion as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.Entities that Provide Capital to Low-Income and Rural Communities We hold variable interests in entities (“Investor Entities”) that invest in community development entities (“CDEs”) that provide debt financing to businesses and non-profit entities in low-income and rural communities. Variable interests in the CDEs held by the consolidated Investor Entities are also our variable interests. The activities of the Investor Entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. The activities of the CDEs are financed solely with invested equity capital. We receive federal and state tax credits for these investments. We consolidate the VIEs in which we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and where we have the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE. We have also consolidated other investments and CDEs that are not considered to be VIEs, but where we hold a controlling financial interest. The assets of the VIEs that we consolidated, which totaled approximately $687 million and $352 million as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets in cash, loans held for investment, interest receivable and other assets. The liabilities are reflected in other liabilities. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit. We have not provided additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it.OtherOther VIEs include variable interests that we hold in a trust that has a royalty interest in certain oil and gas properties, alternative energy project companies that promote renewable energy sources and other equity method investments. We were not required to consolidate these entities because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance. Our maximum exposure to these entities is limited to the investment on our consolidated balance sheet of $116 million and $57 million as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The creditors of the other VIEs have no recourse to our general credit. We have not provided additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it. 97Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents NOTE 7—GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETSThe table below displays the components of goodwill, intangible assets and mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

Securitized and Unsecured Debt ObligationsIn addition to our deposits, which serve as our primary funding source, we use a variety of other funding sources including short-term borrowings, the issuance of senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings, and securitization transactions. In addition, we utilize FHLB advances, which are secured by certain portions of our loan and investment securities portfolios, for our funding needs. The securitized debt obligations are separately presented on our consolidated balance sheets as they represent obligations of consolidated securitization trusts, while federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings, including FHLB advances, are included in other debt on our consolidated balance sheets.Securitized Debt ObligationsOur outstanding borrowings due to securitization investors decreased to $14.9 billion as of March 31, 2016, from $16.2 billion as of December 31, 2015, primarily driven by $1.3 billion of maturities.Senior and Subordinated NotesAs of March 31, 2016, we had $21.7 billion of senior and subordinated notes outstanding, inclusive of fair value hedging adjustments of $237 million. As of December 31, 2015, we had $21.8 billion of senior and subordinated notes outstanding, inclusive of fair value hedging adjustments of $134 million. During the first quarter of 2016, $500 million of outstanding unsecured notes were retired. See “Note 9—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” for information about our fair value hedging activities.FHLB Advances and OtherIn addition to the issuance capacity under the registration statement, we also have access to funding through the FHLB system and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Our FHLB and Federal Reserve memberships require us to hold FHLB and Federal Reserve stock which totaled $1.8 billion and $2.1 billion as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.Our FHLB advances and lines of credit are secured by our investment securities, residential home loans, multifamily real estate loans, commercial real estate loans and HELOCs. The outstanding FHLB advances totaled $12.9 billion and $20.1 billion as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, substantially all of which represented long-term advances generally callable on either a one-month or a three-month basis. We did not access the Federal Reserve Discount Window for funding during 2015 or the first quarter of 2016.Composition of Deposits, Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term DebtThe table below summarizes the components of our deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Our total short-term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less. Our long-term debt consists of borrowings with an original contractual maturity of greater than one year. The amounts presented for outstanding borrowings include unamortized debt premiums and discounts, net of debt issuance costs and fair value hedge accounting adjustments. 100Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents Table 8.1: Components of Deposits, Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt(Dollars in millions) March 31, 2016 December 31, 2015Deposits:    Non-interest bearing deposits $25,182 $25,847Interest-bearing deposits 196,597 191,874Total deposits $221,779 $217,721Short-term borrowings:    Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase $917 $981Total short-term borrowings $917 $981  March 31, 2016  (Dollars in millions) MaturityDates Interest Rates Weighted-AverageInterest Rate  Outstanding Amount December 31, 2015Long-term debt:          Securitized debt obligations(1) 2016 - 2025 0.48 - 5.75% 1.48% $14,913 $16,166Senior and subordinated notes:(1)          Fixed unsecured senior debt 2016 - 2025 1.15 - 6.75 2.72 16,837 16,559Floating unsecured senior debt 2018 - 2018 1.30 - 1.77 1.50 699 1,198Total unsecured senior debt 2.67 17,536 17,757Fixed unsecured subordinated debt 2016 - 2025 3.38 - 8.80 4.70 4,200 4,080Total senior and subordinated notes 21,736 21,837Other long-term borrowings:          FHLB advances 2016 - 2025 0.39 - 6.41 0.50 12,898 20,098Capital lease obligations 2016 - 2035 3.09 - 12.86 4.17 33 33Total other long-term borrowings 12,931 20,131Total long-term debt $49,580 $58,134Total short-term borrowings and long-term debt $50,497 $59,115___________(1) Outstanding amount includes any fair value hedge accounting adjustments.

Our primary market risks stem from the impact on our earnings and economic value of equity from changes in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, changes in foreign exchange rates. We employ several techniques to manage our interest rate sensitivity which include changing the duration and re-pricing characteristics of various assets and liabilities by using interest rate derivatives. Our current policies also include the use of derivatives to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currency so we may limit our earnings and capital ratio exposures to foreign exchange risk. We execute our derivative contracts in both the over-the-counter (“OTC”) and exchange-traded derivative markets, and clear eligible derivative transactions through a central clearinghouse as required under the Dodd-Frank Act. The majority of our derivatives are interest rate swaps. In addition, we may use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks. We offer various interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity derivatives as an accommodation to our customers within our Commercial Banking business, and usually offset our exposure through derivative transactions with other counterparties.Accounting for DerivativesOur derivatives are designated as either qualifying accounting hedges or free-standing derivatives. Qualifying accounting hedges are designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges. Free-standing derivatives primarily consist of customer-accommodation derivatives and economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting. •Fair Value Hedges: We designate derivatives as fair value hedges when they are used to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, which fluctuate in value as a result of movements in interest rates. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded in earnings together with offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item and any resulting ineffectiveness. Our fair value hedges consist of interest rate swaps that are intended to modify our exposure to interest rate risk on various fixed-rate assets and liabilities. •Cash Flow Hedges: We designate derivatives as cash flow hedges when they are used to manage our exposure to variability in cash flows related to forecasted transactions. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of AOCI, to the extent that the hedge relationships are effective, and amounts are reclassified from AOCI to earnings as the forecasted transactions impact earnings. To the extent that any ineffectiveness exists in the hedge relationships, the amounts are recorded in current period earnings. Our cash flow hedges use interest rate swaps and floors that are intended to hedge the variability in interest payments or interest receipts on some of our variable-rate assets or liabilities. We have also entered into forward foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to intercompany borrowings denominated in foreign currency. •Net Investment Hedges: We use net investment hedges to manage the foreign currency exposure related to our net investments in foreign operations that have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recorded in the translation adjustment component of AOCI, offsetting the translation gain or loss from those foreign operations. We execute net investment hedges using foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the translation exposure of the net investment in our foreign operations.•Free-Standing Derivatives: We use free-standing derivatives to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of residential MSRs, mortgage loan origination and purchase commitments and other interests held. We also categorize our customer accommodation derivatives and the related offsetting contracts as free-standing derivatives. Changes in the fair value of free-standing derivatives are recorded in earnings as a component of other non-interest income. 103Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents Balance Sheet PresentationThe following table summarizes the notional and fair values of our derivative instruments on a gross basis as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, which are segregated by derivatives that are designated as accounting hedges and those that are not, and are further segregated by type of contract within those two categories. The total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and any associated cash collateral received or paid.

See Table 9.2 for further information.Offsetting of Financial Assets and Liabilities We execute the majority of our derivative transactions and repurchase agreements under master netting arrangements. Under our existing enforceable master netting arrangements, we generally have the right to offset exposure with the same counterparty. In addition, either counterparty can generally request the net settlement of all contracts through a single payment upon default on, or termination of, any one contract. The Company offsets derivative assets and liabilities for purposes of balance sheet presentation where a right of setoff exists. As of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, derivative contracts that are executed bilaterally with a counterparty in the OTC market and then novated to and cleared through a central clearinghouse are not subject to offsetting due to the uncertainty existing around an end-user’s ability to setoff derivative contracts that have been novated to a clearinghouse.  104Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents The following table presents as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the gross and net fair values of our derivative assets and liabilities and repurchase agreements, as well as the related offsetting amounts permitted under U.S. GAAP. The table also includes cash and non-cash collateral received or pledged associated with such arrangements. The collateral amounts shown are limited to the extent of the related net derivative fair values or outstanding balances, thus instances of over-collateralization are not shown.Table 9.2: Offsetting of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  GrossAmounts Gross Amounts Offset in the Balance Sheet Net Amounts as Recognized Securities Collateral Held Under Master Netting Agreements  (Dollars in millions)  FinancialInstruments Cash Collateral Received   NetExposureAs of March 31, 2016            Derivatives assets(1) $2,023 $(200) $(134) $1,689 $(5) $1,684As of December 31, 2015            Derivatives assets(1) 1,518 (86) (446) 986 (156) 830  GrossAmounts Gross Amounts Offset in the Balance Sheet Net Amounts as Recognized Securities Collateral Pledged Under Master Netting Agreements  (Dollars in millions)  FinancialInstruments Cash Collateral Pledged   NetExposureAs of March 31, 2016            Derivatives liabilities(1) $795 $(200) $(150) $445 $0 $445Repurchase agreements(2)(3) 917 0 0 917 (917) 0As of December 31, 2015            Derivatives liabilities(1) 520 (86) (57) 377 0 377Repurchase agreements(2) 969 0 0 969 (969) 0__________(1) The gross balances include derivative assets and derivative liabilities as of March 31, 2016 totaling $1.1 billion and $364 million, respectively, related to the centrally cleared derivative contracts. The comparable amounts as of December 31, 2015 totaled $429 million and $314 million, respectively. These contracts were not subject to offsetting as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.(2) As of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company only had repurchase obligations outstanding and did not have any reverse repurchase receivables.(3) Represents customer repurchase agreements that mature the next business day. As of March 31, 2016, we pledged collateral with a fair value of $936 million under these customer repurchase agreements, which were primarily agency RMBS securities. Credit Risk-Related Contingency Features and CollateralCertain of our derivatives contracts include provisions requiring that our debt maintain a credit rating of investment grade or above by each of the major credit rating agencies. In the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating below investment grade, some of our derivatives counterparties would have the right to terminate the derivative contract and close out the existing positions, or demand immediate and ongoing full overnight collateralization on derivative instruments in a net liability position. Certain of our derivatives contracts may also allow, in the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating of any kind, our derivatives counterparties to demand additional collateralization on such derivatives instruments in a net liability position. We posted $215 million and $304 million of cash collateral as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. If our debt credit rating had fallen below investment grade, we would have been required to post $60 million and $55 million of additional collateral as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The fair value of derivatives instruments with credit risk-related contingent features in a net liability position was less than $1 million as of both March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Derivatives Counterparty Credit Risk Derivatives instruments contain an element of credit risk that arises from the potential failure of a counterparty to perform according to the contractual terms of the contract. Our exposure to derivatives counterparty credit risk, at any point in time, is represented by the fair value of derivatives in a gain position, or derivatives assets position, assuming no recoveries of underlying collateral. To mitigate the risk of counterparty default, we enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements and maintain collateral  105Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents agreements with certain derivative counterparties. We generally enter into these agreements on a bilateral basis with our counterparties; however, since June 2013 we have begun to clear eligible OTC derivatives through a central clearinghouse in accordance with the requirements under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. These agreements typically provide for the right to offset exposures and require both parties to maintain collateral in the event the fair values of derivative financial instruments exceed established thresholds. We received cash collateral from derivatives counterparties totaling $502 million and $544 million as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We also received securities from derivatives counterparties with a fair value of $7 million and $172 million as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which we have the ability to re-pledge. We record counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments on our derivative assets to properly reflect the credit quality of the counterparty. We consider collateral and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate our credit exposure to each counterparty in determining the counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment, which may be adjusted in future periods due to changes in the fair value of the derivatives contracts, collateral and creditworthiness of the counterparty. The cumulative counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as a reduction to the derivatives asset balance was $5 million and $4 million as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We also adjust the fair value of our derivatives liabilities to reflect the impact of our own credit quality. We calculate this adjustment by comparing the spreads on our credit default swaps to the discount benchmark curve. The cumulative credit risk valuation adjustment related to our credit quality recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as a reduction in the derivative liability balance was less than $1 million as of both March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Income Statement Presentation and AOCIThe following tables summarize the impact of derivatives and the related hedged items in our consolidated statements of income and AOCI.Fair Value Hedges and Free-Standing DerivativesThe net gains (losses) recognized in earnings related to derivatives in fair value hedging relationships and free-standing derivatives are presented below for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.Table 9.3: Gains and Losses on Fair Value Hedges and Free-Standing Derivatives  Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015Derivatives designated as accounting hedges:(1)    Fair value interest rate contracts:    Gains (losses) recognized in earnings on derivatives $208 $153Gains (losses) recognized in earnings on hedged items (192) (148)Net fair value hedge ineffectiveness gains (losses) 16 5Derivatives not designated as accounting hedges:(1)    Interest rate contracts covering:    MSRs 10 6Customer accommodation 5 4Other interest rate exposures 15 2Total interest rate contracts 30 12Other contracts 0 (2)Total gains on derivatives not designated as accounting hedges 30 10Net derivative gains (losses) recognized in earnings $46 $15__________(1) Amounts are recorded in our consolidated statements of income in other non-interest income. 106Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges The table below shows the net gains (losses) related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and net investment hedges for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015.Table 9.4: Gains and Losses on Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges and Net Investment Hedges   Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015Gains (losses) recorded in AOCI:    Cash flow hedges:    Interest rate contracts $426 $210Foreign exchange contracts 0 (5)Subtotal 426 205Net investment hedges:    Foreign exchange contracts 41 75Net derivatives gains (losses) recognized in AOCI $467 $280Gains (losses) recorded in earnings:    Cash flow hedges:    Gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI into earnings:    Interest rate contracts(1)  $50 $47Foreign exchange contracts(2)  (1) (4)Subtotal 49 43Gains (losses) recognized in earnings due to ineffectiveness:    Interest rate contracts(2)  3 2Net derivative gains (losses) recognized in earnings $52 $45__________(1) Amounts reclassified are recorded in our consolidated statements of income in interest income or interest expense.(2) Amounts are recorded in our consolidated statements of income in other non-interest income or other interest income. In the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify to earnings net after-tax gains of $173 million currently recorded in AOCI as of March 31, 2016. These amounts will offset the cash flows associated with the hedged forecasted transactions. The maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions were hedged was approximately six years as of March 31, 2016. The amount we expect to reclassify into earnings may change as a result of changes in market conditions and ongoing actions taken as part of our overall risk management strategy. 107Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents NOTE 10—STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITYPreferred StockThe following table summarizes the Company’s preferred stock issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Table 10.1: Preferred Stock Issued and Outstanding      Redeemable by Issuer Beginning Per Annum Dividend Rate Dividend Frequency Liquidation Preference per Share   Carrying Value (in millions)Series Description Issuance Date     Total Shares Outstanding March 31, 2016 December 31, 2015Series B(1) 6.00% Non-Cumulative August 20, 2012 September 1, 2017 6.00% Quarterly $1,000 875,000 $853 $853Series C(1) 6.25% Non-Cumulative June 12, 2014 September 1, 2019 6.25 Quarterly 1,000 500,000 484 484Series D(1) 6.70% Non-Cumulative October 31, 2014 December 1, 2019 6.70 Quarterly 1,000 500,000 485 485Series E Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative May 14, 2015 June 1, 2020 5.55% through 5/31/2020; 3-mo.

The fair value accounting guidance provides a three-level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments. This hierarchy is based on the markets in which the assets or liabilities trade and whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable. The fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:Level 1: Valuation is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2: Valuation is based on observable market-based inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or models using inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data of substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3: Valuation is generated from techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. Valuation techniques include pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques.The accounting guidance for fair value measurements requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in determining fair value. The accounting guidance provides for the irrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-contract basis, to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value at inception of the contract and record any subsequent changes in fair value in earnings. We have not made any material fair value option elections as of or for the periods disclosed herein.For additional information on the valuation techniques used in estimating the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities on a recurring or nonrecurring basis and for estimating the fair value for financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value, see “Note 19—Fair Value Measurement” in our 2015 Form 10-K.Fair Value Governance and ControlWe have a governance framework and a number of key controls that are intended to ensure that our fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable. Our governance framework provides for independent oversight and segregation of duties. Our control processes include review and approval of new transaction types, price verification and review of valuation judgments, methods, models, process controls and results. Groups independent of our trading and investing functions, including our Corporate Valuations Group (“CVG”), Fair Value Committee (“FVC”) and Model Validation Group (“MVG”), participate in the review and validation process. The fair valuation governance process is set up in a manner that allows the Chairperson of the FVC to escalate valuation disputes that cannot be resolved by the FVC to a more senior committee called the Valuations Advisory Committee (“VAC”) for resolution. The VAC is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and includes other members of senior management. The VAC is only required to convene to review escalated valuation disputes and may meet for a general update on the valuation process. The CVG performs periodic verification of fair value measurements to determine if assigned fair values are reasonable. For example, in cases where we rely on third-party pricing services to obtain fair value measures, we analyze pricing variances among different pricing sources and validate the final price used by comparing the information to additional sources, including dealer pricing indications in transaction results and other internal sources, where necessary. Additional validation procedures performed by the CVG include reviewing (either directly or indirectly through the reasonableness of assigned fair values) valuation inputs and assumptions and monitoring acceptable variances between recommended prices and validation prices. The CVG and the Trade Analytics and Valuation (“TAV”) team perform due diligence reviews of the third-party pricing services by comparing their prices to those from other sources and periodically reviewing research publications. Additionally, when necessary, the CVG and TAV challenge prices from third-party vendors to ensure reasonableness of prices through a pricing challenge process. This may include a request for transparency of the assumptions used by the third party.The FVC, which includes representation from our Risk Management and Finance functions, is a forum for discussing fair market valuations, related inputs, assumptions, methodologies, as well as variance thresholds, valuation control environments and material risks or concerns related to fair market valuations. Additionally, the FVC is empowered to resolve valuation disputes between the primary valuation providers and the CVG, and provides guidance and oversight to ensure an appropriate valuation control environment. The FVC regularly reviews and approves our valuation methodologies to ensure that our methodologies and practices  112Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents are consistent with industry standards and adhere to regulatory and accounting guidance. The Chief Financial Officer determines when material issues or concerns regarding valuations shall be raised to the Audit Committee or another delegated committee of the Board of Directors.We have a model policy, established by an independent Model Risk Office, which governs the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for pricing. The MVG is part of the Model Risk Office and validates all models and provides ongoing monitoring of their performance, including the validation and monitoring of the performance of all valuation models.Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisThe following table displays our assets and liabilities measured on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015:Table 12.1: Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis  March 31, 2016  Fair Value Measurements Using  (Dollars in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 TotalAssets:        Securities available for sale:        U.S. Treasury securities $4,966 $0 $0 $4,966RMBS 0 27,763 505 28,268CMBS 0 5,253 251 5,504Other ABS 0 1,008 30 1,038Other securities 303 2 11 316Total securities available for sale 5,269 34,026 797 40,092Other assets:        Consumer MSRs 0 0 59 59Derivative assets(1)(2) 2 1,950 71 2,023Retained interests in securitizations 0 0 201 201Total assets $5,271 $35,976 $1,128 $42,375Liabilities:        Other liabilities:        Derivative liabilities(1)(2) $3 $752 $40 $795Total liabilities $3 $752 $40 $795 113Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents   December 31, 2015  Fair Value Measurements Using  (Dollars in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 TotalAssets:        Securities available for sale:        U.S. Treasury securities $4,660 $0 $0 $4,660RMBS 0 26,807 504 27,311CMBS 0 5,282 97 5,379Other ABS 0 1,340 0 1,340Other securities 355 2 14 371Total securities available for sale 5,015 33,431 615 39,061Other assets:        Consumer MSRs 0 0 68 68Derivative assets(1)(2) 2 1,459 57 1,518Retained interests in securitizations 0 0 211 211Total assets $5,017 $34,890 $951 $40,858Liabilities:        Other liabilities:        Derivative liabilities(1)(2) $2 $491 $27 $520Total liabilities $2 $491 $27 $520__________(1) The balances represent gross derivative amounts and are not reduced by the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to net positive and negative positions and the related payables and receivables for cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparty. The net derivative assets were $1.7 billion and $986 million, and the net derivative liabilities were $445 million and $377 million as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. See “Note 9—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” for further information. (2) Does not reflect $4 million recognized as a net valuation allowance on derivative assets and liabilities for non-performance risk as of both March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Non-performance risk is reflected in other assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and offset through non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income. The determination of the classification of financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy is performed at the end of each reporting period. We consider all available information, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs. Based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category, judgments are made regarding the significance of the unobservable inputs to the instruments’ fair value measurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. The process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, we had minimal movements between Levels 1 and 2.Level 3 Recurring Fair Value RollforwardThe table below presents a reconciliation for all assets and liabilities measured and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. When assets and liabilities are transferred between levels, we recognize the transfer as of the end of the period.   114Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents Table 12.2: Level 3 Recurring Fair Value Rollforward  Fair Value Measurements Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)  Three Months Ended March 31, 2016    Total Gains (Losses)(Realized/Unrealized)               Net UnrealizedGains (Losses)Included in NetIncome Related to Assets andLiabilities Still Held as ofMarch 31, 2016(3)                   (Dollars in millions) Balance,January 1,2016 Includedin NetIncome(1) Included inOCI Purchases Sales Issuances Settlements TransfersIntoLevel 3(2) TransfersOut ofLevel 3(2) Balance, March 31, 2016 Assets:                      Securities available for sale:                    RMBS $504 $6 $(5) $0 $0 $0 $(17) $127 $(110) $505 $6CMBS 97 0 1 93 0 0 (4) 64 0 251 0Other ABS 0 0 0 30 0 0 0 0 0 30 0Other securities 14 0 0 0 0 0 (3) 0 0 11 0Total securities available for sale 615 6 (4) 123 0 0 (24) 191 (110) 797 6Other assets:                      Consumer MSRs 68 (12) 0 0 0 4 (1) 0 0 59 (12)Derivative assets(4) 57 19 0 0 0 12 (11) 0 (6) 71 19Retained interest in securitizations 211 (10) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 201 (10)Liabilities:                      Other liabilities:                      Derivative liabilities(4) $(27) $(14) $0 $0 $0 $(7) $3 $0 $5 $(40) $(14)  Fair Value Measurements Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)  Three Months Ended March 31, 2015    Total Gains (Losses)(Realized/Unrealized)               Net UnrealizedGains (Losses)Included in NetIncome Related to Assets and Liabilities Still Held as of March 31, 2015(3)                   (Dollars in millions) Balance,January 1,2015 Includedin NetIncome(1) Included inOCI Purchases Sales Issuances Settlements TransfersIntoLevel 3(2) TransfersOut ofLevel 3(2) Balance,March 31, 2015 Assets:                      Securities available for sale:                    Corporate debt securities guaranteed by U.S. government agencies $333 $(2) $5 $0 $(68) $0 $(8) $0 $(88) $172 $0RMBS 561 8 8 0 0 0 (13) 85 (94) 555 9CMBS 228 0 1 0 0 0 (21) 0 (34) 174 0Other ABS 65 1 (2) 0 (20) 0 0 0 (37) 7 0Other securities 18 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 18 0Total securities available for sale 1,205 7 12 0 (88) 0 (42) 85 (253) 926 9Other assets:                      Consumer MSRs 53 (3) 0 0 0 4 (1) 0 0 53 (3)Derivative assets(4) 66 11 0 0 0 9 (12) 0 (1) 73 11Retained interest in securitization 221 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 223 2Liabilities:                      Other liabilities:                      Derivative liabilities(4) $(43) $(10) $0 $0 $0 $(7) $12 $0 $0 $(48) $(10)__________(1) Gains (losses) related to Level 3 Consumer MSRs, derivative assets and derivative liabilities, and retained interests in securitizations are reported in other non-interest income, which is a component of non-interest income, in our consolidated statements of income. 115Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents (2) During the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, the transfers into Level 3 were primarily driven by less consistency among vendor pricing on individual securities, while the transfers out of Level 3 were primarily driven by greater consistency among multiple pricing sources. (3) The amount presented for unrealized gains (losses) for assets still held as of the reporting date primarily represents impairments of securities available for sale, accretion on certain fixed maturity securities, changes in fair value of derivative instruments and mortgage servicing rights transactions. Impairment is reported in total OTTI, which is a component of non-interest income, in our consolidated statements of income.(4) All Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis and are not reduced by the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to net positive and negative positions and the related payables and receivables for cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparty. Significant Level 3 Fair Value Asset and Liability Input SensitivityChanges in unobservable inputs may have a significant impact on fair value. Certain of these unobservable inputs will, in isolation, have a directionally consistent impact on the fair value of the instrument for a given change in that input. Alternatively, the fair value of the instrument may move in an opposite direction for a given change in another input. In general, an increase in the discount rate, default rates, loss severity and credit spreads, in isolation, would result in a decrease in the fair value measurement. In addition, an increase in default rates would generally be accompanied by a decrease in recovery rates, slower prepayment rates and an increase in liquidity spreads.Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value MeasurementsThe following table presents the significant unobservable inputs relied upon to determine the fair values of our Level 3 financial instruments on a recurring basis. We utilize multiple third-party pricing services to obtain fair value measures for our securities. Several of our third-party pricing services are only able to provide unobservable input information for a limited number of securities due to software licensing restrictions. Other third-party pricing services are able to provide unobservable input information for all securities for which they provide a valuation. As a result, the unobservable input information for the securities available for sale presented below represents a composite summary of all information we are able to obtain for a majority of our securities. The unobservable input information for all other Level 3 financial instruments is based on the assumptions used in our internal valuation models.Table 12.3: Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements  Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements(Dollars in millions) Fair Value at March 31, 2016 SignificantValuationTechniques SignificantUnobservableInputs Range WeightedAverageAssets:          Securities available for sale:          RMBS $505 Discounted cash flows (3rd party pricing) YieldConstant prepayment rateDefault rateLoss severity 0-15%0-27%0-11%9-88% 6%5%4%54%CMBS 251 Discounted cash flows (3rd party pricing) YieldConstant prepayment rate 1-3%0-15% 2%2%Other ABS 30 Discounted cash flows (3rd party pricing) YieldConstant prepayment rate 1%3% 1%3%Other securities 11 Discounted cash flows Yield 1% 1%Other assets:          Consumer MSRs 59 Discounted cash flows Total prepayment rateDiscount rateOption-adjusted spread rateServicing cost ($ per loan) 10-20%15%435-1,500 bps$93-$201 17%15%477 bps$98Derivative assets(1) 71 Discounted cash flows Swap rates 2% 2%Retained interests in securitization(2) 201 Discounted cash flows Life of receivables (months) Constant prepayment rateDiscount rateDefault rateLoss severity 14-831-12%3-11%1-6%6-117% N/ALiabilities:          Derivative liabilities(1) $40 Discounted cash flows Swap rates 2% 2% 116Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents   Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements(Dollars in millions) Fair Value at December 31, 2015 SignificantValuationTechniques SignificantUnobservableInputs Range WeightedAverageAssets:          Securities available for sale:          RMBS $504 Discounted cash flows (3rd party pricing) YieldConstant prepayment rateDefault rateLoss severity 0-12%0-28%0-8%16-85% 6%4%4%55%CMBS 97 Discounted cash flows (3rd party pricing) YieldConstant prepayment rate 2-3%0-15% 3%9%Other securities 14 Discounted cash flows Yield 1% 1%Other assets:          Consumer MSRs 68 Discounted cash flows Total prepayment rateDiscount rateOption-adjusted spread rateServicing cost ($ per loan) 11-18%12%435-1,500 bps$93-$201 16%12%474 bps$98Derivative assets(1) 57 Discounted cash flows Swap rates 2% 2%Retained interests in securitization(2) 211 Discounted cash flows Life of receivables (months) Constant prepayment rateDiscount rateDefault rateLoss severity 16-751-13%4-9%2-6%15-94% N/ALiabilities:          Derivative liabilities(1) $27 Discounted cash flows Swap rates 2% 2%__________(1) All Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis and are not reduced by the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to net positive and negative positions and the related payables and receivables for cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparty. (2) Due to the nature of the various mortgage securitization structures in which we have retained interests, it is not meaningful to present a consolidated weighted average for the significant unobservable inputs.Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring BasisWe are required to measure and recognize certain other assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on the consolidated balance sheets. These assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, from the application of lower of cost or market accounting or when we evaluate for impairment). The following table presents the carrying amount of the assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and still held as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and for which a nonrecurring fair value measurement was recorded during the three and twelve months then ended:Table 12.4: Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements Related to Assets Still Held at Period End  March 31, 2016  Estimated Fair Value Hierarchy Total(Dollars in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Loans held for investment $0 $0 $716 $716Loans held for sale 0 6 0 6Other assets(1) 0 0 39 39Total $0 $6 $755 $761 117Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents   December 31, 2015  Estimated Fair Value Hierarchy Total(Dollars in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Loans held for investment $0 $0 $362 $362Loans held for sale 0 149 0 149Other assets(1) 0 0 92 92Total $0 $149 $454 $603__________(1) Includes foreclosed property and repossessed assets of $39 million and long-lived assets held for sale of $0 million as of March 31, 2016, compared to foreclosed property and repossessed assets of $54 million and long-lived assets held for sale of $38 million as of December 31, 2015.In the above table, loans held for investment primarily include nonperforming loans for which specific reserves or charge-offs have been recognized. These loans are classified as Level 3 as they are valued based in part on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral and the non-recoverable rate, which is considered to be a significant unobservable input. Collateral fair value sources include the appraisal value obtained from independent appraisers, broker pricing opinions or other available market information. The non-recoverable rate ranged from 0% to 78%, with a weighted average of 11%, and from 9% to 73%, with a weighted average of 20%, as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The fair value of the other assets classified as Level 3 is determined based on appraisal value or listing price which involves significant judgment; the significant unobservable inputs and related quantitative information are not meaningful to disclose as they vary significantly across properties and collateral.The following table presents total nonrecurring fair value measurements for the period, included in earnings, attributable to the change in fair value relating to assets that are still held at March 31, 2016 and 2015:Table 12.5: Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements Included in Earnings Related to Assets Still Held at Period End  Total Gains (Losses)  Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015Loans held for investment $(71) $(5)Loans held for sale 0 0Other assets(1) (4) (4)Total $(75) $(9)__________(1) Includes losses related to foreclosed property and repossessed assets.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe following table is a summary of the fair value estimates for our financial instruments, excluding those financial instruments that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as they are included within the “Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis” table included earlier in this Note. 118Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents Table 12.6: Fair Value of Financial Instruments   March 31, 2016  CarryingAmount EstimatedFair Value Estimated Fair Value Hierarchy(Dollars in millions)   Level 1 Level 2 Level 3Financial assets:          Cash and cash equivalents $5,235 $5,235 $5,235 $0 $0Restricted cash for securitization investors 960 960 960 0 0Securities held to maturity 25,080 26,455 200 26,204 51Net loans held for investment 222,197 224,489 0 0 224,489Loans held for sale 1,251 1,308 0 1,308 0Interest receivable 1,221 1,221 0 1,221 0Other investments(1) 1,754 1,754 0 1,754 0Financial liabilities:          Non-interest bearing deposits $25,182 $25,182 $25,182 $0 $0Interest-bearing deposits 196,597 192,475 0 16,336 176,139Securitized debt obligations 14,913 14,961 0 14,961 0Senior and subordinated notes 21,736 21,697 0 21,697 0Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase 917 917 917 0 0Other borrowings 12,931 12,920 0 12,920 0Interest payable 217 217 0 217 0  December 31, 2015  CarryingAmount EstimatedFair Value Estimated Fair Value Hierarchy(Dollars in millions)   Level 1 Level 2 Level 3Financial assets:          Cash and cash equivalents $8,023 $8,023 $8,023 $0 $0Restricted cash for securitization investors 1,017 1,017 1,017 0 0Securities held to maturity 24,619 25,317 198 25,068 51Net loans held for investment 224,721 222,007 0 0 222,007Loans held for sale 904 933 0 860 73Interest receivable 1,189 1,189 0 1,189 0Other investments(1) 2,060 2,060 0 2,060 0Financial liabilities:          Non-interest bearing deposits $25,847 $25,847 $25,847 $0 $0Interest-bearing deposits 191,874 185,075 0 15,848 169,227Securitized debt obligations 16,166 16,225 0 16,225 0Senior and subordinated notes 21,837 22,062 0 22,062 0Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase 981 981 981 0 0Other borrowings 20,131 20,134 0 20,134 0Interest payable 299 299 0 299 0__________(1) Primarily includes our investments in Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLB”) and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve”) stock.

The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group, are included in the Other category.     Basis of PresentationWe report the results of each of our business segments on a continuing operations basis. See “Note 2—Discontinued Operations” for a discussion of our discontinued operations. The results of our individual businesses reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. Business Segment Reporting MethodologyThe results of our business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. Our internal management and reporting process used to derive our segment results employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. Our funds transfer pricing process provides a funds credit for sources of funds, such as deposits generated by our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses, and a funds charge for the use of funds by each segment. Due to the integrated nature of our business segments, estimates and judgments have been made in allocating certain revenue and expense items. Transactions between segments are based on specific criteria or approximate third-party rates. We regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods. We provide additional information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in “Note 20—Business Segments” in our 2015 Form 10-KSegment Results and Reconciliation We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment. The following tables present our business segment results for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, selected balance sheet data as of March 31, 2016 and 2015, and a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated income from continuing operations, assets and deposits.  120Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents Table 13.1: Segment Results and Reconciliation  Three Months Ended March 31, 2016(Dollars in millions) CreditCard ConsumerBanking CommercialBanking(1) Other(1) ConsolidatedTotalNet interest income $3,033 $1,420 $537 $66 $5,056Non-interest income 847 191 118 8 1,164Total net revenue (loss) 3,880 1,611 655 74 6,220Provision (benefit) for credit losses 1,071 230 228 (2) 1,527Non-interest expense:          Amortization of intangibles:          PCCR intangible amortization 70 0 0 0 70Core deposit intangible amortization 0 15 3 0 18Total PCCR and core deposit intangible amortization 70 15 3 0 88Other non-interest expense 1,793 975 319 48 3,135Total non-interest expense 1,863 990 322 48 3,223Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 946 391 105 28 1,470Income tax provision (benefit) 337 142 38 (65) 452Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax $609 $249 $67 $93 $1,018Loans held for investment $92,699 $70,591 $64,241 $82 $227,613Deposits 0 177,803 33,383 10,593 221,779             Three Months Ended March 31, 2015(Dollars in millions) CreditCard ConsumerBanking CommercialBanking(1) Other(1) ConsolidatedTotalNet interest income $2,666 $1,434 $461 $15 $4,576Non-interest income 816 158 114 (17) 1,071Total net revenue (loss) 3,482 1,592 575 (2) 5,647Provision (benefit) for credit losses 669 206 60 0 935Non-interest expense:          Amortization of intangibles:          PCCR intangible amortization 84 0 0 0 84Core deposit intangible amortization 0 22 4 0 26Total PCCR and core deposit intangible amortization 84 22 4 0 110Other non-interest expense 1,692 948 268 31 2,939Total non-interest expense 1,776 970 272 31 3,049Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 1,037 416 243 (33) 1,663Income tax provision (benefit) 369 150 88 (78) 529Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax $668 $266 $155 $45 $1,134Loans held for investment $81,754 $71,379 $50,741 $104 $203,978Deposits 0 172,502 32,575 5,363 210,440__________(1) Some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits. Accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory tax rate of 35% with offsetting reclassifications to the Other category.             121Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents NOTE 14—COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES, GUARANTEES AND OTHERSLetters of Credit and Loss Sharing AgreementsWe issue letters of credit (financial standby, performance standby and commercial) to meet the financing needs of our customers. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party in a borrowing arrangement. Commercial letters of credit are short-term commitments issued primarily to facilitate trade finance activities for customers and are generally collateralized by the goods being shipped to the client. These collateral requirements are similar to those for funded transactions and are established based on management’s credit assessment of the customer. Management conducts regular reviews of all outstanding letters of credit and customer acceptances, and the results of these reviews are considered in assessing the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses.Within our Commercial Banking business, we originate multifamily commercial real estate loans with the intent to sell them to a government-sponsored enterprise (“GSE”). We enter into loss sharing agreements with the GSE upon the sale of the loans. At inception, we record a liability representing the fair value of our obligation which is subsequently amortized as we are released from risk of payment under the loss sharing agreement. If payment under the loss sharing agreement becomes probable and estimable, an additional liability may be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and a non-interest expense may be recognized in the consolidated statements of income. The amount of liability recognized on our consolidated balance sheets for our loss sharing agreements was $41 million and $40 million as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We had standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit with contractual amounts of $1.9 billion as of both March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The carrying value of outstanding letters of credit, which we include in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets was $3 million as of both March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015. These financial guarantees had expiration dates ranging from 2016 to 2025 as of March 31, 2016. U.K. Cross SellIn the U.K., we previously sold payment protection insurance (“PPI”) and other ancillary cross sell products. In response to an elevated level of customer complaints across the industry, heightened media coverage and pressure from consumer advocacy groups, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), formerly the Financial Services Authority, investigated and raised concerns about the way the industry has handled complaints related to the sale of these insurance policies. For the past several years, the U.K.’s Financial Ombudsman Service (“FOS”) has been adjudicating customer complaints relating to PPI, escalated to it by consumers who disagree with the rejection of their complaint by firms, leading to customer remediation payments by us and others within the industry. On October 2, 2015, the FCA issued a Statement on PPI (“FCA Proposal”) announcing it has decided to consult, by the end of 2015, on the introduction of a time bar for PPI complaints and on new rules and guidance about how banks should handle PPI complaints covered by s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act of 1974 (“Consumer Credit Act”) in light of the U.K. Supreme Court’s 2014 ruling in Plevin v. Paragon Personal Finance Limited (“Plevin”). The industry consultation period ended in February 2016, and we expect the FCA to issue final rules later this year. In determining our best estimate of incurred losses for future remediation payments, management considers numerous factors, including: (i) the number of customer complaints we expect in the future; (ii) our expectation of upholding those complaints; (iii) the expected number of complaints customers escalate to the FOS; (iv) our expectation of the FOS upholding such escalated complaints; (v) the number of complaints that fall under the s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act; and (vi) the estimated remediation payout to customers. We monitor these factors each quarter and adjust our reserves to reflect the latest data. Management’s best estimate of incurred losses related to U.K. cross sell products, including PPI, totaled $150 million and $176 million as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The decrease to the reserve for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was a combination of utilization of the reserve through customer refund payments and foreign exchange movements. Our best estimate of reasonably possible future losses beyond our reserve as of March 31, 2016 is approximately $250 million.  122Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents Mortgage Representation and Warranty LiabilitiesWe acquired three subsidiaries that originated residential mortgage loans and sold these loans to various purchasers, including purchasers who created securitization trusts. These subsidiaries are Capital One Home Loans, LLC, which was acquired in February 2005; GreenPoint, which was acquired in December 2006 as part of the North Fork acquisition; and CCB, which was acquired in February 2009 and subsequently merged into CONA (collectively, the “subsidiaries”).In connection with their sales of mortgage loans, the subsidiaries entered into agreements containing varying representations and warranties about, among other things, the ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing the loan, the loan’s compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the purchaser, including underwriting guidelines and the existence of mortgage insurance, and the loan’s compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws. The representations and warranties do not address the credit performance of the mortgage loans, but mortgage loan performance often influences whether a claim for breach of representation and warranty will be asserted and has an effect on the amount of any loss in the event of a breach of a representation or warranty.Each of these subsidiaries may be required to repurchase mortgage loans in the event of certain breaches of these representations and warranties. In the event of a repurchase, the subsidiary is typically required to pay the unpaid principal balance of the loan together with interest and certain expenses (including, in certain cases, legal costs incurred by the purchaser and/or others). The subsidiary then recovers the loan or, if the loan has been foreclosed, the underlying collateral. The subsidiary is exposed to any losses on the repurchased loans, taking into account any recoveries on the collateral. In some instances, rather than repurchase the loans, a subsidiary may agree to make cash payments to make an investor whole on losses or to settle repurchase claims, possibly including claims for attorneys’ fees and interest. In addition, our subsidiaries may be required to indemnify certain purchasers and others against losses they incur as a result of certain breaches of representations and warranties.These subsidiaries, in total, originated and sold to non-affiliates approximately $111 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans between 2005 and 2008, which are the years (or “vintages”) with respect to which our subsidiaries have received the vast majority of the repurchase-related requests and other related claims.The following table presents the original principal balance of mortgage loan originations, by vintage for 2005 through 2008, for the three general categories of purchasers of mortgage loans and the estimated unpaid principal balance as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015:Table 14.1: Unpaid Principal Balance of Mortgage Loans Originated and Sold to Third Parties Based on Category of Purchaser   Estimated Unpaid Principal Balance Original Principal Balance(Dollars in billions) March 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 Total 2008 2007 2006 2005GSEs $2 $2 $11 $1 $4 $3 $3Insured Securitizations 3 4 20 0 2 8 10Uninsured Securitizations and Other 14 14 80 3 15 30 32Total $19 $20 $111 $4 $21 $41 $45Between 2005 and 2008, our subsidiaries sold an aggregate amount of $11 billion in original principal balance mortgage loans to the GSEs.Of the $20 billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans sold directly by our subsidiaries to private-label purchasers who placed the loans into securitizations supported by bond insurance (“Insured Securitizations”), approximately 48% of the original principal balance was covered by bond insurance. Further, approximately $16 billion original principal balance was placed in securitizations as to which the monoline bond insurers have made repurchase-related requests or loan file requests to one of our subsidiaries (“Active Insured Securitizations”) and the remaining approximately $4 billion original principal balance was placed in securitizations as to which the monoline bond insurers have not made repurchase-related requests or loan file requests to one of our subsidiaries (“Inactive Insured Securitizations”). Insured Securitizations often allow the monoline bond insurer to act independently of the investors. Bond insurers typically have indemnity agreements directly with both the mortgage originators and the securitizers, and they often have super-majority rights within the trust documentation that allow them to direct trustees to pursue mortgage repurchase-related requests without coordination with other investors. 123Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents Because we do not service most of the loans our subsidiaries sold to others, we do not have complete information about the current ownership of a portion of the $80 billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans not sold directly to GSEs or placed in Insured Securitizations. We have determined based on information obtained from third-party databases that about $48 billion original principal balance of these mortgage loans was placed in private-label publicly issued securitizations not supported by bond insurance (“Uninsured Securitizations”). An additional approximately $22 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans were initially sold to private investors as whole loans. Various known and unknown investors purchased the remaining $10 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans.With respect to the $111 billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans originated and sold to others between 2005 and 2008, we estimate that approximately $19 billion in unpaid principal balance remains outstanding as of March 31, 2016, of which approximately $3 billion in unpaid principal balance is at least 90 days delinquent. Approximately $22 billion in losses have been realized by third parties. Because we do not service most of the loans we sold to others, we do not have complete information about the underlying credit performance levels for some of these mortgage loans. These amounts reflect our best estimates, including extrapolations of underlying credit performance where necessary. These estimates could change as we get additional data or refine our analysis.The subsidiaries had open repurchase-related requests with regard to approximately $1.4 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans as of March 31, 2016, flat from December 31, 2015. Currently, repurchase-related demands predominantly relate to the 2006 and 2007 vintages. We have received relatively few repurchase-related demands from the 2008 and 2009 vintages, mostly because GreenPoint ceased originating mortgages in August 2007.The following table presents information on pending repurchase-related requests by counterparty category and timing of initial request. The amounts presented are based on original loan principal balances.Table 14.2: Open Pipeline All Vintages (All Entities)(1)(Dollars in millions) GSEs InsuredSecuritizations UninsuredSecuritizationsand Other TotalOpen claims as of December 31, 2014 $16 $649 $1,847 $2,512Gross new demands received 23 0 23 46Loans repurchased/made whole (17) 0 (1) (18)Demands rescinded (21) (115) (1,054) (1,190)Open claims as of December 31, 2015 1 534 815 1,350Gross new demands received 8 0 5 13Loans repurchased/made whole (1) 0 0 (1)Demands rescinded (2) 0 0 (2)Open claims as of March 31, 2016 $6 $534 $820 $1,360__________(1) The open pipeline includes all timely repurchase-related requests ever received by our subsidiaries where the requesting party has not formally rescinded the repurchase-related request or our subsidiary has not agreed to either repurchase the loan at issue or make the requesting party whole with respect to its losses. The demands rescinded in 2015 reflect the ruling from New York’s highest court in June 2015 that the statute of limitations for repurchase claims begins when the relevant representations and warranties were made, as opposed to some later date during the life of the loan. Finally, the amounts reflected in this chart are the original principal balance amounts of the mortgage loans at issue and do not correspond to the losses our subsidiary would incur upon the repurchase of these loans. 124Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents The following table summarizes changes in our representation and warranty reserve for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015:Table 14.3: Changes in Representation and Warranty Reserve(1)  Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2016 2015Representation and warranty reserve, beginning of period $610 $731Provision (benefit) for mortgage representation and warranty losses:    Recorded in continuing operations (1) 1Recorded in discontinued operations 3 (19)Total provision (benefit) for mortgage representation and warranty losses 2 (18)Net realized recoveries (losses) 1 (40)Representation and warranty reserve, end of period $613 $673__________(1) Reported on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities.The following table summarizes the allocation of our representation and warranty reserve as of March 31, 2016 and 2015:Table 14.4: Allocation of Representation and Warranty Reserve  Reserve Liability Loans Sold2005 to 2008(1) (Dollars in millions, except for loans sold) March 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 Selected period-end data:      Active Insured Securitizations and GSEs $482 $480 $27Inactive Insured Securitizations and Others 131 130 84Total(2) $613 $610 $111__________(1) Reflects, in billions, the total original principal balance of loans originated by our subsidiaries and sold to third-party investors between 2005 and 2008.(2) The total reserve liability includes an immaterial amount related to loans that were originated after 2008.We established reserves for the $11 billion original principal balance of GSE loans, based on open claims and historic repurchase rates. We have entered into and completed repurchase or settlement agreements with respect to the majority of our repurchase exposure within this category. Our reserves could also be impacted by any claims which may be brought by governmental agencies under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (“FIRREA”), the False Claims Act or other federal or state statutes. For example, GreenPoint and Capital One have received requests for information and/or subpoenas from various governmental regulators and law enforcement authorities, including members of the RMBS Working Group, relating to the origination of loans for sale to the GSEs and to RMBS participants. We are cooperating with these regulators and other authorities in responding to such requests.For the $16 billion original principal balance in Active Insured Securitizations, our reserving approach is based upon the expected resolution of litigation with the monoline bond insurers. Accordingly, our representation and warranty reserves for this category are litigation reserves. In establishing litigation reserves for this category, we consider the current and future monoline insurer losses inherent within the securitization and apply legal judgment to the developing factual and legal record to estimate the liability for each securitization. We consider as factors within the analysis our own past monoline settlements in addition to publicly available industry monoline settlements. Our reserves with respect to the U.S. Bank Litigation, referenced below, are contained within the Active Insured Securitization reserve category. Further, to the extent we have litigation reserves with respect to indemnification risks from certain representation and warranty lawsuits brought by monoline bond insurers against third-party securitizations sponsors, where one of our subsidiaries provided some or all of the mortgage collateral within the securitization but is not a defendant in the litigation, such reserves are also contained within this category. 125Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents For the $4 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans in the Inactive Insured Securitizations category and the $48 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans in the Uninsured Securitizations category, we establish reserves based on an assessment of probable and estimable legal liability, if any, utilizing both our own experience and publicly available industry settlement information to estimate lifetime liability. In contrast with the bond insurers in the Insured Securitizations, investors in Uninsured Securitizations often face a number of legal and logistical hurdles before they can force a securitization trustee to pursue mortgage repurchases, including the need to coordinate with a certain percentage of investors holding the securities and to indemnify the trustee for any litigation it undertakes. Accordingly, we only reserve for such exposures when a trustee or investor with standing brings claims and it is probable we have incurred a loss. Some Uninsured Securitization investors from this category are currently suing investment banks and securitization sponsors under federal and/or state securities laws. Although we face some indirect indemnity risks from these litigations, we generally have not established reserves with respect to these indemnity risks because we do not consider them to be both probable and reasonably estimable liabilities. In addition, to the extent we have litigation reserves with respect to indemnification risks from certain representation and warranty lawsuits brought by parties who purchased loans from our subsidiaries and subsequently re-sold the loans into securitizations, such reserves are also contained within this category.For the $22 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans sold to private investors as whole loans, we establish reserves based on open claims and historical repurchase rates.The aggregate reserve for all three subsidiaries totaled $613 million as of March 31, 2016, compared to $610 million as of December 31, 2015. We recorded a net loss for mortgage representation and warranty losses of $2 million (which includes a benefit of $1 million before taxes in continuing operations and a loss of $3 million before taxes in discontinued operations) in the first quarter of 2016.As part of our business planning processes, we have considered various outcomes relating to the future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are possible but do not rise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying an incremental accrual under applicable accounting standards. Our current best estimate of reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond our reserves as of March 31, 2016 is approximately $1.5 billion, a decrease from our $1.6 billion estimate at December 31, 2015. The decrease in this estimate was primarily driven by favorable rulings in representation and warranty-related litigation. The estimate as of March 31, 2016 covers all reasonably possible losses relating to representation and warranty claim activity, including those relating to the cases more specifically described below in Mortgage Repurchase Litigation.In estimating reasonably possible future losses in excess of our current reserves, we assume a portion of the inactive securitizations become active and for all Insured Securitizations, we assume loss rates on the high end of those observed in monoline settlements or court rulings. For our remaining GSE exposures, Uninsured Securitizations and whole loan exposures, our reasonably possible risk estimates assume lifetime loss rates and claims rates at the highest levels of our past experience and also consider the limited instances of observed settlements. We do not assume claim rates or loss rates for these risk categories will be as high as those assumed for the Active Insured Securitizations, however, based on industry precedent. Should the number of claims or the loss rates on these claims increase significantly, our estimate of reasonably possible risk would increase materially. We also assume that repurchase-related requests will be resolved at discounts reflecting the nature of the claims, the vintage of the underlying loans and evolving legal precedents. Notwithstanding our ongoing attempts to estimate a reasonably possible amount of future losses beyond our current accrual levels based on current information, it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and our current estimate of the amount of reasonably possible losses. Our reserve and reasonably possible estimates involve considerable judgment and reflect that there is still significant uncertainty regarding numerous factors that may impact the ultimate loss levels, including, but not limited to: litigation outcomes; court rulings; governmental enforcement decisions; future repurchase and indemnification claim levels; securitization trustees pursuing mortgage repurchase litigation unilaterally or in coordination with investors; investors successfully pursuing repurchase litigation independently and without the involvement of the trustee as a party; ultimate repurchase and indemnification rates; future mortgage loan performance levels; actual recoveries on the collateral; and macroeconomic conditions (including unemployment levels and housing prices). In light of the significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability our subsidiaries may incur from these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period. 126Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents LitigationIn accordance with the current accounting standards for loss contingencies, we establish reserves for litigation related matters that arise from the ordinary course of our business activities when it is probable that a loss associated with a claim or proceeding has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. None of the amounts we currently have recorded individually or in the aggregate are considered to be material to our financial condition. Litigation claims and proceedings of all types are subject to many uncertain factors that generally cannot be predicted with assurance. Below we provide a description of potentially material legal proceedings and claims.For some of the matters disclosed below, we are able to determine estimates of potential future outcomes that are not probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying either the establishment of a reserve or an incremental reserve build, but which are reasonably possible outcomes. For other disclosed matters, such an estimate is not possible at this time. For those matters below where an estimate is possible (excluding the reasonably possible future losses relating to the U.S. Bank Litigation, the FHFA Litigation, and the LXS Trust Litigation, because reasonably possible losses with respect to those litigations are included within the reasonably possible representation and warranty liabilities discussed above) management currently estimates the reasonably possible future losses beyond our reserves as of March 31, 2016 is approximately $200 million. Notwithstanding our attempt to estimate a reasonably possible range of loss beyond our current accrual levels for some litigation matters based on current information, it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and the range of reasonably possible losses disclosed here. Given the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters, especially those involving governmental actors, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from these litigation matters and an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period.Interchange LitigationIn 2005, a number of entities, each purporting to represent a class of retail merchants, filed antitrust lawsuits (“Interchange Lawsuits”) against MasterCard and Visa and several member banks, including our subsidiaries and us, alleging among other things, that the defendants conspired to fix the level of interchange fees. The complaints seek injunctive relief and civil monetary damages, which could be trebled. Separately, a number of large merchants have asserted similar claims against Visa and MasterCard only. In October 2005, the class and merchant Interchange Lawsuits were consolidated before the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for certain purposes, including discovery. In July 2012, the parties executed and filed with the court a Memorandum of Understanding agreeing to resolve the litigation on certain terms set forth in a settlement agreement attached to the Memorandum. The class settlement provides for, among other things, (i) payments by defendants to the class and individual plaintiffs totaling approximately $6.6 billion; (ii) a distribution to the class merchants of an amount equal to 10 basis points of certain interchange transactions for a period of eight months; and (iii) modifications to certain Visa and MasterCard rules regarding point of sale practices. In December 2013, the court granted final approval of the proposed class settlement, which was appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in January 2014 and argued before the court on September 28, 2015. Several merchant plaintiffs have also opted out of the class settlement, some of which have sued MasterCard, Visa and various member banks, including Capital One. The opt-out cases were consolidated before the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for certain purposes, including discovery. These consolidated cases are in their preliminary stages, and Visa and MasterCard have settled a number of individual opt-out cases, requiring non-material payments from all banks. Separate settlement and judgment sharing agreements between Capital One and MasterCard and Visa allocate the liabilities of any judgment or settlement arising from the Interchange Lawsuits and associated opt-out cases. Visa created a litigation escrow account following its IPO of stock in 2008, which funds any settlements for its member banks, and any settlements related to MasterCard allocated losses are reflected in Capital One’s reserves. 127Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents Mortgage Repurchase LitigationIn February 2009, GreenPoint was named as a defendant in a lawsuit commenced in the New York County Supreme Court, by U.S. Bank, N. A., Syncora Guarantee Inc. and CIFG Assurance North America, Inc. (“U.S. Bank Litigation”). Plaintiffs allege, among other things, that GreenPoint breached certain representations and warranties in two contracts pursuant to which GreenPoint sold approximately 30,000 mortgage loans having an aggregate original principal balance of approximately $1.8 billion to a purchaser that ultimately transferred most of these mortgage loans to a securitization trust. Some of the securities issued by the trust were insured by Syncora and CIFG. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and an order compelling GreenPoint to repurchase the entire portfolio of 30,000 mortgage loans based on alleged breaches of representations and warranties relating to a limited sampling of loans in the portfolio, or, alternatively, the repurchase of specific mortgage loans to which the alleged breaches of representations and warranties relate. In March 2010, the court granted GreenPoint’s motion to dismiss with respect to plaintiffs Syncora and CIFG and denied the motion with respect to U.S. Bank. GreenPoint subsequently answered the complaint with respect to U.S. Bank, denying the allegations, and filed a counterclaim against U.S. Bank alleging breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In February 2012, the court denied plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file an amended complaint and dismissed Syncora and CIFG from the case. Syncora and CIFG appealed their dismissal to the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department (“First Department”), which affirmed the dismissal in April 2013. The New York Court of Appeals denied Syncora’s and CIFG’s motion for leave to appeal the First Department’s decision in February 2014. Therefore, the case is now proceeding with U.S. Bank as the sole plaintiff. On May 20, 2015, Lehman Brothers Holding, Inc. (“LBHI”) filed an adversary proceeding in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York against U.S. Bank, Syncora, and GreenPoint regarding bankruptcy proofs of claims filed by U.S. Bank and Syncora on the same securitization at issue in the U.S. Bank Litigation.In May, June, and July 2012, FHFA (acting as conservator for Freddie Mac) filed three summonses with notice in the New York state court against GreenPoint, on behalf of the trustees for three RMBS trusts backed by loans originated by GreenPoint with an aggregate original principal balance of $3.4 billion. In January 2013, the plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint in the name of the three trusts, acting by the respective trustees, alleging breaches of contractual representations and warranties regarding compliance with GreenPoint underwriting guidelines relating to certain loans (“FHFA Litigation”). Plaintiffs seek specific performance of the repurchase obligations with respect to the loans for which they have provided notice of alleged breaches as well as all other allegedly breaching loans, rescissory damages, indemnification, costs and interest.In July 2013, Lehman XS Trust, Series 2006-4N, by its trustee U.S. Bank, N.A. filed a lawsuit in the Southern District of New York against GreenPoint alleging breaches of representations and warranties made in certain loan sale agreements, pursuant to which GreenPoint sold mortgage loans with an original principal balance of $915 million to Lehman Brothers for securitization and sale to investors. The lawsuit (“LXS Trust Litigation”) seeks specific performance of GreenPoint’s obligation to repurchase certain allegedly breaching loans, or in the alternative, the repurchase of all loans in the trust, the award of rescissory damages, costs, fees and interest. In January 2014, the court granted GreenPoint’s motion to dismiss based on the statute of limitations, which the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed in March 2016.As noted above in the section entitled Mortgage Representation and Warranty Liabilities, the Company’s subsidiaries establish reserves with respect to representation and warranty litigation matters, where appropriate, within the Company’s overall representation and warranty reserves. Please see above for more details.Anti-Money Laundering Capital One has received subpoenas and requests for testimony from the New York District Attorney’s Office (“NYDA”) with respect to certain former check casher clients of the Commercial Banking business and Capital One’s anti-money laundering (“AML”) program. In early 2015, we received similar requests from the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) of the U.S. Department of Treasury. Capital One is cooperating with all agencies involved in the investigation. 128Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents Intellectual Ventures Corp., et al.In June 2013, Intellectual Ventures I, LLC and Intellectual Ventures II, LLC (collectively “IV”) sued Capital One Financial Corp., Capital One Bank (USA), N.A. and Capital One, N.A. (collectively “Capital One”) for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. In the Complaint, IV alleged infringement of patents related to various business processes across the Capital One enterprise. IV simultaneously filed patent infringement actions against numerous other financial institutions on the same and other patents in several other federal courts. Capital One filed an answer and counterclaim alleging antitrust violations. In December 2013, the court dismissed Capital One’s counterclaim and decided the parties’ arguments on claim construction. IV agreed to dismiss two patents in suit, and following claim construction, asked for a stipulation of non-infringement for one patent with an opportunity to appeal the court’s decision regarding claim construction. In April 2014, the court granted Capital One’s motion for summary judgment and found that the two remaining patents were either unpatentable or indefinite. In May 2014, IV appealed to the Federal Circuit, which affirmed the district court’s dismissal of all three remaining patents in July 2015. In January 2014, IV filed a second suit against Capital One for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. In the complaint, IV again alleges infringement of patents related to various business practices across the Capital One enterprise. In March 2015, the court granted Capital One’s motion for leave to add a counterclaim for antitrust violations. IV voluntarily dismissed one of the patents against Capital One and in September 2015, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Capital One on the remaining four patents and dismissed IV’s claims. IV has appealed the dismissal of its claims to the Federal Circuit.Other Pending and Threatened LitigationIn addition, we are commonly subject to various pending and threatened legal actions relating to the conduct of our normal business activities. In the opinion of management, the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of all such other pending or threatened legal actions will not be material to our consolidated financial position or our results of operations. 129Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskFor a discussion of the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see “MD&A—Risk Management—Market Risk Management” and “MD&A—Market Risk Profile.”Item 4. Controls and Procedures OverviewWe are required under applicable laws and regulations to maintain controls and procedures, which include disclosure controls and procedures as well as internal control over financial reporting, as further described below.(a) Disclosure Controls and ProceduresDisclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our financial reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding our required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we must apply judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures.Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresAs required by Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of March 31, 2016, the end of the period covered by this Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2016, at a reasonable level of assurance, in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting information required to be disclosed within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms.(b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingWe regularly review our disclosure controls and procedures and make changes intended to ensure the quality of our financial reporting. There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred in the first quarter of 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 130Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsPART II—OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1.
