Unless otherwise specified, references to notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2017 included in this Report. Management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial condition. The following MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and related notes in this Report and the more detailed information contained in our 2016 Form 10-K.INTRODUCTIONWe are a diversified financial services holding company with banking and non-banking subsidiaries. Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through branches, the internet and other distribution channels. As of September 30, 2017, our principal subsidiaries included:•Capital One Bank (USA), National Association (“COBNA”), which offers credit and debit card products, other lending products and deposit products; and•Capital One, National Association (“CONA”), which offers a broad spectrum of banking products and financial services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients.The Company is hereafter collectively referred to as “we,” “us” or “our.” COBNA and CONA are collectively referred to as the “Banks.” Certain business terms used in this document are defined in the “MD&A—Glossary and Acronyms” and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.Our consolidated total net revenues are derived primarily from lending to consumer and commercial customers net of funding costs associated with interest on deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. We also earn non-interest income which primarily consists of interchange income net of rewards expenses and service charges and other customer-related fees. Our non-interest expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating expenses, marketing expenses and income taxes.Our principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group, are included in the Other category.•Credit Card: Consists of our domestic consumer and small business card lending, and international card businesses in Canada and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”).•Consumer Banking: Consists of our branch-based lending and deposit gathering activities for consumers and small businesses, national deposit gathering, auto lending and consumer home loan lending and servicing activities.•Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending, deposit gathering and servicing activities provided to commercial real estate and commercial and industrial customers. Our commercial and industrial customers typically include companies with annual revenues between $10 million and $1 billion. 1Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsRecent Acquisitions and DispositionsWe regularly explore and evaluate opportunities to acquire financial services and financial assets, including credit card and other loan portfolios, and enter into strategic partnerships as part of our growth strategy. We also explore opportunities to acquire digital companies and related assets to improve our information technology infrastructure and to deliver on our digital strategy. We also regularly consider the potential disposition of certain of our assets, branches, partnership agreements or lines of business. We may issue equity or debt in connection with acquisitions, including public offerings, to fund such acquisitions.On September 25, 2017, we completed the previously announced acquisition from Synovus Bank of credit card assets and related liabilities of World’s Foremost Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cabela’s Incorporated (“Cabela’s acquisition”). The Cabela’s acquisition added approximately $5.7 billion to our domestic credit card loans held for investment portfolio as of the acquisition date. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for additional details. 2Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsSUMMARY OF SELECTED FINANCIAL DATAThe following table presents selected consolidated financial data and performance from our results of operations for the third quarter and first nine months of 2017 and 2016 and selected comparative balance sheet data as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. We also provide selected key metrics we use in evaluating our performance, including certain metrics that are computed using non-GAAP measures.

In comparison, we reported net income of $1.0 billion ($1.90 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $6.5 billion and net income of $3.0 billion ($5.42 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $18.9 billion for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively.Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio as calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach, including transition provisions, was 10.7% and 10.1% as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. See “MD&A—Capital Management” below for additional information.On June 28, 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.85 billion of shares of our common stock (“2017 Stock Repurchase Program”) from the third quarter of 2017 through the end of the second quarter of 2018. See “MD&A—Capital Management” below for additional information.Below are additional highlights of our performance in the third quarter and first nine months of 2017. These highlights are generally based on a comparison between the results of the third quarter and first nine months of 2017 and 2016, except as otherwise noted. The changes in our financial condition and credit performance are generally based on our financial condition and credit performance as of September 30, 2017 compared to our financial condition and credit performance as of December 31, 2016. We provide a more detailed discussion of our financial performance in the sections following this “Executive Summary and Business Outlook.”Total Company Performance•Earnings: Our net income increased by $102 million to $1.1 billion in the third quarter of 2017 and was substantially flat at $3.0 billion in the first nine months of 2017 primarily driven by: ◦higher interest income due to growth in our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios, as well as higher yields as a result of higher interest rates; ◦lower income tax provision due to a lower effective income tax rate primarily driven by increases in the relative benefit of tax exempt income and tax credits; and◦higher non-interest income primarily attributable to gains from the sale of investment securities as a result of portfolio repositioning and higher net interchange fees primarily driven by higher purchase volume.These drivers were partially offset by:◦higher provision for credit losses primarily driven by higher charge-offs; 5Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents◦higher operating expenses as a result of (i) loan growth; (ii) continued investments in technology and infrastructure; and (iii) restructuring activities, which primarily consisted of severance and related benefits pursuant to our ongoing benefit programs, that are the result of exiting certain business activities and locations; and◦higher interest expense due to the net effect of higher interest rates, as well as growth and mix changes in our interest-bearing liabilities.•Loans Held for Investment: ◦Period-end loans held for investment increased by $6.8 billion to $252.4 billion as of September 30, 2017 from December 31, 2016 primarily due to growth in our auto and domestic credit card loan portfolios, including loans acquired in the Cabela’s acquisition, partially offset by expected seasonal paydowns in our domestic credit card loan portfolio and run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio.◦Average loans held for investment increased by $10.0 billion to $245.8 billion in the third quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2016, and increased by $12.2 billion to $243.2 billion in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the first nine months of 2016, primarily driven by growth in our auto, domestic credit card and commercial loan portfolios, partially offset by run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio.•Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: Our net charge-off rate increased by 51 basis points to 2.61% in the third quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2016, and increased by 54 basis points to 2.60% in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the first nine months of 2016, primarily due to growth and seasoning of recent domestic credit card loan originations and higher losses in our auto loan portfolio due to recent growth and declines in used car auction prices, as well as higher charge-offs in our taxi medallion lending portfolio.Our 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 3 basis points to 3.24% as of September 30, 2017 from December 31, 2016 primarily due to growth in our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios, as well as the impact of the transfer of certain nonperforming loans in our home loan portfolio from loans held for investment to loans held for sale, partially offset by higher domestic credit card and auto delinquency inventories.We provide additional information on our credit quality metrics below under “MD&A—Business Segment Financial Performance” and “MD&A —Credit Risk Profile.”•Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses: Our allowance for loan and lease losses increased by $915 million to $7.4 billion as of September 30, 2017 from December 31, 2016, and the allowance coverage ratio increased by 29 basis points to 2.94% as of September 30, 2017 from December 31, 2016. The increases were primarily driven by:◦an allowance build in our domestic credit card loan portfolio primarily due to increasing losses from recent vintages and portfolio seasoning, as well as an initial quarterly allowance build related to the loans acquired in the Cabela’s acquisition; ◦an allowance build in our auto loan portfolio due to higher losses associated with growth; and◦an allowance build for estimated hurricane-related losses.These increases were partially offset by an allowance decrease in our commercial loan portfolio due to charge-offs in our taxi medallion lending portfolio.Business Outlook We discuss below our current expectations regarding our total company performance and the performance of each of our business segments over the near-term based on market conditions, the regulatory environment and our business strategies as of the time we filed this Report. The statements contained in this section are based on our current expectations regarding our outlook for our financial results and business strategies. Our expectations take into account, and should be read in conjunction with, our expectations regarding economic trends and analysis of our business as discussed in “Part I—Item 1. Business” and “MD&A” in our 2016 Form 10-K. Certain statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise disclosed, forward-looking statements do not reflect: 6Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents•any change in current dividend or repurchase strategies;•the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures or similar transactions that have not been previously disclosed; or•any changes in laws, regulations or regulatory interpretations, in each case after the date as of which such statements are made.See “MD&A—Forward-Looking Statements” in this Report for more information on the forward-looking statements included in this Report and “Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2016 Form 10-K for factors that could materially influence our results.Total Company ExpectationsWe expect annual efficiency ratio for 2017, excluding adjusting items, will be in the low 51%s.We expect to deliver earnings per share growth, excluding adjusting items, between 7% and 11% in 2017, assuming no substantial change in the broader credit and economic cycles. We expect to deliver solid earnings per share growth in 2018, excluding adjusting items, assuming no substantial change in the broader credit and economic cycles.We believe our actions have created a well-positioned balance sheet with strong capital and liquidity. We believe that we are currently at the destination capital ratios appropriate for our current balance sheet mix. On June 28, 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.85 billion of shares of our common stock from the third quarter of 2017 through the end of the second quarter of 2018 as part of the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program. The timing and exact amount of any common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including market conditions, opportunities for growth and utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time. See “MD&A—Capital Management—Dividend Policy and Stock Purchases” for more information.Business Segment ExpectationsCredit Card: In our Domestic Card business, we expect the full-year 2017 charge-off rate will be at the high end of the high 4%s to around 5% range, whether or not the impact from the Cabela’s acquisition is considered. We expect the impact of the Cabela’s acquisition to be favorable to the full-year 2017 charge-off rate in our Domestic Card business by single-digit basis points. Going forward, we expect the impact of the Cabela’s acquisition to reduce the 30+ day performing delinquency rate in our Domestic Card business by approximately 15 basis points, the charge-off rate in our Domestic Card business by approximately 25 basis points, and revenue margin in our Domestic Card business by approximately 65 basis points, all else being equal. We expect the impacts of the upward pressure on charge-offs as new loan balances in our front book season and become a larger proportion of our overall portfolio relative to the older and highly seasoned back book, will continue to moderate with a small impact in 2018. As the impact of front book seasoning moderates, our delinquency and charge-off rate trends will be driven primarily by broader industry factors.Consumer Banking: In our Consumer Banking business, we expect that the charge-off rate in our auto finance business will increase gradually and the growth we have experienced in that business will moderate.Commercial Banking: In our Commercial Banking business, we expect credit pressures will continue to be focused in our oil field service and taxi medallion lending portfolios.CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe section below provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated financial performance for the third quarter and first nine months of 2017 and 2016. We provide a discussion of our business segment results in the following section, “MD&A—Business Segment Financial Performance.” You should read this section together with our “MD&A—Executive Summary and Business Outlook,” where we discuss trends and other factors that we expect will affect our future results of operations.Net Interest IncomeNet interest income represents the difference between the interest income, including certain fees, earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense on our interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets, while our interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, and other borrowings. Generally, we include in interest income any past due fees on loans that we  7Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contentsdeem collectible. Our net interest margin, based on our consolidated results, represents the difference between the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, including the notional impact of non-interest-bearing funding. We expect net interest income and our net interest margin to fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 8Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 2 below presents, for each major category of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the average outstanding balance, interest income earned or interest expense incurred, and average yield for the third quarter and first nine months of 2017 and 2016.Table 2: Average Balances, Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin  Three Months Ended September 30,  2017 2016(Dollars in millions) AverageBalance InterestIncome/Expense Average Yield/Rate AverageBalance InterestIncome/Expense Average Yield/RateAssets:            Interest-earning assets:            Loans:(1)            Credit card $102,545 $3,995 15.58% $98,006 $3,598 14.68%Consumer banking 75,645 1,280 6.77 71,957 1,150 6.39Commercial banking(2) 68,777 684 3.98 67,028 584 3.49Other(3) 55 1 7.27 76 51 268.42Total loans, including loans held for sale 247,022 5,960 9.65 237,067 5,383 9.08Investment securities 69,302 431 2.49 66,291 386 2.33Cash equivalents and other interest-earning assets 5,691 29 2.04 7,629 25 1.31Total interest-earning assets 322,015 6,420 7.97 310,987 5,794 7.45Cash and due from banks 3,336     3,182    Allowance for loan and lease losses (7,180)     (5,883)    Premises and equipment, net 3,983     3,655    Other assets 33,037     31,212    Total assets $355,191     $343,153    Liabilities and stockholders’ equity:            Interest-bearing liabilities:(3)            Deposits $213,137 $410 0.77% $196,913 $306 0.62%Securitized debt obligations 17,598 85 1.93 17,389 56 1.29Senior and subordinated notes 28,753 194 2.70 22,342 121 2.17Other borrowings and liabilities 9,320 31 1.33 21,840 34 0.62Total interest-bearing liabilities 268,808 720 1.07 258,484 517 0.80Non-interest-bearing deposits 25,706     25,338    Other liabilities 10,501     10,298    Total liabilities 305,015     294,120    Stockholders’ equity 50,176     49,033    Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $355,191     $343,153    Net interest income/spread $5,700 6.90   $5,277 6.65Impact of non-interest-bearing funding 0.18     0.14Net interest margin 7.08%     6.79% 9Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents  Nine Months Ended September 30,  2017 2016(Dollars in millions) AverageBalance InterestIncome/Expense Average Yield/Rate AverageBalance InterestIncome/Expense Average Yield/RateAssets:            Interest-earning assets:            Loans:(1)            Credit card $101,258 $11,572 15.24% $95,190 $10,411 14.58%Consumer banking 74,607 3,693 6.60 71,192 3,354 6.28Commercial banking(2) 68,171 1,946 3.81 65,600 1,691 3.44Other(3) 61 44 96.17 82 160 260.16Total loans, including loans held for sale 244,097 17,255 9.43 232,064 15,616 8.97Investment securities 68,862 1,280 2.48 65,735 1,206 2.45Cash equivalents and other interest-earning assets 6,538 83 1.69 6,624 60 1.21Total interest-earning assets 319,497 18,618 7.77 304,423 16,882 7.39Cash and due from banks 3,378     3,222    Allowance for loan and lease losses (6,894)     (5,481)    Premises and equipment, net 3,879     3,647    Other assets 32,356     30,728    Total assets $352,216     $336,539    Liabilities and stockholders’ equity:            Interest-bearing liabilities:(3)            Deposits $213,508 $1,145 0.72% $195,565 $881 0.60%Securitized debt obligations 17,726 236 1.78 15,997 151 1.26Senior and subordinated notes 27,140 522 2.56 22,019 338 2.05Other borrowings and liabilities 8,434 68 1.08 19,099 86 0.60Total interest-bearing liabilities 266,808 1,971 0.98 $252,680 1,456 0.77Non-interest-bearing deposits 25,808     25,299    Other liabilities 10,468     9,545    Total liabilities 303,084     287,524    Stockholders’ equity 49,132     49,015    Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $352,216     $336,539    Net interest income/spread $16,647 6.79   $15,426 6.62Impact of non-interest-bearing funding 0.16     0.14Net interest margin 6.95%     6.76%__________(1)  Past due fees included in interest income totaled approximately $413 million and $1.2 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2017, respectively, and $390 million and $1.1 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively.(2) Some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits.

Net interest margin increased by 29 basis points to 7.08% in the third quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2016 and increased by 19 basis points to 6.95% in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the first nine months of 2016. These increases were primarily driven by:•growth in our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios; and•higher yields as a result of higher interest rates.These increases were partially offset by:•higher interest expense due to the net effect of higher interest rates, as well as growth and mix changes in our interest-bearing liabilities; and•one less day in the first nine months of 2017.Table 3 displays the change in our net interest income between periods and the extent to which the variance is attributable to:•changes in the volume of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; or•changes in the interest rates related to these assets and liabilities.Table 3: Rate/Volume Analysis of Net Interest Income(1)   Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,  2017 vs. 2016 2017 vs. 2016(Dollars in millions) Total Variance Volume Rate Total Variance Volume RateInterest income:            Loans:            Credit card $397 $171 $226 $1,161 $681 $480Consumer banking 130 60 70 339 165 174Commercial banking(2) 100 16 84 255 68 187Other (50) (10) (40) (116) (32) (84)Total loans, including loans held for sale 577 237 340 1,639 882 757Investment securities 45 18 27 74 58 16Cash equivalents and other interest-earning assets 4 (7) 11 23 (1) 24Total interest income 626 248 378 1,736 939 797Interest expense:            Deposits 104 26 78 264 85 179Securitized debt obligations 29 1 28 85 18 67Senior and subordinated notes 73 39 34 184 87 97Other borrowings and liabilities (3) (19) 16 (18) (48) 30Total interest expense 203 47 156 515 142 373Net interest income $423 $201 $222 $1,221 $797 $424 __________(1) We calculate the change in interest income and interest expense separately for each item. The portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate is allocated proportionately when the calculation results in a positive value. When the portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate results in a negative value, the total amount is allocated to volume or rate, depending on which amount is positive.(2) Some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits. Accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory rate of 35% with offsetting reclassifications to the Other category.  11Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsNon-Interest IncomeNon-interest income primarily consists of interchange fees net of rewards expense, service charges and other customer-related fees and other non-interest income. Other non-interest income includes the pre-tax net benefit (provision) for mortgage representation and warranty losses related to continuing operations, gains and losses on free-standing derivatives not accounted for in hedge accounting relationships and hedge ineffectiveness.Table 4 displays the components of non-interest income for the third quarter and first nine months of 2017 and 2016.

The primary net effects of the reclassifications compared to previously reported results were (i) an increase to Service charges and other customer-related fees of $30 million and $71 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively; and (ii) a decrease to Other non-interest income of $31 million and $87 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. We have also consolidated the Non-interest income presentation of Other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) with net realized gains or losses from investment securities into a new Net securities gains (losses) line. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2016 Form 10-K for additional information.(2) Represents the benefit for mortgage representation and warranty losses recorded in continuing operations.Non-interest income increased by $101 million to $1.3 billion in the third quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2016, and increased by $68 million to $3.6 billion in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the first nine months of 2016 primarily due to:•gains from the sale of investment securities as a result of portfolio repositioning; and•an increase in net interchange fees primarily due to higher purchase volume.Provision for Credit LossesOur provision for credit losses in each period is driven by net charge-offs, changes to the allowance for loan and lease losses and changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $1.8 billion and $5.6 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2017, respectively, compared to $1.6 billion and $4.7 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively. The provision for credit losses as a percentage of net interest income was 32.2% and 33.8% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2017, respectively, compared to 30.1% and 30.5% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively. 12Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsOur provision for credit losses increased by $245 million in the third quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2016 primarily driven by:•higher charge-offs in our domestic credit card loan portfolio due to growth and portfolio seasoning;•higher charge-offs in our commercial loan portfolio due to increased charge-offs in our taxi medallion lending portfolio resulting from declines in taxi medallion values;•an allowance build for estimated hurricane-related losses;•an initial quarterly allowance build related to the loans acquired in the Cabela’s acquisition; and•higher charge-offs in our auto loan portfolio due to recent growth and declines in used car auction prices.Our provision for credit losses increased by $918 million in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the first nine months of 2016 primarily driven by:•higher charge-offs in our domestic credit card loan portfolio due to growth and portfolio seasoning;•a larger allowance build in our domestic credit card loan portfolio due to increasing losses from recent vintages and portfolio seasoning, as well as an initial quarterly allowance build related to the loans acquired in the Cabela’s acquisition; and•higher charge-offs in our auto loan portfolio due to recent growth and declines in used car auction prices.We provide additional information on the provision for credit losses and changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses within “MD&A—Credit Risk Profile,” “Note 4—Loans” and “Note 5—Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments.” For information on the allowance methodology for each of our loan categories, see “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2016 Form 10-K.Non-Interest ExpenseNon-interest expense consists of operating expenses related to continuing operations, such as salaries and associate benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, professional services, communications and data processing expenses and other non-interest expenses, as well as marketing costs and amortization of intangibles.Table 5 displays the components of non-interest expense for the third quarter and first nine months of 2017 and 2016.Table 5: Non-Interest Expense  Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,(Dollars in millions) 2017 2016(1) 2017 2016(1)Salaries and associate benefits $1,524 $1,317 $4,378 $3,866Occupancy and equipment 471 499 1,416 1,422Marketing 379 393 1,210 1,236Professional services 297 257 823 762Communications and data processing 294 291 871 873Amortization of intangibles 61 89 184 285Other non-interest expense:        Collections 93 76 266 234Fraud losses 89 77 245 256Bankcard, regulatory and other fee assessments 156 163 438 399Other 203 199 584 546Total other non-interest expense 541 515 1,533 1,435Total non-interest expense $3,567 $3,361 $10,415 $9,879__________(1) We made certain non-interest expense reclassifications in the fourth quarter of 2016 to conform to the current period presentation. The net effects of the reclassifications for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to previously reported results were increases to Communications and  13Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contentsdata processing expense of $39 million and $116 million, respectively, with corresponding decreases to Professional services. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2016 Form 10-K for additional information.Non-interest expense increased by $206 million to $3.6 billion in the third quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2016, and increased by $536 million to $10.4 billion in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the first nine months of 2016 primarily due to:•higher operating expenses associated with loan growth, as well as continued investments in technology and infrastructure; and•restructuring activities, which primarily consisted of severance and related benefits pursuant to our ongoing benefit programs, that are the result of exiting certain business activities and locations.These increases were partially offset by lower amortization of intangibles.Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of TaxIncome (loss) from discontinued operations consists of results from the discontinued mortgage origination operations of our wholesale mortgage banking unit, GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, Inc. (“GreenPoint”) and the discontinued manufactured housing operations of GreenPoint Credit, LLC, a subsidiary of GreenPoint, both of which were acquired as part of the North Fork Bancorporation, Inc. (“North Fork”) acquisition in December 2006. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $30 million and $26 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2017, respectively, and $11 million and $17 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively. We recorded a provision related to our mortgage representation and warranty reserve, net of tax, of $10 million ($13 million before tax) in the third quarter of 2017. We had a benefit, net of tax, of $30 million ($48 million before tax) in the first nine months of 2017 primarily as a result of a release in this reserve due to favorable legal developments.We provide additional information on the discontinued operations in “Note 2—Discontinued Operations” and on the net benefit (provision) for mortgage representation and warranty losses and the related reserve for representation and warranty claims in “MD&A—Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis—Mortgage Representation and Warranty Reserve” and “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others.”Income TaxesWe recorded income tax provisions of $448 million (28.3% effective income tax rate) and $1.2 billion (28.8% effective income tax rate) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2017, respectively, compared to $496 million (32.8% effective income tax rate) and $1.4 billion (31.5% effective income tax rate) in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations varies between periods due, in part, to fluctuations in our pre-tax earnings, which affects the relative tax benefit of tax-exempt income, tax credits and other permanent tax items.The decrease in our effective income tax rate in the third quarter of 2017 and first nine months of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2016 and first nine months of 2016 was primarily due to:•increases in the relative benefit of tax exempt income and tax credits; •increased benefits of lower taxed foreign earnings; and•increased discrete tax benefits. We provide additional information on items affecting our income taxes and effective tax rate under “Note 16—Income Taxes” in our 2016 Form 10-K. 14Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ANALYSISTotal assets increased by $4.4 billion to $361.4 billion as of September 30, 2017 from December 31, 2016 primarily driven by an increase in loans held for investment due to growth in our auto and domestic credit card loan portfolios, including loans acquired in the Cabela’s acquisition. This increase was partially offset by expected seasonal paydowns in our domestic credit card loan portfolio.Total liabilities increased by $1.7 billion to $311.2 billion as of September 30, 2017 from December 31, 2016 primarily driven by:•an increase in deposits; and•an increase in our senior and subordinated notes.These drivers were partially offset by a decrease in our Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLB”) advances outstanding, which is included in other debt.Stockholders’ equity increased by $2.6 billion to $50.2 billion as of September 30, 2017 from December 31, 2016 primarily due to our net income of $3.0 billion in the first nine months of 2017.This increase was partially offset by:•$773 million of dividend payments to our common and preferred stockholders; and•$236 million of treasury stock purchases. The following is a discussion of material changes in the major components of our assets and liabilities during the first nine months of 2017. Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management activities that are intended to ensure the adequacy of capital while managing the liquidity requirements of the Company, our customers, and our market risk exposure in accordance with our risk appetite. 15Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsInvestment SecuritiesOur investment portfolio consists primarily of the following: U.S. Treasury securities; U.S. government-sponsored enterprise or agency (“Agency”) and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”); Agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”); other asset-backed securities (“ABS”); and other securities. The carrying value of our investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities represented 92% and 91% of our total investment securities as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.The fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio was $39.7 billion as of September 30, 2017, a decrease of $995 million from December 31, 2016. The decrease in fair value was primarily due to sales and paydowns outpacing purchases, partially offset by fair value gains as a result of declines in long-term interest rates. The fair value of our held to maturity securities portfolio was $29.3 billion as of September 30, 2017, an increase of $3.1 billion from December 31, 2016. The increase in fair value was primarily driven by purchases outpacing paydowns.Gross unrealized gains on our available for sale securities portfolio were substantially flat at $590 million as of September 30, 2017 compared to $539 million as of December 31, 2016. Gross unrealized losses on this portfolio decreased to $287 million as of September 30, 2017 compared to $535 million as of December 31, 2016 primarily due to declines in long-term interest rates. Of the $287 million gross unrealized losses as of September 30, 2017, $193 million was related to securities that had been in a loss position for 12 months or longer. 16Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 6 presents the amortized cost, carrying value and fair value for the major categories of our investment securities portfolio as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.Table 6: Investment Securities  September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016(Dollars in millions) AmortizedCost  FairValue AmortizedCost  FairValueInvestment securities available for sale:        U.S. Treasury securities $5,110 $5,139 $5,103 $5,065RMBS:        Agency(1) 26,186 26,039 26,830 26,527Non-agency 1,797 2,199 2,349 2,722Total RMBS 27,983 28,238 29,179 29,249CMBS:        Agency(1) 3,033 3,021 3,335 3,304Non-agency 1,783 1,808 1,676 1,684Total CMBS 4,816 4,829 5,011 4,988Other ABS(2) 546 547 714 714Other securities(3) 984 989 726 721Total investment securities available for sale $39,439 $39,742 $40,733 $40,737         (Dollars in millions) Carrying Value FairValue Carrying Value FairValueInvestment securities held to maturity:        U.S. Treasury securities $199 $199 $199 $199Agency RMBS 24,795 25,397 22,125 22,573Agency CMBS 3,656 3,731 3,388 3,424Total investment securities held to maturity $28,650 $29,327 $25,712 $26,196__________(1) Includes securities guaranteed by Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) and securities issued by Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”).

Table 8 summarizes the carrying value of our portfolio of loans held for investment by portfolio segment, net of the allowance for loan and lease losses, as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.Table 8: Loans Held for Investment   September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016(Dollars in millions) Loans Allowance Net Loans Loans Allowance Net LoansCredit Card $109,130 $5,534 $103,596 $105,552 $4,606 $100,946Consumer Banking 75,564 1,213 74,351 73,054 1,102 71,952Commercial Banking 67,670 669 67,001 66,916 793 66,123Other 58 2 56 64 2 62Total $252,422 $7,418 $245,004 $245,586 $6,503 $239,083Loans held for investment increased by $6.8 billion to $252.4 billion as of September 30, 2017 from December 31, 2016 primarily due to growth in our auto and domestic credit card loan portfolios, including loans acquired in the Cabela’s acquisition, partially offset by expected seasonal paydowns in our domestic credit card loan portfolio and run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio.We provide additional information on the composition of our loan portfolio and credit quality below in “MD&A—Credit Risk Profile,” “MD&A—Consolidated Results of Operations” and “Note 4—Loans.”DepositsOur deposits represent our largest source of funding for our operations and provide a consistent source of low-cost funds. Total deposits increased by $2.3 billion to $239.1 billion as of September 30, 2017. We provide information on the composition of our deposits, average outstanding balances, interest expense and yield in “MD&A—Liquidity Risk Profile.”Securitized Debt ObligationsSecuritized debt obligations decreased to $17.1 billion as of September 30, 2017 from $18.8 billion as of December 31, 2016 as maturities outpaced issuances, partially offset by the securitized debt obligations assumed in the Cabela’s acquisition. We provide additional information on our borrowings in “MD&A—Liquidity Risk Profile” and in “Note 8—Deposits and Borrowings.” 18Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsOther DebtOther debt, which consists primarily of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, senior and subordinated notes, and FHLB advances, totaled $42.4 billion as of September 30, 2017, of which $41.6 billion represented long-term debt and the remainder represented short-term borrowings. Other debt totaled $41.6 billion as of December 31, 2016, of which $40.6 billion represented long-term debt and the remainder represented short-term borrowings. The increase in other debt of $737 million in the first nine months of 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase in our senior and subordinated notes, partially offset by a decrease in our FHLB advances outstanding. We provide additional information on our borrowings in “MD&A—Liquidity Risk Profile” and in “Note 8—Deposits and Borrowings.”Mortgage Representation and Warranty ReserveWe acquired three subsidiaries that originated residential mortgage loans and sold these loans to various purchasers, including purchasers who created securitization trusts. These subsidiaries are Capital One Home Loans, LLC, which was acquired in February 2005; GreenPoint, which was acquired in December 2006 as part of the North Fork acquisition; and Chevy Chase Bank, F.S.B. (“CCB”), which was acquired in February 2009 and subsequently merged into CONA.We establish representation and warranty reserves for losses associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable. These reserves are reported on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities. The reserve setting process relies heavily on estimates, which are inherently uncertain, and requires judgment. We evaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis. We build our representation and warranty reserves through the provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses, which we report in our consolidated statements of income as a component of non-interest income for loans originated and sold by CCB and Capital One Home Loans, LLC and as a component of discontinued operations for loans originated and sold by GreenPoint. The aggregate reserve for all three entities decreased to $401 million as of September 30, 2017 compared to $630 million as of December 31, 2016 primarily due to the resolution of several legal matters.As part of our business planning processes, we have considered various outcomes relating to the future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are possible but do not rise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying an incremental reserve under applicable accounting standards. Our current best estimate of reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond what was in our reserve as of September 30, 2017 is approximately $550 million, a decrease from our estimate of $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2016 primarily due to the resolution of several legal matters. The remaining representation and warranty reserve relates almost entirely to outstanding litigation matters. We provide additional information related to the representation and warranty reserve, including factors that may impact the adequacy of the reserve and the ultimate amount of losses incurred by our subsidiaries, in “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others.” OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In the ordinary course of business, we engage in certain activities that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, generally referred to as off-balance sheet arrangements. These activities typically involve transactions with unconsolidated variable interest entities (“VIEs”) as well as other arrangements, such as letter of credits, loan commitments and guarantees, to meet the financing needs of our customers and support their ongoing operations. We provide additional information regarding these types of activities in the “MD&A—Liquidity Risk Profile” as well as “Note 6—Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations” and “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others.”BUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEOur principal operations are organized into three major business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group, are included in the Other category. 19Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsThe results of our individual businesses, which we report on a continuing operations basis, reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. We provide additional information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in “Note 18—Business Segments” in our 2016 Form 10-K.We refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our “managed” presentation, which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on U.S. GAAP. There is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to U.S. GAAP; therefore, the managed presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial services companies. In addition, our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Below we summarize our business segment results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2017 and 2016 and provide a comparative discussion of these results, as well as changes in our financial condition and credit performance metrics as of September 30, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016. We provide a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated results in “Note 13—Business Segments.” Additionally, we provide information on the outlook for each of our business segments as described above in “MD&A—Executive Summary and Business Outlook.”Business Segment Financial PerformanceTable 9 summarizes our business segment results, which we report based on revenue and income from continuing operations, for the third quarter and first nine months of 2017 and 2016.

Accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory tax rate of 35% with offsetting reclassifications to the Other category. (4) The Other category includes the residual impact of the allocation of our centralized Corporate Treasury group activities, unallocated corporate expenses such as restructuring charges that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance, and other items as described in “Note 18—Business Segments” in our 2016 Form 10-K.Credit Card BusinessThe primary sources of revenue for our Credit Card business are interest income, net interchange income and fees collected from customers. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs and marketing expenses.Our Credit Card business generated net income from continuing operations of $572 million and $1.4 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2017, respectively, and $555 million and $1.6 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively. 21Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 10 summarizes the financial results of our Credit Card business and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.Table 10: Credit Card Business Results  Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,(Dollars in millions, except as noted) 2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 ChangeSelected income statement data:            Net interest income $3,440 $3,204 7 % $10,080 $9,282 9 %Non-interest income 865 825 5 2,478 2,531 (2)Total net revenue(1) 4,305 4,029 7 12,558 11,813 6Provision for credit losses 1,466 1,272 15 4,580 3,604 27Non-interest expense 1,961 1,884 4 5,808 5,630 3Income from continuing operations before income taxes 878 873 1 2,170 2,579 (16)Income tax provision 306 318 (4) 774 931 (17)Income from continuing operations, net of tax $572 $555 3 $1,396 $1,648 (15)Selected performance metrics:            Average loans held for investment(2) $102,545 $98,016 5 $101,258 $95,139 6Average yield on loans held for investment(3) 15.58% 14.68% 90bps 15.24% 14.59% 65bpsTotal net revenue margin(4) 16.79 16.44 35 16.54 16.56 (2)Net charge-offs $1,155 $906 27 % $3,682 $2,805 31 %Net charge-off rate 4.51% 3.70% 81bps 4.85% 3.93% 92bpsPurchased credit card relationship (“PCCR”) intangible amortization $43 $62 (31)% $131 $199 (34)%Purchase volume(5) 84,505 78,106 8 240,781 224,314 7             (Dollars in millions, except as noted) September 30,2017 December 31, 2016 Change      Selected period-end data:            Loans held for investment(2) $109,130 $105,552 3 %     30+ day performing delinquency rate 3.91% 3.91% —     30+ day delinquency rate 3.92 3.94 (2)bps     Nonperforming loan rate(6) 0.02 0.04 (2)     Allowance for loan and lease losses $5,534 $4,606 20 %     Allowance coverage ratio(7) 5.07% 4.36% 71bps     __________(1) We recognize billed finance charges and fee income on open-ended loans in accordance with the contractual provisions of the credit arrangements and estimate the uncollectible amount on a quarterly basis. The estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees is reflected as a reduction in revenue and is not included in our net charge-offs. Total net revenue was reduced by $356 million and $990 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2017, respectively, and by $289 million and $761 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively, for the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees and related losses. The finance charge and fee reserve totaled $470 million and $402 million as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.(2) Period-end loans held for investment and average loans held for investment include billed finance charges and fees, net of the estimated uncollectible amount.(3) Average yield on loans held for investment is calculated by dividing annualized interest income for the period by average loans held for investment during the period. Interest income excludes various allocations including funds transfer pricing that assigns certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses attributable to each business segment. (4) Total net revenue margin is calculated by dividing annualized total net revenue for the period by average loans held for investment during the period. Interest income also includes interest income on loans held for sale. (5) Purchase volume consists of purchase transactions, net of returns, for the period for loans both classified as held for investment and held for sale. Excludes cash advance and balance transfer transactions. (6) Within our credit card loan portfolio, only certain loans in our international card businesses are classified as nonperforming. See “MD&A—Nonperforming Loans and Other Nonperforming Assets” for additional information.(7) Allowance coverage ratio is calculated by dividing the period-end allowance for loan and lease losses by period-end loans held for investment. 22Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsKey factors affecting the results of our Credit Card business for the third quarter and first nine months of 2017 compared to the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 include the following:•Net Interest Income: Net interest income increased by $236 million to $3.4 billion in the third quarter of 2017 and increased by $798 million to $10.1 billion in the first nine months of 2017 primarily driven by:◦loan growth in our Domestic Card business; and◦the absence of a U.K. payment protection insurance customer refund reserve (“U.K. PPI Reserve”) build in the second and third quarters of 2017.•Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income increased by $40 million to $865 million in the third quarter of 2017 substantially driven by an increase in net interchange fees primarily due to higher purchase volume.Non-interest income decreased by $53 million to $2.5 billion in the first nine months of 2017 primarily driven by:◦lower service charges and other customer-related fees primarily due to the exit of our legacy payment protection products in our Domestic Card business during the first quarter of 2016; and◦the absence of a gain recorded in the second quarter of 2016 related to the exchange of our ownership interest in Visa Europe with Visa Inc. as a result of Visa Inc.’s acquisition of Visa Europe. These drivers were partially offset by an increase in net interchange fees primarily due to higher purchase volume.•Provision for Credit Losses: The provision for credit losses increased by $194 million to $1.5 billion in the third quarter of 2017 primarily driven by:◦higher charge-offs due to growth and portfolio seasoning; and◦an initial quarterly allowance build related to the loans acquired in the Cabela’s acquisition.These drivers were partially offset by a smaller allowance build in our domestic credit card loan portfolio, excluding Cabela’s, compared to the third quarter of 2016.The provision for credit losses increased by $976 million to $4.6 billion in the first nine months of 2017 primarily driven by:◦higher charge-offs due to growth and portfolio seasoning; and◦a larger allowance build in our domestic credit card loan portfolio due to increasing losses from recent vintages and portfolio seasoning.•Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $77 million to $2.0 billion in the third quarter of 2017, and increased by $178 million to $5.8 billion in the first nine months of 2017, primarily driven by higher operating expenses associated with loan growth and continued investments in technology and infrastructure, as well as costs associated with closing the Cabela’s acquisition.This driver was partially offset by:◦operating efficiencies; ◦lower amortization of intangibles; and◦lower marketing expenses.•Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment increased by $3.6 billion to $109.1 billion as of September 30, 2017 from December 31, 2016 primarily due to the Cabela’s acquisition and continued loan growth in our Domestic Card business, partially offset by expected seasonal paydowns. Average loans held for investment increased by $4.5 billion to $102.5 billion in the third quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2016 and increased by $6.1 billion  23Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contentsto $101.3 billion in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the first nine months of 2016 primarily due to growth in our domestic credit card loan portfolio. •Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: The net charge-off rate increased by 81 basis points to 4.51% in the third quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2016 and increased by 92 basis points to 4.85% in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the first nine months of 2016 primarily driven by growth and seasoning of recent domestic credit card loan originations. The 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 2 basis points to 3.92% as of September 30, 2017 from December 31, 2016 primarily due to the impact of the loans acquired in the Cabela’s acquisition, partially offset by higher delinquency inventories.Domestic Card BusinessDomestic Card generated net income from continuing operations of $475 million and $1.2 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2017, respectively, compared to net income from continuing operations of $527 million and $1.6 billion in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2017 and 2016, Domestic Card accounted for greater than 90% of total net revenue of our Credit Card business. 24Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 10.1 summarizes the financial results for Domestic Card and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.Table 10.1: Domestic Card Business Results  Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,(Dollars in millions, except as noted) 2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 ChangeSelected income statement data:            Net interest income $3,132 $2,956 6 % $9,236 $8,481 9 %Non-interest income 787 759 4 2,288 2,325 (2)Total net revenue(1) 3,919 3,715 5 11,524 10,806 7Provision for credit losses 1,417 1,190 19 4,381 3,326 32Non-interest expense 1,754 1,696 3 5,198 5,036 3Income from continuing operations before income taxes 748 829 (10) 1,945 2,444 (20)Income tax provision 273 302 (10) 710 890 (20)Income from continuing operations, net of tax $475 $527 (10) $1,235 $1,554 (21)Selected performance metrics:            Average loans held for investment(2) $93,729 $89,763 4 $92,847 $86,974 7Average yield on loans held for investment(3) 15.51% 14.71% 80bps 15.20% 14.51% 69bpsTotal net revenue margin(4) 16.72 16.55 17 16.55 16.57 (2)Net charge-offs $1,087 $841 29 % $3,455 $2,602 33 %Net charge-off rate 4.64% 3.74% 90bps 4.96% 3.99% 97bpsPCCR intangible amortization $43 $62 (31)% $131 $199 (34)%Purchase volume(5) 76,806 71,331 8 219,537 204,998 7             (Dollars in millions, except as noted) September 30,2017 December 31, 2016 Change      Selected period-end data:            Loans held for investment(2) $99,981 $97,120 3 %      30+ day delinquency rate 3.94% 3.95% (1)bps      Allowance for loan and lease losses $5,155 $4,229 22 %      Allowance coverage ratio(6) 5.16% 4.35% 81bps      __________(1) We recognize billed finance charges and fee income on open-ended loans in accordance with the contractual provisions of the credit arrangements and estimate the uncollectible amount on a quarterly basis.

Net income for our Domestic Card business decreased in the third quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2016 and decreased in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the first nine months of 2016 primarily driven by:•higher provision for credit losses, including an initial quarterly allowance build related to the loans acquired in the Cabela’s acquisition; and•higher operating expenses associated with loan growth and continued investments in technology and infrastructure, as well as costs associated with closing the Cabela’s acquisition. 25Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsThese drivers were partially offset by:•higher net interest income resulting from loan growth; and•lower marketing expenses.Consumer Banking BusinessThe primary sources of revenue for our Consumer Banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits and non-interest income from service charges and customer-related fees. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs and marketing expenses.Our Consumer Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $316 million and $840 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2017, respectively, and $244 million and $750 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively.Table 11 summarizes the financial results of our Consumer Banking business and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated. 26Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 11: Consumer Banking Business Results   Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,(Dollars in millions, except as noted) 2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 ChangeSelected income statement data:            Net interest income $1,649 $1,472 12 % $4,744 $4,331 10 %Non-interest income 192 201 (4) 570 567 1Total net revenue 1,841 1,673 10 5,314 4,898 8Provision for credit losses 293 256 14 840 690 22Non-interest expense 1,051 1,034 2 3,152 3,030 4Income from continuing operations before income taxes 497 383 30 1,322 1,178 12Income tax provision  181 139 30 482 428 13Income from continuing operations, net of tax $316 $244 30 $840 $750 12Selected performance metrics:            Average loans held for investment:(1)            Auto $52,615 $45,355 16 $50,711 $43,647 16Home loan 19,302 22,852 (16) 20,211 23,819 (15)Retail banking 3,446 3,520 (2) 3,473 3,540 (2)Total consumer banking $75,363 $71,727 5 $74,395 $71,006 5Average yield on loans held for investment(2) 6.79% 6.41% 38bps 6.61% 6.29% 32bpsAverage deposits $185,072 $177,402 4 % $185,336 $176,159 5 %Average deposits interest rate 0.62% 0.56% 6bps 0.60% 0.55% 5bpsNet charge-offs $276 $227 22 % $726 $556 31 %Net charge-off rate 1.47% 1.26% 21bps 1.30% 1.04% 26bpsNet charge-off rate (excluding PCI loans)(3) 1.74 1.62 12 1.57 1.37 20Auto loan originations $7,043 $6,804 4 % $21,521 $19,177 12 %             (Dollars in millions, except as noted) September 30,2017 December 31, 2016 Change      Selected period-end data:            Loans held for investment:(1)            Auto $53,290 $47,916 11 %      Home loan 18,820 21,584 (13)      Retail banking 3,454 3,554 (3)      Total consumer banking $75,564 $73,054 3      30+ day performing delinquency rate 4.10% 4.10% —      30+ day performing delinquency rate (excluding PCI loans)(3) 4.84 5.12 (28)bps      30+ day delinquency rate 4.61 4.67 (6)      30+ day delinquency rate (excluding PCI loans)(3) 5.44 5.82 (38)      Nonperforming loan rate 0.71 0.72 (1)      Nonperforming loan rate (excluding PCI loans)(3) 0.84 0.90 (6)      Nonperforming asset rate(4) 0.88 1.09 (21)      Nonperforming asset rate (excluding PCI loans)(3)(4) 1.03 1.36 (33)      Allowance for loan and lease losses $1,213 $1,102 10 %      Allowance coverage ratio(5)(6) 1.61% 1.51% 10bps      Deposits $184,719 $181,917 2 %      Loans serviced for others(7) 8,752 8,258 6      __________(1) Average consumer banking loans held for investment includes purchased credit-impaired loans (“PCI loans”) of $11.7 billion and $15.9 billion in the third quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $12.8 billion and $16.9 billion in the first nine months of 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The increases were primarily driven by changes in the product mix in Consumer Banking as a result of growth in our auto loan portfolio and run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio.•Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income was substantially flat at $192 million and $570 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2017, respectively.•Provision for Credit Losses: The provision for credit losses increased by $37 million to $293 million in the third quarter of 2017 and increased by $150 million to $840 million in the first nine months of 2017 primarily driven by:◦higher charge-offs in our auto loan portfolio due to recent growth and declines in used car auction prices, as well as changes in our charge-off practices for certain loans; and◦an allowance build for estimated hurricane-related losses.•Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $17 million to $1.1 billion in the third quarter of 2017 and increased by $122 million to $3.2 billion in the first nine months of 2017 primarily due to higher operating expenses driven by growth in our auto loan portfolio and continued investment in technology and infrastructure.•Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment increased by $2.5 billion to $75.6 billion as of September 30, 2017 from December 31, 2016, and average loans held for investment increased by $3.6 billion to $75.4 billion in the third quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2016 and increased by $3.4 billion to $74.4 billion in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the first nine months of 2016. These increases were due to growth in our auto loan portfolio, partially offset by run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio.•Deposits: Period-end deposits increased by $2.8 billion to $184.7 billion as of September 30, 2017 from December 31, 2016.•Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: The net charge-off rate increased by 21 basis points to 1.47% in the third quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2016, and increased by 26 basis points to 1.30% in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the first nine months of 2016. The increases were driven by:◦higher losses in our auto loan portfolio due to recent growth and declines in used car auction prices, as well as changes in our charge-off practices for certain loans; and◦a greater portion of auto loans in our total consumer banking loan portfolio, which generally have higher charge-off rates than other products within this portfolio.The 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 6 basis points to 4.61% as of September 30, 2017 from December 31, 2016 primarily attributable to: 28Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents◦growth in our auto loan portfolio; and◦the impact of the transfer of certain nonperforming loans in our home loan portfolio from loans held for investment to loans held for sale.These drivers were partially offset by higher auto delinquency inventories.Commercial Banking BusinessThe primary sources of revenue for our Commercial Banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits and non-interest income from customer fees and other transactions. Because we have some investments that generate tax-exempt income or tax credits, we make certain reclassifications to our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues on a taxable-equivalent basis. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs and marketing expenses.Our Commercial Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $179 million and $538 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2017, respectively, and $191 million and $396 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016, respectively.

These increases were driven by growth across our commercial loan portfolios.•Deposits: Period-end deposits decreased by $1.1 billion to $32.8 billion as of September 30, 2017 from December 31, 2016. •Net Charge-Off and Nonperforming Metrics: The net charge-off rate increased by 30 basis points to 0.96% in the third quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2016 and increased by 20 basis points to 0.64% in the first nine months of 2017 compared to the first nine months of 2016 driven by higher charge-offs in our taxi medallion lending portfolio resulting from declines in taxi medallion values and the downgrade of our remaining taxi medallion lending portfolio to nonperforming classification.The nonperforming loan rate decreased by 37 basis points to 1.16% as of September 30, 2017 from December 31, 2016 primarily due to improved credit risk ratings and charge-offs in our oil and gas portfolio as well as charge-offs in our taxi medallion lending portfolio, partially offset by the downgrade of our remaining taxi medallion lending portfolio to nonperforming classification.Other CategoryOther includes unallocated amounts related to our centralized Corporate Treasury group activities, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio, asset/liability management and certain capital management activities.

Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We provide a summary of our significant accounting policies under “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2016 Form 10-K. We have identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. These critical accounting policies govern:•Loan loss reserves•Asset impairment•Fair value of financial instruments•Representation and warranty reserves•Customer rewards reserveWe evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them, as necessary, based on changing conditions. Management has discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since the 2016 Form 10-K.We provide additional information on our critical accounting policies and estimates under “MD&A—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our 2016 Form 10-K.ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTSSee “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for information on accounting standards adopted in 2017, as well as recently issued accounting standards not yet required to be adopted and the expected impact of these changes in accounting standards.CAPITAL MANAGEMENTThe level and composition of our capital are determined by multiple factors, including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements and internal risk-based capital assessments such as internal stress testing and economic capital. The level and composition of our capital may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment, conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments.Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective ActionWe are subject to capital adequacy standards adopted by the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) (collectively, the “Federal Banking Agencies”), including the capital rules that implemented the Basel III capital framework (“Basel III Capital Rule”) developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“Basel Committee”). Moreover, the Banks, as insured depository institutions, are subject to prompt corrective action (“PCA”) capital regulations.In July 2013, the Federal Banking Agencies adopted the Basel III Capital Rule, which, in addition to implementing the Basel III capital framework, also implemented certain Dodd-Frank Act and other capital provisions, and updated the PCA capital framework to reflect the new regulatory capital minimums. The Basel III Capital Rule amended both the Basel I and Basel II Advanced Approaches frameworks, established a new common equity Tier 1 capital requirement and set higher minimum capital ratio requirements. We refer to the amended Basel I framework as the “Basel III Standardized Approach,” and the amended Advanced Approaches framework as the “Basel III Advanced Approaches.”  33Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsAt the end of 2012, we met one of the two independent eligibility criteria set by banking regulators for becoming subject to the Advanced Approaches capital rules. As a result, we have undertaken a multi-year process of implementing the Advanced Approaches regime for calculating risk-weighted assets and regulatory capital levels. We entered parallel run under Advanced Approaches on January 1, 2015, during which we are required to calculate capital ratios under both the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches, though we continue to use the Standardized Approach for purposes of meeting regulatory capital requirements. The Basel Committee has proposed, but has not finalized, changes to the Basel III capital framework. There is uncertainty around any final changes that the Basel Committee might adopt and which of those changes thereafter may be adopted in the United States. Additionally, the Federal Banking Agencies have recently proposed, but have not finalized, certain limited changes to the Basel III Capital Rule. There is uncertainty regarding how any of those changes may impact the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches. The Market Risk Rule supplements both the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches by requiring institutions subject to the Market Risk Rule to adjust their risk-based capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading portfolios. The Market Risk Rule generally applies to institutions with aggregate trading assets and liabilities equal to the lesser of (i) 10% or more of total assets or (ii) $1 billion or more. See “MD&A—Market Risk Profile” below for additional information. We began reporting risk-based capital ratios including market risk-weighted assets for the Company and CONA pursuant to the Market Risk Rule for positions covered by such rule in the third quarter of 2016. This change did not have a material impact on the risk-based capital ratios of these two entities. As of September 30, 2017, COBNA is not subject to the Market Risk Rule. For additional information about the capital adequacy guidelines we are subject to, see “Part I—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation” in our 2016 Form 10-K.Table 14 provides a comparison of our regulatory capital ratios under the Basel III Standardized Approach subject to transition provisions, the regulatory minimum capital adequacy ratios and the PCA well-capitalized level for each ratio, where applicable, as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.Table 14: Capital Ratios under Basel III(1)(2)  September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016  CapitalRatio MinimumCapitalAdequacy Well-Capitalized CapitalRatio MinimumCapitalAdequacy Well-CapitalizedCapital One Financial Corp:            Common equity Tier 1 capital(3) 10.7% 4.5% N/A 10.1% 4.5% N/ATier 1 capital(4) 12.2 6.0 6.0% 11.6 6.0 6.0%Total capital(5)  14.8 8.0 10.0 14.3 8.0 10.0Tier 1 leverage(6) 10.5 4.0 N/A 9.9 4.0 N/ASupplementary leverage(7) 9.0 N/A N/A 8.6 N/A N/ACapital One Bank (USA), N.A.:           Common equity Tier 1 capital(3) 12.8% 4.5% 6.5% 12.0% 4.5% 6.5%Tier 1 capital(4) 12.8 6.0 8.0 12.0 6.0 8.0Total capital(5)  15.5 8.0 10.0 14.8 8.0 10.0Tier 1 leverage(6) 11.7 4.0 5.0 10.8 4.0 5.0Supplementary leverage(7) 9.6 N/A N/A 8.9 N/A N/ACapital One, N.A.:           Common equity Tier 1 capital(3) 12.2% 4.5% 6.5% 10.6% 4.5% 6.5%Tier 1 capital(4) 12.2 6.0 8.0 10.6 6.0 8.0Total capital(5)  13.5 8.0 10.0 11.8 8.0 10.0Tier 1 leverage(6) 8.9 4.0 5.0 7.7 4.0 5.0Supplementary leverage(7) 8.0 N/A N/A 6.9 N/A N/A__________  34Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents(1) Capital ratios are calculated based on the Basel III Standardized Approach framework, subject to applicable transition provisions, such as the inclusion of the unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale included in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and adjustments related to intangible assets other than goodwill. The inclusion of AOCI and the adjustments related to intangible assets are phased-in at 60% for 2016, 80% for 2017 and 100% for 2018.(2) Ratios as of September 30, 2017 are preliminary. As we continue to validate our data, the calculations are subject to change until we file our September 30, 2017 Form FR Y-9C—Consolidated Financial Statements for Holding Companies and Call Reports.(3) Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on common equity Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets.(4) Tier 1 capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets.(5) Total capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on total capital divided by risk-weighted assets.(6) Tier 1 leverage ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average assets.(7) Supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by total leverage exposure.In addition to the above statutory capital ratios, we also disclose a non-GAAP TCE ratio in “MD&A—Summary of Selected Financial Data.” This capital measure is not necessarily comparable to similarly-titled capital measures reported by other companies. We provide information on the calculation of this ratio in “MD&A—Table A—Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures and Calculation of Regulatory Capital Measures.” The Company exceeded the minimum capital requirements and each of the Banks exceeded the minimum regulatory requirements and were well capitalized under PCA requirements as of both September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The Basel III Capital Rule requires banks to maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above the regulatory minimum ratios composed of common equity Tier 1 capital. The capital conservation buffer is being phased in over a transition period that commenced on January 1, 2016 and will be fully phased in on January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer is 1.25% in 2017. For banks subject to the Advanced Approaches, including the Company and the Banks, the capital conservation buffer may be supplemented by an incremental countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% (once fully phased-in) composed of common equity Tier 1 capital and set at the discretion of the Federal Banking Agencies. As of September 30, 2017, the countercyclical capital buffer is zero percent in the United States. A determination to increase the countercyclical capital buffer generally would be effective twelve months after the announcement of such an increase, unless the Federal Banking Agencies set an earlier effective date. The countercyclical capital buffer, if set to an amount greater than zero percent, would be subject to the same transition period as the capital conservation buffer, which commenced on January 1, 2016. For 2017, the minimum capital requirement plus capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer for common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios is 5.75%, 7.25% and 9.25%, respectively, for the Company and the Banks. A common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, or total capital ratio below the applicable regulatory minimum ratio plus the applicable capital conservation buffer and the applicable countercyclical buffer (if set to an amount greater than zero percent) might restrict a bank’s ability to distribute capital and make discretionary bonus payments. As of September 30, 2017, the Company and each of the Banks are all above the applicable combined thresholds. Additionally, banks designated as global systemically important banks (“G-SIBs”) are subject to an additional regulatory capital surcharge above the combined capital conservation and countercyclical capital buffers established by the Basel III Capital Rule. We are currently not designated as a G-SIB and therefore not subject to this surcharge. The following table compares our common equity Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as of September 30, 2017, subject to applicable transition provisions, to our estimated fully phased-in common equity Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets, as it applies for Advanced Approaches banks such as ourselves that have not yet exited parallel run. Our estimated common equity Tier 1 capital, risk-weighted assets and common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the fully phased-in Basel III Standardized Approach are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information in evaluating compliance with regulatory capital requirements that are not effective yet. They are calculated based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and are subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. As we continue to engage with our regulators, there could be further changes to the calculation. 35Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 15: Regulatory Capital Reconciliations between Basel III Transition to Fully Phased-in(1) (Dollars in millions) September 30, 2017Common equity Tier 1 capital under Basel III Standardized Approach $31,298Adjustments related to AOCI(2) (84)Adjustments related to intangibles(2) (93)Other adjustments(2) (1)Estimated common equity Tier 1 capital under fully phased-in Basel III Standardized Approach $31,120Risk-weighted assets under Basel III Standardized Approach(3) $292,041Adjustments for fully phased-in Basel III Standardized Approach(4) 1,101Estimated risk-weighted assets under fully phased-in Basel III Standardized Approach $293,142Estimated common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under fully phased-in Basel III Standardized Approach(5) 10.6%__________(1) Estimated common equity Tier 1 capital, risk-weighted assets, and common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the fully phased-in Basel III Standardized Approach are non-GAAP financial measures.(2) Assumes adjustments are fully phased-in.(3) Includes credit and market risk-weighted assets.(4) Adjustments include higher risk weights for items that are included in capital based on the threshold deduction approach, such as mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets. The adjustments also include removal of risk weights for items that are deducted from common equity Tier 1 capital.(5) Estimated common equity Tier 1 capital ratio is calculated by dividing estimated common equity Tier 1 capital by estimated risk-weighted assets, which are both calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach, as it applies when fully phased-in for Advanced Approaches banks that have not yet exited parallel run.Under the Basel III Capital Rule, when we complete our parallel run for the Advanced Approaches, our minimum risk-based capital requirement will be determined by the greater of our risk-weighted assets under the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches. See “Part I—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation” in our 2016 Form 10-K for additional information. Once we exit parallel run, based on clarification of the Basel III Capital Rule from our regulators, any amount by which our expected credit losses exceed eligible credit reserves, as each term is defined under the Basel III Capital Rule, will be deducted from our Basel III Standardized Approach numerator, subject to transition provisions. Inclusive of this impact, based on current capital rules and our business mix, we estimate that our Basel III Advanced Approaches ratios will be lower than our Basel III Standardized Approach ratios. However, there is uncertainty whether this will remain the case in light of potential changes to the United States capital rules. Capital Planning and Regulatory Stress TestingOn June 28, 2017, the Federal Reserve completed its 2017 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) and did not object to our proposed capital plan. As a condition to not objecting to the capital plan, the Federal Reserve has required us to submit a revised capital plan by December 28, 2017 to address certain weaknesses it identified in our capital planning process. If the Federal Reserve objects to the resubmitted capital plan, it may restrict subsequent capital distributions. For the description of the regulatory capital planning rules we are subject to, see “Part I—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation” in our 2016 Form 10-K. During the intervening period we are allowed to proceed with the actions in our capital plan. The Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.85 billion of shares of our common stock from the third quarter of 2017 through the second quarter of 2018, in addition to share repurchases related to employee compensation. The Board of Directors also authorized the quarterly dividend on our common stock of $0.40 per share. Dividend Policy and Stock PurchasesWe paid common stock dividends of $0.40 per share in the third quarter of 2017. The following table summarizes the dividends paid per share on our various preferred stock series in the first nine months of 2017. 36Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 16: Preferred Stock Dividends Paid Per Share Series Description Issuance Date Per Annum Dividend Rate Dividend Frequency 2017 Q3 Q2 Q1Series B 6.00% Non-Cumulative August 20, 2012 6.00% Quarterly $15.00 $15.00 $15.00Series C 6.25% Non-Cumulative June 12, 2014 6.25 Quarterly 15.63 15.63 15.63Series D 6.70% Non-Cumulative October 31, 2014 6.70 Quarterly 16.75 16.75 16.75Series E Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative May 14, 2015 5.55% through 5/31/2020; 3-mo.

As a bank holding company (“BHC”), our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries. Regulatory restrictions exist that limit the ability of the Banks to transfer funds to our BHC. As of September 30, 2017, funds available for dividend payments from COBNA and CONA were $4.6 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends to stockholders.Consistent with our 2017 Stock Repurchase Program, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.85 billion of shares of common stock beginning in the third quarter of 2017 through the end of the second quarter of 2018.The timing and exact amount of any future common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including market conditions, opportunities for growth, our capital position and the amount of retained earnings. Our stock repurchase program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time. For additional information on dividends and stock repurchases, see “Part I—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation—Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Transfer of Funds” in our 2016 Form 10-K.RISK MANAGEMENTRisk FrameworkWe use a risk framework to provide an overall enterprise-wide approach for effectively managing risk. We execute against our risk framework with the “Three Lines of Defense” risk management model to demonstrate and structure the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities in the organization for taking and managing risk. The “First Line of Defense” is comprised of the business areas that through their day-to-day business activities take risk on our behalf. As the business owner, the first line is responsible for identifying, assessing, managing and controlling that risk. This principle places ultimate accountability for the management of risks and ownership of risk decisions with the CEO and business heads. The “Second Line of Defense” provides oversight of first line risk taking and management, and is primarily comprised of our Risk Management organization. The second line assists in determining risk appetite and the strategies, policies and structures for managing risks. The second line is both an “expert advisor” to the first line and an “effective challenger” of first line risk activities. The “Third Line of Defense” is comprised of our Internal Audit and Credit Review functions. The third line provides independent and objective assurance to senior management and to the Board of Directors that first and second line risk management and internal control systems and its governance processes are well-designed and working as intended. 37Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsThe risk framework is also used to guide design of risk programs and performance of risk activity within each risk category and across the entire enterprise. There are eight elements that comprise the risk framework:•Establish Governance Processes, Accountabilities and Risk Appetites •Identify and Assess Risks and Ownership •Develop and Operate Controls, Monitoring and Mitigation Plans  •Test and Detect Control Gaps and Perform Corrective Action •Escalate Key Risks and Gaps to Executive Management and, when Appropriate, the Board of Directors  •Calculate and Allocate Capital in Alignment with Risk Management and Measurement Processes (including Stress Testing) •Support with the Right Culture, Talent and Skills  •Enabled by the Right Data, Infrastructure and Programs  We provide additional discussion of our risk management principles, roles and responsibilities, framework and risk appetite under “MD&A—Risk Management” in our 2016 Form 10-K. CREDIT RISK PROFILEOur loan portfolio accounts for the substantial majority of our credit risk exposure. Our lending activities are governed under our credit policy and are subject to independent review and approval. Below we provide information about the composition of our loan portfolio, key concentrations and credit performance metrics.We also engage in certain non-lending activities that may give rise to credit and counterparty settlement risk, including the purchase of securities for our investment securities portfolio, entering into derivative transactions to manage our market risk exposure and to accommodate customers, short-term advances on syndication activity (including bridge financing transactions we have underwritten), certain operational cash balances in other financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and customer overdrafts. We provide additional information on credit risk related to our investment securities portfolio under “MD&A—Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis—Investment Securities” and credit risk related to derivative transactions in “Note 9—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”Loans Held for Investment Portfolio CompositionWe provide a variety of lending products. Our primary products include credit cards, auto loans, home loans and commercial lending products. For information on our lending policies and procedures, including our underwriting criteria for our primary loan products, see “MD&A—Credit Risk Profile” in our 2016 Form 10-K.Our loan portfolio consists of loans held for investment, including loans held in our consolidated trusts, and loans held for sale. Table 17 presents the composition of our portfolio of loans held for investment, including PCI loans, by portfolio segment as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Table 17 and the credit metrics presented in this section exclude loans held for sale, which are carried at lower of cost or fair value and totaled $1.6 billion and $1.0 billion as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. 38Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 17: Loans Held for Investment Portfolio Composition   September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016(Dollars in millions) Loans % of Total Loans % of TotalCredit Card:        Domestic credit card $99,981 39.6% $97,120 39.6%International card businesses 9,149 3.6 8,432 3.4Total credit card 109,130 43.2 105,552 43.0Consumer Banking:        Auto 53,290 21.1 47,916 19.5Home loan 18,820 7.5 21,584 8.8Retail banking 3,454 1.4 3,554 1.4Total consumer banking 75,564 30.0 73,054 29.7Commercial Banking:        Commercial and multifamily real estate 27,944 11.1 26,609 10.9Commercial and industrial 39,306 15.5 39,824 16.2Total commercial lending 67,250 26.6 66,433 27.1Small-ticket commercial real estate 420 0.2 483 0.2Total commercial banking 67,670 26.8 66,916 27.3Other loans 58 — 64 —Total loans held for investment $252,422 100.0% $245,586 100.0%Commercial LoansFor purposes of portfolio risk management, we aggregate our commercial loan portfolio according to market segmentation primarily based on standard industry codes.

For information on our total unfunded lending commitments see “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others.”(3) Includes our taxi medallion lending portfolio among other portfolios. 39Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsPurchased Credit-Impaired LoansOur portfolio of loans includes certain of our consumer and commercial loans acquired in business acquisitions that were recorded at fair value at acquisition and subsequently accounted for using the guidance for accounting for PCI loans and debt securities, which is based upon expected cash flows. These PCI loans totaled $12.0 billion as of September 30, 2017 compared to $15.1 billion as of December 31, 2016. See “MD&A—Glossary and Acronyms” for the definition of “PCI loans.”The difference between the fair value at acquisition and expected cash flows represents the accretable yield, which is recognized in interest income over the life of the loans. The difference between the contractual payments on the loans and expected cash flows represents the nonaccretable difference, or the amount of principal and interest not considered collectible, which incorporates future expected credit losses over the life of the loans. We regularly update our estimate of expected principal and interest to be collected from these loans and evaluate the results for each accounting pool that was established at acquisition based on loans with common risk characteristics. Probable decreases in expected cash flows would trigger the recognition of an allowance for loan and lease losses through our provision for credit losses. Probable and significant increases in expected cash flows would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan and lease losses established subsequent to acquisition, with any remaining increase in expected cash flows recognized prospectively in interest income over the remaining estimated life of the underlying loans. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2016 Form 10-K for additional information on PCI loans that are accounted for based on expected cash flows.Home LoansThe majority of our home loan portfolio are PCI loans acquired from the ING Direct and CCB acquisitions, representing 61% and 67% of our total home loan portfolio as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. See “MD&A—Glossary and Acronyms” for the definition of “ING Direct acquisition” and “CCB.” The expected cash flows for the PCI loans in our home loan portfolio are significantly impacted by future expectations of home prices and interest rates. Decreases in expected cash flows that result from declining conditions, particularly associated with these variables, could result in an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses and reduction in accretable yield. Charge-offs on these loans are not recorded until the expected credit losses within the nonaccretable difference are depleted. In addition, PCI loans are not classified as delinquent or nonperforming, as we expect to collect our net investment in these loans and the nonaccretable difference is expected to absorb the majority of the losses associated with these loans.Table 19 presents the break out of our total home loan portfolio by lien priority for PCI loans and remaining loans.Table 19: Home Loans—Risk Profile by Lien Priority  September 30, 2017  Loans PCI Loans Total Home Loans(Dollars in millions) Amount % ofTotal Amount % ofTotal Amount % ofTotalLien type:            1st lien $6,414 34.1% $11,193 59.5% $17,607 93.6%2nd lien 976 5.2 237 1.2 1,213 6.4Total $7,390 39.3% $11,430 60.7% $18,820 100.0%  December 31, 2016  Loans PCI Loans Total Home Loans(Dollars in millions) Amount % ofTotal Amount % ofTotal Amount % ofTotalLien type:            1st lien $6,182 28.7% $14,159 65.5% $20,341 94.2%2nd lien 974 4.5 269 1.3 1,243 5.8Total $7,156 33.2% $14,428 66.8% $21,584 100.0%See “Note 4—Loans” in this Report for additional credit quality information.

The analysis reflects a hypothetical decline of 10% in the home price index and its impact on lifetime future cash flow expectations, accretable yield and allowance for loan and lease losses. Any significant economic events or variables not considered could impact the results that are presented below.Table 20: Sensitivity Analysis—PCI Home Loans(1)(Dollars in millions) September 30, 2017 Estimated ImpactIncrease (Decrease)Expected cash flows $13,678 $(16)Accretable yield 2,281 60Allowance for loan and lease losses 33 76__________(1) Changes in the accretable yield would be recognized in interest income in our consolidated statements of income over the life of the loans. Changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses would be recognized immediately in the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income.Credit Risk MeasurementWe closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to assess and manage our exposure to credit risk. Key metrics we track in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming asset rates, as well as net charge-off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger balance commercial loans. Trends in delinquency rates are a primary indicator of credit risk within our consumer loan portfolios, as changes in delinquency rates provide an early warning of changes in credit losses. The primary indicator of credit risk in our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings. Because we generally classify loans that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming, the level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of our loans provides insight as to the exposure of the portfolio to regional economic conditions. We underwrite most consumer loans using proprietary models, which are typically based on credit bureau data, including borrower credit scores, along with application information and, where applicable, collateral and deal structure data. We continuously adjust our management of credit lines and collection strategies based on customer behavior and risk profile changes. We also use borrower credit scores for subprime classification, for competitive benchmarking and, in some cases, to drive product segmentation decisions. The following table provides details on the credit scores of our domestic credit card and auto loans held for investment portfolios as of September 30, 2017, December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2016.Table 21: Credit Score Distribution(Percentage of portfolio) September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 September 30, 2016Domestic credit card—Refreshed FICO scores:(1)      Greater than 660 65% 64% 64%660 or below 35 36 36Total 100% 100% 100%Auto—At origination FICO scores:(2)      Greater than 660 51% 52% 51%621 - 660 18 17 17620 or below 31 31 32Total 100% 100% 100%__________ (1) Domestic card credit scores generally represent FICO scores. These scores are obtained from one of the major credit bureaus at origination and are refreshed monthly thereafter. We approximate non-FICO credit scores to comparable FICO scores for consistency purposes. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 660 or below category.(2) Auto credit scores generally represent average FICO scores obtained from three credit bureaus at the time of application and are not refreshed thereafter. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 620 or below category. We present information in the section below on the credit performance of our loan portfolio, including the key metrics we use in tracking changes in the credit quality of our loan portfolio. 41Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsSee “Note 4—Loans” in this Report for additional credit quality information. Also, see “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2016 Form 10-K and in this Report for information on our accounting policies for delinquent and nonperforming loans, net charge-offs and TDRs for each of our loan categories.Delinquency RatesWe consider the entire balance of an account to be delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the customer’s due date, measured at the reporting date. Our 30+ day delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due, whereas our 30+ day performing delinquency metrics include loans that are 30 or more days past due but are currently classified as performing and accruing interest. The 30+ day delinquency and 30+ day performing delinquency metrics are the same for domestic credit card loans, as we continue to classify loans as performing until the account is charged off, typically when the account is 180 days past due. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2016 Form 10-K for information on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming for each of our loan categories. We provide additional information on our credit quality metrics above under “MD&A—Business Segment Financial Performance.”Table 22 presents our 30+ day performing delinquency rates and 30+ day delinquency rates of our portfolio of loans held for investment, including PCI loans, by portfolio segment, as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.Table 22: 30+ Day Delinquencies  September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016  30+ Day Performing Delinquencies 30+ Day Delinquencies 30+ Day Performing Delinquencies 30+ Day Delinquencies(Dollars in millions) Amount Rate(1) Amount Rate(1) Amount Rate(1) Amount Rate(1)Credit Card:                Domestic credit card(2) $3,940 3.94% $3,940 3.94% $3,839 3.95% $3,839 3.95%International card businesses 323 3.54 339 3.71 283 3.36 317 3.76Total credit card(2) 4,263 3.91 4,279 3.92 4,122 3.91 4,156 3.94Consumer Banking:                Auto 3,044 5.71 3,345 6.28 2,931 6.12 3,154 6.58Home loan(3) 33 0.17 96 0.51 43 0.20 205 0.95Retail banking 25 0.73 46 1.33 25 0.70 49 1.39Total consumer banking(3) 3,102 4.10 3,487 4.61 2,999 4.10 3,408 4.67Commercial Banking:                Commercial and multifamily real estate 16 0.06 80 0.28 20 0.07 45 0.17Commercial and industrial 3 0.01 333 0.85 36 0.09 408 1.02Total commercial lending 19 0.03 413 0.61 56 0.08 453 0.68Small-ticket commercial real estate 2 0.43 8 2.01 6 1.31 10 2.14Total commercial banking 21 0.03 421 0.62 62 0.09 463 0.69Other loans 1 2.56 4 6.08 2 3.66 8 12.90Total(2) $7,387 2.93 $8,191 3.24 $7,185 2.93 $8,035 3.27__________(1) The 30+ day performing and 30+ day delinquency rates are calculated by loan category by dividing 30+ day delinquent loans as of the end of the period by period-end loans held for investment for the specified loan category, including PCI loans as applicable.(2) On September 25, 2017, we completed the Cabela’s acquisition. The metrics reported above as of September 30, 2017 include the impact of this acquisition. Excluding this impact the total credit card and domestic credit card 30+ day performing delinquency rate as of September 30, 2017 would have been 4.10% and 4.15%, respectively, and the total 30+ day performing delinquency rate would have been 2.98%.(3)  Excluding the impact of PCI loans, the 30+ day performing delinquency rate for our home loan and total consumer banking portfolios was 0.44% and 4.84%, respectively, as of September 30, 2017, and 0.59% and 5.12%, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. Excluding the impact of PCI loans, the 30+ day delinquency rate for our home loan and total consumer banking portfolios was 1.30% and 5.44%, respectively, as of September 30, 2017, and 2.86% and 5.82%, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. 42Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 23 presents an aging and geography of 30+ day delinquent loans as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.Table 23: Aging and Geography of 30+ Day Delinquent Loans   September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016(Dollars in millions) Amount % ofTotal Loans(1) Amount % ofTotal Loans(1)Delinquency status:        30 – 59 days $3,608 1.43% $3,466 1.41%60 – 89 days 2,008 0.79 1,920 0.78> 90 days 2,575 1.02 2,649 1.08Total $8,191 3.24% $8,035 3.27%Geographic region:        Domestic $7,852 3.11% $7,718 3.14%International 339 0.13 317 0.13Total $8,191 3.24% $8,035 3.27%Total loans held for investment $252,422 100.00% $245,586 100.00%__________(1) Delinquency rates are calculated by dividing loans in each delinquency status category or geographic region as of the end of the period by the total period-end loans held for investment, including PCI loans.Table 24 summarizes loans that were 90+ days delinquent as to interest or principal, and still accruing interest as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. These loans consist primarily of credit card accounts between 90 days and 179 days past due. As permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”), we continue to accrue interest and fees on domestic credit card loans through the date of charge-off, which is typically in the period the account becomes 180 days past due. While domestic credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until the loan is charged off, we reduce the balance of our credit card receivables by the amount of finance charges and fees billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from revenue.Table 24: 90+ Day Delinquent Loans Accruing Interest   September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016(Dollars in millions) Amount % ofTotal Loans(1) Amount % ofTotal Loans(1)Loan category:        Credit card $1,966 1.80% $1,936 1.83%Consumer banking — — — —Commercial banking 4 0.01 — —Total $1,970 0.78 $1,936 0.79Geographic region:        Domestic $1,850 0.76 $1,840 0.78International 120 1.31 96 1.14Total $1,970 0.78 $1,936 0.79__________ (1) Delinquency rates are calculated by dividing 90+ day delinquent loans accruing interest by period-end loans held for investment, including PCI loans, for the specified loan category.Nonperforming Loans and Nonperforming AssetsNonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, foreclosed properties and repossessed assets, and the net realizable value of certain partially charged off auto loans. Nonperforming loans include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status.

Nonperforming loan rates are calculated based on nonperforming loans for each category divided by period-end total loans held for investment for each respective category. We do not classify loans held for sale as nonperforming, as they are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value.

Interest income foregone related to nonperforming loans was $43 million and $49 million in the first nine months of 2017 and 2016, respectively. Foregone interest income represents the amount of interest income that would have been recorded during the period for nonperforming loans as of the end of the period had the loans performed according to their contractual terms.(2) Excluding the impact of PCI loans, the nonperforming loan rates for our home loan and total consumer banking portfolios were 2.13% and 0.84%, respectively, as of September 30, 2017, compared to 3.81% and 0.90%, respectively, as of December 31, 2016.(3) Excluding the impact of domestic credit card loans, nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment was 0.89% and 1.08% as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.(4) The denominator used in calculating the nonperforming asset ratios consists of total loans held for investment and total other nonperforming assets.(5) Includes the net realizable value of certain partially charged off auto loans and repossessed assets obtained in satisfaction of auto loans. 44Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsNet Charge-OffsNet charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine to be uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We charge off loans as a reduction to the allowance for loan and lease losses when we determine the loan is uncollectible and record subsequent recoveries of previously charged off amounts as increases to the allowance for loan and lease losses. Uncollectible finance charges and fees are reversed through revenue and certain fraud losses are recorded in other non-interest expense. Generally, costs to recover charged-off loans are recorded as collection expenses and included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest expense as incurred. Our charge-off policy for loans varies based on the loan type. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2016 Form 10-K and in this Report for information on our charge-off policy for each of our loan categories.Table 26 presents our net charge-off amounts and rates, by portfolio segment, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2017 and 2016.Table 26: Net Charge-Offs (Recoveries)  Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,  2017 2016 2017 2016(Dollars in millions) Amount Rate(1) Amount Rate(1) Amount Rate(1) Amount Rate(1)Credit Card:                Domestic credit card(2) $1,087 4.64 % $841 3.74 % $3,455 4.96% $2,602 3.99 %International card businesses 68 3.08 65 3.18 227 3.60 203 3.32Total credit card(2) 1,155 4.51 906 3.70 3,682 4.85 2,805 3.93Consumer Banking:                Auto 257 1.96 210 1.85 671 1.77 508 1.55Home loan(3) 1 0.02 1 0.03 5 0.03 9 0.05Retail banking 18 2.10 16 1.75 50 1.91 39 1.46Total consumer banking(3) 276 1.47 227 1.26 726 1.30 556 1.04Commercial Banking:                Commercial and multifamily real estate 0 (0.01) 0 0.01 2 0.01 (2) (0.01)Commercial and industrial 163 1.64 107 1.09 319 1.07 214 0.74Total commercial lending 163 0.97 107 0.66 321 0.64 212 0.44Small-ticket commercial real estate 0 0.12 1 0.74 1 0.33 2 0.39Total commercial banking 163 0.96 108 0.66 322 0.64 214 0.44Other loans 12 86.90 (1) (2.59) 4 9.20 (2) (3.19)Total net charge-offs $1,606 2.61 $1,240 2.10 $4,734 2.60 $3,573 2.06Average loans held for investment $245,822   $235,843   $243,205   $231,004  __________ (1) Net charge-off (recovery) rates are calculated by dividing annualized net charge-offs by average loans held for investment for the period for each loan category.(2) On September 25, 2017, we completed the Cabela’s acquisition. The domestic credit card metrics reported above for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 include the impact of this acquisition. Excluding this impact (i) the total credit card and domestic credit card net charge-off rate for the three months ended September 30, 2017 would have been 4.52% and 4.66%, respectively; and (ii) the total credit card and domestic credit card net charge-off rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 would have been 4.85% and 4.97%, respectively. (3) Excluding the impact of PCI loans, the net charge-off rates for our home loan and total consumer banking portfolios were 0.06% and 1.74%, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2017, compared to 0.08% and 1.62%, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2016; and 0.08% and 1.57%, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, compared to 0.18% and 1.37%, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 45Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTroubled Debt RestructuringsAs part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may provide short-term (three to twelve months) or long-term (greater than twelve months) modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to improve long-term collectability of the loan and to avoid the need for foreclosure or repossession of collateral.Table 27 presents our recorded investment of loans modified in TDRs as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, which excludes loan modifications that do not meet the definition of a TDR, and PCI loans, which we track and report separately.Table 27: Troubled Debt Restructurings  September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016(Dollars in millions) Amount % of Total Modifications Amount % of Total ModificationsCredit card $777 32.3% $715 29.0%Consumer banking:        Auto 487 20.2 523 21.2Home loan 190 7.9 241 9.8Retail banking 40 1.7 43 1.7Total consumer banking 717 29.8 807 32.7Commercial banking 911 37.9 944 38.3Total $2,405 100.0% $2,466 100.0%Status of TDRs:        Performing $1,761 73.2% $1,631 66.1%Nonperforming 644 26.8 835 33.9Total $2,405 100.0% $2,466 100.0% In the Credit Card business, the majority of our credit card loans modified in TDRs involve reducing the interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. The effective interest rate in effect immediately prior to the loan modification is used as the effective interest rate for purposes of measuring impairment using the present value of expected cash flows. If the customer does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement may revert to its original payment terms, likely resulting in any loan outstanding reflected in the appropriate delinquency category, and charged off in accordance with our standard charge-off policy.In the Consumer Banking business, the majority of our loans modified in TDRs receive an extension, an interest rate reduction or principal reduction, or a combination of the three. In addition, TDRs also occur in connection with bankruptcy of the borrower. In certain bankruptcy discharges, the loan is written down to the collateral value and the charged off amount is reported as principal reduction. Their impairment is determined using the present value of expected cash flows or a collateral evaluation for certain auto and home loans where the collateral value is lower than the recorded investment. In the Commercial Banking business, the majority of loans modified in TDRs receive an extension, with a portion of these loans receiving an interest rate reduction or a gross balance reduction. The impairment on modified commercial loans is generally determined based on the underlying collateral value. We provide additional information on modified loans accounted for as TDRs, including the performance of those loans subsequent to modification, in “Note 4—Loans.”Impaired LoansA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan. Generally, we report loans as impaired based on the method for measuring impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. Loans defined as individually impaired include larger-balance commercial nonperforming loans and TDRs. Loans held for sale are not reported as impaired, as these loans are recorded at lower of cost or fair value. Impaired loans also exclude PCI loans accounted for based on expected cash flows because this accounting methodology takes into consideration future credit losses expected to be incurred.Impaired loans, including TDRs, totaled $2.9 billion and $3.2 billion as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Modified TDR loans accounted for $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion of impaired loans as of September 30, 2017 and December 31,  46Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents2016, respectively. We provide additional information on our impaired loans, including the allowance for loan and lease losses established for these loans, in “Note 4—Loans” and “Note 5—Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments.”Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending CommitmentsOur allowance for loan and lease losses represents management’s best estimate of incurred loan and lease credit losses inherent to our held for investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date. The allowance for loan and lease losses is increased through the provision for credit losses and reduced by net charge-offs. We provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses under “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2016 Form 10-K.Table 28 presents changes in our allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the third quarter and first nine months of 2017 and 2016, and

The increases were primarily driven by:•an allowance build in our domestic credit card loan portfolio primarily due to increasing losses from recent vintages and portfolio seasoning, as well as an initial quarterly allowance build related to the loans acquired in the Cabela’s acquisition•an allowance build in our auto loan portfolio due to higher losses associated with growth; and•an allowance build for estimated hurricane-related losses.These increases were partially offset by an allowance decrease in our commercial loan portfolio due to charge-offs in our taxi medallion lending portfolio.LIQUIDITY RISK PROFILEWe have established liquidity practices that are intended to ensure that we have sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover our funding requirements and maintain adequate reserves to withstand the potential impact of deposit attrition or diminished liquidity in the funding markets. We maintain these reserves in the form of readily-marketable or pledgeable assets that can be used as a source of liquidity, if needed.Table 30 below presents the composition of our liquidity reserves as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.Table 30: Liquidity Reserves(Dollars in millions) September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016Cash and cash equivalents $8,484 $9,976Investment securities available for sale, at fair value 39,742 40,737Investment securities held to maturity, at fair value 29,327 26,196Total investment securities portfolio(1)(2) 69,069 66,933FHLB borrowing capacity secured by loans 22,104 24,078Outstanding FHLB advances and letters of credit secured by loans (13,647) (17,646)Investment securities encumbered for Public Funds and others (8,655) (9,265)Total liquidity reserves $77,355 $74,076__________(1) The weighted-average life of our securities was approximately 5.9 years and 6.0 years as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.(2) As part of our liquidity management strategy, we pledge securities to secure borrowings from counterparties and to secure trust and public deposits and other purposes as required or permitted by law. We pledged securities available for sale with a fair value of $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. We also pledged securities held to maturity with a carrying value of $7.8 billion and $8.1 billion as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. 50Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsOur liquidity reserves increased by $3.3 billion to $77.4 billion as of September 30, 2017 from December 31, 2016 primarily due to an increase in our investment securities portfolio. See “MD&A—Risk Management” in our 2016 Form 10-K for additional information on our management of liquidity risk.We are subject to the Final Liquidity Coverage Ratio Rule (“Final LCR Rule”) issued by the Federal Banking Agencies. The Final LCR Rule came into effect in January 2015 and required us to calculate the LCR daily starting July 1, 2016. The minimum LCR standard was phased-in beginning January 1, 2015 and is at 100% as of January 1, 2017. At September 30, 2017, we exceeded the fully phased-in LCR requirement. The calculation and the underlying components are based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and are subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. See “Part I—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation” in our 2016 Form 10-K for additional information.Borrowing CapacityWe filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC on March 31, 2015, which expires in March 2018. Under this shelf registration, we may periodically offer and sell an indeterminate aggregate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units. There is no limit under this shelf registration to the amount or number of such securities that we may offer and sell, subject to market conditions. We also filed a new shelf registration statement with the SEC on January 12, 2016, which expires in January 2019 and allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $23 billion of securitized debt obligations from our credit card loan securitization trust.In addition to our issuance capacity under the shelf registration statements, we also have access to FHLB advances with a maximum borrowing capacity of $22.9 billion, of which $9.3 billion was still available to us to borrow as of September 30, 2017. The ability to draw down funding is based on membership status and the amount is dependent upon the Banks’ ability to post collateral. Our FHLB membership is secured by our investment in FHLB stock of $478 million and $760 million as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, which was determined in part based on our outstanding advances. We also have access to the Federal Reserve Discount Window through which we had a borrowing capacity of $8.1 billion as of September 30, 2017. FundingThe Company’s primary source of funding comes from deposits, which provide a stable and relatively low cost of funds. In addition to deposits, the Company raises funding through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, FHLB advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios, the issuance of securitized debt obligations, the issuance of brokered deposits, federal funds purchased and other borrowings. A key objective in our use of these markets is to maintain access to a diversified mix of wholesale funding sources.DepositsTable 31 provides the composition of deposits as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, as well as a comparison of average balances, interest expense and average deposit interest rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016.Table 31: Deposits Composition and Average Deposits Interest Rates(Dollars in millions) September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016Non-interest-bearing deposits $26,106 $25,502Interest-bearing checking accounts(1) 43,652 45,820Saving deposits(2) 142,427 145,142Time deposits less than $100,000 22,712 16,949Total core deposits 234,897 233,413Time deposits of $100,000 or more 3,863 2,875Foreign deposits 302 480Total deposits $239,062 $236,768 51Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents  Three Months Ended September 30,  2017 2016(Dollars in millions) AverageBalance InterestExpense AverageDepositsInterest Rate AverageBalance InterestExpense AverageDepositsInterest RateInterest-bearing checking accounts(1) $44,055 $57 0.52% $44,619 $54 0.48%Saving deposits(2) 143,023 247 0.69 137,365 207 0.60Time deposits less than $100,000 21,769 91 1.66 11,658 35 1.21Total interest-bearing core deposits 208,847 395 0.75 193,642 296 0.61Time deposits of $100,000 or more 3,836 15 1.52 2,644 9 1.38Foreign deposits 454 — 0.38 627 1 0.36Total interest-bearing deposits $213,137 $410 0.77 $196,913 $306 0.62  Nine Months Ended September 30,  2017 2016(Dollars in millions) AverageBalance InterestExpense AverageDepositsInterest Rate AverageBalance InterestExpense AverageDepositsInterest RateInterest-bearing checking accounts(1) $45,041 $168 0.50% $45,458 $164 0.48%Saving deposits(2) 144,458 706 0.65 136,042 596 0.58Time deposits less than $100,000 20,000 230 1.54 10,953 94 1.15Total interest-bearing core deposits 209,499 1,104 0.70 192,453 854 0.59Time deposits of $100,000 or more 3,531 40 1.49 2,441 25 1.39Foreign deposits 478 1 0.39 671 2 0.35Total interest-bearing deposits $213,508 $1,145 0.72 $195,565 $881 0.60__________(1) Includes Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (“NOW”) accounts.(2) Includes Money Market Deposit Accounts (“MMDA”).Our deposits include brokered deposits, which we obtained through third-party intermediaries. Those brokered deposits are reported as interest-bearing checking, saving deposits and time deposits in the above table and totaled $22.8 billion and $22.5 billion as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.The FDIC limits the acceptance of brokered deposits by well-capitalized insured depository institutions and, with a waiver from the FDIC, by adequately-capitalized institutions. COBNA and CONA were well-capitalized, as defined under the federal banking regulatory guidelines, as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. See “Part I—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation” for additional information.Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term DebtWe access the capital markets to meet our funding needs through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations, and federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. In addition, we may utilize short-term and long-term FHLB advances secured by our investment securities, residential home loans, multifamily real estate loans, commercial real estate loans and home equity lines of credit. Substantially all of our long-term FHLB advances are structured with either a monthly or a quarterly call option at our discretion.Our short-term borrowings include those borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less and do not include the current portion of long-term debt. The short-term borrowings, which consist of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, decreased by $225 million to $767 million as of September 30, 2017 from December 31, 2016. Our long-term debt, which primarily consists of securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, and long-term FHLB advances, decreased by $777 million to $58.7 billion as of September 30, 2017 from December 31, 2016, primarily attributable to decreases in our FHLB advances outstanding and securitized debt obligations, partially offset by an increase in our senior and subordinated notes. 52Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCredit RatingsOur credit ratings impact our ability to access capital markets and our borrowing costs. Rating agencies base their ratings on numerous factors, including liquidity, capital adequacy, asset quality, quality of earnings and the probability of systemic support. Significant changes in these factors could result in different ratings. Such ratings help to support our cost effective unsecured funding as part of our overall financing programs. Table 32 provides a summary of the credit ratings for the senior unsecured long-term debt of Capital One Financial Corporation, COBNA and CONA as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.Table 32: Senior Unsecured Long-Term Debt Credit Ratings  September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016  Capital OneFinancialCorporation COBNA CONA Capital OneFinancialCorporation COBNA CONAMoody’s Baa1 Baa1 Baa1 Baa1 Baa1 Baa1S&P BBB BBB+ BBB+ BBB BBB+ BBB+Fitch A- A- A- A- A- A- As of October 31, 2017, Moody’s, S&P and Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”) have us on a stable outlook.MARKET RISK PROFILEMarket risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities, including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and derivatives. Below we provide additional information about our primary sources of market risk, our market risk management strategies and the measures we use to evaluate our market risk exposure.Primary Market Risk ExposuresOur primary source of market risk is interest rate risk. We also have exposure to foreign exchange risk and customer-related trading risk, both of which we believe are minimal after considering the impact of our associated risk management activities discussed below.Interest Rate RiskInterest rate risk, which represents exposure to instruments whose yield or price varies with the volatility of interest rates, is our most significant source of market risk exposure. Banks are inevitably exposed to interest rate risk due to differences in the timing between the maturities or re-pricing of assets and liabilities.Foreign Exchange RiskForeign exchange risk represents exposure to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies. Our primary exposure to foreign exchange risk is related to the operations of our international businesses in the U.K. and Canada. The largest foreign exchange exposure arising from these operations is the funding they are provided in the Great British pound (“GBP”) and the Canadian dollar (“CAD”), respectively. We also have foreign exchange exposure through our net equity investments in these operations and through the dollar-denominated value of future earnings and cash flows they generate. Our intercompany funding exposes our consolidated statements of income to foreign exchange transaction risk, while our equity investments in our foreign operations result in translation risk in AOCI and our capital ratios. We manage our transaction risk by entering into forward foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to foreign currency-denominated intercompany borrowings. We use foreign currency derivative contracts as net investment hedges to manage our AOCI exposure. We apply hedge accounting to both our intercompany funding hedges and our net investment hedges, with the primary net investments subject to hedging those denominated in GBP. We measure our total exposure from non-dollar-denominated intercompany borrowings to our international businesses by regularly tracking the value of the loans made to our foreign operations and the associated forward foreign currency derivative contracts we use to hedge them. We apply a 1% U.S. dollar appreciation shock against these exposures to measure the impact to our consolidated  53Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contentsstatements of income from foreign exchange transaction risk. The intercompany borrowings to our international businesses were 696 million GBP and 786 million GBP as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, and 6.1 billion CAD and 6.2 billion CAD as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. We measure our total exposure in non-dollar-denominated equity by regularly tracking the value of net equity invested in our foreign operations, the largest of which is in our U.K. and Canadian operations. Our measurement of net equity includes the impact of net investment hedges where applicable. We apply a 30% U.S. dollar appreciation shock against these net investment exposures, which we believe approximates a significant adverse foreign exchange movement over a one-year time horizon. Our gross equity exposures in our U.K. and Canadian operations were 1.5 billion GBP as of both September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and 1.0 billion CAD and 863 million CAD as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.As a result of our derivative management activities, we believe our net exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal.Customer-Related Trading RiskWe offer various interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity derivatives as an accommodation to our customers within our Commercial Banking business and offset the majority of these exposures through derivative transactions with other counterparties. These exposures are measured and monitored on a daily basis. As a result of offsetting our customer exposures with other counterparties, we believe our net exposure to customer-related trading risk is minimal.We employ value-at-risk (“VaR”) as the primary method to both measure and monitor the market risk in our customer-related trading activities. VaR is a statistical-based risk measure used to estimate the potential loss from adverse market movements in a normal market environment. We employ a historical simulation approach using the most recent 500 business days and use a 99 percent confidence level and a holding period of 1 business day. We use internal models to produce a daily VaR measure of the market risk of all customer-related trading exposures.For further information on our customer-related trading exposures, see “Note 9—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”Market Risk ManagementWe employ several techniques to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk, which include, but are not limited to, altering the duration and re-pricing characteristics of our various assets and liabilities through interest rate derivatives and mitigating the foreign exchange exposure of certain non-dollar-denominated equity or transactions through derivatives. Our current market risk management policies include the use of derivatives, which are one of the primary tools we use in managing interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We execute our derivative contracts in both over-the-counter (“OTC”) and exchange-traded derivative markets and have exposure to both bilateral and clearinghouse counterparties. Although the majority of our derivatives are interest rate swaps, we also use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage both our interest rate and foreign currency risk. The outstanding notional amount of our derivative contracts increased to $179.5 billion as of September 30, 2017 from $142.9 billion as of December 31, 2016 primarily driven by an increase in our hedging activities.Market Risk MeasurementWe have risk management policies and limits established by our market risk management policies and approved by the Board of Directors. Our objective is to manage our asset and liability risk position and exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and prescribed limits based on prevailing market conditions and long-term expectations. Because no single measure can reflect all aspects of market risk, we use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analysis to measure, assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our non-dollar-denominated earnings and non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations. We provide additional information below in “Economic Value of Equity.”We consider the impact on both net interest income and economic value of equity in measuring and managing our interest rate risk. Due to the increase in interest rates since December 31, 2016, we have incorporated a 100-basis points decline scenario into our interest rate sensitivity analysis. We use this 100-basis points decrease as our largest magnitude declining interest rate scenario, since a scenario where interest rates would decline by 200 basis points is unlikely. In scenarios where a 100-basis points decline would result in a rate less than 0%, we assume a rate of 0%. Below we discuss the assumptions used in calculating each of these measures.  54Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsNet Interest Income SensitivityThis sensitivity measure estimates the impact on our projected 12-month baseline interest rate-sensitive revenue resulting from movements in interest rates. Interest rate-sensitive revenue consists of net interest income and certain components of other non-interest income significantly impacted by movements in interest rates, including changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and free-standing interest rate swaps. Adjusted net interest income consists of net interest income and changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, including related derivative hedging activity, and changes in the fair value of free-standing interest rate swaps. In addition to our existing assets and liabilities, we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions, such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, and plans for projected changes in our funding mix in our baseline forecast. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our projected interest rate-sensitive revenue, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates of +200 basis points, +100 basis points, +50 basis points, -50 basis points and -100 basis points to spot rates, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above. At the current level of interest rates, our net interest income increases in the +50 and +100 basis points scenarios and declines in the +200 basis points scenario. The net interest income decline in the +200 basis points scenario compared with the +100 basis points scenario is mainly due to our assumption that deposit repricing increases more quickly with higher interest rates. Economic Value of EquityOur economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact on the net present value of our assets and liabilities, including derivative hedging activity, resulting from movements in interest rates. Our economic value of equity sensitivity measures are calculated based on our existing assets and liabilities, including derivatives, and do not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected plans for funding mix changes. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our economic value of equity, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates of +200 basis points, +100 basis points, +50 basis points, -50 basis points and -100 basis points to spot rates, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above.Calculating our economic value of equity and its sensitivity to interest rates requires projecting cash flows for assets, liabilities and derivative instruments and discounting those cash flows at the appropriate discount rates. Key assumptions in our economic value of equity calculation include projecting rate sensitive prepayments for mortgage securities, loans and other assets, term structure modeling of interest rates, discount spreads, and deposit volume and pricing assumptions.Our current economic value of equity sensitivity profile demonstrates that our economic value of equity generally decreases as interest rates increase indicating that the economic value of our assets and derivative positions is more sensitive to interest rate changes than our liabilities.Table 33 shows the estimated percentage impact on our projected baseline net interest income and economic value of equity calculated under the methodology described above as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. During the second quarter of 2017, we updated our projected commercial deposit attrition assumptions that resulted in longer life of these deposit balances and accounts for most of the decrease in economic value of equity sensitivity from December 31, 2016. Our net interest income sensitivity measures were largely unchanged from this assumption update.  55Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 33: Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis  September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016Estimated impact on projected baseline net interest income:    +200 basis points (0.6)% (0.1)%+100 basis points 0.1 0.5+50 basis points 0.2 0.4–50 basis points (0.5) (1.0)–100 basis points (2.2) N/AEstimated impact on economic value of equity:    +200 basis points (6.9) (9.6)+100 basis points (2.6) (3.8)+50 basis points (1.0) (1.5)–50 basis points (0.4) 0.5–100 basis points (2.4) N/AIn addition to these industry standard measures, we will continue to factor into our internal interest rate risk management decisions the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios, such as stressed rate shocks as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios.Limitations of Market Risk MeasuresThe interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information, internally-developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies, which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments. Other market inputs, such as interest rates, market prices and interest rate volatility, are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures. We regularly evaluate, update and enhance these assumptions, models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities.There are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. The sensitivity analysis described above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is performed at a particular point in time based on the existing balance sheet and, in some cases, expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions. The strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections, which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ substantially from the above sensitivity analysis. 56Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsSUPERVISION AND REGULATIONWe provide information on our Supervision and Regulation in our 2016 Form 10-K under “Part I—Item 1.

For loans recorded at amortized cost, carrying value is the unpaid principal balance net of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and costs, and unamortized purchase premium or discount. For loans that are or have been on nonaccrual status, the carrying value is also reduced by any net charge-offs that have been recorded and the amount of interest payments applied as a reduction of principal under the cost recovery method. For credit card loans, the carrying value also includes interest that has been billed to the customer. For loans classified as held for sale, carrying value is the lower of carrying value as described in the sentences above, or fair value. For PCI loans, carrying value represents the present value of all expected cash flows including interest that has not yet been accrued, discounted at the effective interest rate, including any valuation allowance for impaired loans.CCB: Chevy Chase Bank, F.S.B., which was acquired by the Company in 2009.CECL: In June 2016, the FASB issued revised guidance for impairments on financial instruments. The guidance, which becomes effective on January 1, 2020 with early adoption permitted no earlier than January 1, 2019, requires use of a current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model that is based on expected rather than incurred losses, with an anticipated result of more timely loss recognition.COBNA: Capital One Bank (USA), National Association, one of our fully owned subsidiaries, which offers credit and debit card products, other lending products and deposit products.Common equity Tier 1 capital: Calculated as the sum of common equity, related surplus and retained earnings, and accumulated other comprehensive income net of applicable phase-ins, less goodwill and intangibles net of associated deferred tax liabilities and applicable phase-ins, less other deductions, as defined by regulators.Company: Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries.CONA: Capital One, National Association, one of our fully owned subsidiaries, which offers a broad spectrum of banking products and financial services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients.Credit risk: The risk of loss from an obligor’s failure to meet the terms of any contract or otherwise fail to perform as agreed.Derivative: A contract or agreement whose value is derived from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, prices of securities or commodities, credit worthiness for credit default swaps or financial or commodity indices.Discontinued operations: The operating results of a component of an entity, as defined by Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 205, that are removed from continuing operations when that component has been disposed of or it is management’s intention to sell the component. 61Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”): Regulatory reform legislation signed into law on July 21, 2010.

The Final LCR Rule applies to institutions with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in total consolidated on-balance sheet foreign exposure, and their respective consolidated subsidiary depository institutions with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The LCR is calculated by dividing the amount of an institution’s high quality, unencumbered liquid assets by its estimated net cash outflow, as defined and calculated in accordance with Final LCR Rule. Foreign currency derivative contracts: An agreement to exchange contractual amounts of one currency for another currency at one or more future dates.Foreign exchange contracts: Contracts that provide for the future receipt or delivery of foreign currency at previously agreed-upon terms.GreenPoint: Refers to our wholesale mortgage banking unit, GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, Inc., which was closed in 2007.GSE or Agency: A government-sponsored enterprise or agency is a financial services corporation created by the United States Congress.

Instruments that fall below these levels are considered to be non-investment grade.Investments in qualified affordable housing projects: Capital One invests in private investment funds that make equity investments in multifamily affordable housing properties that provide affordable housing tax credits for these investments. The activities of these entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. 62Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsInvestor entities: Entities that invest in community development entities (“CDE”) that provide debt financing to businesses and non-profit entities in low-income and rural communities.Leverage ratio: Tier 1 capital divided by average assets after certain adjustments, as defined by the regulators. Liquidity risk: The risk that the Company will not be able to meet its future financial obligations as they come due, or invest in future asset growth because of an inability to obtain funds at a reasonable price within a reasonable time period.Loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio: The relationship expressed as a percentage, between the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of the collateral (i.e., residential real estate, autos, etc.) securing the loan.Managed presentation: A non-GAAP presentation of financial results that includes reclassifications to present revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure at the segment level, because it believes this provides information to enable investors to understand the underlying operational performance and trends of the particular business segment and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with the performance of competitors.Market risk: The risk that an institution’s earnings or the economic value of equity could be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates or other market factors.Master netting agreement: An agreement between two counterparties that have multiple contracts with each other that provides for the net settlement of all contracts through a single payment in the event of default or termination of any one contract.Mortgage-backed security (“MBS”): An asset-backed security whose cash flows are backed by the principal and interest payments of a set of mortgage loans.Mortgage servicing rights (“MSR”): The right to service a mortgage loan when the underlying loan is sold or securitized.

After the initial payment option period, usually five years, the recalculated minimum payment represents a fully-amortizing principal and interest payment that would effectively repay the loan by the end of its contractual term.Other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”): An impairment charge taken on a security whose fair value has fallen below the carrying value on the balance sheet and whose value is not expected to recover through the holding period of the security.Purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans: Refers to the loans acquired in a business combination that were recorded at fair value at acquisition and subsequently accounted for based on cash flows expected to be collected in accordance with ASC 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality (formerly known as “Statement of Position 03-3, Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer,” commonly referred to as “SOP 03-3”). Acquired loans are considered PCI loans if they have a discount attributable, at least in part, to credit deterioration and they are not specifically scoped out of this guidance. Our PCI loans primarily include a limited portion of commercial loans acquired in the HFS acquisition and the substantial majority of consumer and commercial loans acquired in the ING Direct and Chevy Chase acquisitions.The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated fair value of purchased loans represents the accretable yield, which is recognized into interest income over the life of the loans. The difference between total contractual payments on the loans and all expected cash flows represents the nonaccretable difference or the amount of principal and interest not considered collectible, which incorporates future expected credit losses over the life of the loans. Decreases in expected cash flows from credit deterioration subsequent to acquisition will generally result in an impairment charge recognized in our provision for credit losses and an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses. Charge-offs are not recorded until the expected credit losses within the nonaccretable difference are depleted. PCI loans are not classified as delinquent or nonperforming as we expect to collect our net investment in these loans and the nonaccretable difference will absorb the majority of the losses associated with these loans. In addition, PCI loans are excluded from impaired loans because the applicable accounting methodology takes into consideration expected future credit losses.Public Fund deposits: Deposits that are derived from a variety of political subdivisions such as school districts and municipalities.  63Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsPurchase volume: Includes purchase transactions, net of returns, for the period for loans both classified as held for investment and held for sale. Excludes cash advance and balance transfer transactions.Rating agency: An independent agency that assesses the credit quality and likelihood of default of an issue or issuer and assigns a rating to that issue or issuer.Recorded investment: The amount of the investment in a loan which includes any direct write-down of the investment.Repurchase agreement: An instrument used to raise short-term funds whereby securities are sold with an agreement for the seller to buy back the securities at a later date. Restructuring charges: Charges typically from the consolidation or relocation of operations, and reductions in work force.Return on average assets: Calculated based on income from continuing operations, net of tax, for the period divided by average total assets for the period.Return on average common equity: Calculated based on the sum of (i) income from continuing operations, net of tax; (ii) less dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities; (iii) less preferred stock dividends, for the period, divided by average common equity. Our calculation of return on average common equity may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.Return on average tangible common equity: A non-GAAP financial measure calculated based on the sum of (i) income from continuing operations, net of tax; (ii) less dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities; and (iii) less preferred stock dividends, for the period, divided by average tangible common equity. Our calculation of return on average tangible common equity may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.Risk-weighted assets: Consist of on- and off-balance sheet assets that are assigned to one of several broad risk categories and weighted by factors representing their risk and potential for default. Securitized debt obligations: A type of asset-backed security and structured credit product constructed from a portfolio of fixed-income assets.Small-ticket commercial real estate: Our small-ticket commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly low- or no-documentation loans with balances generally less than $2 million. This portfolio was originated on a national basis through a broker network and is in a run-off mode.Subprime: For purposes of lending in our Credit Card business we generally consider FICO scores of 660 or below, or other equivalent risk scores, to be subprime. For purposes of auto lending in our Consumer Banking business we generally consider FICO scores of 620 or below to be subprime.Tangible common equity (“TCE”): A non-GAAP financial measure. Common equity less goodwill and intangible assets adjusted for deferred tax liabilities associated with non-tax deductible intangible assets and tax deductible goodwill.Troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”): A TDR is deemed to occur when the Company modifies the contractual terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty.U.K. PPI Reserve: U.K. payment protection insurance customer refund reserve.U.S. GAAP: Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Accounting rules and conventions defining acceptable practices in preparing financial statements in the U.S.Unfunded commitments: Legally binding agreements to provide a defined level of financing until a specified future date.Variable interest entity (“VIE”): An entity that (i) lacks enough equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support from other parties; (ii) has equity owners that lack the right to make significant decisions affecting the entity’s operations; and/or (iii) has equity owners that do not have an obligation to absorb or the right to receive the entity’s losses or return. 64Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsAcronymsABS: Asset-backed securityAFS: Available for saleAML: Anti-money launderingAOCI: Accumulated other comprehensive incomeARM: Adjustable rate mortgageASC: Accounting Standards CodificationBHC: Bank holding companyBMA: Bank Merger Actbps: Basis pointsCAD: Canadian dollarCCAR: Comprehensive Capital Analysis and ReviewCCP: Central Counterparty Clearinghouse, or Central ClearinghouseCDE: Community development entitiesCECL: Current expected credit lossCEO: Chief Executive OfficerCIFG: CIFG Assurance North America, Inc.

Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through branches, the internet and other distribution channels. As of September 30, 2017, our principal subsidiaries included:•Capital One Bank (USA), National Association (“COBNA”), which offers credit and debit card products, other lending products and deposit products; and•Capital One, National Association (“CONA”), which offers a broad spectrum of banking products and financial services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients.The Company is hereafter collectively referred to as “we,” “us” or “our.” COBNA and CONA are collectively referred to as the “Banks.”We also offer products outside of the United States of America (“U.S.”) principally through Capital One (Europe) plc (“COEP”), an indirect subsidiary of COBNA organized and located in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), and through a branch of COBNA in Canada. COEP has authority, among other things, to provide credit card loans. Our branch of COBNA in Canada also has the authority to provide credit card loans.Our principal operations are currently organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. We provide details on our business segments, the integration of recent acquisitions, if any, into our business segments and the allocation methodologies and accounting policies used to derive our business segment results in “Note 13—Business Segments.”On September 25, 2017, we completed the acquisition from Synovus Bank of credit card assets and related liabilities of World’s Foremost Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cabela’s Incorporated (“Cabela’s acquisition”) for a total purchase price of $3.2 billion net of cash and restricted cash acquired. The Cabela’s acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that we allocate the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our best estimates of fair value as of the acquisition date. As of the acquisition date, we recorded $6.0 billion of assets, which primarily consisted of $5.7 billion of credit card receivables, and assumed $2.6 billion of liabilities, of which $2.5 billion were securitized debt obligations. We expect to finalize the accounting for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Cabela’s acquisition by December 31, 2017. Results of the Cabela’s acquisition are included within our Credit Card segment.Basis of Presentation and Use of EstimatesThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and in the related disclosures. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. While management makes its best judgment, actual amounts or results could differ from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included for a fair statement of this interim financial information. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements, and related notes thereto, included in Capital One Financial Corporation’s 2016 Form 10-K.Principles of Consolidation The unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Capital One Financial Corporation and all other entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. We determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity (“VIE”). All significant intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated.LoansCharge-OffsIn the second quarter of 2017, we implemented changes in accounting estimates impacting our charge-off practices for the treatment of certain loans within our consumer banking loan portfolio. This includes changes to the charge-off timing of auto and home loans where the borrower has filed for bankruptcy and the loans have not been reaffirmed, which are now charged off in the period that the loan is 60 days from the bankruptcy notification date. Newly Adopted Accounting StandardsRestricted CashIn November 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued revised guidance that requires restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents to be included within beginning and ending total cash amounts reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Disclosure of the nature of the restrictions on cash balances is required under the guidance. We have elected to early adopt the guidance retrospectively effective as of January 1, 2017. Upon adoption, changes in restricted cash, which had previously been presented as financing activities, are now included within beginning and ending Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for securitization investors balances.The Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for securitization investors balances presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows are comprised of the amounts captioned on the consolidated balance sheets as Total cash and cash equivalents and Restricted cash for securitization investors. Improvements to Employee Share-Based AccountingIn March 2016, the FASB issued revised guidance for accounting for employee share-based payments. The guidance requires that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies that pertain to employee stock-based incentive payments be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of income, rather than within additional paid-in capital; and that excess tax benefits be classified as an operating activity rather than financing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The guidance also permits an accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur. We adopted the guidance effective in the first quarter of 2017 on a prospective basis related to recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies in the consolidated statements of income and presentation of excess tax benefits in the consolidated statements of cash flows. In addition, we made an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures of awards as they occur and applied a modified retrospective transition method. Our adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.Recently Issued but Not Yet Adopted Accounting Standards Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging ActivitiesIn August 2017, the FASB issued new hedge accounting guidance to amend the existing hedge accounting recognition and presentation requirements. The amendments better align an entity’s risk management activities and financial reporting for hedging relationships through changes to both the designation and measurement guidance for qualifying hedging relationships and the presentation of the impacts of those hedging relationships. The guidance is effective for us on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the potential impacts of this guidance to our existing risk management practices as well as the overall effects on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We are currently evaluating the overall impact of adopting this standard earlier than required.Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt SecuritiesIn March 2017, the FASB issued revised guidance to shorten the amortization period to the earliest call date for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium. There is no change for accounting for securities held at a discount. Under the existing guidance, the premium is generally amortized as an adjustment to interest income over the contractual life of the debt security. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. This guidance is effective for us on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted, using the modified retrospective method of adoption. We plan to adopt the standard on its effective date.Simplifying the Test for Goodwill ImpairmentIn January 2017, the FASB issued revised guidance which is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of testing goodwill for impairment by eliminating the second step from the current goodwill impairment test. Under the existing guidance, the first step compares a reporting unit’s carrying value to its fair value. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, an entity performs the second step, which assigns the reporting unit’s fair value to its assets and liabilities, including unrecognized assets and liabilities, in the same manner as required in purchase accounting. Under the new guidance, any impairment of a reporting unit’s goodwill is determined based on the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. This guidance is effective for us on January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted, using the prospective method of adoption. We plan to adopt the standard on its effective date.Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial InstrumentsIn June 2016, the FASB issued revised guidance for impairments on financial instruments. The guidance requires an impairment model (known as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model) that is based on expected rather than incurred losses, with an anticipated result of more timely loss recognition. The CECL model is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, net investments in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income and certain off-balance sheet arrangements. The CECL model will replace our current accounting for purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) and impaired loans. The guidance also amends the available for sale (“AFS”) debt securities other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) model. Credit losses (and subsequent recoveries) on AFS debt securities will be recorded through an allowance approach, rather than the current U.S. GAAP practice of permanent write-downs for credit losses and accreting positive changes through interest income over time. This guidance is effective for us on January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted no earlier than January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective method of adoption. We plan to adopt the standard on its effective date. We have established a company-wide, cross-functional governance structure for our implementation of this standard. We are in the process of determining key accounting interpretations, data requirements and necessary changes to our credit loss estimation methods, processes and systems. We continue to assess the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Due to the significant differences in the revised guidance from existing U.S. GAAP, the implementation of this guidance may result in material changes in our accounting for credit losses on financial instruments.LeasesIn February 2016, the FASB issued revised guidance for leases. The guidance requires lessees to recognize right of use assets and lease liabilities on their consolidated balance sheets and disclose key information about all their leasing arrangements, with certain practical expedients. This guidance is effective for us on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted, using the modified retrospective method of adoption. We plan to adopt the standard on the effective date. We are currently in the process of reviewing lease contracts, establishing new processes and internal controls, evaluating the impact of various accounting policy elections and the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. We expect our total assets and liabilities to increase.Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesIn January 2016, the FASB issued revised guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The main provisions of the guidance include, (i) the measurement of most equity investments at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through net income, except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that do not have a readily determinable fair value (for which a practical expedient can be elected); (ii) the required use of the exit price notion when valuing financial instruments for disclosure purposes; (iii) the separate presentation in other comprehensive income of the instrument-specific credit risk portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability under the fair value option; (iv) the determination of the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to AFS securities must be made in combination with other deferred tax assets. The guidance eliminates the current classifications of equity securities as trading or AFS and will require separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by category and form of the financial assets on the face of the consolidated balance sheets or within the accompanying notes. The guidance also eliminates the requirement to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet. This guidance is effective for us on January 1, 2018. Early adoption is only permitted for the requirement to present the portion of the total change in fair value attributable to a change in the instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. We plan to adopt the standard on its effective date, and do not expect such adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.Revenue from Contracts with CustomersIn May 2014, the FASB issued revised guidance for the recognition, measurement and disclosure of revenue from contracts with customers. The original guidance has been amended through subsequent accounting standard updates that resulted in technical corrections, improvements, and a one-year deferral of the effective date to January 1, 2018. The guidance, as amended, is applicable to all entities and, once effective, will replace significant portions of existing industry and transaction-specific revenue recognition rules with a more principles-based recognition model. Entities can elect to apply either a full or modified retrospective method of adoption. Most revenue associated with financial instruments, including interest income, loan origination fees and credit card fees, is outside the scope of the guidance. Gains and losses on investment securities, derivatives and sales of financial instruments are similarly excluded from the scope. Our implementation efforts have included identifying revenues and related costs within the scope of this guidance, reviewing the associated contracts and evaluating the related accounting policies and internal controls to determine if any changes will be required. We have substantially completed the evaluation of the potential impact of this guidance on the timing, recognition, and presentation of revenues and expenses and have not identified any material changes. We continue to evaluate and prepare for the new disclosures required by this guidance. We plan to adopt the standard on its effective date, using the modified retrospective method of adoption. 73Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE 2—DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSOur discontinued operations consist of the mortgage origination operations of our wholesale mortgage banking unit, GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, Inc. (“GreenPoint”) and the manufactured housing operations of GreenPoint Credit, LLC, a subsidiary of GreenPoint, both of which were acquired as part of the North Fork Bancorporation, Inc. (“North Fork”) acquisition in December 2006. Although the manufactured housing operations were sold to a third party in 2004 prior to our acquisition of North Fork, we acquired certain retained interests and obligations related to those operations as part of the acquisition. Separately, in the third quarter of 2007 we closed the mortgage origination operations of the wholesale mortgage banking unit. The results of both the wholesale banking unit and the manufactured housing operations have been accounted for as discontinued operations and are reported as income or loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, on the consolidated statements of income. As of September 30, 2017, we had no significant continuing involvement in these operations.The following table summarizes the results from discontinued operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016:Table 2.1: Results of Discontinued Operations   Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,(Dollars in millions) 2017 2016 2017 2016Income (loss) from discontinued operations before income taxes $(47) $(17) $(40) $(27)Income tax provision (benefit) (17) (6) (14) (10)Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax $(30) $(11) $(26) $(17)The discontinued mortgage origination operations of our wholesale mortgage banking unit have remaining assets primarily consisting of a deferred tax asset related to the reserve for representations and warranties on loans previously sold to third parties. As of September 30, 2017, we had contingent obligations to exercise mandatory clean-up calls associated with certain securitization transactions undertaken by the discontinued GreenPoint Credit, LLC manufactured housing operations in the event the third-party servicer could not fulfill its obligation to exercise these clean-up calls. On October 10, 2017, we entered into an agreement with the third-party servicer under which we assumed the mandatory obligation to exercise the remaining clean-up calls as they become due on certain securitization transactions. See “Note 6—Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations” and “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others” for information on the reserve related to our retained interests and obligations associated with GreenPoint Credit, LLC manufactured housing operations and the reserves we have established for our mortgage representation and warranty exposure. 74Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE 3—INVESTMENT SECURITIESOur investment portfolio consists primarily of the following: U.S. Treasury securities; U.S. government-sponsored enterprise or agency (“Agency”) and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”); Agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”); other asset-backed securities (“ABS”); and other securities.

As of September 30, 2017, our investments in non-agency RMBS and CMBS, other ABS and other securities accounted for $3 million, or 1%, of total gross unrealized losses on securities available for sale. As of September 30, 2017, the carrying value of approximately 160 securities classified as held to maturity exceeded their fair value by $124 million. The unrealized losses related to investment securities for which we have not recognized credit impairment were primarily attributable to changes in market interest rates. As discussed in more detail below, we conduct periodic reviews of all investment securities with unrealized losses to assess whether impairment is other-than-temporary. Maturities and Yields of Investment SecuritiesThe following tables summarize the remaining scheduled contractual maturities, assuming no prepayments, of our investment securities as of September 30, 2017.Table 3.5: Contractual Maturities of Securities Available for Sale September 30, 2017 (Dollars in millions) Amortized Cost Fair ValueDue in 1 year or less $730 $731Due after 1 year through 5 years 2,983 3,013Due after 5 years through 10 years 6,650 6,694Due after 10 years(1) 29,076 29,304Total $39,439 $39,742__________(1) Investments with no stated maturities, which consist of equity securities, are included with contractual maturities due after 10 years.Table 3.6: Contractual Maturities of Securities Held to Maturity  September 30, 2017 (Dollars in millions) Carrying Value Fair ValueDue in 1 year or less $200 $199Due after 1 year through 5 years 753 795Due after 5 years through 10 years 598 625Due after 10 years 27,099 27,708Total $28,650 $29,327Because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay certain obligations, the expected maturities of our securities are likely to differ from the scheduled contractual maturities presented above.  78Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe table below summarizes, by major security type, the expected maturities and weighted-average yields of our investment securities as of September 30, 2017.

Our OTTI assessment is based on a discounted cash flow analysis which requires careful use of judgments and assumptions. A number of qualitative and quantitative criteria may be considered in our assessment as applicable, including the size and the nature of the portfolio; historical and projected performance such as prepayment, default and loss severity for the RMBS portfolio; recent credit events specific to the issuer and/or industry to which the issuer belongs; the payment structure of the security; external credit ratings of the issuer and any failure or delay of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments; the value of underlying collateral; our intent and ability to hold the security; and current and projected market and macro-economic conditions.If we intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, the entire difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and its fair value is recognized in earnings. As of September 30, 2017, for any securities with unrealized losses recorded in AOCI, we do not intend to sell, nor believe that we will be required to sell, these securities prior to recovery of their amortized cost. 79Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFor those securities that we do not intend to sell nor expect to be required to sell, an analysis is performed to determine if any of the impairment is due to credit-related factors or whether it is due to other factors, such as interest rates. Credit-related impairment is recognized in earnings, with the remaining unrealized non-credit-related impairment recorded in AOCI. We determine the credit component based on the difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected cash flows, discounted based on the effective yield.The table below presents a rollforward of the credit-related OTTI recognized in earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 on investment securities for which we had no intent to sell.Table 3.8: Credit Impairment Rollforward  Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,(Dollars in millions) 2017 2016 2017 2016Credit loss component, beginning of period $207 $204 $207 $199Additions:        Initial credit impairment 1 0 1 1Subsequent credit impairment 0 0 1 7Total additions 1 0 2 8Reductions due to payoffs, disposals, transfers and other (61) 0 (62) (3)Credit loss component, end of period $147 $204 $147 $204Realized Gains and Losses on Securities and OTTI Recognized in EarningsThe following table presents the gross realized gains and losses on the sale and redemption of securities available for sale, and the OTTI losses recognized in earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016.

We pledged securities available for sale with a fair value of $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. We also pledged securities held to maturity with a carrying value of $7.8 billion and $8.1 billion as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Of the total securities pledged as collateral, we have encumbered a fair value of $8.7 billion and $9.3 billion as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, primarily related to Public Fund deposits. We accepted pledges of securities with a fair value of $1 million and $16 million as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, primarily related to our derivative transactions.Purchased Credit-Impaired Debt SecuritiesThe table below presents the outstanding balance and carrying value of the purchased credit-impaired debt securities as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.Table 3.10: Outstanding Balance and Carrying Value of Acquired Credit-Impaired Debt Securities(Dollars in millions) September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016Outstanding balance $2,226 $2,899Carrying value 1,913 2,277Changes in Accretable Yield of Purchased Credit-Impaired Debt SecuritiesThe following table presents changes in the accretable yield related to the purchased credit-impaired debt securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017.Table 3.11: Changes in the Accretable Yield of Purchased Credit-Impaired Debt Securities(Dollars in millions) Three Months Ended September 30, 2017 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017Accretable yield, beginning of period $1,093 $1,173Accretion recognized in earnings (46) (144)Reduction due to payoffs, disposals, transfers and other (154) (157)Net reclassifications from nonaccretable difference (35) (14)Accretable yield, end of period $858 $858 81Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE 4—LOANSLoan Portfolio CompositionOur loan portfolio consists of loans held for investment, including loans held in our consolidated trusts, and loans held for sale, and is divided into three portfolio segments: credit card, consumer banking and commercial banking. Credit card loans consist of domestic and international credit card loans. Consumer banking loans consist of auto, home and retail banking loans. Commercial banking loans consist of commercial and multifamily real estate, commercial and industrial, and small-ticket commercial real estate loans.Our portfolio of loans held for investment also includes certain consumer and commercial loans acquired through business combinations that were recorded at fair value at acquisition and subsequently accounted for based on cash flows expected to be collected, which are referred to as PCI loans. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2016 Form 10-K for additional information on the accounting guidance for these loans. The credit metrics presented in this section exclude loans held for sale, which are carried at lower of cost or fair value.Credit QualityWe closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to manage and evaluate our exposure to credit risk. Trends in delinquency rates are an indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk within our loan portfolio. The level of nonperforming loans represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. Accordingly, key metrics we track and use in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming loan rates, as well as net charge-off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger balance commercial loans. The table below presents the composition and an aging analysis of our loans held for investment portfolio as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The delinquency aging includes all past due loans, both performing and nonperforming.Table 4.1: Loan Portfolio Composition and Aging Analysis  September 30, 2017(Dollars in millions) Current 30-59Days 60-89Days > 90Days TotalDelinquentLoans PCILoans TotalLoansCredit Card:              Domestic credit card $96,010 $1,223 $871 $1,846 $3,940 $31 $99,981International card businesses 8,810 135 78 126 339 0 9,149Total credit card 104,820 1,358 949 1,972 4,279 31 109,130Consumer Banking:              Auto 49,945 2,125 944 276 3,345 0 53,290Home loan 7,294 36 12 48 96 11,430 18,820Retail banking 3,387 21 7 18 46 21 3,454Total consumer banking 60,626 2,182 963 342 3,487 11,451 75,564Commercial Banking:              Commercial and multifamily real estate 27,839 12 1 67 80 25 27,944Commercial and industrial 38,495 52 93 188 333 478 39,306Total commercial lending 66,334 64 94 255 413 503 67,250Small-ticket commercial real estate 412 3 1 4 8 0 420Total commercial banking 66,746 67 95 259 421 503 67,670Other loans 54 1 1 2 4 0 58Total loans(1) $232,246 $3,608 $2,008 $2,575 $8,191 $11,985 $252,422% of Total loans 92.01% 1.43% 0.79% 1.02% 3.24% 4.75% 100.00%   82Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  December 31, 2016(Dollars in millions) Current 30-59Days 60-89Days > 90Days TotalDelinquentLoans PCI Loans TotalLoansCredit Card:              Domestic credit card $93,279 $1,153 $846 $1,840 $3,839 $2 $97,120International card businesses 8,115 124 72 121 317 0 8,432Total credit card 101,394 1,277 918 1,961 4,156 2 105,552Consumer Banking:              Auto 44,762 2,041 890 223 3,154 0 47,916Home loan 6,951 44 20 141 205 14,428 21,584Retail banking 3,477 22 7 20 49 28 3,554Total consumer banking 55,190 2,107 917 384 3,408 14,456 73,054Commercial Banking:              Commercial and multifamily real estate 26,536 45 0 0 45 28 26,609Commercial and industrial 38,831 27 84 297 408 585 39,824Total commercial lending 65,367 72 84 297 453 613 66,433Small-ticket commercial real estate 473 7 1 2 10 0 483Total commercial banking 65,840 79 85 299 463 613 66,916Other loans 56 3 0 5 8 0 64Total loans(1) $222,480 $3,466 $1,920 $2,649 $8,035 $15,071 $245,586% of Total loans 90.59% 1.41% 0.78% 1.08% 3.27% 6.14% 100.00%__________(1) Loans (other than PCI loans) include unearned income, unamortized premiums and discounts, and unamortized deferred fees and costs totaling $739 million and $558 million as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.We pledged loan collateral of $28.5 billion and $29.3 billion to secure the majority of our FHLB borrowing capacity of $22.9 billion and $24.9 billion as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.The following table presents the outstanding balance of loans 90 days or more past due that continue to accrue interest and loans classified as nonperforming as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.Table 4.2: 90+ Day Delinquent Loans Accruing Interest and Nonperforming Loans(1)   September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016(Dollars in millions) > 90 Days and Accruing Nonperforming Loans > 90 Days and Accruing Nonperforming LoansCredit Card:        Domestic credit card $1,846 N/A $1,840 N/AInternational card businesses 120 $25 96 $42Total credit card 1,966 25 1,936 42Consumer Banking:        Auto 0 346 0 223Home loan 0 158 0 273Retail banking 0 33 0 31Total consumer banking 0 537 0 527 83Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016(Dollars in millions) > 90 Days and Accruing Nonperforming Loans > 90 Days and Accruing Nonperforming LoansCommercial Banking:        Commercial and multifamily real estate $4 $64 $0 $30Commercial and industrial 0 717 0 988Total commercial lending 4 781 0 1,018Small-ticket commercial real estate 0 7 0 4Total commercial banking 4 788 0 1,022Other loans 0 4 0 8Total $1,970 $1,354 $1,936 $1,599% of Total loans 0.78% 0.54% 0.79% 0.65%__________(1) Nonperforming loans generally include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status.

See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2016 Form 10-K for additional information on our policies for nonperforming loans.Credit CardOur credit card loan portfolio is highly diversified across millions of accounts and numerous geographies without significant individual exposure. We therefore generally manage credit risk based on portfolios with common risk characteristics. The risk in our credit card loan portfolio correlates to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates and home values, as well as consumers’ financial condition, all of which can have a material effect on credit performance. The primary indicators we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our credit card portfolio are delinquency and charge-off trends, including an analysis of loan migration between delinquency categories over time.The table below displays the geographic profile of our credit card loan portfolio as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

The net charge-off rate is calculated by dividing annualized net charge-offs by average balance of loans held for investment for the period for each loan category. Net charge-offs and the net charge-off rate are impacted periodically by fluctuations in recoveries, including loan sales.(2) On September 25, 2017, we completed the Cabela’s acquisition. The domestic credit card metrics reported above for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 include the impact of this acquisition. Excluding this impact (i) the total credit card and domestic credit card net charge-off rate for the three months ended September 30, 2017 would have been 4.52% and 4.66%, respectively; and (ii) the total credit card and domestic credit card net charge-off rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 would have been 4.85% and 4.97%, respectively. Consumer BankingOur consumer banking loan portfolio consists of auto, home and retail banking loans. Similar to our credit card loan portfolio, the risk in our consumer banking loan portfolio correlates to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates, gross domestic product (“GDP”) and home values, as well as consumers’ financial condition, all of which can have a material effect on credit performance. Delinquency, nonperforming loans and charge-off trends are key indicators we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our consumer banking loan portfolio. The table below displays the geographic profile of our consumer banking loan portfolio, including PCI loans as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. 85Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSTable 4.5: Consumer Banking Risk Profile by Geographic Region   September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016(Dollars in millions) Amount % of Total(1) Amount % ofTotal(1)Auto:        Texas $6,961 9.2% $6,304 8.6%California 6,052 8.0 5,448 7.5Florida 4,402 5.8 3,985 5.5Georgia 2,715 3.6 2,506 3.4Ohio 2,265 3.0 2,017 2.8Louisiana 2,260 3.0 2,159 3.0Illinois 2,188 2.9 2,065 2.8Other 26,447 35.0 23,432 32.0Total auto 53,290 70.5 47,916 65.6Home loan:        California 4,115 5.4 4,993 6.8New York 1,985 2.6 2,036 2.8Maryland 1,287 1.7 1,409 1.9Virginia 1,102 1.5 1,204 1.7Illinois 1,053 1.4 1,218 1.7New Jersey 1,000 1.3 1,112 1.5Texas 883 1.2 823 1.1Other 7,395 9.8 8,789 12.0Total home loan 18,820 24.9 21,584 29.5Retail banking:        Louisiana 977 1.3 1,010 1.4New York 934 1.2 941 1.3Texas 718 1.0 756 1.0New Jersey 219 0.3 238 0.3Maryland 187 0.2 190 0.3Virginia 154 0.2 156 0.2Other 265 0.4 263 0.4Total retail banking 3,454 4.6 3,554 4.9Total consumer banking $75,564 100.0% $73,054 100.0%__________(1) Percentages by geographic region are calculated based on period-end amounts.The table below presents nonperforming loans in our consumer banking loan portfolio as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, as well as net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016. 86Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSTable 4.6: Consumer Banking Net Charge-Offs and Nonperforming Loans  Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,  2017 2016 2017 2016(Dollars in millions) Amount Rate(1) Amount Rate(1) Amount Rate(1) Amount Rate(1)Net charge-offs:                Auto $257 1.96% $210 1.85% $671 1.77% $508 1.55%Home loan(2) 1 0.02 1 0.03 5 0.03 9 0.05Retail banking 18 2.10 16 1.75 50 1.91 39 1.46Total consumer banking(2) $276 1.47 $227 1.26 $726 1.30 $556 1.04  September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016(Dollars in millions) Amount Rate(3) Amount Rate(3)Nonperforming loans:        Auto $346 0.65% $223 0.47%Home loan(4) 158 0.84 273 1.26Retail banking 33 0.97 31 0.86Total consumer banking(4) $537 0.71 $527 0.72__________(1) The net charge-off rate is calculated by dividing annualized net charge-offs by average balance of loans held for investment for the period for each loan category.

Home LoanOur home loan portfolio consists of both first-lien and second-lien residential mortgage loans. In evaluating the credit quality and risk of our home loan portfolio, we monitor a variety of mortgage loan characteristics that may affect the default experience on this loan portfolio, such as vintage, geographic concentrations, lien priority and product type. Certain loan concentrations have experienced higher delinquency rates as a result of the significant decline in home prices after the peak in 2006 and subsequent rise in unemployment. These loan concentrations include loans originated between 2006 and 2008 in an environment of decreasing home sales, broadly declining home prices and more relaxed underwriting standards. The following table presents the distribution of our home loan portfolio as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, based on selected key risk characteristics. 87Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSTable 4.7: Home Loan Risk Profile by Vintage, Geography, Lien Priority and Interest Rate Type  September 30, 2017  Loans PCI Loans(1) Total Home Loans(Dollars in millions) Amount % ofTotal(2) Amount % ofTotal(2) Amount % ofTotal(2)Origination year:(3)            < = 2008 $1,689 9.0% $7,808 41.5% $9,497 50.5%2009 65 0.3 833 4.5 898 4.82010 66 0.4 1,172 6.2 1,238 6.62011 120 0.6 1,272 6.8 1,392 7.42012 727 3.9 192 1.0 919 4.92013 402 2.1 48 0.3 450 2.42014 491 2.6 28 0.1 519 2.72015 936 5.0 28 0.1 964 5.12016 1,647 8.7 23 0.1 1,670 8.82017 1,247 6.7 26 0.1 1,273 6.8Total $7,390 39.3% $11,430 60.7% $18,820 100.0%Geographic concentration:(4)            California $999 5.3% $3,116 16.6% $4,115 21.9%New York 1,400 7.4 585 3.1 1,985 10.5Maryland 610 3.2 677 3.6 1,287 6.8Virginia 538 2.9 564 3.0 1,102 5.9Illinois 154 0.8 899 4.8 1,053 5.6New Jersey 391 2.1 609 3.2 1,000 5.3Texas 804 4.3 79 0.4 883 4.7Louisiana 848 4.5 19 0.1 867 4.6Florida 184 1.0 618 3.3 802 4.3Arizona 94 0.5 634 3.4 728 3.9Other 1,368 7.3 3,630 19.2 4,998 26.5Total $7,390 39.3% $11,430 60.7% $18,820 100.0%Lien type:            1st lien $6,414 34.1% $11,193 59.5% $17,607 93.6%2nd lien 976 5.2 237 1.2 1,213 6.4Total $7,390 39.3% $11,430 60.7% $18,820 100.0%Interest rate type:            Fixed rate $3,725 19.8% $1,653 8.8% $5,378 28.6%Adjustable rate 3,665 19.5 9,777 51.9 13,442 71.4Total $7,390 39.3% $11,430 60.7% $18,820 100.0% 88Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  December 31, 2016  Loans PCI Loans(1) Total Home Loans(Dollars in millions) Amount % ofTotal(2) Amount % ofTotal(2) Amount % ofTotal(2)Origination year:(3)            < = 2008 $2,166 10.0% $9,684 44.9% $11,850 54.9%2009 80 0.4 1,088 5.0 1,168 5.42010 82 0.4 1,562 7.2 1,644 7.62011 139 0.6 1,683 7.8 1,822 8.42012 969 4.5 268 1.2 1,237 5.72013 465 2.2 59 0.2 524 2.42014 557 2.6 31 0.2 588 2.82015 1,024 4.7 30 0.2 1,054 4.92016 1,674 7.8 23 0.1 1,697 7.9Total $7,156 33.2% $14,428 66.8% $21,584 100.0%Geographic concentration:(4)            California $976 4.5% $4,017 18.6% $4,993 23.1%New York 1,343 6.2 693 3.2 2,036 9.4Maryland 585 2.7 824 3.9 1,409 6.6Illinois 108 0.5 1,110 5.1 1,218 5.6Virginia 490 2.3 714 3.3 1,204 5.6New Jersey 379 1.8 733 3.4 1,112 5.2Louisiana 962 4.5 23 0.1 985 4.6Florida 159 0.7 772 3.6 931 4.3Arizona 89 0.4 799 3.7 888 4.1Texas 725 3.4 98 0.4 823 3.8Other 1,340 6.2 4,645 21.5 5,985 27.7Total $7,156 33.2% $14,428 66.8% $21,584 100.0%Lien type:            1st lien $6,182 28.7% $14,159 65.5% $20,341 94.2%2nd lien 974 4.5 269 1.3 1,243 5.8Total $7,156 33.2% $14,428 66.8% $21,584 100.0%Interest rate type:            Fixed rate $3,394 15.8% $1,822 8.4% $5,216 24.2%Adjustable rate 3,762 17.4 12,606 58.4 16,368 75.8Total $7,156 33.2% $14,428 66.8% $21,584 100.0%__________(1) The PCI loan balances with an origination date in the years subsequent to 2012 represent refinancing of previously acquired home loans.(2) Percentages within each risk category are calculated based on period-end amounts.

We commence the foreclosure process on home loans when a borrower becomes at least 120 days delinquent in accordance with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau regulations. Foreclosure procedures and timelines vary according to state laws. As of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the carrying value of the foreclosed residential real estate properties we hold and report as other assets on our consolidated balance sheets totaled $47 million and $69 million, respectively.  89Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCommercial BankingWe evaluate the credit risk of commercial loans using a dual risk rating system. We assign internal risk ratings to loans based on relevant information about the ability of the borrowers to repay their debt. In determining the risk rating of a particular loan, some of the factors considered are the borrower’s current financial condition, historical and projected future credit performance, prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors, the estimated realizable value of any collateral and current economic trends. The scale based on our internal risk rating system is as follows:•Noncriticized: Loans that have not been designated as criticized, frequently referred to as “pass” loans.•Criticized performing: Loans in which the financial condition of the obligor is stressed, affecting earnings, cash flows or collateral values. The borrower currently has adequate capacity to meet near-term obligations; however, the stress, left unabated, may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects at some future date.•Criticized nonperforming: Loans that are not adequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as criticized nonperforming have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, which jeopardize the full repayment of the debt. These loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain a credit loss if the deficiencies are not corrected and are generally placed on nonaccrual status.We use our internal risk rating system for regulatory reporting, determining the frequency of credit exposure reviews, and evaluating and determining the allowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans. Loans of $1 million or more that are designated as criticized performing and criticized nonperforming are reviewed quarterly by management to determine if they are appropriately classified/rated and whether any impairment exists. Noncriticized loans greater than $1 million are specifically reviewed, at least annually, to determine the appropriate risk rating. In addition, we evaluate the risk rating during the renewal process of any loan or if a loan becomes past due.The following table presents the geographic distribution and internal risk ratings of our commercial loan portfolio as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.Table 4.8: Commercial Banking Risk Profile by Geographic Region and Internal Risk Rating  September 30, 2017(Dollars in millions) CommercialandMultifamilyReal Estate % ofTotal(1) CommercialandIndustrial % ofTotal(1) Small-TicketCommercialReal Estate % ofTotal(1)  TotalCommercial Banking % ofTotal(1) Geographic concentration:(2)                Northeast $16,302 58.4% $8,498 21.6% $259 61.7% $25,059 37.1%Mid-Atlantic 3,132 11.2 3,838 9.8 15 3.6 6,985 10.3South 3,692 13.2 14,991 38.1 27 6.4 18,710 27.6Other 4,818 17.2 11,979 30.5 119 28.3 16,916 25.0Total $27,944 100.0% $39,306 100.0% $420 100.0% $67,670 100.0%Internal risk rating:(3)                Noncriticized $27,369 98.0% $35,721 90.9% $411 97.8% $63,501 93.8%Criticized performing 486 1.7 2,390 6.1 2 0.5 2,878 4.3Criticized nonperforming 64 0.2 717 1.8 7 1.7 788 1.2PCI loans 25 0.1 478 1.2 0 0.0 503 0.7Total $27,944 100.0% $39,306 100.0% $420 100.0% $67,670 100.0% 90Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  December 31, 2016(Dollars in millions) CommercialandMultifamilyReal Estate % ofTotal(1) CommercialandIndustrial % ofTotal(1) Small-TicketCommercialReal Estate % ofTotal(1)  TotalCommercial Banking % ofTotal(1) Geographic concentration:(2)                Northeast $15,714 59.0% $9,628 24.2% $298 61.7% $25,640 38.3%Mid-Atlantic 3,024 11.4 3,450 8.7 16 3.3 6,490 9.7South 4,032 15.2 15,193 38.1 34 7.0 19,259 28.8Other 3,839 14.4 11,553 29.0 135 28.0 15,527 23.2Total $26,609 100.0% $39,824 100.0% $483 100.0% $66,916 100.0%Internal risk rating:(3)                Noncriticized $26,309 98.9% $36,046 90.5% $473 97.9% $62,828 93.9%Criticized performing 242 0.9 2,205 5.5 6 1.3 2,453 3.7Criticized nonperforming 30 0.1 988 2.5 4 0.8 1,022 1.5PCI loans 28 0.1 585 1.5 0 0.0 613 0.9Total $26,609 100.0% $39,824 100.0% $483 100.0% $66,916 100.0%__________(1) Percentages calculated based on total loans held for investment in each respective loan category using period-end amounts.(2) Geographic concentration is generally determined by the location of the borrower’s business or the location of the collateral associated with the loan.

In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments, such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments. The provision for losses on unfunded lending commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income and the related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.

of the allowance for loan and lease losses for credit card and other consumer loans that we collectively evaluate for impairment is based on a statistical calculation supplemented by management judgment and interpretation. The component of the allowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans that we collectively evaluate for impairment is based on historical loss experience for loans with similar characteristics and consideration of credit quality supplemented by management judgment and interpretation.(2) The asset-specific component of the allowance for loan and lease losses for smaller-balance impaired loans is calculated on a pool basis using historical loss experience for the respective class of assets. The asset-specific component of the allowance for loan and lease losses for larger-balance commercial loans is individually calculated for each loan.(3) The PCI loans component of the allowance for loan and lease losses is accounted for based on expected cash flows. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2016 Form 10-K for details on these loans.(4) Allowance coverage ratio is calculated by dividing the period-end allowance for loan and lease losses by period-end loans held for investment within the specified loan category.We have certain credit card partnership arrangements in which our partner agrees to share a portion of the credit losses associated with the partnership that qualify for net accounting treatment. The expected reimbursements from these partners, which are netted against our allowance for loan and lease losses, result in reductions to reported net charge-offs and provision for credit losses. See  101Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS“Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2016 Form 10-K for further discussion on our card partnership agreements.The table below summarizes the changes in the estimated reimbursements from these partners for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016.Table 5.3: Summary of Loss Sharing Arrangements Impacts  Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,(Dollars in millions) 2017 2016 2017 2016Estimated reimbursements from loss sharing partners:        Balance as of beginning of the period $263 $219 $228 $194Impact to net charge-offs (66) (56) (198) (161)Impact to provision for credit losses 135 64 302 194Balance as of end of the period $332 $227 $332 $227 102Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE 6—VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES AND SECURITIZATIONSIn the normal course of business, we enter into various types of transactions with entities that are considered to be VIEs. Our primary involvement with VIEs has been related to our securitization transactions in which we transferred assets from our balance sheet to securitization trusts. We have primarily securitized credit card and home loans, which have provided a source of funding for us and enabled us to transfer a certain portion of the economic risk of the loans or related debt securities to third parties.The entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is referred to as the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE. The majority of the VIEs in which we are involved have been consolidated in our financial statements.Summary of Consolidated and Unconsolidated VIEsThe assets of our consolidated VIEs primarily consist of cash, credit card loan receivables and the related allowance for loan and lease losses, which we report on our consolidated balance sheets under restricted cash, loans held in consolidated trusts and allowance for loan and lease losses, respectively. The assets of a particular VIE are the primary source of funding to settle its obligations. The creditors of the VIEs typically do not have recourse to the general credit of the Company. The liabilities primarily consist of debt securities issued by the VIEs, which we report under securitized debt obligations. For unconsolidated VIEs, we present the carrying amount of assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets and our maximum exposure to loss. Our maximum exposure to loss is estimated based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and we are required to meet our maximum remaining funding obligations.The table below presents a summary of certain VIEs in which we had continuing involvement or held a variable interest, aggregated based on VIEs with similar characteristics as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. We separately present information for consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs.Table 6.1: Carrying Amount of Consolidated and Unconsolidated VIEs  September 30, 2017  Consolidated Unconsolidated(Dollars in millions) CarryingAmountof Assets CarryingAmount ofLiabilities CarryingAmountof Assets CarryingAmount ofLiabilities Maximum Exposure toLossSecuritization-Related VIEs:          Credit card loan securitizations(1) $34,230 $17,654 $0 $0 $0Home loan securitizations(2) 0 0 178 89 1,105Total securitization-related VIEs 34,230 17,654 178 89 1,105Other VIEs:(3)          Affordable housing entities 221 18 4,237 1,316 4,237Entities that provide capital to low-income and rural communities 1,321 128 0 0 0Other 0 0 314 0 314Total other VIEs 1,542 146 4,551 1,316 4,551Total VIEs $35,772 $17,800 $4,729 $1,405 $5,656 103Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  December 31, 2016  Consolidated Unconsolidated(Dollars in millions) CarryingAmountof Assets CarryingAmount ofLiabilities CarryingAmountof Assets CarryingAmount ofLiabilities MaximumExposure toLossSecuritization-Related VIEs:          Credit card loan securitizations(1) $33,550 $19,662 $0 $0 $0Home loan securitizations(2) 0 0 201 27 1,276Total securitization-related VIEs 33,550 19,662 201 27 1,276Other VIEs:(3)          Affordable housing entities  174 9 3,862 1,093 3,862Entities that provide capital to low-income and rural communities 927 127 0 0 0Other 0 0 187 0 187Total other VIEs 1,101 136 4,049 1,093 4,049Total VIEs $34,651 $19,798 $4,250 $1,120 $5,325__________(1) Represents the carrying amount of assets and liabilities owned by the VIE, which includes the seller’s interest and repurchased notes held by other related parties.(2) The carrying amount of assets of unconsolidated securitization-related VIEs consists of retained interests associated with the securitization of option-adjustable rate mortgage (“option-ARM”) loans and letters of credit related to manufactured housing securitizations. These are reported on our consolidated balance sheets within other assets. The carrying amount of liabilities of unconsolidated securitization-related VIEs is comprised of obligations on certain swap agreements associated with the securitizations of manufactured housing loans and other obligations. These are reported on our consolidated balance sheets within other liabilities.(3) In certain investment structures, we consolidate a VIE which in turn holds as its primary asset an investment in an unconsolidated VIE. In these instances, we disclose the carrying amount of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets in the unconsolidated VIEs to avoid duplicating our exposure, as the unconsolidated VIEs are generally the operating entities generating the exposure. The carrying amount of assets and liabilities included in the unconsolidated VIE columns above related to these investment structures were $2.2 billion of assets and $898 million of liabilities as of September 30, 2017 and $1.9 billion of assets and $618 million of liabilities as of December 31, 2016. Securitization-Related VIEsIn a securitization transaction, assets from our balance sheet are transferred to a trust, which generally meets the definition of a VIE. Our primary securitization activity is in the form of credit card securitizations, conducted through securitization trusts which we consolidate. Our continuing involvement in these securitization transactions mainly consists of acting as the primary servicer and holding certain retained interests.We transfer residential home loans and multifamily commercial loans that we originate to the government-sponsored enterprises (“GSEs”) and retain the right to service the transferred loans pursuant to the guidelines set forth by the GSEs. Subsequent to such transfers, these loans are commonly securitized into RMBS or CMBS by the GSEs. We also hold RMBS, CMBS and ABS in our investment portfolio, which represent an interest in the respective securitization trusts employed in the transactions under which those securities were issued. We do not consolidate the securitization trusts employed in these transactions as we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these securitization trusts. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with these VIEs is the carrying value of the mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) and investment securities on our consolidated balance sheets. See “Note 7—Goodwill and Intangible Assets” for information related to our MSRs associated with these residential home loan and multifamily commercial loan securitizations and “Note 3—Investment Securities” for more information on the securities held in our investment securities portfolio. We exclude these VIEs from the tables within this note because we do not consider our continuing involvement with these VIEs to be significant; we either invest in securities issued by the VIE and were not involved in the design of the VIE or no transfers have occurred between the VIE and us. In addition, where we have certain lending arrangements in the normal course of business with entities that could be VIEs, we have also excluded these VIEs from the tables presented in this note. See “Note 4—Loans” for additional information regarding our lending arrangements in the normal course of business. 104Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSWe also may have exposure associated with contractual obligations to repurchase previously transferred loans due to breaches of representations and warranties. See “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others” for information related to reserves we have established for our mortgage representation and warranty exposure.The table below presents our continuing involvement in certain securitization-related VIEs as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Table 6.2: Continuing Involvement in Securitization-Related VIEs    Mortgage (Dollars in millions) CreditCard Option-ARM GreenPointHELOCs GreenPointManufacturedHousing September 30, 2017:         Securities held by third-party investors $17,087 $1,288 $44 $599 Receivables in the trust 34,763 1,331 38 603 Cash balance of spread or reserve accounts 0 8 N/A 121 Retained interests Yes Yes Yes Yes Servicing retained Yes Yes(1) No No(2) Amortization event(3) No No No No December 31, 2016:         Securities held by third-party investors $18,826 $1,499 $56 $697 Receivables in the trust 31,762 1,549 50 702 Cash balance of spread or reserve accounts 0 8 N/A 130 Retained interests Yes Yes Yes Yes Servicing retained Yes Yes(1) No No(2) Amortization event(3) No No No No __________(1) We continue to service certain option-ARM securitizations.(2) The core servicing activities for the manufactured housing securitizations are completed by a third party.(3) Amortization events vary according to each specific trust agreement but generally are triggered by declines in performance or credit metrics of the underlying assets, such as net charge-off rates or delinquency rates, beyond certain predetermined thresholds. Generally, the occurrence of an amortization event changes the sequencing and amount of trust-related cash flows to the benefit of more senior interest holders.Credit Card SecuritizationsWe hold certain retained interests in our credit card securitizations and continue to service the receivables in these trusts. As of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we were deemed to be the primary beneficiary, and accordingly, all of these trusts have been consolidated in our financial statements. Mortgage SecuritizationsOption-ARM LoansWe had previously securitized option-ARM loans by transferring these loans to securitization trusts that had issued mortgage-backed securities to investors. The outstanding balance of debt securities held by third-party investors related to these mortgage loan securitization trusts was $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.We continue to service a portion of the remaining mortgage loans in these securitizations. We also retain rights to future cash flows arising from these securitizations, the most significant being certificated interest-only bonds issued by the trusts. We generally estimate the fair value of these retained interests based on the estimated present value of expected future cash flows, using our best estimates of the key assumptions which include credit losses, prepayment speeds and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. For the mortgage loans that we continue to service, we do not consolidate the related trusts because we do not have the right to receive benefits nor the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts. For the remaining  105Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTStrusts, for which we no longer service the underlying mortgage loans, we do not consolidate these entities since we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts.In connection with the securitization of certain option-ARM loans, a third party is obligated to advance a portion of any “negative amortization” resulting from monthly payments that are less than the interest accrued for that payment period. We have an agreement in place with the third party that mirrors this advance requirement. The amount advanced is tracked through mortgage-backed securities retained as part of the securitization transaction. As advances occur, we record an asset in the form of negative amortization bonds, which are held at fair value in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Our maximum exposure is affected by rate caps and monthly payment change caps, but the funding obligation cannot exceed the difference between the original loan balance multiplied by a preset negative amortization cap and the current unpaid principal balance. For the transactions where the negative amortization funding agreements have been terminated, incremental negative amortization is funded through the available cash flow in each transaction.We have also entered into certain derivative contracts related to the securitization activities. These are classified as free-standing derivatives, with fair value adjustments recorded in non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income. See “Note 9—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” for further details on these derivatives.GreenPoint Mortgage Home Equity Lines of Credit (“HELOCs”)Our discontinued wholesale mortgage banking unit, GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, Inc. (“GreenPoint”), previously sold HELOCs in whole loan sales that were subsequently securitized by third parties. GreenPoint acquired residual interests in certain of those securitization trusts. We do not consolidate these trusts because we either lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts or because we do not have the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts. As the residual interest holder, GreenPoint is required to fund advances on the HELOCs when certain performance triggers are met due to deterioration in asset performance. On behalf of GreenPoint, we have funded cumulative advances of $30 million as of both September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. We also have unfunded commitments of $5 million related to those interests for our non-consolidated VIEs as of both September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.GreenPoint Credit Manufactured HousingAs of September 30, 2017, we had certain retained interests and obligations related to the discontinued manufactured housing operations of GreenPoint Credit, LLC, a subsidiary of GreenPoint. Such discontinued operations, including the related recourse obligations, servicing rights and the primary obligation to execute mandatory clean-up calls in certain securitization transactions were sold to a third party in 2004. We did not consolidate these securitization trusts because we did not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts as we did not service the loans.The unpaid principal balance of manufactured housing securitization transactions where we were the residual interest holder was $603 million and $702 million as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. In the event the third-party servicer could not fulfill its obligation to exercise the clean-up calls on certain securitizations, the obligation would revert to us and we would be required to acquire a maximum of approximately $391 million of loan receivables and other assets upon our execution of these clean-up calls with the requirement to absorb any losses on the loan receivables and other assets. See “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others” for information related to these obligations.On October 10, 2017, we entered into an agreement with the third-party servicer under which we assumed the mandatory obligation to exercise the remaining clean-up calls as they become due on certain securitization transactions and received approximately $37 million in compensation for assuming this obligation. As a result of this agreement, we will recognize the loan receivables and a corresponding liability on our consolidated balance sheets in the fourth quarter of 2017. We were required to fund letters of credit to cover losses on certain manufactured housing securitizations. We have the right to receive any funds remaining in the letters of credit after the securities are released. The fair value of these letters of credit are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets and totaled $76 million and $85 million as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. We also have credit exposure on an agreement that we entered into to absorb a portion of the risk of loss on certain manufactured housing securitizations not subject to the funded letters of credit. Our maximum credit exposure related to the agreement totaled $11 million and $12 million as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Our  106Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSobligation under the agreement included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets was $8 million as of both September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.Other VIEsAffordable Housing EntitiesAs part of our community reinvestment initiatives, we invest in private investment funds that make equity investments in multi-family affordable housing properties. We receive affordable housing tax credits for these investments. The activities of these entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. We account for certain of our investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method if certain criteria are met. The proportional amortization method amortizes the cost of the investment over the period in which the investor expects to receive tax credits and other tax benefits, and the resulting amortization is recognized as a component of income tax expense attributable to continuing operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, we recognized amortization of $347 million and $295 million, respectively, and tax credits of $388 million and $336 million, respectively, associated with these investments within income tax provision. The carrying value of our equity investments in these qualified affordable housing projects was $4.0 billion and $3.8 billion as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. We are periodically required to provide additional financial or other support during the period of the investments. Our liability for these unfunded commitments was $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Predominantly all of this liability is expected to be paid from 2017 to 2019.For those investment funds considered to be VIEs, we are not required to consolidate them if we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of those entities. We record our interests in these unconsolidated VIEs in loans held for investment, other assets and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our interests consisted of assets of approximately $4.2 billion and $3.9 billion as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Our maximum exposure to these entities is limited to our variable interests in the entities of $4.2 billion and $3.9 billion as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit and we do not provide additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it. The total assets of the unconsolidated VIE investment funds were approximately $10.4 billion and $11.5 billion as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.Entities that Provide Capital to Low-Income and Rural Communities We hold variable interests in entities (“Investor Entities”) that invest in community development entities (“CDEs”) that provide debt financing to businesses and non-profit entities in low-income and rural communities. Variable interests in the CDEs held by the consolidated Investor Entities are also our variable interests. The activities of the Investor Entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. The activities of the CDEs are financed solely with invested equity capital. We receive federal and state tax credits for these investments. We consolidate the VIEs in which we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and where we have the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE. We have also consolidated other investments and CDEs that are not considered to be VIEs, but where we hold a controlling financial interest. The assets of the VIEs that we consolidated, which totaled approximately $1.3 billion and $927 million as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets in cash, loans held for investment, interest receivable and other assets. The liabilities are reflected in other liabilities. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit. We have not provided additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it.OtherOther VIEs include variable interests that we hold in companies that promote renewable energy sources and other equity method investments. We were not required to consolidate these entities because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance. Our maximum exposure to these entities is limited to the investment on our consolidated balance sheets of $314 million and $187 million as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The creditors of the other VIEs have no recourse to our general credit. We have not provided additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it. 107Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE 7—GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETSThe table below displays the components of goodwill, intangible assets and MSRs as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

Securitized and Unsecured Debt ObligationsIn addition to our deposits, which serve as our primary funding source, we use a variety of other funding sources including short-term borrowings, the issuance of senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings, and securitization transactions. In addition, we utilize FHLB advances, which are secured by certain portions of our loan and investment securities portfolios, for our funding needs. The securitized debt obligations are separately presented on our consolidated balance sheets as they represent obligations of consolidated securitization trusts, while federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings, including FHLB advances, are included in other debt on our consolidated balance sheets.Securitized Debt ObligationsOur borrowings due to securitization investors decreased to $17.1 billion as of September 30, 2017 from $18.8 billion as of December 31, 2016. During the first nine months of 2017, we had $7.2 billion of maturities, partially offset by $3.0 billion of new issuances from our credit card loan securitization trust and $2.5 billion of securitized debt obligations assumed in the Cabela’s acquisition.Senior and Subordinated NotesWe had $28.4 billion and $23.4 billion of senior and subordinated notes outstanding as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. During the first nine months of 2017, we issued $7.8 billion of long-term senior and subordinated debt comprised of $1.7 billion of floating-rate notes and $6.1 billion of fixed-rate notes. During the first nine months of 2017, $2.8 billion of senior and subordinated notes matured. FHLB Advances and OtherWe have access to funding through the FHLB system and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Our FHLB and Federal Reserve memberships require us to hold FHLB and Federal Reserve stock which totaled $1.7 billion and $1.9 billion as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, and are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.Our FHLB advances and lines of credit are secured by our investment securities, residential home loans, multifamily real estate loans, commercial real estate loans and HELOCs. Outstanding FHLB advances totaled $13.1 billion and $17.2 billion as of September 30, 2017 and December 2016, respectively, substantially all of which represented long-term advances generally callable on either a monthly or a quarterly basis.Composition of Deposits, Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term DebtThe table below summarizes the components of our deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Our total short-term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. Our long-term debt consists of borrowings with an original contractual maturity of greater than one year. The carrying value presented below for these borrowings include unamortized debt premiums and discounts, net of debt issuance costs and fair value hedge accounting adjustments.  110Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSTable 8.1: Components of Deposits, Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt(Dollars in millions) September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016Deposits:    Non-interest-bearing deposits $26,106 $25,502Interest-bearing deposits 212,956 211,266Total deposits $239,062 $236,768Short-term borrowings:    Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase $767 $992Total short-term borrowings $767 $992  September 30, 2017  (Dollars in millions) MaturityDates Interest Rates Weighted-AverageInterest Rate Carrying Value December 31, 2016Long-term debt:          Securitized debt obligations(1) 2018 - 2025 1.33 - 2.75% 1.77 $17,087 $18,826Senior and subordinated notes:(1)          Fixed unsecured senior debt 2018 - 2027 1.50 - 4.75 2.69 20,815 17,546Floating unsecured senior debt 2018 - 2023 1.99 - 2.46 2.19 3,047 1,353Total unsecured senior debt 2.63 23,862 18,899Fixed unsecured subordinated debt 2019 - 2026 3.38 - 8.80 4.09 4,558 4,532Total senior and subordinated notes 28,420 23,431Other long-term borrowings:          FHLB advances 2017 - 2023 1.21 - 5.43 1.23 13,136 17,179Capital lease obligations 2022 - 2035 2.50 - 12.86 5.75 48 32Total other long-term borrowings 13,184 17,211Total long-term debt $58,691 $59,468Total short-term borrowings and long-term debt $59,458 $60,460__________(1) Carrying value includes fair value hedge accounting adjustments. 111Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSComponents of Interest ExpenseThe following table displays interest expense attributable to short-term borrowings and long-term debt for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016:Table 8.2: Components of Interest Expense on Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt  Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,(Dollars in millions) 2017 2016 2017 2016Short-term borrowings:        Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase $1 $0 $3 $2Total short-term borrowings 1 0 3 2Long-term debt:        Securitized debt obligations(1) 85 56 236 151Senior and subordinated notes(1) 194 121 522 338Other long-term borrowings 30 34 65 84Total long-term debt 309 211 823 573Total interest expense on short-term borrowings and long-term debt $310 $211 $826 $575__________(1)  Interest expense includes the impact from qualifying hedge accounting relationships. 112Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE 9—DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIESUse of DerivativesWe manage asset and liability positions and market risk exposure and limits in accordance with market risk management policies that are approved by our Board of Directors. Our primary market risks stem from the impact on our earnings and economic value of equity from changes in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, changes in foreign exchange rates. We employ several techniques to manage our interest rate sensitivity, which include changing the duration and re-pricing characteristics of various assets and liabilities by using interest rate derivatives. Our current policies also include the use of derivatives to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currency so we may limit our earnings and capital ratio exposures to foreign exchange risk. We execute our derivative contracts in both the over-the-counter (“OTC”) and exchange-traded derivative markets. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to clear eligible derivative transactions through Central Counterparty Clearinghouses (“CCPs”) such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (“CME”) and Clearnet (“LCH”), which are often referred to as “central clearinghouses.” The majority of our derivatives are interest rate swaps. In addition, we may use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks. We offer various interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity derivatives as an accommodation to our customers within our Commercial Banking business, and usually offset our exposure through derivative transactions with other counterparties.Derivatives Counterparty Credit RiskDerivative instruments contain an element of credit risk that arises from the potential failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of the contract. Our exposure to derivative counterparty credit risk, at any point in time, is represented by the fair value of derivatives in a gain position, or derivative asset position, assuming no recoveries of underlying collateral.To mitigate the risk of counterparty default, we enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements and collateral agreements, where possible, with certain derivative counterparties. We generally enter into these agreements on a bilateral basis with our counterparties. These bilateral agreements typically provide the right to offset exposures and require one counterparty to post collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position to the other counterparty. Certain of these bilateral agreements include provisions requiring that our debt maintain a credit rating of investment grade or above by each of the major credit rating agencies. In the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating below investment grade, some of our counterparties would have the right to terminate the derivative contract and close out the existing positions.  We also clear certain OTC derivatives with central clearinghouses through futures commission merchants (“FCMs”) as part of the regulatory requirement. The use of the central clearinghouses and the FCMs reduces our bilateral counterparty credit exposures while it increases our credit exposures to CCPs and FCMs. We are required by CCPs to post initial and variation margin to mitigate the risk of non-payment through our FCMs. Our FCM agreements governing these derivative transactions generally include provisions that may require us to post more collateral or otherwise change terms in our agreements under certain circumstances. Effective January 3, 2017, the CME amended its rulebook to legally characterize variation margin cash payments for cleared OTC derivatives as a settlement of the position rather than collateral. We adopted this variation margin rule change in the second quarter of 2017. As a result, we began reducing the corresponding derivative assets and liabilities for CME-cleared OTC derivatives to reflect the settlement of these positions. Variation margin payments for LCH-cleared OTC derivatives continue to be characterized as collateral.We record counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments (“CVAs”) on our OTC derivative contracts to properly reflect the credit quality of the counterparty. We consider collateral and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate our credit exposure to each counterparty in determining the counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment, which may be adjusted in future periods due to changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts, collateral and creditworthiness of the counterparty. We also record debit valuation adjustments (“DVAs”) to adjust the fair value of our derivative liabilities to reflect the impact of our own credit quality. We calculate this adjustment by comparing the spreads on our credit default swaps to the discount benchmark curve. Accounting for DerivativesOur derivatives are designated as either qualifying accounting hedges or free-standing derivatives. Qualifying accounting hedges are designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges. Free-standing derivatives primarily consist of customer-accommodation derivatives and economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting.  113Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS•Fair Value Hedges: We designate derivatives as fair value hedges when they are used to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, which fluctuate in value as a result of movements in interest rates. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded in earnings together with offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item and any resulting ineffectiveness. Our fair value hedges consist of interest rate swaps that are intended to modify our exposure to interest rate risk on various fixed-rate assets and liabilities. •Cash Flow Hedges: We designate derivatives as cash flow hedges when they are used to manage our exposure to variability in cash flows related to forecasted transactions. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of AOCI, to the extent that the hedge relationships are effective, and amounts are reclassified from AOCI to earnings as the forecasted transactions impact earnings. To the extent that any ineffectiveness exists in the hedge relationships, the amounts are recorded in current period earnings. Our cash flow hedges use interest rate swaps and floors that are intended to hedge the variability in interest receipts or interest payments on some of our variable-rate assets or liabilities. We also enter into foreign currency forward derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to intercompany borrowings denominated in foreign currency. •Net Investment Hedges: We use net investment hedges to manage the foreign currency exposure related to our net investments in foreign operations that have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recorded in the translation adjustment component of AOCI, offsetting the translation gain or loss from those foreign operations. We execute net investment hedges using foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the translation exposure of the net investment in our foreign operations.•Free-Standing Derivatives: We use free-standing derivatives to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of residential MSRs, mortgage loan origination and purchase commitments and other interests held. We also categorize our customer accommodation derivatives and the related offsetting contracts as free-standing derivatives. Changes in the fair value of free-standing derivatives are recorded in earnings as a component of other non-interest income.Balance Sheet PresentationThe following table summarizes the notional and fair values of our derivative instruments as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, which are segregated by derivatives that are designated as accounting hedges and those that are not, and are further segregated by type of contract within those two categories. The total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and any associated cash collateral received or pledged.  114Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSTable 9.1: Derivative Assets and Liabilities at Fair Value  September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016  Notional orContractualAmount Derivative(1)(5) Notional orContractualAmount Derivative(1)(Dollars in millions) Assets Liabilities Assets LiabilitiesDerivatives designated as accounting hedges:            Interest rate contracts:            Fair value hedges $51,645 $78 $79 $40,480 $295 $569Cash flow hedges 65,700 30 96 50,400 151 287Total interest rate contracts 117,345 108 175 90,880 446 856Foreign exchange contracts:            Cash flow hedges 5,833 10 228 5,620 108 9Net investment hedges 2,849 0 172 2,396 163 0Total foreign exchange contracts 8,682 10 400 8,016 271 9Total derivatives designated as accounting hedges 126,027 118 575 98,896 717 865Derivatives not designated as accounting hedges:            Interest rate contracts covering:            MSRs(2) 1,639 8 4 1,696 17 21Customer accommodation 45,886 570 435 39,474 670 530Other interest rate exposures(3) 4,914 49 12 1,105 33 8Total interest rate contracts 52,439 627 451 42,275 720 559Other contracts 1,053 0 5 1,767 57 14Total derivatives not designated as accounting hedges 53,492 627 456 44,042 777 573Total derivatives $179,519 $745 $1,031 $142,938 $1,494 $1,438Less: netting adjustment(4)   (236) (598)   (539) (336)Total derivative assets/liabilities   $509 $433   $955 $1,102__________(1) Derivative assets and liabilities presented above exclude valuation adjustments related to non-performance risk.

Either counterparty can generally request to net settle all contracts through a single payment upon default on, or termination of, any one contract. We elect to offset the derivative assets and liabilities under netting arrangements for balance sheet presentation where a right of setoff exists. For derivative contracts entered into under master netting arrangements for which we have not been able to confirm the enforceability of the setoff rights, or those not subject to master netting arrangements, we do not offset our derivative positions for balance sheet presentation.We also maintain collateral agreements with certain derivative counterparties. For bilateral derivatives, we review our collateral positions on a daily basis and exchange collateral with our counterparties in accordance with standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association documentation and other related agreements. Agreements with certain bilateral counterparties require both parties to maintain collateral in the event the fair values of derivative instruments exceed established exposure thresholds. For  115Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTScentrally cleared derivatives, we are subject to initial margin and daily variation margin posting with the central clearinghouses. Acceptable types of collateral are typically in the form of cash or high quality liquid securities. The exchange of collateral is dependent upon the fair value of the derivative instruments as well as the fair value of the pledged collateral. When valuing collateral, an estimate of the variation in price and liquidity over time is subtracted in the form of a “haircut” to discount the value of the collateral pledged. The following table presents as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 the gross and net fair values of our derivative assets and liabilities and repurchase agreements, as well as the related offsetting amounts permitted under U.S. GAAP. The table also includes cash and non-cash collateral received or pledged associated with such arrangements. The collateral amounts shown are limited to the extent of the related net derivative fair values or outstanding balances, thus instances of over-collateralization are not shown.Table 9.2: Offsetting of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  GrossAmounts Gross Amounts Offset in the Balance Sheet Net Amounts as Recognized Securities Collateral Held Under Master Netting Agreements  (Dollars in millions)  FinancialInstruments Cash Collateral Received   NetExposureAs of September 30, 2017            Derivatives assets(1)(2) $745 $(187) $(49) $509 $0 $509As of December 31, 2016            Derivatives assets(1)(2) 1,494 (152) (387) 955 (11) 944  GrossAmounts Gross Amounts Offset in the Balance Sheet Net Amounts as Recognized Securities Collateral Pledged Under Master Netting Agreements  (Dollars in millions)  FinancialInstruments Cash Collateral Pledged   NetExposureAs of September 30, 2017            Derivatives liabilities(1)(2) $1,031 $(187) $(411) $433 $0 $433Repurchase agreements(3) 767 0 0 767 (767) 0As of December 31, 2016            Derivatives liabilities(1)(2) 1,438 (152) (184) 1,102 0 1,102Repurchase agreements 992 0 0 992 (992) 0__________(1) Reflects a reduction of derivative assets of $23 million and a reduction of derivative liabilities of $500 million on our consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2017 as a result of adoption of the CME variation margin rule change in the second quarter of 2017.(2) We received cash collateral from derivative counterparties totaling $51 million and $448 million as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.

The fair value accounting guidance provides a three-level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments. This hierarchy is based on the markets in which the assets or liabilities trade and whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable. The fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:Level 1: Valuation is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2: Valuation is based on observable market-based inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or models using inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data of substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3: Valuation is generated from techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. Valuation techniques include pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques.The accounting guidance for fair value measurements requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in determining fair value. The accounting guidance provides for the irrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-contract basis, to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value at inception of the contract and record any subsequent changes in fair value in earnings. We have not made any material fair value option elections as of or for the periods disclosed herein.The determination and classification of financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy is performed at the end of each reporting period. We consider all available information, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs. For additional information on the valuation techniques used in estimating the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities on a recurring or nonrecurring basis and for estimating the fair value for financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value, see “Note 17—Fair Value Measurement” in our 2016 Form 10-K.Fair Value Governance and ControlWe have a governance framework and a number of key controls that are intended to ensure that our fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable. Our governance framework provides for independent oversight and segregation of duties. Our control processes include review and approval of new transaction types, price verification and review of valuation judgments, methods, models, process controls and results. Groups independent of our trading and investing functions participate in the review and validation process. Tasks performed by these groups include periodic verification of fair value measurements to determine if assigned fair values are reasonable, including comparing prices from third-party pricing services to other available market information. Our Fair Value Committee (“FVC”), which includes representation from business areas, Risk Management and Finance divisions, provides guidance and oversight to ensure an appropriate valuation control environment. The FVC regularly reviews and approves our fair valuations to ensure that our valuation practices are consistent with industry standards and adhere to regulatory and accounting guidance. We have a model policy, established by an independent Model Risk Office, which governs the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for pricing and fair value measurements. The Model Risk Office validates all models and provides ongoing monitoring of their performance. The fair valuation governance process is set up in a manner that allows the Chairperson of the FVC to escalate valuation disputes that cannot be resolved by the FVC to a more senior committee called the Valuations Advisory Committee (“VAC”) for resolution. The VAC is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and includes other members of senior management. The VAC is only required to convene to review escalated valuation disputes. 124Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisThe following table displays our assets and liabilities measured on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

interests in securitizations are reported in other non-interest income, which is a component of non-interest income, in our consolidated statements of income.(2) During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, the transfers into Level 3 were primarily driven by the usage of unobservable assumptions in the pricing of these securities as evidenced by wider pricing variations among pricing vendors. Transfers out of Level 3 were primarily driven by the usage of assumptions corroborated by market observable information as evidenced by tighter pricing among multiple pricing sources. (3) The amount presented for unrealized gains (losses) for assets still held as of the reporting date primarily represents impairments of securities available for sale, accretion on certain fixed maturity securities, changes in fair value of derivative instruments and mortgage servicing rights transactions.(4) All Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis and are not reduced by the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to net positive and negative positions and the related payables and receivables for cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparty. Significant Level 3 Fair Value Asset and Liability Input SensitivityChanges in unobservable inputs may have a significant impact on fair value. Certain of these unobservable inputs will, in isolation, have a directionally consistent impact on the fair value of the instrument for a given change in that input. Alternatively, the fair value of the instrument may move in an opposite direction for a given change in another input. In general, an increase in the discount rate, default rates, loss severity and credit spreads, in isolation, would result in a decrease in the fair value measurement. In addition, an increase in default rates would generally be accompanied by a decrease in recovery rates, slower prepayment rates and an increase in liquidity spreads.Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value MeasurementsThe following table presents the significant unobservable inputs used to determine the fair values of our Level 3 financial instruments on a recurring basis. We utilize multiple third-party pricing services to obtain fair value for our securities. Several of our third-party pricing services are only able to provide unobservable input information for a limited number of securities due to software licensing restrictions. Other third-party pricing services are able to provide unobservable input information for all securities for which they provide a valuation. As a result, the unobservable input information for the securities available for sale presented below represents a composite summary of all information we are able to obtain. The unobservable input information for all other Level 3 financial instruments is based on the assumptions used in our internal valuation models. 128Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSTable 12.3: Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements  Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements(Dollars in millions) Fair Value at September 30, 2017 SignificantValuationTechniques SignificantUnobservableInputs Range WeightedAverageAssets:          Securities available for sale:          RMBS $520 Discounted cash flows (3rd party pricing) YieldVoluntary prepayment rateDefault rateLoss severity 2-9%0-15%0-10%0-90% 4%4%4%65%CMBS 66 Discounted cash flows (3rd party pricing) YieldVoluntary prepayment rate 2-3%0% 2%0%Other securities 9 Discounted cash flows Yield 2% 2%Other assets:          Derivative assets(1) 57 Discounted cash flows Swap rates 2% 2%Consumer MSRs 90 Discounted cash flows Total prepayment rateDiscount rateOption-adjusted spread rateServicing cost ($ per loan) 7-21%15%400-1,464 bps$75-$100 15%15%497 bps$76Retained interests in securitization(2) 178 Discounted cash flows Life of receivables (months)Voluntary prepayment rateDiscount rateDefault rateLoss severity 2-872-10%3-11%1-11%5-113% N/ALiabilities:          Derivative liabilities(1) $30 Discounted cash flows Swap rates 2% 2%  Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements(Dollars in millions) Fair Value at December 31, 2016 SignificantValuationTechniques SignificantUnobservableInputs Range WeightedAverageAssets:          Securities available for sale:          RMBS $518 Discounted cash flows (3rd party pricing) YieldVoluntary prepayment rateDefault rateLoss severity 0-15%0-30%0-16%9-87% 5%4%4%57%CMBS 51 Discounted cash flows (3rd party pricing) YieldVoluntary prepayment rate 2%0% 2%0%Other securities 9 Discounted cash flows Yield 1-2% 1%Other assets:          Derivative assets(1) 47 Discounted cash flows Swap rates 2% 2%Consumer MSRs 80 Discounted cash flows Total prepayment rateDiscount rateOption-adjusted spread rateServicing cost ($ per loan) 8-20%15%580-1,500 bps$75-$100 15%15%636 bps$76Retained interests in securitization(2) 201 Discounted cash flows Life of receivables (months) Voluntary prepayment rateDiscount rateDefault rateLoss severity 6-872-11%4-11%1-6%7-102% N/ALiabilities:          Derivative liabilities(1) $29 Discounted cash flows Swap rates 2% 2%__________(1) All Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis and are not reduced by the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to net positive and negative positions and the related payables and receivables for cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparty.

These assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, from the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or when we evaluate for impairment). The following table presents the carrying value of the assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and still held as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and for which a nonrecurring fair value measurement was recorded during the nine and twelve months then ended:Table 12.4: Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements  September 30, 2017  Estimated Fair Value Hierarchy Total(Dollars in millions) Level 2 Level 3 Loans held for investment $0 $563 $563Loans held for sale 773 2 775Other assets(1) 0 29 29Total $773 $594 $1,367  December 31, 2016  Estimated Fair Value Hierarchy Total(Dollars in millions) Level 2 Level 3 Loans held for investment $0 $587 $587Loans held for sale 157 0 157Other assets(1) 0 83 83Total $157 $670 $827__________(1) Other assets includes foreclosed property and repossessed assets of $22 million and long-lived assets held for sale of $7 million as of September 30, 2017, compared to foreclosed property and repossessed assets of $43 million and long-lived assets held for sale of $40 million as of December 31, 2016.In the above table, loans held for investment primarily include nonperforming loans for which specific reserves or charge-offs have been recognized. These loans are classified as Level 3, as they are valued based in part on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral and the non-recoverable rate, which is considered to be a significant unobservable input. Collateral fair value sources include the appraisal value obtained from independent appraisers, broker pricing opinions or other available market information. The non-recoverable rate ranged from 0% to 17%, with a weighted average of 12%, and from 0% to 73%, with a weighted average of 16%, as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The fair value of the loans held for sale and the other assets classified as Level 3 is determined based on appraisal value or listing price which involves significant judgment; the significant unobservable inputs and related quantitative information are not meaningful to disclose as they vary significantly across properties and collateral. 130Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe following table presents total nonrecurring fair value measurements for the period, included in earnings, attributable to the change in fair value relating to assets that are still held at September 30, 2017 and 2016.Table 12.5: Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements Included in Earnings  Total Gains (Losses)  Nine Months Ended September 30,(Dollars in millions) 2017 2016Loans held for investment $(237) $(142)Loans held for sale (5) 0Other assets(1) (7) (15)Total $(249) $(157)__________(1) Other assets includes losses related to foreclosed property, repossessed assets and long-lived assets held for sale.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe following table presents the carrying value and estimated fair value, including the level within the fair value hierarchy, of our financial instruments that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis on our consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.Table 12.6: Fair Value of Financial Instruments   September 30, 2017  CarryingValue EstimatedFair Value Estimated Fair Value Hierarchy(Dollars in millions)   Level 1 Level 2 Level 3Financial assets:          Cash and cash equivalents $8,484 $8,484 $4,154 $4,330 $0Restricted cash for securitization investors 304 304 304 0 0Securities held to maturity 28,650 29,327 199 29,122 6Net loans held for investment 245,004 249,622 0 0 249,622Loans held for sale 1,566 1,580 0 1,578 2Interest receivable 1,426 1,426 0 1,426 0Other investments(1) 1,803 1,804 0 1,793 11Financial liabilities:          Deposits $239,062 $241,634 $26,106 $215,528 $0Securitized debt obligations 17,087 17,196 0 17,196 0Senior and subordinated notes 28,420 29,004 0 29,004 0Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase 767 767 0 767 0Other borrowings(2) 13,136 13,137 0 13,137 0Interest payable 301 301 0 301 0 131Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  December 31, 2016  CarryingValue EstimatedFair Value Estimated Fair Value Hierarchy(Dollars in millions)   Level 1 Level 2 Level 3Financial assets:          Cash and cash equivalents $9,976 $9,976 $4,185 $5,791 $0Restricted cash for securitization investors 2,517 2,517 2,517 0 0Securities held to maturity 25,712 26,196 199 25,962 35Net loans held for investment 239,083 242,935 0 0 242,935Loans held for sale 1,043 1,038 0 1,038 0Interest receivable 1,351 1,351 0 1,351 0Other investments(1) 2,029 2,029 0 2,020 9Financial liabilities:          Deposits $236,768 $237,082 $25,502 $211,580 $0Securitized debt obligations 18,826 18,920 0 18,920 0Senior and subordinated notes 23,431 23,774 0 23,774 0Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase 992 992 0 992 0Other borrowings 17,211 17,180 0 17,180 0Interest payable 327 327 0 327 0__________(1) Other investments includes FHLB, Federal Reserve stock and cost method investments.

The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group, are included in the Other category.Basis of PresentationWe report the results of each of our business segments on a continuing operations basis. See “Note 2—Discontinued Operations” for a discussion of our discontinued operations. The results of our individual businesses reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. Business Segment Reporting MethodologyThe results of our business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. Our internal management and reporting process used to derive our segment results employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. Our funds transfer pricing process provides a funds credit for sources of funds, such as deposits generated by our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses, and a funds charge for the use of funds by each segment. Due to the integrated nature of our business segments, estimates and judgments have been made in allocating certain revenue and expense items. Transactions between segments are based on specific criteria or approximate third-party rates. We regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods. We provide additional information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in “Note 18—Business Segments” in our 2016 Form 10-K.Segment Results and Reconciliation We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies or changes in organizational alignment. The following tables present our business segment results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, selected balance sheet data as of September 30, 2017 and 2016, and a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated income from continuing operations, loans held for investment and deposits.  133Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSTable 13.1: Segment Results and Reconciliation  Three Months Ended September 30, 2017(Dollars in millions) CreditCard ConsumerBanking CommercialBanking(1) Other(1) ConsolidatedTotalNet interest income $3,440 $1,649 $560 $51 $5,700Non-interest income 865 192 179 49 1,285Total net revenue 4,305 1,841 739 100 6,985Provision (benefit) for credit losses 1,466 293 63 11 1,833Non-interest expense 1,961 1,051 394 161 3,567Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 878 497 282 (72) 1,585Income tax provision (benefit) 306 181 103 (142) 448Income from continuing operations, net of tax $572 $316 $179 $70 $1,137Loans held for investment $109,130 $75,564 $67,670 $58 $252,422Deposits 0 184,719 32,783 21,560 239,062             Three Months Ended September 30, 2016(Dollars in millions) CreditCard ConsumerBanking CommercialBanking(1) Other(1) ConsolidatedTotalNet interest income  $3,204 $1,472 $555 $46 $5,277Non-interest income 825 201 156 2 1,184Total net revenue  4,029 1,673 711 48 6,461Provision (benefit) for credit losses 1,272 256 61 (1) 1,588Non-interest expense 1,884 1,034 349 94 3,361Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 873 383 301 (45) 1,512Income tax provision (benefit) 318 139 110 (71) 496Income from continuing operations, net of tax $555 $244 $191 $26 $1,016Loans held for investment $99,201 $72,285 $66,457 $76 $238,019Deposits 0 178,793 33,611 13,577 225,981 134Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017(Dollars in millions) CreditCard ConsumerBanking CommercialBanking(1) Other(1) ConsolidatedTotalNet interest income $10,080 $4,744 $1,695 $128 $16,647Non-interest income 2,478 570 520 9 3,577Total net revenue 12,558 5,314 2,215 137 20,224Provision (benefit) for credit losses 4,580 840 201 4 5,625Non-interest expense 5,808 3,152 1,166 289 10,415Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 2,170 1,322 848 (156) 4,184Income tax provision (benefit) 774 482 310 (361) 1,205Income from continuing operations, net of tax $1,396 $840 $538 $205 $2,979Loans held for investment $109,130 $75,564 $67,670 $58 $252,422Deposits 0 184,719 32,783 21,560 239,062             Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016(Dollars in millions) CreditCard ConsumerBanking CommercialBanking(1) Other(1) ConsolidatedTotalNet interest income  $9,282 $4,331 $1,651 $162 $15,426Non-interest income 2,531 567 403 8 3,509Total net revenue  11,813 4,898 2,054 170 18,935Provision (benefit) for credit losses 3,604 690 417 (4) 4,707Non-interest expense 5,630 3,030 1,014 205 9,879Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 2,579 1,178 623 (31) 4,349Income tax provision (benefit) 931 428 227 (214) 1,372Income from continuing operations, net of tax $1,648 $750 $396 $183 $2,977Loans held for investment $99,201 $72,285 $66,457 $76 $238,019Deposits 0 178,793 33,611 13,577 225,981__________ (1) Some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits. Accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory tax rate of 35% with offsetting reclassifications to the Other category. 135Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE 14—COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES, GUARANTEES AND OTHERSCommitments to LendOur unfunded lending commitments primarily consist of credit card lines, loan commitments to customers of both our Commercial Banking and Consumer Banking businesses, as well as standby and commercial letters of credit. These commitments, other than credit card lines, are legally binding conditional agreements that have fixed expirations or termination dates and specified interest rates and purposes. The contractual amount of these commitments represents the maximum possible credit risk to us should the counterparty draw upon the commitment. We generally manage the potential risk of unfunded lending commitments by limiting the total amount of arrangements, monitoring the size and maturity structure of these portfolios and applying the same credit standards for all of our credit activities. For unused credit card lines, we have not experienced and do not anticipate that all of our customers will access their entire available line at any given point in time. Commitments to extend credit other than credit card lines generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards. Collateral requirements and loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios are the same as those for funded transactions and are established based on management’s credit assessment of the customer. These commitments may expire without being drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future funding requirements.We also issue letters of credit, such as financial standby, performance standby and commercial letters of credit, to meet the financing needs of our customers. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party in a borrowing arrangement. Commercial letters of credit are short-term commitments issued primarily to facilitate trade finance activities for customers and are generally collateralized by the goods being shipped to the client. These collateral requirements are similar to those for funded transactions and are established based on management’s credit assessment of the customer. Management conducts regular reviews of all outstanding letters of credit and the results of these reviews are considered in assessing the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses.The following table presents contractual amount and carrying value of our unfunded lending commitments as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The carrying value represents our reserve and deferred revenue on legally binding commitments.Table 14.1: Unfunded Lending Commitments: Contractual Amount and Carrying Value  Contractual Amount Carrying Value(Dollars in millions) September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016Standby letter of credit and commercial letter of credit(1) $2,074 $1,936 $39 $42Credit card lines 354,155 312,864 N/A N/AOther loan commitments(2) 30,498 28,402 92 98Total unfunded lending commitments $386,727 $343,202 $131 $140__________(1) These financial guarantees have expiration dates ranging from 2017 to 2025 as of September 30, 2017.(2) Includes $898 million and $699 million of advised lines of credit as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.Loss Sharing Agreements and Other ObligationsWithin our Commercial Banking business, we originate multifamily commercial real estate loans with the intent to sell them to the GSEs. We enter into loss sharing agreements with the GSEs upon the sale of the loans. At inception, we record a liability representing the fair value of our obligation which is subsequently amortized as we are released from risk of payment under the loss sharing agreement. If payment under the loss sharing agreement becomes probable and estimable, an additional liability may be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and a non-interest expense may be recognized in the consolidated statements of income. The amount of liability recognized on our consolidated balance sheets for our loss sharing agreements was $52 million and $48 million as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.  136Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSAs of September 30, 2017, in certain securitizations associated with the discontinued manufactured housing operations of GreenPoint Credit, LLC, the third-party servicer had an obligation to exercise mandatory clean-up calls. In the event the third-party servicer could not fulfill its obligation to exercise these clean-up calls, the obligation would revert to us. The amount of loan receivables and other assets subject to these clean-up calls was approximately $391 million as of September 30, 2017. Based on our current projections, we expect these securitizations to reach their individual clean-up call thresholds beginning in 2017 and continuing through 2019. According to current information and estimates, we also expect the fair value of the loan receivables and other assets to be less than the contractual amount required to exercise the clean-up calls. We have monitored the underlying assets for trends in delinquencies and related losses and reviewed the third-party servicer’s financial strength. As of September 30, 2017, we had a liability of $61 million associated with these clean-up call obligations. On October 10, 2017, we entered into an agreement with the third-party servicer under which we assumed the mandatory obligation to exercise the remaining clean-up calls as they become due on certain securitization transactions. See “Note 6—Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations” for information related to these obligations.U.K. Payment Protection InsuranceIn the U.K., we previously sold payment protection insurance (“PPI”) and other ancillary cross sell products. In response to an elevated level of customer complaints across the industry, heightened media coverage and pressure from consumer advocacy groups, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), formerly the Financial Services Authority, investigated and raised concerns about the way the industry has handled complaints related to the sale of these insurance policies. For the past several years, the U.K.’s Financial Ombudsman Service (“FOS”) has been adjudicating customer complaints relating to PPI, escalated to it by consumers who disagree with the rejection of their complaint by firms, leading to customer remediation payments by us and others within the industry. On October 2, 2015, the FCA issued a Statement on PPI (“FCA Proposal”) announcing it has decided to consult on the introduction of a time bar for PPI complaints and on new rules and guidance about how banks should handle unfair relationship PPI complaints covered by s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act of 1974 (“Consumer Credit Act”). On March 2, 2017, the FCA further issued a statement that sets out final rules and guidance on the PPI complaints deadline, which has been set as August 29, 2019. The statement also provides clarity on how to handle PPI complaints under s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act, including guidance on how redress for such complaints should be calculated. The final rules and guidance came into force on August 29, 2017. In determining our best estimate of incurred losses for future remediation payments, management considers numerous factors, including (i) the number of customer complaints we expect in the future; (ii) our expectation of upholding those complaints; (iii) the expected number of complaints customers escalate to the FOS; (iv) our expectation of the FOS upholding such escalated complaints; (v) the number of complaints that fall under the s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act; and (vi) the estimated remediation payout to customers. We monitor these factors each quarter and adjust our reserves to reflect the latest data.Management’s best estimate of incurred losses related to U.K. PPI totaled $298 million and $238 million as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The increase in the reserve was primarily driven by an addition of $99 million recorded in the first quarter of 2017. Other movements were due to a combination of utilization of the reserve through customer refund payments and foreign exchange movements. For the three months ended September 30, 2017, no additions were made to our reserve. Our best estimate of reasonably possible future losses beyond our reserve as of September 30, 2017 is approximately $200 million.Mortgage Representation and Warranty LiabilitiesWe acquired three subsidiaries that originated residential mortgage loans and sold these loans to various purchasers, including purchasers who created securitization trusts. These subsidiaries are Capital One Home Loans, LLC, which was acquired in February 2005; GreenPoint, which was acquired in December 2006 as part of the North Fork acquisition; and Chevy Chase Bank, F.S.B. (“CCB”), which was acquired in February 2009 and subsequently merged into CONA (collectively, the “subsidiaries”).In connection with their sales of mortgage loans, the subsidiaries entered into agreements containing varying representations and warranties about, among other things, the ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing the loan, the loan’s compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the purchaser, including underwriting guidelines and the existence of mortgage insurance, and the loan’s compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws. The representations and warranties do not address the credit performance of the mortgage loans, but mortgage loan performance often influences whether a claim for breach of representation and warranty will be asserted and has an effect on the amount of any loss in the event of a breach of a representation or warranty. 137Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSEach of these subsidiaries may be required to repurchase mortgage loans in the event of certain breaches of these representations and warranties. In the event of a repurchase, the subsidiary is typically required to pay the unpaid principal balance of the loan together with interest and certain expenses (including, in certain cases, legal costs incurred by the purchaser and/or others). The subsidiary then recovers the loan or, if the loan has been foreclosed, the underlying collateral. The subsidiary is exposed to any losses on the repurchased loans, taking into account any recoveries on the collateral. In some instances, rather than repurchase the loans, a subsidiary may agree to make cash payments to make a purchaser whole on losses or to settle repurchase claims, possibly including claims for attorneys’ fees and interest. In addition, our subsidiaries may be required to indemnify certain purchasers and others against losses they incur as a result of certain breaches of representations and warranties.These subsidiaries, in total, originated and sold to non-affiliates approximately $111 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans between 2005 and 2008, which are the years (or “vintages”) with respect to which our subsidiaries have received the vast majority of the repurchase-related requests and other related claims.The following table presents the original principal balance of mortgage loan originations for the three general categories of purchasers of mortgage loans and the estimated unpaid principal balance as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.Table 14.2: Unpaid Principal Balance of Mortgage Loans Originated and Sold to Third Parties Based on Category of Purchaser   Estimated Unpaid Principal Balance Original Principal Balance(Dollars in billions) September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 2005-2008GSEs $1 $2 $11Insured Securitizations 3 3 20Uninsured Securitizations and Other 11 12 80Total $15 $17 $111Of the $20 billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans sold directly by our subsidiaries to private-label purchasers who placed the loans into securitizations supported by bond insurance (“Insured Securitizations”), approximately 48% of the original principal balance was covered by bond insurance. Further, approximately $16 billion original principal balance was placed in securitizations as to which the monoline bond insurers have made repurchase-related requests or loan file requests to one of our subsidiaries (“Active Insured Securitizations”) and the remaining approximately $4 billion original principal balance was placed in securitizations as to which the monoline bond insurers have not made repurchase-related requests or loan file requests to one of our subsidiaries (“Inactive Insured Securitizations”). Insured Securitizations often allow the monoline bond insurer to act independently of the investors. Bond insurers typically have indemnity agreements directly with both the mortgage originators and the securitizers, and they often have super-majority rights within the trust documentation that allow them to direct trustees to pursue mortgage repurchase-related requests without coordination with other investors.Because we do not service most of the loans our subsidiaries sold to others, we do not have complete information about the current ownership of a portion of the $80 billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans not sold directly to GSEs or placed in Insured Securitizations. We have determined based on information obtained from third-party databases that about $48 billion original principal balance of these mortgage loans was placed in private-label publicly issued securitizations not supported by bond insurance (“Uninsured Securitizations”). An additional approximately $22 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans were initially sold to private investors as whole loans. Various known and unknown investors purchased the remaining $10 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans.With respect to the $111 billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans originated and sold to others between 2005 and 2008, we estimate that approximately $15 billion in unpaid principal balance remains outstanding as of September 30, 2017, of which approximately $2 billion in unpaid principal balance is at least 90 days delinquent. Approximately $23 billion in losses have been realized by third parties. Because we do not service most of the loans we sold to others, we do not have complete information about the underlying credit performance levels for some of these mortgage loans. These amounts reflect our best estimates, including extrapolations of underlying credit performance where necessary. These estimates are dependent on the availability of performance data. The subsidiaries had open repurchase-related requests with regard to approximately $566 million original principal balance of mortgage loans as of September 30, 2017, a decrease of $803 million from $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2016. 138Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe remaining repurchase requests are almost entirely related to outstanding litigation matters. The repurchase-related requests reflect the original principal balance amounts of the mortgage loans at issue and do not correspond to the losses our subsidiary would incur upon the repurchase of these loans. Total repurchase-related requests include all timely requests ever received by our subsidiaries where the requesting party has not formally rescinded the repurchase-related requests or our subsidiary has not agreed to either repurchase the loan at issue or make the requesting party whole with respect to its losses. We have received relatively few repurchase-related requests subsequent to the New York’s highest court ruling in 2015 that the statute of limitations for repurchase claims begins when the relevant representations and warranties were made, as opposed to some later date during the life of the loan. Additionally, we have received relatively few repurchase-related demands for vintages after 2007, mostly because GreenPoint ceased originating mortgages in August 2007.For the $16 billion original principal balance in Active Insured Securitizations, our reserving approach is based upon the expected resolution of litigation directed by the monoline bond insurers. Accordingly, our representation and warranty reserves related to Active Insured Securitizations are litigation reserves. In establishing these litigation reserves, we consider the current and future monoline insurer losses inherent within the securitization and apply legal judgment to the developing factual and legal record to estimate the liability for each securitization. We also consider both our own past monoline settlements and publicly available industry monoline settlements in establishing these litigation reserves. Our reserves with respect to the U.S. Bank Litigation, referenced below, are related to Active Insured Securitizations. Further, to the extent we have litigation reserves with respect to indemnification risks from certain representation and warranty lawsuits brought by monoline bond insurers against third-party securitizations sponsors, where one of our subsidiaries provided some or all of the mortgage collateral within the securitization but is not a defendant in the litigation, such reserves are also contained within this category.For the $11 billion original principal balance of GSE loans, the $4 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans in Inactive Insured Securitizations and the $80 billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans not sold directly to GSEs or placed in Insured Securitizations, our remaining reserves are also litigation reserves. In establishing these litigation reserves, we consider the current and future losses associated with the loans at issue and apply legal judgment to the developing factual and legal record to estimate the probable liability for each claim, if any, utilizing both our own experience and publicly available industry settlement information. Accordingly, we only reserve for such exposures when a trustee or investor with standing brings claims and it is probable we have incurred a loss. Some Uninsured Securitization investors are currently suing investment banks and securitization sponsors under federal and/or state securities laws. Although we face some indirect indemnity risks from these litigations, we generally have not established reserves with respect to these indemnity risks because we do not consider them to be both probable and reasonably estimable liabilities. In addition, to the extent we have litigation reserves with respect to indemnification risks from certain representation and warranty lawsuits brought by parties who purchased loans from our subsidiaries and subsequently re-sold the loans into securitizations, such reserves are also contained within this category.Our reserves could be impacted by any claims which may be brought by governmental agencies under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (“FIRREA”), the False Claims Act or other federal or state statutes. For example, GreenPoint and Capital One have received requests for information and/or subpoenas from various governmental regulators and law enforcement authorities, including members of the RMBS Working Group, relating to the origination of loans for sale to the GSEs and to RMBS participants. We are cooperating with these regulators and other authorities in responding to such requests.The aggregate reserve for all three subsidiaries totaled $401 million as of September 30, 2017 compared to $630 million as of December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the resolution of several legal matters. The remaining representation and warranty reserve relates almost entirely to outstanding litigation matters. The table below summarizes changes in our representation and warranty reserve for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016. 139Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSTable 14.3: Changes in Representation and Warranty Reserve(1)  Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,(Dollars in millions) 2017 2016 2017 2016Representation and warranty reserve, beginning of period $521 $614 $630 $610Provision (benefit) for mortgage representation and warranty losses:        Recorded in continuing operations (1) 0 (26) (2)Recorded in discontinued operations 13 18 (48) 23Total provision (benefit) for mortgage representation and warranty losses 12 18 (74) 21Net realized recoveries (losses) (132) 0 (155) 1Representation and warranty reserve, end of period $401 $632 $401 $632__________(1) Reported on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities.As part of our business planning processes, we have considered various outcomes relating to the future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are possible but do not rise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying an incremental accrual under applicable accounting standards. Our current best estimate of reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond our reserves as of September 30, 2017 is approximately $550 million, a decrease from our $1.5 billion estimate at December 31, 2016. The primary driver of the decrease in this estimate has been the resolution of several legal matters. The estimate as of September 30, 2017 covers all reasonably possible losses relating to representation and warranty claim activity, including those relating to the cases more specifically described below in Mortgage Repurchase Litigation.In estimating reasonably possible future losses in excess of our current reserves, for Active Insured Securitizations, we assume loss rates on the high end of those observed in monoline settlements or court rulings. For our remaining GSE exposures, Uninsured Securitizations and whole loan exposures, our reasonably possible risk estimates assume lifetime loss rates and claims rates at the highest levels of our past experience and also consider the limited instances of observed settlements. We do not however, based on industry precedent, assume claim rates or loss rates for these risk categories will be as high as those assumed for the Active Insured Securitizations. Should the number of claims or the loss rates on these claims increase significantly, our estimate of reasonably possible risk would increase materially. We also assume that repurchase-related requests will be resolved at discounts reflecting the nature of the claims, the vintage of the underlying loans and evolving legal precedents. Notwithstanding our ongoing attempts to estimate a reasonably possible amount of future losses beyond our current accrual levels based on current information, it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and our current estimate of the amount of reasonably possible losses. Our reserve and reasonably possible loss estimates involve considerable judgment and reflect that there is still significant uncertainty regarding numerous factors that may impact the ultimate loss levels, including, but not limited to: litigation outcomes; court rulings; governmental enforcement decisions; future repurchase and indemnification claim levels; securitization trustees pursuing mortgage repurchase litigation unilaterally or in coordination with investors; investors successfully pursuing repurchase litigation independently and without the involvement of the trustee as a party; ultimate repurchase and indemnification rates; future mortgage loan performance levels; actual recoveries on the collateral; and macroeconomic conditions (including unemployment levels and housing prices). In light of the significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability our subsidiaries may incur from these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period.LitigationIn accordance with the current accounting standards for loss contingencies, we establish reserves for litigation related matters that arise from the ordinary course of our business activities when it is probable that a loss associated with a claim or proceeding has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. None of the amounts we currently have recorded individually or in the aggregate are considered to be material to our financial condition. Litigation claims and proceedings of all types are subject to many uncertain factors that generally cannot be predicted with assurance. Below we provide a description of potentially material legal proceedings and claims. 140Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFor some of the matters disclosed below, we are able to determine estimates of potential future outcomes that are not probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying either the establishment of a reserve or an incremental reserve build, but which are reasonably possible outcomes. For other disclosed matters, such an estimate is not possible at this time. For those matters below where an estimate is possible (excluding the reasonably possible future losses relating to the Mortgage Repurchase Litigation described below, which are included within the estimate of reasonably possible representation and warranty losses discussed above), management currently estimates the reasonably possible future losses beyond our reserves as of September 30, 2017 is approximately $250 million. Notwithstanding our attempt to estimate a reasonably possible range of loss beyond our current accrual levels for some litigation matters based on current information, it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and the range of reasonably possible losses disclosed here. Given the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters, especially those involving governmental agencies, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from these litigation matters and an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period.Interchange LitigationIn 2005, a number of entities, each purporting to represent a class of retail merchants, filed antitrust lawsuits against MasterCard and Visa and several member banks, including our subsidiaries and us, alleging among other things, that the defendants conspired to fix the level of interchange fees. The complaints seek injunctive relief and civil monetary damages, which could be trebled. Separately, a number of large merchants have asserted similar claims against Visa and MasterCard only (together with the lawsuits described above, “Interchange Lawsuits”). In October 2005, the class and merchant Interchange Lawsuits were consolidated before the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for certain purposes, including discovery. In July 2012, the parties executed and filed with the court a Memorandum of Understanding agreeing to resolve the litigation on certain terms set forth in a settlement agreement attached to the Memorandum. The class settlement provides for, among other things, (i) payments by defendants to the class and individual plaintiffs totaling approximately $6.6 billion; (ii) a distribution to the class merchants of an amount equal to 10 basis points of certain interchange transactions for a period of eight months; and (iii) modifications to certain Visa and MasterCard rules regarding point of sale practices. In December 2013, the district court granted final approval of the proposed class settlement, which was appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in January 2014. On June 30, 2016, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the district court’s certification of the class, reversed approval of the proposed class settlement, and remanded the litigation to the district court for further proceedings, ruling that some of the merchants that were part of the proposed class settlement were not adequately represented. Because the Second Circuit ruling remands the litigation to the district court for further proceedings, the ultimate outcome in this matter is uncertain. Several merchant plaintiffs also opted out of the class settlement before it was overturned, and some of those plaintiffs have sued MasterCard, Visa and various member banks, including Capital One. The opt-out cases are consolidated before the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for certain purposes, including discovery. Visa and MasterCard have settled a number of individual opt-out cases, requiring non-material payments from all banks, including Capital One. Separate settlement and judgment sharing agreements between Capital One, MasterCard and Visa allocate the liabilities of any judgment or settlement arising from the Interchange Lawsuits and associated opt-out cases. Visa created a litigation escrow account following its IPO of stock in 2008, which funds any settlements for its member banks, and any settlements related to MasterCard allocated losses are reflected in Capital One’s reserves.Mortgage Repurchase LitigationIn February 2009, GreenPoint was named as a defendant in a lawsuit commenced in the New York County Supreme Court, by U.S. Bank, N. A., Syncora Guarantee Inc. and CIFG Assurance North America, Inc. (“U.S. Bank Litigation”). Plaintiffs allege, among other things, that GreenPoint breached certain representations and warranties in two contracts pursuant to which GreenPoint sold approximately 30,000 mortgage loans having an aggregate original principal balance of approximately $1.8 billion to a purchaser that ultimately transferred most of these mortgage loans to a securitization trust. Some of the securities issued by the trust were insured by Syncora and CIFG. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and an order compelling GreenPoint to repurchase the entire portfolio of 30,000 mortgage loans based on alleged breaches of representations and warranties relating to a limited sampling of loans in the portfolio, or, alternatively, the repurchase of specific mortgage loans to which the alleged breaches of representations and warranties relate. In March 2010, the court granted GreenPoint’s motion to dismiss with respect to plaintiffs Syncora and CIFG but denied the motion with respect to U.S. Bank. GreenPoint subsequently answered the complaint with respect to U.S. Bank, denying the allegations, and filed a counterclaim against U.S. Bank alleging breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In February 2012, the court denied plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file an amended complaint and dismissed Syncora and CIFG from the case.
