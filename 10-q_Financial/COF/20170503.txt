Unless otherwise specified, references to notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2017 included in this Report. Management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial condition. The following MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes in this Report and the more detailed information contained in our 2016 Form 10-K.INTRODUCTIONWe are a diversified financial services holding company with banking and non-banking subsidiaries. Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through branches, the internet and other distribution channels. As of March 31, 2017, our principal subsidiaries included:•Capital One Bank (USA), National Association (“COBNA”), which offers credit and debit card products, other lending products and deposit products; and•Capital One, National Association (“CONA”), which offers a broad spectrum of banking products and financial services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients.The Company is hereafter collectively referred to as “we,” “us” or “our.” COBNA and CONA are collectively referred to as the “Banks.” Certain business terms used in this document are defined in the “MD&A—Glossary and Acronyms” and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.Our consolidated total net revenues are derived primarily from lending to consumer and commercial customers net of funding costs associated with interest on deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. We also earn non-interest income which primarily consists of interchange income net of rewards expenses and service charges and other customer-related fees. Our expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating expenses, marketing expenses and income taxes.Our principal operations are currently organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group, are included in the Other category.•Credit Card: Consists of our domestic consumer and small business card lending, and international card businesses in Canada and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”).•Consumer Banking: Consists of our branch-based lending and deposit gathering activities for consumers and small businesses, national deposit gathering, auto lending and consumer home loan lending and servicing activities.•Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending, deposit gathering and servicing activities provided to commercial real estate and commercial and industrial customers. Our commercial and industrial customers typically include companies with annual revenues between $10 million and $1 billion. 1Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsRecent Acquisitions and DispositionsWe regularly explore and evaluate opportunities to acquire financial services and financial assets, including credit card and other loan portfolios, and enter into strategic partnerships as part of our growth strategy. We also explore opportunities to acquire digital companies and related assets to improve our information technology infrastructure and to deliver on our digital strategy. We also regularly consider the potential disposition of certain of our assets, branches, partnership agreements or lines of business. We may issue equity or debt in connection with acquisitions, including public offerings, to fund such acquisitions.On October 3, 2016, we announced that we entered into a 10-year program agreement (the “Program Agreement”) to become the exclusive issuing partner of co-branded credit cards to Cabela’s customers. In connection with this credit card program, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we would acquire the credit card operations from Cabela’s, including approximately $5.2 billion in credit card receivables and other assets and approximately $5.0 billion in associated funding liabilities. This transaction was subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of various regulatory approvals and the approval of the stockholders of Cabela’s. On January 28, 2017, Capital One withdrew its Bank Merger Act (“BMA”) application from the OCC, as we did not expect to receive regulatory approval of any BMA application for this transaction prior to October 3, 2017. This is the date when any of the parties involved in the agreement could terminate the agreement.On April 17, 2017, we entered into agreements with subsidiaries of Synovus Financial Corp. (“Synovus”) and Cabela’s under which Synovus will acquire certain assets and assume certain liabilities of Cabela’s wholly-owned subsidiary, World’s Foremost Bank (“WFB”), including WFB’s deposits. Immediately following the completion of this acquisition, Synovus will sell WFB’s credit card assets and related liabilities to Capital One. Synovus will retain WFB’s deposits. Capital One is not required to file any regulatory applications to complete this acquisition from Synovus. These transactions are subject to customary closing conditions, including approvals by Synovus’s primary banking regulators and by Cabela’s stockholders. The closing of these transactions are also subject to the closing of the Agreement and Plan of Merger between Cabela’s and Bass Pro Group, LLC, entered into on October 3, 2016. We expect these transactions will close after all closing conditions have been satisfied. These agreements may be terminated by any of the parties if all closing conditions have not been satisfied by October 3, 2017. Upon closing of the acquisition of the credit card assets and related liabilities from Synovus, Capital One will become the exclusive issuing partner of co-branded credit cards to Cabela’s customers under the Program Agreement.We had no significant acquisitions or dispositions in the first quarter of 2017. 2Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsSUMMARY OF SELECTED FINANCIAL DATAThe following table presents selected consolidated financial data and performance from our results of operations for the first quarters of 2017 and 2016 and selected comparative balance sheet data as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

In comparison, we reported net income of $1.0 billion ($1.84 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $6.2 billion for the first quarter of 2016.Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio as calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach, including transition provisions, was 10.4% and 10.1% as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. See “MD&A—Capital Management” below for additional information.On June 29, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion in shares of our common stock (“2016 Stock Repurchase Program”) from the third quarter of 2016 through the end of the second quarter of 2017. Through the end of the first quarter of 2017, we repurchased approximately $2.2 billion of common stock as part of the 2016 Stock Repurchase Program. See “MD&A—Capital Management” below for additional information.Below are additional highlights of our performance in the first quarter of 2017. These highlights are generally based on a comparison between the results of the first quarters of 2017 and 2016, except as otherwise noted. The changes in our financial condition and credit performance are generally based on our financial condition and credit performance as of March 31, 2017 compared to our financial condition and credit performance as of December 31, 2016. We provide a more detailed discussion of our financial performance in the sections following this “Executive Summary and Business Outlook.”Total Company Performance•Earnings: Our net income decreased by $203 million to $810 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. The decrease was primarily due to:◦higher provision for credit losses primarily driven by higher charge-offs and a larger allowance build in our domestic credit card loan portfolio; and ◦higher operating expenses associated with loan growth, as well as continued investments in technology and infrastructure. These higher expenses were partially offset by:◦higher interest income due to growth in our credit card and auto loan portfolios; and◦lower income tax expense as a result of lower income before taxes and increased discrete tax benefits related to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  5Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents•Loans Held for Investment: ◦Period-end loans held for investment decreased by $5.0 billion to $240.6 billion as of March 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016 primarily due to expected seasonal paydowns in our domestic credit card loan portfolio and run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio, partially offset by growth in our auto and commercial loan portfolios.◦Average loans held for investment increased by $14.8 billion to $241.5 billion in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 primarily driven by growth in our credit card, auto and commercial loan portfolios, partially offset by run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio.•Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: Our net charge-off rate increased by 42 basis points to 2.50% in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to growth and seasoning of recent domestic credit card loan originations.Our 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 35 basis points to 2.92% as of March 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016 primarily due to seasonally lower delinquency inventories.We provide additional information on our credit quality metrics below under “MD&A—Business Segment Financial Performance” and “MD&A —Credit Risk Profile.”•Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses: Our allowance for loan and lease losses increased by $481 million to $7.0 billion as of March 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016, and the allowance coverage ratio increased by 25 basis points to 2.90% as of March 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016. The increases were primarily driven by:◦an allowance build in our domestic credit card loan portfolio due to increasing loss expectations on recent originations; and◦an allowance build in our auto loan portfolio due to higher loss rates associated with growth, as well as further expected declines in used car auction prices.These increases were partially offset by:◦an allowance release in our Commercial Banking business, reflecting improved portfolio performance in our oil and gas portfolio.Business Outlook We discuss below our current expectations regarding our total company performance and the performance of each of our business segments over the near-term based on market conditions, the regulatory environment and our business strategies as of the time we filed this Report.

Over the longer-term, we believe that we will be able to achieve additional efficiency improvement, driven by growth and digital productivity gains.We expect our strong growth over the last two years puts us in a position to deliver earnings per share growth, excluding adjusting items, between 7% and 11% in 2017, assuming no substantial change in the broader credit and economic cycles.We believe our actions have created a well-positioned balance sheet with strong capital and liquidity. We believe that we are currently at the destination capital ratios appropriate for our current balance sheet mix. Pursuant to our approved 2016 capital plan, our Board of Directors has authorized repurchases of up to $2.5 billion of common stock through the end of the second quarter of 2017. Through the end of the first quarter of 2017, we repurchased approximately $2.2 billion of common stock as part of the 2016 Stock Repurchase Program. The timing and exact amount of any common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including market conditions, opportunities for growth, utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time. See “MD&A—Capital Management—Dividend Policy and Stock Purchases” for more information.Business Segment ExpectationsCredit Card: In our Domestic Card business, we expect the full-year 2017 charge-off rate will be in the high 4%s to around 5%, with quarterly variability.Consumer Banking: In our Consumer Banking business, we expect that the charge-off rate in our auto finance business will increase gradually and the growth we have experienced in that business will moderate.Commercial Banking: In our Commercial Banking business, we expect credit pressures will continue to be focused in our oil field service and taxi medallion lending portfolios.CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe section below provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated financial performance for the first quarters of 2017 and 2016. We provide a discussion of our business segment results in the following section, “MD&A—Business Segment Financial Performance.” You should read this section together with our “MD&A—Executive Summary and Business Outlook,” where we discuss trends and other factors that we expect will affect our future results of operations.Net Interest IncomeNet interest income represents the difference between the interest income, including certain fees, earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense on our interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets, while our interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, and other borrowings. Generally, we include in interest income any past due fees on loans that we deem collectible. Our net interest margin, based on our consolidated results, represents the difference between the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, including the notional impact of non-interest-bearing funding. We expect net interest income and our net interest margin to fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. 7Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 2 below presents, for each major category of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the average outstanding balance, interest income earned or interest expense incurred, and average yield for the first quarters of 2017 and 2016.Table 2: Average Balances, Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin  Three Months Ended March 31,  2017 2016(Dollars in millions) AverageBalance InterestIncome/Expense Average Yield/Rate AverageBalance InterestIncome/Expense Average Yield/RateAssets:            Interest-earning assets:            Loans:(1)            Credit card $101,169 $3,790 14.98% $93,158 $3,394 14.57%Consumer banking 73,510 1,190 6.48 70,441 1,088 6.18Commercial banking(2) 67,503 615 3.64 63,884 539 3.37Other(3) 67 31 185.07 90 64 284.44Total loans, including loans held for sale 242,249 5,626 9.29 227,573 5,085 8.94Investment securities 68,418 416 2.43 65,156 415 2.55Cash equivalents and other interest-earning assets 7,691 28 1.46 6,727 17 1.01Total interest-earning assets 318,358 6,070 7.63 299,456 5,517 7.37Cash and due from banks 3,487     3,355    Allowance for loan and lease losses (6,513)     (5,131)    Premises and equipment, net 3,797     3,642    Other assets 32,512     30,597    Total assets $351,641     $331,919    Liabilities and stockholders’ equity:            Interest-bearing liabilities:(3)            Deposits $212,973 $353 0.66% $194,125 $283 0.58%Securitized debt obligations 17,176 69 1.61 15,361 48 1.25Senior and subordinated notes 24,804 149 2.40 21,993 106 1.93Other borrowings and liabilities 12,356 25 0.81 17,176 24 0.56Total interest-bearing liabilities 267,309 596 0.89 248,655 461 0.74Non-interest-bearing deposits 25,577     25,055    Other liabilities 10,562     9,131    Total liabilities 303,448     282,841    Stockholders’ equity 48,193     49,078    Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $351,641     $331,919    Net interest income/spread $5,474 6.74   $5,056 6.63Impact of non-interest-bearing funding 0.14     0.12Net interest margin 6.88%     6.75%__________(1)  Past due fees included in interest income totaled approximately $384 million and $351 million in the first quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively.(2) Some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits.

The portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate is allocated proportionately when the calculation results in a positive value. When the portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate results in a negative value, the total amount is allocated to volume or rate, depending on which amount is positive.(2) Some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits. Accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory rate of 35% with offsetting reclassifications to the Other category.Non-Interest IncomeNon-interest income primarily consists of interchange fees net of rewards expense, service charges and other customer-related fees and other non-interest income. Other non-interest income includes the pre-tax net benefit (provision) for mortgage representation and warranty losses related to continuing operations, gains and losses on free-standing derivatives not accounted for in hedge accounting relationships and hedge ineffectiveness. 10Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 4 displays the components of non-interest income for the first quarters of 2017 and 2016.

The primary net effects of the reclassifications for the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared to previously reported results were (i) an increase to Service charges and other customer-related fees of $19 million; and (ii) a decrease to Other non-interest income of $27 million. We have also consolidated the Non-interest income presentation of Other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) with net realized gains or losses from investment securities into a new Net securities gains(losses) line. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2016 Form 10-K for additional information.(2) Represents the benefit for mortgage representation and warranty losses recorded in continuing operations.Non-interest income decreased by $103 million to $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 primarily driven by:•lower service charges and other customer-related fees primarily due to a build in our U.K. payment protection insurance customer refund reserve (“U.K. PPI Reserve”) in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the absence of a build in the first quarter of 2016, as well as the exit of our legacy payment protection products in our Domestic Card business during the first quarter of 2016; and•lower net interchange fees, as an increase in gross interchange fees driven by higher purchase volume was more than offset by higher rewards expense from the continued expansion of our rewards franchise, as well as a customer rewards reserve release within our retail banking business in the first quarter of 2016 related to the discontinuation of certain debit card and deposit products.These decreases were partially offset by:•higher revenue in our capital markets and agency businesses in our Commercial Banking business; and•a mortgage representation and warranty reserve release in our Consumer Banking business.We provide additional information on our U.K. PPI Reserve in “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others.”Provision for Credit LossesOur provision for credit losses in each period is driven by net charge-offs, changes to the allowance for loan and lease losses and changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $2.0 billion and $1.5 billion  in the first quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively. The provision for credit losses as a percentage of net interest income was 36.4% and 30.2% in the first quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively. 11Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsOur provision for credit losses increased by $465 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 primarily driven by:•a larger allowance build in our domestic credit card loan portfolio due to increasing loss expectations on recent originations; and•higher charge-offs in our domestic credit card loan portfolio due to seasoning of recent growth.These increases were partially offset by:•an allowance release in our Commercial Banking business in the first quarter of 2017 compared to a build in the first quarter of 2016, reflecting lower exposure in our oil and gas and taxi medallion lending portfolios.We provide additional information on the provision for credit losses and changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses within “MD&A—Credit Risk Profile,” “Note 4—Loans” and “Note 5—Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments.” For information on the allowance methodology for each of our loan categories, see “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2016 Form 10-K.Non-Interest ExpenseNon-interest expense consists of operating expenses related to continuing operations, such as salaries and associate benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, professional services, communications and data processing expenses and other non-interest expenses, as well as marketing costs and amortization of intangibles.Table 5 displays the components of non-interest expense for the first quarters of 2017 and 2016.Table 5: Non-Interest Expense  Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2017 2016(1)Salaries and associate benefits $1,471 $1,270Occupancy and equipment 471 458Marketing 396 428Professional services 247 241Communications and data processing 288 280Amortization of intangibles 62 101Other non-interest expense:    Collections 85 81Fraud losses 78 90Bankcard, regulatory and other fee assessments 136 107Other 200 167Total other non-interest expense 499 445Total non-interest expense $3,434 $3,223__________(1) We made certain non-interest expense reclassifications in the fourth quarter of 2016. The net effect of the reclassifications for the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared to previously reported results was an increase to Communications and data processing expense of $37 million, with a corresponding decrease to Professional services. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2016 Form 10-K for additional information.Non-interest expense increased by $211 million to $3.4 billion in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 primarily due to:•higher operating expenses associated with loan growth, as well as continued investments in technology and infrastructure;•higher other non-interest expense primarily driven by a build in our U.K. PPI Reserve in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the absence of a build in the first quarter of 2016; and 12Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents•higher Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) surcharges and premiums.These increases are partially offset by:•lower amortization of intangibles; and•lower marketing expenses.Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of TaxIncome (loss) from discontinued operations consists of results from the discontinued mortgage origination operations of our wholesale mortgage banking unit, GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, Inc. (“GreenPoint”) and the discontinued manufactured housing operations of GreenPoint Credit, LLC, a subsidiary of GreenPoint, both of which were acquired as part of the North Fork Bancorporation, Inc. (“North Fork”) acquisition in December 2006. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $15 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to a loss of $5 million in the first quarter of 2016. We recorded a release related to our mortgage representation and warranty reserve, net of tax, of $42 million ($67 million before tax) in the first quarter of 2017, compared to a provision, net of tax, of $2 million ($3 million before tax) in the first quarter of 2016 as a result of favorable legal developments. This mortgage representation and warranty reserve release was partially offset by a pre-tax charge of $40 million to record a liability related to our contingent obligation to exercise certain mandatory clean-up calls associated with manufactured housing securitizations undertaken by GreenPoint Credit, LLC. We provide additional information on the discontinued operations in “Note 2—Discontinued Operations” and on the net benefit (provision) for mortgage representation and warranty losses and the related reserve for representation and warranty claims in “MD&A—Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis—Mortgage Representation and Warranty Reserve” and “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others.”Income TaxesWe recorded income tax provisions of $314 million (28.3% effective income tax rate) and $452 million (30.7% effective income tax rate) in the first quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations varies between periods due, in part, to fluctuations in our pre-tax earnings, which affects the relative tax benefit of tax-exempt income, tax credits and other permanent tax items.The decrease in our effective income tax rate in the first quarter of 2017 from the first quarter of 2016 was primarily due to:•increases in the relative benefit of tax exempt income and tax credits; and•increased discrete tax benefits related to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This increase was partially offset by:•reduced benefits associated with foreign earnings.We provide additional information on items affecting our income taxes and effective tax rate under “Note 16—Income Taxes” in our 2016 Form 10-K. 13Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ANALYSISTotal assets decreased by $8.5 billion to $348.5 billion as of March 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016 primarily due to:•a decrease in loans held for investment primarily due to expected seasonal paydowns in our domestic credit card loan portfolio and run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio, partially offset by growth in our auto and commercial loan portfolios.Total liabilities decreased by $9.0 billion to $300.5 billion as of March 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016 primarily driven by:•a decrease in other debt primarily attributable to a decrease in our FHLB advances outstanding, partially offset by an increase in our senior and subordinated notes.Stockholders’ equity increased by $526 million to $48.0 billion as of March 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016 primarily due to:•our net income of $810 million in the first quarter of 2017.This increase was partially offset by:•$250 million of dividend payments to our common and preferred stockholders; and•$218 million of share repurchases. The following is a discussion of material changes in the major components of our assets and liabilities during the first quarter of 2017. Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management activities that are intended to ensure the adequacy of capital while managing the liquidity requirements of the Company and our customers and our market risk exposure in accordance with our risk appetite.Investment SecuritiesOur investment portfolio consists primarily of the following: U.S. Treasury securities; U.S. government-sponsored enterprise or agency (“Agency”) and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”); Agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”); other asset-backed securities (“ABS”); and other securities. The carrying value of our investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities represented 91% of our total investment securities as of both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.The fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio was $41.3 billion as of March 31, 2017, an increase of $523 million from December 31, 2016. The fair value of our held to maturity securities portfolio was $26.7 billion as of March 31, 2017, an increase of $461 million from December 31, 2016. The increase in the fair value of both of these portfolios was primarily driven by purchases outpacing sales and paydowns.Gross unrealized gains on our available for sale securities portfolio increased slightly to $550 million as of March 31, 2017 compared to $539 million as of December 31, 2016 and gross unrealized losses on this portfolio decreased to $501 million as of March 31, 2017 compared to $535 million as of December 31, 2016. Of the $501 million gross unrealized losses as of March 31, 2017, $104 million was related to securities that had been in a loss position for 12 months or longer.  14Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 6 presents the amortized cost, carrying value and fair value for the major categories of our investment securities portfolio as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.Table 6: Investment Securities  March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016(Dollars in millions) AmortizedCost  FairValue AmortizedCost  FairValueInvestment securities available for sale:        U.S. Treasury securities $5,195 $5,170 $5,103 $5,065RMBS:        Agency(1) 27,289 26,992 26,830 26,527Non-agency 2,264 2,647 2,349 2,722Total RMBS 29,553 29,639 29,179 29,249CMBS:        Agency(1) 3,159 3,132 3,335 3,304Non-agency 1,712 1,730 1,676 1,684Total CMBS 4,871 4,862 5,011 4,988Other ABS(2) 688 688 714 714Other securities(3) 904 901 726 721Total investment securities available for sale $41,211 $41,260 $40,733 $40,737         (Dollars in millions) Carrying Value FairValue Carrying Value FairValueInvestment securities held to maturity:        U.S. Treasury securities $199 $199 $199 $199Agency RMBS 22,486 22,932 22,125 22,573Agency CMBS 3,485 3,526 3,388 3,424Total investment securities held to maturity $26,170 $26,657 $25,712 $26,196__________(1) Includes securities guaranteed by Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) and securities issued by Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”). (2) ABS collateralized by credit card loans constituted approximately 54% and 57% of the other ABS portfolio as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, and ABS collateralized by auto dealer floor plan inventory loans and leases constituted approximately 24% and 23% of the other ABS portfolio as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.(3) Includes supranational bonds, foreign government bonds, mutual funds and equity investments.Credit RatingsOur portfolio of investment securities continues to be concentrated in securities that generally have high credit ratings and low credit risk, such as securities issued and guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury and Agencies. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, approximately 96% and 95% of our total investment securities portfolio was rated AA+ or its equivalent, or better, respectively, while approximately 4% was below investment grade, as of both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. We categorize the credit ratings of our investment securities based on the lowest credit rating as issued by the following rating agencies: Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”), Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) and Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”).Table 7 provides information on the credit ratings of our non-agency RMBS, non-agency CMBS, other ABS and other securities in our portfolio as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. 15Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 7: Non-Agency Investment Securities Credit Ratings  March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016(Dollars in millions) Fair Value AAA OtherInvestmentGrade BelowInvestmentGrade(1) Fair Value AAA OtherInvestmentGrade BelowInvestmentGrade(1)Non-agency RMBS $2,647 — 2% 98% $2,722 — 3% 97%Non-agency CMBS 1,730 100% — — 1,684 100% — —Other ABS 688 99 1 — 714 99 1 —Other securities 901 72 18 10 721 62 25 13__________(1)  Includes investment securities that were not rated.For additional information on our investment securities, see “Note 3—Investment Securities.”Loans Held for InvestmentTotal loans held for investment (“HFI”) consists of both unsecuritized loans and loans held in our consolidated trusts.

Total deposits increased by $4.4 billion to $241.2 billion as of March 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016 primarily driven by growth in our Consumer Banking business. We provide information on the composition of our deposits, average outstanding balances, interest expense and yield in “MD&A—Liquidity Risk Profile.”Securitized Debt ObligationsSecuritized debt obligations decreased to $18.5 billion as of March 31, 2017, from $18.8 billion as of December 31, 2016, as debt maturities exceeded issuances during the first quarter of 2017. We provide additional information on our borrowings in “MD&A—Liquidity Risk Profile” and in “Note 8—Deposits and Borrowings.” 16Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsOther DebtOther debt, which consists primarily of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, senior and subordinated notes, and Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLB”) advances, totaled $29.9 billion as of March 31, 2017, of which $28.9 billion represented long-term debt and the remainder represented short-term borrowings. Other debt totaled $41.6 billion as of December 31, 2016, of which $40.6 billion represented long-term debt and the remainder represented short-term borrowings. The decrease in other debt of $11.7 billion in the first quarter of 2017 was primarily attributable to a decrease in our FHLB advances outstanding, partially offset by an increase in our senior and subordinated notes. We provide additional information on our borrowings in “MD&A—Liquidity Risk Profile” and in “Note 8—Deposits and Borrowings.”Mortgage Representation and Warranty ReserveWe acquired three subsidiaries that originated residential mortgage loans and sold these loans to various purchasers, including purchasers who created securitization trusts. These subsidiaries are Capital One Home Loans, LLC, which was acquired in February 2005; GreenPoint, which was acquired in December 2006 as part of the North Fork acquisition; and Chevy Chase Bank, F.S.B. (“CCB”), which was acquired in February 2009 and subsequently merged into CONA.We have established representation and warranty reserves for losses associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable, including both litigation and non-litigation liabilities. These reserves are reported on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities. The reserve setting process relies heavily on estimates, which are inherently uncertain, and requires judgment. We evaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis. We build our representation and warranty reserves through the provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses, which we report in our consolidated statements of income as a component of non-interest income for loans originated and sold by CCB and Capital One Home Loans, LLC and as a component of discontinued operations for loans originated and sold by GreenPoint. The aggregate reserve for all three entities decreased to $516 million as of March 31, 2017, compared to $630 million as of December 31, 2016 primarily due to favorable legal developments.As part of our business planning processes, we have considered various outcomes relating to the future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are possible but do not rise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying an incremental reserve under applicable accounting standards. Our current best estimate of reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond what was in our reserve as of March 31, 2017 is approximately $1.4 billion, a decrease from our estimate of $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2016.We provide additional information related to the representation and warranty reserve, including factors that may impact the adequacy of the reserve and the ultimate amount of losses incurred by our subsidiaries, in “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others.”OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In the ordinary course of business, we engage in certain activities that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, generally referred to as off-balance sheet arrangements. These activities typically involve transactions with unconsolidated variable interest entities (“VIEs”) as well as other arrangements, such as letter of credits, loan commitments and guarantees, to meet the financing needs of our customers and support their ongoing operations. We provide additional information regarding these types of activities in the “MD&A—Liquidity Risk Profile” as well as “Note 6—Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations” and “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others.” 17Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsBUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEOur principal operations are currently organized into three major business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group, are included in the Other category.The results of our individual businesses, which we report on a continuing operations basis, reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. We provide additional information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in “Note 18—Business Segments” in our 2016 Form 10-K.We refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our “managed” presentation, which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on U.S. GAAP. There is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to U.S. GAAP; therefore, the managed presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial services companies. In addition, our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Below we summarize our business segment results for the first quarters of 2017 and 2016 and provide a comparative discussion of these results, as well as changes in our financial condition and credit performance metrics as of March 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016. We provide a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated results in “Note 13—Business Segments.” Additionally, we provide information on the outlook for each of our business segments as described above under “MD&A—Executive Summary and Business Outlook.”Business Segment Financial PerformanceTable 9 summarizes our business segment results, which we report based on revenue and income from continuing operations, for the first quarters of 2017 and 2016. We provide information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in “Note 18—Business Segments” in our 2016 Form 10-K. We also provide a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our consolidated U.S. GAAP results in “Note 13—Business Segments” of this Report.Table 9: Business Segment Results   Three Months Ended March 31,  2017 2016  Total NetRevenue(1) Net Income(2) Total NetRevenue(1) Net Income(2)(Dollars in millions) Amount % ofTotal Amount % ofTotal Amount % ofTotal Amount % ofTotalCredit Card $4,084 63% $271 34% $3,880 62% $609 60%Consumer Banking 1,712 26 248 31 1,611 26 249 24Commercial Banking(3) 724 11 213 27 655 11 67 7Other(4)  15 — 63 8 74 1 93 9Total $6,535 100% $795 100% $6,220 100% $1,018 100%__________(1) Total net revenue consists of net interest income and non-interest income.(2) Net income for our business segments and the Other category is based on income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax.(3) Some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits. Accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory tax rate of 35% with offsetting reclassifications to the Other category. (4) The Other category includes the residual impact of the allocation of our centralized Corporate Treasury group activities, unallocated corporate expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments and other items as described in “Note 18—Business Segments” in our 2016 Form 10-K.                 Credit Card BusinessThe primary sources of revenue for our Credit Card business are interest income, net interchange income and fees collected from customers. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs and marketing expenses.Our Credit Card business generated net income from continuing operations of $271 million and $609 million in the first quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively.Table 10 summarizes the financial results of our Credit Card business and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.Table 10: Credit Card Business Results  Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions, except as noted) 2017 2016 ChangeSelected income statement data:      Net interest income $3,346 $3,033 10%Non-interest income 738 847 (13)Total net revenue(1) 4,084 3,880 5Provision for credit losses 1,717 1,071 60Non-interest expense 1,929 1,863 4Income from continuing operations before income taxes 438 946 (54)Income tax provision 167 337 (50)Income from continuing operations, net of tax $271 $609 (56)Selected performance metrics:      Average loans held for investment(2) $101,169 $92,987 9Average yield on loans held for investment(3) 14.99% 14.60% 39bpsTotal net revenue margin(4) 16.14 16.69 (55)Net charge-offs $1,271 $950 34%Net charge-off rate 5.02% 4.09% 93bpsPurchased credit card relationship (“PCCR”) intangible amortization $44 $70 (37)%Purchase volume(5) 73,197 68,189 7       (Dollars in millions, except as noted) March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 ChangeSelected period-end data:      Loans held for investment(2) $99,213 $105,552 (6)%30+ day performing delinquency rate 3.68% 3.91% (23)bps30+ day delinquency rate 3.71 3.94 (23)Nonperforming loan rate 0.04 0.04 —Allowance for loan and lease losses $5,058 $4,606 10%Allowance coverage ratio(6) 5.10% 4.36% 74bps__________(1) We recognize billed finance charges and fee income on open-ended loans in accordance with the contractual provisions of the credit arrangements and estimate the uncollectible amount on a quarterly basis. The estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees is reflected as a reduction in revenue and is not included in our net charge-offs. Total net revenue was reduced by $321 million and $228 million in the first quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively, for the estimated uncollectible amount of billed finance charges and fees and related losses. The finance charge and fee reserve totaled $398 million and $402 million as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.(2) Period-end loans held for investment and average loans held for investment include billed finance charges and fees, net of the estimated uncollectible amount.(3) Average yield on loans held for investment is calculated by dividing annualized interest income for the period by average loans held for investment during the period. Interest income excludes various allocations including funds transfer pricing that assigns certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses attributable to each business segment.  18Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents(4) Total net revenue margin is calculated by dividing annualized total net revenue for the period by average loans held for investment during the period. Interest income also includes interest income on loans held for sale. (5) Purchase volume consists of purchase transactions, net of returns, for the period for loans both classified as held for investment and held for sale.

(6) Allowance coverage ratio is calculated by dividing the period-end allowance for loan and lease losses by period-end loans held for investment.Key factors affecting the results of our Credit Card business for the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 include the following:•Net Interest Income: Net interest income increased by $313 million to $3.3 billion in the first quarter of 2017 primarily driven by loan growth and higher net interest margins in our Domestic Card business.•Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income decreased by $109 million to $738 million in the first quarter of 2017 primarily driven by:◦higher rewards expense from the continued expansion of our rewards franchise; ◦a build in our U.K. PPI Reserve in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the absence of a build in the first quarter of 2016; and◦lower service charges and other customer-related fees primarily due to the exit of our legacy payment protection products in our Domestic Card business during the first quarter of 2016.These decreases were partially offset by:◦an increase in gross interchange fees driven by higher purchase volume.•Provision for Credit Losses: The provision for credit losses increased by $646 million to $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2017 primarily driven by:◦a larger allowance build in our domestic credit card loan portfolio due to increasing loss expectations on recent originations; and◦higher charge-offs due to seasoning of recent growth.•Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $66 million to $1.9 billion in the first quarter of 2017 primarily driven by:◦higher operating expenses associated with loan growth and continued investments in technology; and◦higher other non-interest expense primarily driven by a build in our U.K. PPI Reserve in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the absence of a build in the first quarter of 2016.These increases were partially offset by:◦lower marketing expenses and operating efficiencies.•Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment decreased by $6.3 billion to $99.2 billion as of March 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016 primarily due to expected seasonal paydowns. Average loans held for investment increased by $8.2 billion to $101.2 billion in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016, primarily due to growth in our domestic credit card loan portfolio. •Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: The net charge-off rate increased by 93 basis points to 5.02% in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 primarily driven by growth and seasoning of recent domestic credit card loan originations, partially offset by growth in our domestic credit card loan portfolio. The 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 23 basis points to 3.71% as of March 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016 primarily due to seasonally lower delinquency inventories, partially offset by seasonally lower loan balances in our domestic credit card loan portfolio. 19Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsDomestic Card BusinessDomestic Card generated net income from continuing operations of $278 million and $564 million in the first quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Net income for our Domestic Card business decreased in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 primarily driven by: 20Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents•higher provision for credit losses;•lower non-interest income; and•higher operating expenses associated with loan growth.These drivers were partially offset by:•higher net interest income resulting from loan growth and higher net interest margins; and•lower marketing expenses and operating efficiencies.Consumer Banking BusinessThe primary sources of revenue for our Consumer Banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits and non-interest income from service charges and customer-related fees. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs and marketing expenses.Our Consumer Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $248 million and $249 million in the first quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively.Table 11 summarizes the financial results of our Consumer Banking business and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated. 21Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 11: Consumer Banking Business Results   Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions, except as noted) 2017 2016 ChangeSelected income statement data:      Net interest income $1,517 $1,420 7%Non-interest income 195 191 2Total net revenue 1,712 1,611 6Provision for credit losses 279 230 21Non-interest expense 1,042 990 5Income from continuing operations before income taxes 391 391 —Income tax provision  143 142 1Income from continuing operations, net of tax $248 $249 —Selected performance metrics:      Average loans held for investment:(1)      Auto $48,673 $41,962 16Home loan 21,149 24,781 (15)Retail banking 3,509 3,553 (1)Total consumer banking $73,331 $70,296 4Average yield on loans held for investment(2) 6.48% 6.18% 30bpsAverage deposits $183,936 $174,254 6%Average deposits interest rate 0.57% 0.54% 3bpsNet charge-offs $218 $183 19%Net charge-off rate 1.19% 1.04% 15bpsNet charge-off rate (excluding PCI loans)(3) 1.46 1.40 6Auto loan originations $7,025 $5,844 20%       (Dollars in millions, except as noted) March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 ChangeSelected period-end data:      Loans held for investment:(1)      Auto $49,771 $47,916 4%Home loan 20,738 21,584 (4)Retail banking 3,473 3,554 (2)Total consumer banking $73,982 $73,054 130+ day performing delinquency rate 3.45% 4.10% (65)bps30+ day performing delinquency rate (excluding PCI loans)(3) 4.23 5.12 (89)30+ day delinquency rate 3.93 4.67 (74)30+ day delinquency rate (excluding PCI loans)(3) 4.80 5.82 (102)Nonperforming loan rate 0.64 0.72 (8)Nonperforming loan rate (excluding PCI loans)(3) 0.78 0.90 (12)Nonperforming asset rate(4) 0.92 1.09 (17)Nonperforming asset rate (excluding PCI loans)(3)(4) 1.12 1.36 (24)Allowance for loan and lease losses $1,163 $1,102 6%Allowance coverage ratio(5)(6) 1.57% 1.51% 6bpsDeposits $188,216 $181,917 3%Loans serviced for others 8,462 8,258 2__________(1) Average consumer banking loans held for investment includes purchased credit-impaired loans (“PCI loans”) of $13.8 billion and $18.0 billion in the first quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The total nonperforming asset rate is calculated based on total nonperforming assets divided by the combined period-end total loans held for investment, REO and other foreclosed assets.(5) Allowance coverage ratio is calculated by dividing the period-end allowance for loan and lease losses by period-end loans held for investment.(6) Excluding the impact of the PCI home loan amounts in footnote 1 above, the allowance coverage ratios for our home loan portfolio and total consumer banking were 0.42% and 1.87%, respectively, as of March 31, 2017, compared to 0.51% and 1.83%, respectively, as of December 31, 2016.Key factors affecting the results of our Consumer Banking business for the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016, and changes in financial condition and credit performance between March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 include the following:•Net Interest Income: Net interest income increased by $97 million to $1.5 billion in the first quarter of 2017 primarily driven by growth in our auto loan portfolio, partially offset by higher interest expense in our retail banking business due to higher deposit volumes and higher interest rates, as well as margin compression in our auto loan portfolio.◦Consumer Banking loan yield increased by 30 basis points to 6.5% in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by changes in the product mix in Consumer Banking as a result of run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio and growth in our auto loan portfolio, partially offset by margin compression in our auto loan portfolio.◦Average yield on auto loans decreased by 16 basis points to 7.6% in the first quarter of 2017 primarily attributable to margin compression and changes in the product mix in our auto loan portfolio.◦Average yield on our home loan portfolio increased by 49 basis points to 4.2% in the first quarter of 2017 primarily as a result of higher yield on our acquired home loan portfolio.•Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income was substantially flat at $195 million in the first quarter of 2017 as a mortgage representation and warranty reserve release in the first quarter of 2017 had a similar impact as the customer rewards reserve release within our retail banking business in the first quarter of 2016 related to the discontinuation of certain debit card and deposit products.•Provision for Credit Losses: The provision for credit losses increased by $49 million to $279 million in the first quarter of 2017 primarily driven by:◦higher charge-offs due to growth and seasoning in our auto loan portfolio; and◦a larger allowance build in our auto loan portfolio due to higher loss rates associated with growth, as well as further expected declines in used car auction prices.•Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $52 million to $1.0 billion in the first quarter of 2017 primarily due to higher operating expenses driven by growth in our auto loan portfolio.•Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment increased by $928 million to $74.0 billion as of March 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016, and average loans held for investment increased by $3.0 billion to $73.3 billion in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. The increases were primarily due to growth in our auto loan portfolio, partially offset by run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio.•Deposits: Period-end deposits increased by $6.3 billion to $188.2 billion as of March 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016 as a result of strong growth in our deposit products that are sold directly to both existing and new customers.•Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: The net charge-off rate increased by 15 basis points to 1.19% in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. The increase reflects the greater portion of auto loans in our total consumer banking loan portfolio, which generally have higher charge-off rates than other products within this portfolio. The 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 74 basis points to 3.93% as of March 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016 primarily attributable to seasonally lower auto delinquency inventories. 23Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCommercial Banking BusinessThe primary sources of revenue for our Commercial Banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits and non-interest income from customer fees and other transactions.

The decreases reflect lower exposure in our oil and gas and taxi medallion lending portfolios.•Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $69 million to $391 million in the first quarter of 2017 driven by higher operating expenses associated with loan growth and continued investments in technology.•Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment increased by $404 million to $67.3 billion as of March 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016, and average loans held for investment increased by $3.6 billion to $66.9 billion in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016, both driven by growth in our commercial loan portfolios.•Deposits: Period-end deposits were stable at $33.7 billion as of March 31, 2017.•Net Charge-Off and Nonperforming Metrics: The net charge-off rate decreased by 15 basis points to 0.14% in the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016 driven by lower charge-offs in our oil and gas and taxi medallion lending portfolios. The nonperforming loan rate decreased by 28 basis points to 1.25% as of March 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016, reflecting improved portfolio performance in our oil and gas portfolio.Other CategoryOther includes unallocated amounts related to our centralized Corporate Treasury group activities, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio, asset/liability management and certain capital management activities.

The decrease in the first quarter of 2017 was primarily driven by:•lower non-interest income primarily due to rate-driven hedge ineffectiveness losses in the first quarter of 2017 compared to gains in the first quarter of 2016;•higher non-interest expense from restructuring charges for severance and related benefits pursuant to our ongoing benefit programs as a result of the realignment of our workforce, as well as higher bank optimization charges; and•lower net interest income due to higher funding needs to support balance sheet growth.These drivers were partially offset by:•an increased income tax benefit as a result of lower income before taxes and increased discrete tax benefits related to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-09, Compensation—Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses on the consolidated financial statements. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We provide a summary of our significant accounting policies under “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2016 Form 10-K. We have identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. These critical accounting policies govern:•Loan loss reserves•Asset impairment•Fair value of financial instruments•Representation and warranty reserves 27Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents•Customer rewards reserveWe evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them, as necessary, based on changing conditions. Management has discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates since the 2016 Form 10-K.We provide additional information on our critical accounting policies and estimates under “MD&A—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our 2016 Form 10-K.ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTSSee “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for information on accounting standards adopted in 2017, as well as recently issued accounting standards not yet required to be adopted and the expected impact of these changes in accounting standards. 28Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL MANAGEMENTThe level and composition of our capital are determined by multiple factors, including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements and internal risk-based capital assessments such as internal stress testing and economic capital. The level and composition of our capital may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment, conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments.Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective ActionWe are subject to capital adequacy standards adopted by the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and FDIC (collectively, the “Federal Banking Agencies”), including the capital rules that implemented the Basel III capital framework (“Basel III Capital Rule”) developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“Basel Committee”). Moreover, the Banks, as insured depository institutions, are subject to prompt corrective action (“PCA”) capital regulations.In July 2013, the Federal Banking Agencies adopted the Basel III Capital Rule, which, in addition to implementing the Basel III capital framework, also implemented certain Dodd-Frank Act and other capital provisions, and updated the PCA capital framework to reflect the new regulatory capital minimums. The Basel III Capital Rule amended both the Basel I and Basel II Advanced Approaches frameworks, established a new common equity Tier 1 capital requirement and set higher minimum capital ratio requirements. We refer to the amended Basel I framework as the “Basel III Standardized Approach,” and the amended Advanced Approaches framework as the “Basel III Advanced Approaches.” At the end of 2012, we met one of the two independent eligibility criteria set by banking regulators for becoming subject to the Advanced Approaches capital rules. As a result, we have undertaken a multi-year process of implementing the Advanced Approaches regime for calculating risk-weighted assets and regulatory capital levels. We entered parallel run under Advanced Approaches on January 1, 2015, during which we are required to calculate capital ratios under both the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches, though we continue to use the Standardized Approach for purposes of meeting regulatory capital requirements. The Basel Committee has proposed, but has not finalized, changes to the Basel III capital framework. There is uncertainty around any final changes that the Basel Committee might adopt, which of those changes thereafter may be adopted in the United States, and how those changes may impact the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches. The Market Risk Rule supplements both the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches by requiring institutions subject to the Market Risk Rule to adjust their risk-based capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading portfolios. The Market Risk Rule applies to institutions with aggregate trading assets and liabilities equal to the lesser of (i) 10% or more of total assets or (ii) $1 billion or more. See “MD&A—Market Risk Profile” below for additional information. We began reporting risk-based capital ratios including market risk-weighted assets for the Company and CONA pursuant to the Market Risk Rule for positions covered by such rule in the third quarter of 2016. This change did not have a material impact on the risk-based capital ratios of these two entities. As of March 31, 2017, COBNA is not subject to the Market Risk Rule. For additional information about the capital adequacy guidelines we are subject to, see “Part I—Item 1.

The inclusion of AOCI and the adjustments related to intangible assets are phased-in at 60% for 2016, 80% for 2017 and 100% for 2018.(2) Ratios as of March 31, 2017 are preliminary. As we continue to validate our data, the calculations are subject to change until we file our March 31, 2017 Form FR Y-9C—Consolidated Financial Statements for Holding Companies and Call Reports.(3) Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on common equity Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets.(4) Tier 1 capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets.(5) Total capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on total capital divided by risk-weighted assets.(6) Tier 1 leverage ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average assets.(7) Supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by total leverage exposure.In addition to the above statutory capital ratios, we also disclose a non-GAAP TCE ratio in “MD&A—Summary of Selected Financial Data.” This capital measure is not necessarily comparable to similarly-titled capital measures reported by other companies. We provide information on the calculation of this ratio in “MD&A—Table A—Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures and Calculation of Regulatory Capital Measures.” The Company exceeded the minimum capital requirements and each of the Banks exceeded the minimum regulatory requirements and were well capitalized under PCA requirements as of both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The Basel III Capital Rule requires banks to maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above the regulatory minimum ratios composed of common equity Tier 1 capital. The capital conservation buffer is being phased in over a transition period that commenced on January 1, 2016 and will be fully phased in on January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer is 1.25% in 2017. For banks subject to the Advanced Approaches, including the Company and the Banks, the capital conservation buffer may be supplemented by an incremental countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% (once fully phased-in) composed of common equity  30Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTier 1 capital and set at the discretion of the Federal Banking Agencies. As of March 31, 2017, the countercyclical capital buffer is zero percent in the United States. A determination to increase the countercyclical capital buffer generally would be effective twelve months after the announcement of such an increase, unless the Federal Banking Agencies set an earlier effective date. The countercyclical capital buffer, if set to an amount greater than zero percent, would be subject to the same transition period as the capital conservation buffer, which commenced on January 1, 2016. For 2017, the minimum capital requirement plus capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer for common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios is 5.75%, 7.25% and 9.25%, respectively, for the Company and the Banks. A common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, or total capital ratio below the applicable regulatory minimum ratio plus the applicable capital conservation buffer and the applicable countercyclical buffer (if set to an amount greater than zero percent) might restrict a bank’s ability to distribute capital and make discretionary bonus payments. As of March 31, 2017, the Company and each of the Banks are all above the applicable combined thresholds. Additionally, banks designated as global systemically important banks (“G-SIBs”) are subject to an additional regulatory capital surcharge above the combined capital conservation and countercyclical capital buffers established by the Basel III Capital Rule. We are currently not designated as a G-SIB and therefore not subject to this surcharge. The following table compares our common equity Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as of March 31, 2017, subject to applicable transition provisions, to our estimated fully phased-in common equity Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets, as it applies for Advanced Approaches banks such as ourselves that have not yet exited parallel run. Our estimated common equity Tier 1 capital, risk-weighted assets and common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the fully phased-in Basel III Standardized Approach are non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information in evaluating compliance with regulatory capital requirements that are not effective yet. They are calculated based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and are subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. As we continue to engage with our regulators, there could be further changes to the calculation.Table 15: Regulatory Capital Reconciliations between Basel III Transition to Fully Phased-in(1) (Dollars in millions) March 31, 2017Common equity Tier 1 capital under Basel III Standardized Approach $29,161Adjustments related to AOCI(2) (127)Adjustments related to intangibles(2) (116)Other adjustments(2) (2)Estimated common equity Tier 1 capital under fully phased-in Basel III Standardized Approach $28,916Risk-weighted assets under Basel III Standardized Approach(3) $279,302Adjustments for fully phased-in Basel III Standardized Approach(4) 1,910Estimated risk-weighted assets under fully phased-in Basel III Standardized Approach $281,212Estimated common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under fully phased-in Basel III Standardized Approach(5) 10.3%__________(1) Estimated common equity Tier 1 capital, risk-weighted assets, and common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the fully phased-in Basel III Standardized Approach are non-GAAP financial measures.(2) Assumes adjustments are fully phased-in.(3) Includes credit and market risk-weighted assets.(4) Adjustments include higher risk weights for items that are included in capital based on the threshold deduction approach, such as mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets. The adjustments also include removal of risk weights for items that are deducted from common equity Tier 1 capital.(5) Calculated by dividing estimated common equity Tier 1 capital by estimated risk-weighted assets, which are both calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach, as it applies when fully phased-in for Advanced Approaches banks that have not yet exited parallel run.Under the Basel III Capital Rule, when we complete our parallel run for the Advanced Approaches, our minimum risk-based capital requirement will be determined by the greater of our risk-weighted assets under the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches. See “Part I—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation” in our 2016 Form 10-K for additional information. Once we exit parallel run, based on clarification of the Basel III Capital Rule from our regulators, any amount by which our expected credit losses exceed eligible credit reserves, as each term is defined under the Basel III Capital Rule, will be deducted from our Basel III Standardized Approach numerator, subject to transition provisions. Inclusive of this impact, based on current capital rules and our business mix, we estimate that our Basel III Advanced Approaches ratios will be lower than our Basel  31Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsIII Standardized Approach ratios. However, there is uncertainty whether this will remain the case in light of potential changes to the United States capital rules. Capital Planning and Regulatory Stress TestingOn April 5, 2017, we submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve as part of the 2017 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) cycle. The stress testing results are expected to be released by the Federal Reserve before June 30, 2017. On June 29, 2016, the Federal Reserve informed us that they had “no objection” to our CCAR 2016 Capital Plan submission. As a result of this non-objection to our capital plan, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of shares of our common stock from the third quarter of 2016 through the end of the second quarter of 2017, in addition to share repurchases related to employee compensation. The Board of Directors also authorized the quarterly dividend on our common stock of $0.40 per share. For the description of the regulatory capital planning rules we are subject to, see “Part I—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation” in our 2016 Form 10-K.Dividend Policy and Stock PurchasesWe paid common stock dividends of $0.40 per share in the first quarter of 2017.

As a bank holding company (“BHC”), our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries. Regulatory restrictions exist that limit the ability of the Banks to transfer funds to our BHC. As of March 31, 2017, funds available for dividend payments from COBNA and CONA were $3.7 billion and $926 million, respectively. There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends to stockholders.Consistent with our 2016 Stock Repurchase Program, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of shares of common stock beginning in the third quarter of 2016 through the end of the second quarter of 2017. Through the end of the first quarter of 2017, we repurchased approximately $2.2 billion of shares of common stock as part of the 2016 Stock Repurchase Program.The timing and exact amount of any future common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including market conditions, opportunities for growth, our capital position and the amount of retained earnings. Our stock repurchase program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time. For additional information on dividends and stock repurchases, see  32Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents“Part I—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation—Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Transfer of Funds” in our 2016 Form 10-K.RISK MANAGEMENTRisk FrameworkWe use a risk framework to provide an overall enterprise-wide approach for effectively managing risk. We execute against our risk framework with the “Three Lines of Defense” risk management model to demonstrate and structure the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities in the organization for taking and managing risk. The “First Line of Defense” is comprised of the business areas that through their day-to-day business activities take risk on our behalf. As the business owner, the first line is responsible for identifying, assessing, managing and controlling that risk. This principle places ultimate accountability for the management of risks and ownership of risk decisions with the CEO and business heads. The “Second Line of Defense” provides oversight of first line risk taking and management, and is primarily comprised of our Risk Management organization. The second line assists in determining risk appetite and the strategies, policies and structures for managing risks. The second line is both an “expert advisor” to the first line and an “effective challenger” of first line risk activities. The “Third Line of Defense” is comprised of our Internal Audit and Credit Review functions. The third line provides independent and objective assurance to senior management and to the Board of Directors that first and second line risk management and internal control systems and its governance processes are well-designed and working as intended.The risk framework is also used to guide design of risk programs and performance of risk activity within each risk category and across the entire enterprise.  There are eight elements that comprise the risk framework:•Establish Governance Processes, Accountabilities and Risk Appetites •Identify and Assess Risks and Ownership •Develop and Operate Controls, Monitoring and Mitigation Plans  •Test and Detect Control Gaps and Perform Corrective Action •Escalate Key Risks and Gaps to Executive Management and, when Appropriate, the Board of Directors  •Calculate and Allocate Capital in Alignment with Risk Management and Measurement Processes (including Stress Testing) •Support with the Right Culture, Talent and Skills  •Enabled by the Right Data, Infrastructure and Programs  We provide additional discussion of our risk management principles, roles and responsibilities, framework and risk appetite under “MD&A—Risk Management” in our 2016 Form 10-K. CREDIT RISK PROFILEOur loan portfolio accounts for the substantial majority of our credit risk exposure. Our lending activities are governed under our credit policy and are subject to independent review and approval. Below we provide information about the composition of our loan portfolio, key concentrations and credit performance metrics.We also engage in certain non-lending activities that may give rise to credit and counterparty settlement risk, including the purchase of securities for our investment securities portfolio, entering into derivative transactions to manage our market risk exposure and to accommodate customers, short-term advances on syndication activity (including bridge financing transactions we have underwritten), certain operational cash balances in other financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and customer  33Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contentsoverdrafts.

Our primary products include credit cards, auto loans, home loans and commercial lending products. For information on our lending policies and procedures, including our underwriting criteria for our primary loan products, see “MD&A—Credit Risk Profile” in our 2016 Form 10-K.Our loan portfolio consists of loans held for investment, including loans held in our consolidated trusts, and loans held for sale. Table 17 presents the composition of our portfolio of loans held for investment, including PCI loans, by portfolio segment as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Table 17 and the credit metrics presented in this section exclude loans held for sale, which are carried at lower of cost or fair value and totaled $735 million and $1.0 billion as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.Table 17: Loans Held for Investment Portfolio Composition   March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016(Dollars in millions) Loans % of Total Loans % of TotalCredit Card:        Domestic credit card $91,092 37.8% $97,120 39.6%International card businesses 8,121 3.4 8,432 3.4Total credit card 99,213 41.2 105,552 43.0Consumer Banking:        Auto 49,771 20.7 47,916 19.5Home loan 20,738 8.6 21,584 8.8Retail banking 3,473 1.5 3,554 1.4Total consumer banking 73,982 30.8 73,054 29.7Commercial Banking:        Commercial and multifamily real estate 27,218 11.3 26,609 10.9Commercial and industrial 39,638 16.5 39,824 16.2Total commercial lending 66,856 27.8 66,433 27.1Small-ticket commercial real estate 464 0.2 483 0.2Total commercial banking 67,320 28.0 66,916 27.3Other loans 73 — 64 —Total loans held for investment $240,588 100.0% $245,586 100.0% 34Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCommercial LoansFor purposes of portfolio risk management, we aggregate our commercial loan portfolio according to market segmentation primarily based on standard industry codes.

For information on our total unfunded lending commitments see “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others.”(3) Includes our taxi medallion lending portfolio among other portfolios.Purchased Credit-Impaired LoansOur portfolio of loans includes certain of our consumer and commercial loans acquired in business acquisitions that were recorded at fair value at acquisition and subsequently accounted for using the guidance for accounting for PCI loans and debt securities, which is based upon expected cash flows. These PCI loans totaled $14.1 billion as of March 31, 2017 compared to $15.1 billion as of December 31, 2016. See “MD&A—Glossary and Acronyms” for the definition of “PCI loans.”The difference between the fair value at acquisition and expected cash flows represents the accretable yield, which is recognized in interest income over the life of the loans. The difference between the contractual payments on the loans and expected cash flows represents the nonaccretable difference or the amount of principal and interest not considered collectible, which incorporates future expected credit losses over the life of the loans. We regularly update our estimate of expected principal and interest to be collected from these loans and evaluate the results for each accounting pool that was established at acquisition based on loans with common risk characteristics. Probable decreases in expected cash flows would trigger the recognition of an allowance for loan and lease losses through our provision for credit losses. Probable and significant increases in expected cash flows would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan and lease losses established subsequent to acquisition, with any remaining increase in expected cash flows recognized prospectively in interest income over the remaining estimated life of the underlying loans. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2016 Form 10-K for additional information on PCI loans that are accounted for based on expected cash flows. 35Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsHome LoansThe majority of our home loan portfolio are PCI loans acquired from the ING Direct and CCB acquisitions, representing 65% and 67% of our total home loan portfolio as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. See “MD&A—Glossary and Acronyms” for the definition of ING Direct and CCB acquisitions. The expected cash flows for the PCI loans in our home loan portfolio are significantly impacted by future expectations of home prices and interest rates. Decreases in expected cash flows that result from declining conditions, particularly associated with these variables, could result in an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses and reduction in accretable yield. Charge-offs on these loans are not recorded until the expected credit losses within the nonaccretable difference are depleted. In addition, PCI loans are not classified as delinquent or nonperforming as we expect to collect our net investment in these loans and the nonaccretable difference is expected to absorb the majority of the losses associated with these loans.Table 19 presents our total home loan portfolio and the break out of the PCI loans and remaining loans within our home loan portfolio, by lien priority.Table 19: Home Loans—Risk Profile by Lien Priority  March 31, 2017  Home Loans PCI Loans Total Home Loans(Dollars in millions) Amount % ofTotal Amount % ofTotal Amount % ofTotalLien type:            1st lien $6,291 30.3% $13,228 63.8% $19,519 94.1%2nd lien 963 4.7 256 1.2 1,219 5.9Total $7,254 35.0% $13,484 65.0% $20,738 100.0%  December 31, 2016  Home Loans PCI Loans Total Home Loans(Dollars in millions) Amount % ofTotal Amount % ofTotal Amount % ofTotalLien type:            1st lien $6,182 28.7% $14,159 65.5% $20,341 94.2%2nd lien 974 4.5 269 1.3 1,243 5.8Total $7,156 33.2% $14,428 66.8% $21,584 100.0%See “Note 4—Loans” in this Report for additional credit quality information.

Changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses would be recognized immediately in the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income. 36Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCredit Risk MeasurementWe closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to assess and manage our exposure to credit risk. Key metrics we track in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming asset rates, as well as net charge-off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger balance commercial loans. Trends in delinquency rates are a primary indicator of credit risk within our consumer loan portfolios, as changes in delinquency rates provide an early warning of changes in credit losses. The primary indicator of credit risk in our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings. Because we generally classify loans that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming, the level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of our loans provides insight as to the exposure of the portfolio to regional economic conditions. We underwrite most consumer loans using proprietary models, which are typically based on credit bureau data, including borrower credit scores, along with application information and, where applicable, collateral and deal structure data. We continuously adjust our management of credit lines and collection strategies based on customer behavior and risk profile changes. We also use borrower credit scores for subprime classification, for competitive benchmarking and, in some cases, to drive product segmentation decisions. The following table provides details on the credit scores of our domestic credit card and auto loans held for investment portfolios as of March 31, 2017, December 31, 2016 and March 31, 2016.Table 21: Credit Score Distribution(Percentage of portfolio) March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 March 31, 2016Domestic credit card—Refreshed FICO scores:(1)      Greater than 660 63% 64% 65%660 or below 37 36 35Total 100% 100% 100%Auto—At origination FICO scores:(2)      Greater than 660 51% 52% 51%621 - 660 18 17 17620 or below 31 31 32Total 100% 100% 100%__________ (1) Domestic card credit scores generally represent FICO scores. These scores are obtained from one of the major credit bureaus at origination and are refreshed monthly thereafter. We approximate non-FICO credit scores to comparable FICO scores for consistency purposes. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 660 or below category.(2) Auto credit scores generally represent average FICO scores obtained from three credit bureaus at the time of application and are not refreshed thereafter. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 620 or below category. We present information in the section below on the credit performance of our loan portfolio, including the key metrics we use in tracking changes in the credit quality of our loan portfolio.See “Note 4—Loans” in this Report for additional credit quality information. Also, see “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2016 Form 10-K for information on our accounting policies for delinquent and nonperforming loans, net charge-offs and TDRs for each of our loan categories.Delinquency RatesWe consider the entire balance of an account to be delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the customer’s due date, measured at the reporting date. Our 30+ day delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due, whereas our 30+ day performing delinquency metrics include loans that are 30 or more days past due but are currently classified as performing and accruing interest. The 30+ day delinquency and 30+ day performing delinquency metrics are the same for domestic credit card loans, as we continue to classify loans as performing until the account is charged off, typically when the account is 180 days past due. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2016 Form 10-K for information on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming for each of our loan categories.

These loans consist primarily of credit card accounts between 90 days and 179 days past due. As permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”), we continue to accrue interest and fees on domestic credit card loans through the date of charge-off, which is typically in the period the account becomes 180 days past due. While domestic credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until the loan is charged off, we reduce the balance of our credit card receivables by the amount of finance charges and fees billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from revenue.Table 24: 90+ Day Delinquent Loans Accruing Interest   March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016(Dollars in millions) Amount % ofTotal Loans(1) Amount % ofTotal Loans(1)Loan category:        Credit card $1,820 1.83% $1,936 1.83%Consumer banking — — — —Commercial banking — — — —Total $1,820 0.76 $1,936 0.79Geographic region:        Domestic $1,720 0.74 $1,840 0.78International 100 1.22 96 1.14Total $1,820 0.76 $1,936 0.79__________ (1) Delinquency rates are calculated by dividing 90+ day delinquent loans accruing interest by period-end loans held for investment, including PCI loans, for the specified loan category.Nonperforming Loans and Nonperforming AssetsNonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, foreclosed properties and repossessed assets and the net realizable value of auto loans that have been charged off as a result of a bankruptcy. Nonperforming loans include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status.

Interest income foregone related to nonperforming loans was $20 million and $19 million in the first quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively. Foregone interest income represents the amount of interest income that would have been recorded during the period for nonperforming loans as of the end of the period had the loans performed according to their contractual terms.(2) Excluding the impact of PCI loans, the nonperforming loan rates for our home loan and total consumer banking portfolios were 3.64% and 0.78%, respectively, as of March 31, 2017, compared to 3.81% and 0.90%, respectively, as of December 31, 2016.(3) Excluding the impact of domestic credit card loans, nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment was 0.91% and 1.08% as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.(4) The denominator used in calculating the nonperforming asset ratios consists of total loans held for investment and total other nonperforming assets.(5) Includes the net realizable value of auto loans that have been charged off as a result of a bankruptcy and repossessed assets obtained in satisfaction of auto loans. 40Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsNet Charge-OffsNet charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine to be uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We charge off loans as a reduction to the allowance for loan and lease losses when we determine the loan is uncollectible and record subsequent recoveries of previously charged off amounts as increases to the allowance for loan and lease losses. Uncollectible finance charges and fees are reversed through revenue and certain fraud losses are recorded in other non-interest expense. Generally, costs to recover charged-off loans are recorded as collection expenses and included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest expense as incurred. Our charge-off policy for loans varies based on the loan type. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2016 Form 10-K for information on our charge-off policy for each of our loan categories.Table 26 presents our net charge-off amounts and rates, by portfolio segment, in the first quarters of 2017 and 2016.Table 26: Net Charge-Offs (Recoveries)  Three Months Ended March 31,  2017 2016(Dollars in millions) Amount Rate(1) Amount Rate(1)Credit Card:        Domestic credit card $1,196 5.14% $887 4.16%International card businesses 75 3.69 63 3.24Total credit card 1,271 5.02 950 4.09Consumer Banking:        Auto 199 1.64 168 1.60Home loan(2) 2 0.03 3 0.05Retail banking 17 1.92 12 1.36Total consumer banking(2) 218 1.19 183 1.04Commercial Banking:        Commercial and multifamily real estate — — (1) (0.01)Commercial and industrial 22 0.22 47 0.49Total commercial lending 22 0.13 46 0.29Small-ticket commercial real estate 1 1.05 0 0.13Total commercial banking 23 0.14 46 0.29Other loans (2) (10.23) (1) (3.82)Total net charge-offs $1,510 2.50 $1,178 2.08Average loans held for investment $241,505   $226,736  __________ (1) Net charge-off (recovery) rates are calculated by dividing annualized net charge-offs by average loans held for investment for the period for each loan category.(2) Excluding the impact of PCI loans, the net charge-off rates for our home loan and total consumer banking portfolios were 0.08% and 1.46%, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to 0.17% and 1.40%, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2016.For information regarding management’s expectations of net charge-offs, see “MD&A—Executive Summary and Business Outlook.” 41Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTroubled Debt RestructuringsAs part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may provide short-term (three to twelve months) or long-term (greater than twelve months) modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to improve long-term collectability of the loan and to avoid the need for foreclosure or repossession of collateral.Table 27 presents our recorded investment of loans modified in TDRs as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, which excludes loan modifications that do not meet the definition of a TDR, and PCI loans, which we track and report separately.Table 27: Troubled Debt Restructurings  March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016(Dollars in millions) Amount % of Total Modifications Amount % of Total ModificationsCredit card $735 30.7% $715 29.0%Consumer banking:        Auto 499 20.8 523 21.2Home loan 237 9.9 241 9.8Retail banking 35 1.5 43 1.7Total consumer banking 771 32.2 807 32.7Commercial banking 890 37.1 944 38.3Total $2,396 100.0% $2,466 100.0%Status of TDRs:        Performing $1,661 69.3% $1,631 66.1%Nonperforming 735 30.7 835 33.9Total $2,396 100.0% $2,466 100.0% In the Credit Card business, the majority of our credit card loans modified in TDRs involve reducing the interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. The effective interest rate in effect immediately prior to the loan modification is used as the effective interest rate for purposes of measuring impairment using the present value of expected cash flows. In some cases, the interest rate on a credit card account automatically increases due to non-payment, late payment or similar events. In all cases, we cancel the customer’s available line of credit on the credit card. If the customer does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement may revert to its original payment terms, likely resulting in any loan outstanding reflected in the appropriate delinquency category, and charged off in accordance with our standard charge-off policy.In the Consumer Banking business, the majority of our loans modified in TDRs receive an extension, an interest rate reduction or principal reduction, or a combination of both. In addition, TDRs also occur in connection with bankruptcy of the borrower. In certain bankruptcy discharges, the loan is written down to the collateral value and the charged off amount is reported as principal reduction. Their impairment is determined using the present value of expected cash flows or a collateral evaluation for certain auto and home loans where the collateral value is lower than the recorded investment. In the Commercial Banking business, the majority of loans modified in TDRs receive an extension, with a portion of these loans receiving an interest rate reduction. The impairment on modified commercial loans is generally determined based on the underlying collateral value. We provide additional information on modified loans accounted for as TDRs, including the performance of those loans subsequent to modification, in “Note 4—Loans.”Impaired LoansA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan. Generally, we report loans as impaired based on the method for measuring impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. Loans defined as individually impaired include larger balance commercial nonperforming loans and TDRs. Loans held for sale are not reported as impaired, as these loans are recorded at lower of cost or fair value. Impaired loans also exclude PCI loans accounted for based on expected cash flows because this accounting methodology takes into consideration future credit losses expected to be incurred. 42Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsImpaired loans, including TDRs, totaled $3.0 billion and $3.2 billion as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Modified TDR loans accounted for $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion of impaired loans as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. We provide additional information on our impaired loans, including the allowance for loan and lease losses established for these loans, in “Note 4—Loans” and “Note 5—Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments.”Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending CommitmentsOur allowance for loan and lease losses represents management’s best estimate of incurred loan and lease credit losses inherent to our held for investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date. The allowance for loan and lease losses is increased through the provision for credit losses and reduced by net charge-offs. We provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses under “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2016 Form 10-K.Table 28 presents changes in our allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments for the first quarters of 2017 and 2016, and details by portfolio segment for the provision for credit losses, charge-offs and recoveries. 43Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 28: Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments Activity  Credit Card Consumer Banking      (Dollars in millions) Domestic Card International Card Businesses Total Credit Card Auto HomeLoan RetailBanking TotalConsumerBanking Commercial Banking Other(1) TotalAllowance for loan and lease losses:                    Balance as of December 31, 2016 $4,229 $377 $4,606 $957 $65 $80 $1,102 $793 $2 $6,503Charge-offs (1,484) (117) (1,601) (339) (4) (21) (364) (26) — (1,991)Recoveries 288 42 330 140 2 4 146 3 2 481Net charge-offs (1,196) (75) (1,271) (199) (2) (17) (218) (23) 2 (1,510)Provision (benefit) for loan and lease losses 1,637 80 1,717 270 (3) 12 279 (6) (2) 1,988Allowance build (release) for loan and lease losses 441 5 446 71 (5) (5) 61 (29) — 478Other changes(2) — 6 6 — — — — (3) — 3Balance as of March 31, 2017 4,670 388 5,058 1,028 60 75 1,163 761 2 6,984Reserve for unfunded lending commitments:                    Balance as of December 31, 2016 — — — — — 7 7 129 — 136Provision (benefit) for losses on unfunded lending commitments — — — — — — — 4 — 4Balance as of March 31, 2017 — — — — — 7 7 133 — 140Combined allowance and reserve as of March 31, 2017 $4,670 $388 $5,058 $1,028 $60 $82 $1,170 $894 $2 $7,124  Credit Card Consumer Banking      (Dollars in millions) Domestic Card International Card Businesses Total Credit Card Auto HomeLoan RetailBanking TotalConsumerBanking Commercial Banking Other(1) TotalAllowance for loan and lease losses:                    Balance as of December 31, 2015 $3,355 $299 $3,654 $726 $70 $72 $868 $604 $4 $5,130Charge-offs (1,123) (99) (1,222) (269) (5) (17) (291) (48) (1) (1,562)Recoveries 236 36 272 101 2 5 108 2 2 384Net charge-offs (887) (63) (950) (168) (3) (12) (183) (46) 1 (1,178)Provision (benefit) for loan and lease losses 972 99 1,071 214 (3) 18 229 171 (2) 1,469Allowance build (release) for loan and lease losses 85 36 121 46 (6) 6 46 125 (1) 291Other changes(2) — 10 10 — — — — (15) — (5)Balance as of March 31, 2016 3,440 345 3,785 772 64 78 914 714 3 5,416Reserve for unfunded lending commitments:                    Balance as of December 31, 2015 — — — — — 7 7 161 — 168Provision (benefit) for losses on unfunded lending commitments — — — — — 1 1 57 — 58Balance as of March 31, 2016 — — — — — 8 8 218 — 226Combined allowance and reserve as of March 31, 2016 $3,440 $345 $3,785 $772 $64 $86 $922 $932 $3 $5,642________(1)  Primarily consists of the legacy loan portfolio of our discontinued GreenPoint mortgage operations.

The increases were primarily driven by:•an allowance build in our domestic credit card loan portfolio due to increasing loss expectations on recent originations; and•an allowance build in our auto loan portfolio due to higher loss rates associated with growth, as well as further expected declines in used car auction prices.These increases were partially offset by:•an allowance release in our Commercial Banking business in the first quarter of 2017, reflecting improved portfolio performance in our oil and gas portfolio.LIQUIDITY RISK PROFILEWe have established liquidity practices that are intended to ensure that we have sufficient asset-based liquidity to withstand the potential impact of deposit attrition or diminished liquidity in the funding markets. Our practices are intended to maintain adequate liquidity reserves to cover our funding requirements as well as any potential deposit run-off and maintain access to diversified funding sources to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. Our liquidity reserves consist of readily-marketable or pledgable assets which can be used as a source of liquidity, if needed.Table 30 below presents the composition of our liquidity reserves as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.Table 30: Liquidity Reserves(Dollars in millions) March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016Cash and cash equivalents $9,315 $9,976Investment securities available for sale, at fair value 41,260 40,737Investment securities held to maturity, at fair value 26,657 26,196Total investment securities portfolio(1)(2) 67,917 66,933FHLB borrowing capacity secured by loans 22,553 24,078Outstanding FHLB advances and letters of credit secured by loans (2,879) (17,646)Investment securities encumbered for Public Funds and others (9,330) (9,265)Total liquidity reserves $87,576 $74,076__________(1) The weighted-average life of our securities was approximately 6.1 years and 6.0 years as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. 45Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents(2) As part of our liquidity management strategy, we pledge securities to secure borrowings from counterparties and to secure trust and public deposits and other purposes as required or permitted by law. We pledged securities available for sale with a fair value of $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. We also pledged securities held to maturity with a carrying value of $8.3 billion and $8.1 billion as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.Our liquidity reserves increased by $13.5 billion to $87.6 billion as of March 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016 primarily due to a reduction in our outstanding FHLB advances. See “MD&A—Risk Management” in our 2016 Form 10-K for additional information on our management of liquidity risk.We are subject to the Final Liquidity Coverage Ratio Rule (“Final LCR Rule”) issued by the Federal Banking Agencies. The Final LCR Rule came into effect in January 2015 and required us to calculate the LCR on a daily basis starting July 1, 2016. The minimum LCR standard was phased-in beginning January 1, 2015 and is at 100% as of January 1, 2017. At March 31, 2017, we exceeded the fully phased-in LCR requirement. The calculation and the underlying components are based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and are subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. See “Part I—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation” in our 2016 Form 10-K for additional information.Borrowing CapacityWe filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC on March 31, 2015, which expires in March 2018. Under this shelf registration, we may periodically offer and sell an indeterminate aggregate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units. There is no limit under this shelf registration to the amount or number of such securities that we may offer and sell, subject to market conditions. We also filed a new shelf registration statement with the SEC on January 12, 2016, which expires in January 2019 and allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $23 billion of securitized debt obligations from our credit card loan securitization trust.In addition to our issuance capacity under the shelf registration statements, we also have access to FHLB advances with a maximum borrowing capacity of $23.4 billion as of March 31, 2017, of which $20.5 billion was still available to us to borrow as of March 31, 2017. We pledged loan collateral with an outstanding balance of $27.7 billion to secure this borrowing capacity. The ability to draw down funding is based on membership status and the amount is dependent upon the Banks’ ability to post collateral. Our FHLB membership is secured by our investment in FHLB stock of $31 million and $760 million as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, which was determined in part based on our outstanding advances. We also have access to the Federal Reserve Discount Window through which we had a borrowing capacity of $7.2 billion as of March 31, 2017. Although available, we do not view this borrowing capacity as a primary source of liquidity and did not utilize it during 2016 or the first quarter of 2017.FundingThe Company’s primary source of funding comes from deposits, which provide us with a stable and relatively low cost of funds. In addition to deposits, the Company raises funding through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, FHLB advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios, the issuance of securitized debt obligations, the issuance of brokered deposits, federal funds purchased and other borrowings. A key objective in our use of these markets is to maintain access to a diversified mix of wholesale funding sources. 46Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsDepositsTable 31 provides the composition of deposits as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, as well as a comparison of average balances, interest expense and average deposits interest rates for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.Table 31: Deposits Composition and Average Deposits Interest Rates(Dollars in millions) March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016Non-interest-bearing deposits $26,364 $25,502Interest-bearing checking accounts(1) 46,010 45,820Saving deposits(2) 145,717 145,142Time deposits less than $100,000 19,340 16,949Total core deposits 237,431 233,413Time deposits of $100,000 or more 3,313 2,875Foreign deposits 438 480Total deposits $241,182 $236,768  Three Months Ended March 31,  2017 2016(Dollars in millions) AverageBalance InterestExpense AverageDepositsInterest Rate AverageBalance InterestExpense AverageDepositsInterest RateInterest-bearing checking accounts(1) $45,706 $54 0.48% $45,978 $55 0.48%Saving deposits(2) 145,496 225 0.63 134,677 191 0.57Time deposits less than $100,000 18,261 63 1.39 10,554 29 1.08Total interest-bearing core deposits 209,463 342 0.66 191,209 275 0.51Time deposits of $100,000 or more 3,026 11 1.42 2,212 7 1.39Foreign deposits 484 — 0.37 704 1 0.34Total interest-bearing deposits $212,973 $353 0.66 $194,125 $283 0.52__________(1) Includes Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (“NOW”) accounts.(2) Includes Money Market Deposit Accounts (“MMDA”).Our deposits include brokered deposits, which we obtained through the use of third-party intermediaries. Those brokered deposits are reported as interest-bearing checking, saving deposits and time deposits in the above table and totaled $20.6 billion and $22.5 billion as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.The FDIC limits the acceptance of brokered deposits by well-capitalized insured depository institutions and, with a waiver from the FDIC, by adequately-capitalized institutions. COBNA and CONA were well-capitalized, as defined under the federal banking regulatory guidelines, as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. See “Part I—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation” for additional information.Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term DebtWe access the capital markets to meet our funding needs through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations, and federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. In addition, we may utilize short-term and long-term FHLB advances secured by our investment securities, residential home loans, multifamily real estate loans, commercial real estate loans and home equity lines of credit. Substantially all of our long-term FHLB advances are structured with either a one-month or a three-month call option at our discretion.Our short-term borrowings include those borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less and do not include the current portion of long-term debt. The short-term borrowings, which consist of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, increased by $54 million to $1.0 billion as of March 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016.  47Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsOur long-term debt, which primarily consists of securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, and long-term FHLB advances, decreased by $12.1 billion to $47.4 billion as of March 31, 2017 from December 31, 2016, primarily attributable to a decrease in our FHLB advances outstanding, partially offset by an increase in our senior and subordinated notes.Credit RatingsOur credit ratings impact our ability to access capital markets and our borrowing costs. Rating agencies base their ratings on numerous factors, including liquidity, capital adequacy, asset quality, quality of earnings and the probability of systemic support. Significant changes in these factors could result in different ratings. Such ratings help to support our cost effective unsecured funding as part of our overall financing programs. Table 32 provides a summary of the credit ratings for the senior unsecured long-term debt of Capital One Financial Corporation, COBNA and CONA as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.Table 32: Senior Unsecured Long-Term Debt Credit Ratings  March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016  Capital OneFinancialCorporation COBNA CONA Capital OneFinancialCorporation COBNA CONAMoody’s Baa1 Baa1 Baa1 Baa1 Baa1 Baa1S&P BBB BBB+ BBB+ BBB BBB+ BBB+Fitch A- A- A- A- A- A-As of May 1, 2017, Moody’s, S&P and Fitch have us on a stable outlook.MARKET RISK PROFILEMarket risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities, including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and derivatives. Below we provide additional information about our primary sources of market risk, our market risk management strategies and the measures we use to evaluate our market risk exposure.Primary Market Risk ExposuresOur primary source of market risk is interest rate risk. We also have exposure to foreign exchange risk and customer-related trading risk, both of which we believe are minimal after considering the impact of our associated risk management activities discussed below.Interest Rate RiskInterest rate risk, which represents exposure to instruments whose yield or price varies with the volatility of interest rates, is our most significant source of market risk exposure. Banks are inevitably exposed to interest rate risk due to differences in the timing between the maturities or re-pricing of assets and liabilities.Foreign Exchange RiskForeign exchange risk represents exposure to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies. Our primary exposure to foreign exchange risk is related to the operations of our international businesses in the U.K. and Canada. The largest foreign exchange exposure arising from these operations is the funding they are provided in the Great British pound (“GBP”) and the Canadian dollar (“CAD”), respectively. We also have foreign exchange exposure through our net equity investments in these operations and through the dollar-denominated value of future earnings and cash flows they generate. Our intercompany funding exposes our consolidated statements of income to foreign exchange transaction risk, while our equity investments in our foreign operations result in translation risk in AOCI and our capital ratios. We manage our transaction risk by entering into forward foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to foreign currency-denominated intercompany borrowings. We use foreign currency derivative contracts as net investment hedges to manage  48Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contentsour AOCI exposure. We apply hedge accounting to both our intercompany funding hedges and our net investment hedges, with the primary net investments subject to hedging those denominated in GBP. The intercompany borrowings to our international businesses were 742 million GBP and 786 million GBP as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, and 5.8 billion CAD and 6.2 billion CAD as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. We hedge all the cash flows associated with these borrowings with forward foreign currency derivative contracts.In regard to our non-dollar-denominated equity, we measure our total exposure by regularly tracking the value of net equity invested in our foreign operations, the largest of which is in our U.K. and Canadian operations. Our measurement of net equity includes the impact of net investment hedges where applicable. We apply a 30% U.S. dollar appreciation shock against these net investment exposures, which we believe approximates a significant adverse foreign exchange movement over a one-year time horizon. Our gross equity exposures in our U.K. and Canadian operations were 1.4 billion GBP and 1.5 billion GBP as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, and 918 million CAD and 863 million CAD as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.As a result of our derivative management activities, we believe our net exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal.Customer-Related Trading RiskWe offer various interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity derivatives as an accommodation to our customers within our Commercial Banking business and offset the majority of these exposures through derivative transactions with other counterparties. These exposures are measured and monitored on a daily basis. As a result of offsetting our customer exposures with other counterparties, we believe our net exposure to customer-related trading risk is minimal.We employ value-at-risk (“VaR”) as the primary method to both measure and monitor the market risk in our customer-related trading activities. VaR is a statistical-based risk measure used to estimate the potential loss from adverse market movements in a normal market environment. We employ a historical simulation approach using the most recent 500 business days and use a 99 percent confidence level and a holding period of 1 business day. We use internal models to produce a daily VaR measure of the market risk of all customer-related trading exposures.For further information on our customer-related trading exposures, see “Note 9—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”Market Risk ManagementWe employ several techniques to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk, which include, but are not limited to, altering the duration and re-pricing characteristics of our various assets and liabilities through interest rate derivatives and mitigating the foreign exchange exposure of certain non-dollar-denominated equity or transactions through derivatives. Our current market risk management policies include the use of derivatives, which are one of the primary tools we use in managing interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We execute our derivative contracts in both over-the-counter (“OTC”) and exchange-traded derivative markets and have exposure to both bilateral and clearinghouse counterparties. Although the majority of our derivatives are interest rate swaps, we also use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage both our interest rate and foreign currency risk. The outstanding notional amount of our derivative contracts increased to $155.1 billion as of March 31, 2017 from $142.9 billion as of December 31, 2016 primarily driven by an increase in our hedging activities.Market Risk MeasurementWe have risk management policies and limits established by our market risk management policies and approved by the Board of Directors. Our objective is to manage our asset and liability risk position and exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and prescribed limits based on prevailing market conditions and long-term expectations. Because no single measure can reflect all aspects of market risk, we use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analysis to measure, assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our non-dollar-denominated earnings and non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations. We provide additional information below in “Economic Value of Equity.”We consider the impact on both net interest income and economic value of equity in measuring and managing our interest rate risk. We use a 50 basis points decrease as our declining interest rate scenario, since a scenario where interest rates would decline by 200 basis points is unlikely. In scenarios where a 50 basis points decline would result in a rate less than 0%, we assume a rate of 0%. Below we discuss the assumptions used in calculating each of these measures.  49Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsNet Interest Income SensitivityThis sensitivity measure estimates the impact on our projected 12-month base-line interest rate-sensitive revenue resulting from movements in interest rates. Interest rate-sensitive revenue consists of net interest income and certain components of other non-interest income significantly impacted by movements in interest rates, including changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and free-standing interest rate swaps. Adjusted net interest income consists of net interest income and changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, including related derivative hedging activity, and changes in the fair value of free-standing interest rate swaps. In addition to our existing assets and liabilities, we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions, such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, and plans for projected changes in our funding mix in our baseline forecast. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our projected interest rate-sensitive revenue, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates of +200 basis points, +100 basis points, +50 basis points and -50 basis points to spot rates, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above. At the current level of interest rates, we are asset sensitive in the +50 and +100 basis points scenarios and liability sensitive in the +200 basis points scenario. The switch to liability sensitivity in the +200 basis points scenario compared with the +100 basis points scenario is mainly driven by the assumption that deposit repricing increases with higher interest rates.Economic Value of EquityOur economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact on the net present value of our assets and liabilities, including derivative hedging activity, resulting from movements in interest rates. Our economic value of equity sensitivity measures are calculated based on our existing assets and liabilities, including derivatives, and do not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected plans for funding mix changes. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our economic value of equity, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates of +200 basis points, +100 basis points, +50 basis points and -50 basis points to spot rates, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above.Calculating our economic value of equity and its sensitivity to interest rates requires projecting cash flows for assets, liabilities and derivative instruments and discounting those cash flows at the appropriate discount rates. Key assumptions in our economic value of equity calculation include projecting rate sensitive prepayments for mortgage securities, loans and other assets, term structure modeling of interest rates, discount spreads, and deposit volume and pricing assumptions.Our current economic value of equity sensitivity profile demonstrates that our economic value of equity generally decreases as interest rates increase indicating that the economic value of our assets and derivative positions is more sensitive to interest rate changes than our liabilities.Table 33 shows the estimated percentage impact on our projected base-line net interest income and economic value of equity calculated under the methodology described above as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Our base-line net interest income sensitivity and economic value of equity were largely unchanged as compared to December 31, 2016.Table 33: Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis  March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016Estimated impact on projected base-line net interest income:    +200 basis points (0.4)% (0.1)%+100 basis points 0.3 0.5+50 basis points 0.2 0.4–50 basis points (0.6) (1.0)Estimated impact on economic value of equity:    +200 basis points (9.7) (9.6)+100 basis points (4.0) (3.8)+50 basis points (1.6) (1.5)–50 basis points 0.6 0.5In addition to these industry standard measures, we will continue to factor into our internal interest rate risk management decisions the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios, such as stressed rate shocks as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios. 50Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsLimitations of Market Risk MeasuresThe interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information, internally-developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies, which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments. Other market inputs, such as interest rates, market prices and interest rate volatility, are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures. We regularly evaluate, update and enhance these assumptions, models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities.There are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. The sensitivity analysis described above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is performed at a particular point in time based on the existing balance sheet and, in some cases, expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions. The strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections, which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ substantially from the above sensitivity analysis. 51Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsSUPERVISION AND REGULATIONWe provide information on our Supervision and Regulation in our 2016 Form 10-K under “Part I—Item 1.

Interest rate swaps are the most common type of derivative contract that we use in our asset/liability management activities.Investment grade: Represents Moody’s long-term rating of Baa3 or better; and/or a Standard & Poor’s, Fitch or DBRS long-term rating of BBB- or better; or if unrated, an equivalent rating using our internal risk ratings. Instruments that fall below these levels are considered to be non-investment grade.Investments in qualified affordable housing projects: Capital One invests in private investment funds that make equity investments in multifamily affordable housing properties that provide affordable housing tax credits for these investments. The activities of these entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt.Investor entities: Entities that invest in community development entities (“CDE”) that provide debt financing to businesses and non-profit entities in low-income and rural communities.Leverage ratio: Tier 1 capital divided by average assets after certain adjustments, as defined by the regulators.  57Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsLiquidity risk: The risk that the Company will not be able to meet its future financial obligations as they come due, or invest in future asset growth because of an inability to obtain funds at a reasonable price within a reasonable time period.Loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio: The relationship expressed as a percentage, between the principal amount of a loan and the appraised value of the collateral (i.e., residential real estate, autos, etc.) securing the loan.Managed presentation: A non-GAAP presentation of financial results that includes reclassifications to present revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure at the segment level, because it believes this provides information to enable investors to understand the underlying operational performance and trends of the particular business segment and facilitates a comparison of the business segment with the performance of competitors.Market risk: The risk that an institution’s earnings or the economic value of equity could be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates or other market factors.Master netting agreement: An agreement between two counterparties that have multiple contracts with each other that provides for the net settlement of all contracts through a single payment in the event of default or termination of any one contract.Mortgage-backed security (“MBS”): An asset-backed security whose cash flows are backed by the principal and interest payments of a set of mortgage loans.Mortgage servicing rights (“MSR”): The right to service a mortgage loan when the underlying loan is sold or securitized. Servicing includes collections for principal, interest and escrow payments from borrowers and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors.Net interest margin: The result of dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets.Nonperforming loans and leases: Loans and leases that have been placed on non-accrual status.North Fork: North Fork Bancorporation, Inc., which was acquired by the Company in 2006.Operational risk: The risk of loss, capital impairment, adverse customer experience or reputational impact resulting from failure to comply with policies and procedures, failed internal processes or systems, or from external events.Option-ARM loans: The option-ARM real estate loan product is an adjustable-rate mortgage loan that initially provides the borrower with the monthly option to make a fully-amortizing, interest-only or minimum fixed payment. After the initial payment option period, usually five years, the recalculated minimum payment represents a fully-amortizing principal and interest payment that would effectively repay the loan by the end of its contractual term.Other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”): An impairment charge taken on a security whose fair value has fallen below the carrying value on the balance sheet and whose value is not expected to recover through the holding period of the security.Purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) loans: Refers to the loans acquired in a business combination that were recorded at fair value at acquisition and subsequently accounted for based on cash flows expected to be collected in accordance with ASC 310-30, Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality (formerly known as “Statement of Position 03-3, Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer,” commonly referred to as “SOP 03-3”). Acquired loans are considered PCI loans if they have a discount attributable, at least in part, to credit deterioration and they are not specifically scoped out of this guidance. Our PCI loans include a limited portion of commercial loans acquired in the HFS acquisition and the substantial majority of consumer and commercial loans acquired in the ING Direct and Chevy Chase acquisitions.The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the estimated fair value of purchased loans represents the accretable yield, which is recognized into interest income over the life of the loans. The difference between total contractual payments on the loans and all expected cash flows represents the nonaccretable difference or the amount of principal and interest not considered collectible, which incorporates future expected credit losses over the life of the loans. Decreases in expected cash flows from credit deterioration subsequent to acquisition will generally result in an impairment charge recognized in our provision for credit losses and an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses. Charge-offs are not recorded until the expected credit losses within the nonaccretable difference are depleted. PCI loans are not classified as delinquent or nonperforming as we expect to collect our net investment in these loans and the nonaccretable difference will absorb the majority of the losses associated with these loans. In addition, PCI loans are excluded from impaired loans because the applicable accounting methodology takes into consideration expected future credit losses.Public Fund deposits: Deposits that are derived from a variety of political subdivisions such as school districts and municipalities. Purchase volume: Dollar amount of customer purchases, net of returns. 58Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsRating agency: An independent agency that assesses the credit quality and likelihood of default of an issue or issuer and assigns a rating to that issue or issuer.Recorded investment: The amount of the investment in a loan which includes any direct write-down of the investment.Repurchase agreement: An instrument used to raise short-term funds whereby securities are sold with an agreement for the seller to buy back the securities at a later date. Restructuring charges: Charges typically from the consolidation or relocation of operations, and reductions in work force.Return on average assets: Calculated based on income from continuing operations, net of tax, for the period divided by average total assets for the period.Return on average common equity: Calculated based on the sum of (i) income from continuing operations, net of tax; (ii) less dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities; (iii) less preferred stock dividends, for the period, divided by average common equity. Our calculation of return on average common equity may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.Return on average tangible common equity: A non-GAAP financial measure calculated based on the sum of (i) income from continuing operations, net of tax; (ii) less dividends and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities; and (iii) less preferred stock dividends, for the period, divided by average tangible common equity. Our calculation of return on average tangible common equity may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.Risk-weighted assets: Consist of on- and off-balance sheet assets that are assigned to one of several broad risk categories and weighted by factors representing their risk and potential for default. Securitized debt obligations: A type of asset-backed security and structured credit product constructed from a portfolio of fixed-income assets.Small-ticket commercial real estate: Our small-ticket commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly low- or no-documentation loans with balances generally less than $2 million. This portfolio was originated on a national basis through a broker network and is in a run-off mode.Subprime: For purposes of lending in our Credit Card business we generally consider FICO scores of 660 or below, or other equivalent risk scores, to be subprime. For purposes of auto lending in our Consumer Banking business we generally consider FICO scores of 620 or below to be subprime.Tangible common equity (“TCE”): A non-GAAP financial measure. Common equity less goodwill and intangible assets adjusted for deferred tax liabilities associated with non-tax deductible intangible assets and tax deductible goodwill.Troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”): A TDR is deemed to occur when the Company modifies the contractual terms of a loan agreement by granting a concession to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty.U.K. PPI Reserve: U.K. payment protection insurance customer refund reserve.U.S. GAAP: Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Accounting rules and conventions defining acceptable practices in preparing financial statements in the U.S.Unfunded commitments: Legally binding agreements to provide a defined level of financing until a specified future date.Variable interest entity (“VIE”): An entity that (i) lacks enough equity investment at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support from other parties; (ii) has equity owners that lack the right to make significant decisions affecting the entity’s operations; and/or (iii) has equity owners that do not have an obligation to absorb or the right to receive the entity’s losses or return. 59Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsAcronymsABS: Asset-backed securityAFS: Available for saleAML: Anti-money launderingAOCI: Accumulated other comprehensive incomeARM: Adjustable rate mortgageASC: Accounting Standards CodificationASU: Accounting Standards UpdateBHC: Bank holding companyBMA: Bank Merger Actbps: Basis pointsCAD: Canadian dollarCCAR: Comprehensive Capital Analysis and ReviewCCP: Central Counterparty Clearinghouse, or Central ClearinghouseCDE: Community development entitiesCECL: Current expected credit lossCEO: Chief Executive OfficerCIFG: CIFG Assurance North America, Inc.

Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through branches, the internet and other distribution channels. As of March 31, 2017, our principal subsidiaries included:•Capital One Bank (USA), National Association (“COBNA”), which offers credit and debit card products, other lending products and deposit products; and•Capital One, National Association (“CONA”), which offers a broad spectrum of banking products and financial services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients.The Company is hereafter collectively referred to as “we,” “us” or “our.” COBNA and CONA are collectively referred to as the “Banks.”We also offer products outside of the United States of America (“U.S.”) principally through Capital One (Europe) plc (“COEP”), an indirect subsidiary of COBNA organized and located in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), and through a branch of COBNA in Canada. COEP has authority, among other things, to provide credit card loans. Our branch of COBNA in Canada also has the authority to provide credit card loans.Our principal operations are currently organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. We provide details on our business segments, the integration of recent acquisitions, if any, into our business segments and the allocation methodologies and accounting policies used to derive our business segment results in “Note 13—Business Segments.”Basis of Presentation and Use of EstimatesThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and in the related disclosures. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. While management makes its best judgment, actual amounts or results could differ from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included for a fair statement of this interim financial information. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Capital One Financial Corporation and all other entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. We determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity (“VIE”). All significant intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated.Newly Adopted Accounting StandardsRestricted CashIn November 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued revised guidance that requires restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents to be included within beginning and ending total cash amounts reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Disclosure of the nature of the restrictions on cash balances is required under the guidance. We have elected to early adopt the guidance retrospectively effective as of January 1, 2017. Upon adoption, changes in restricted cash, which had previously been presented as financing activities, are now included within beginning and ending Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for securitization investors balance.The Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for securitization investors balances presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows are comprised of the amounts captioned on the consolidated balance sheets as Total cash and cash equivalents and Restricted cash for securitization investors. Improvements to Employee Share-Based AccountingIn March 2016, the FASB issued revised guidance for accounting for employee share-based payments. The guidance requires that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies that pertain to employee stock-based incentive payments be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of income, rather than within additional paid-in capital; and that excess tax benefits be classified as an operating activity rather than financing activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The guidance also permits an accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur. We adopted the guidance effective in the first quarter of 2017 on a prospective basis related to recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies in the consolidated statements of income and presentation of excess tax benefits in the consolidated statements of cash flows. In addition, we made an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures of awards as they occur and applied a modified retrospective transition method. Our adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.Recently Issued but Not Yet Adopted Accounting Standards Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt SecuritiesIn March 2017, the FASB issued revised guidance to shorten the amortization period to the earliest call date for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium. There is no change for accounting for securities held at a discount. Under the existing guidance, the premium is generally amortized as an adjustment to interest income over the contractual life of the debt security. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. This guidance is effective for us on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted, through a modified retrospective method.Simplifying the Test for Goodwill ImpairmentIn January 2017, the FASB issued revised guidance which is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of goodwill for impairment by eliminating the second step from the current goodwill impairment test. Under the existing guidance, step one compares an entity’s reporting unit’s carrying value to its fair value. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, an entity then performs step two, which assigns the fair value across its assets and liabilities, including unrecognized assets and liabilities, following a procedure required in purchase accounting. Under the new guidance, the impairment to a reporting unit’s goodwill is determined based on the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. This impairment method applies to all reporting units, including those with zero or negative carrying amounts of net assets. The guidance is effective for us on January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. We are currently assessing whether, or when, we might early adopt the standard.Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial InstrumentsIn June 2016, the FASB issued revised guidance for impairments on financial instruments. The guidance requires an impairment model (known as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model) that is based on expected rather than incurred losses, with an anticipated result of more timely loss recognition. The CECL model is applicable to loans held for investment, securities held to maturity, lease receivables, financial guarantee contracts and certain unconditional loan commitments. The CECL model will replace our current accounting for purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) and impaired loans. The guidance also amends the available for sale (“AFS”) debt securities other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) model. Credit losses (and subsequent recoveries) on AFS debt securities will be recorded through an allowance approach, rather than the current U.S. GAAP practice of permanent write-downs for credit losses and accreting positive changes through interest income over time. This guidance will be effective for us on January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted no earlier than January 1, 2019. We are currently assessing the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements; however, due to the significant differences in the revised guidance from existing GAAP, the implementation of this guidance may result in material changes in our accounting for credit losses on financial instruments.LeasesIn February 2016, the FASB issued revised guidance for leases. The guidance requires lessees to recognize right of use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements for all leases, with certain practical expedients. This will be effective for us on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We plan to adopt the standard on the effective date. We are currently assessing the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements; however, we expect our total assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet to increase.Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesIn January 2016, the FASB issued revised guidance for the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The main provisions of the guidance include, (i) most equity investments are to be measured at fair value and recorded through net income, except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that do not have a readily determinable fair value (for which a practical expedient can be elected); (ii) the use of the exit price notion is required when valuing financial instruments for disclosure purposes; (iii) an entity shall present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability under fair value option resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk; (iv) the determination of the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities must be made in combination with other deferred tax assets. The guidance eliminates the current classifications of equity securities as trading or available-for-sale and will require separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by category and form of the financial assets on the face of the consolidated balance sheets or within the accompanying notes. The guidance also eliminates the requirement to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet. The guidance will be effective January 1, 2018. Early adoption is only permitted for the requirement to present the portion of the total change in fair value attributable to a change in the instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. We plan on adopting the guidance effective January 1, 2018, and do not expect the guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.Revenue from Contracts with CustomersIn May 2014, the FASB issued revised guidance for the recognition, measurement and disclosure of revenue from contracts with customers. The original guidance has been amended through subsequent accounting standard updates that resulted in technical corrections, improvements, and a one-year deferral of the effective date to January 1, 2018. The guidance, as amended, is applicable to all entities and, once effective, will replace significant portions of existing industry and transaction-specific revenue recognition rules with a more principles-based recognition model. Most revenue associated with financial instruments, including interest income, loan origination fees and credit card fees, is outside the scope of the guidance. Gains and losses on investment securities, derivatives and sales of financial instruments are similarly excluded from the scope. Entities can elect to adopt the guidance either on a full or modified retrospective basis. Full retrospective adoption will require a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. Modified retrospective adoption will require a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the entity first applies the new guidance. We plan to adopt this guidance on the effective date, January 1, 2018. We do not expect the guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets, results of operations or cash flows. However, we are still assessing whether our current income statement presentation of certain credit card-related activities will be impacted by this new guidance.  68Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE 2—DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSOur discontinued operations consist of the mortgage origination operations of our wholesale mortgage banking unit, GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, Inc. (“GreenPoint”) and the manufactured housing operations of GreenPoint Credit, LLC, a subsidiary of GreenPoint, both of which were acquired as part of the North Fork Bancorporation, Inc. (“North Fork”) acquisition in December 2006. Although the manufactured housing operations were sold to a third party in 2004 prior to our acquisition of North Fork, we acquired certain retained interests and obligations related to those operations as part of the acquisition. Separately, in the third quarter of 2007 we closed the mortgage origination operations of the wholesale mortgage banking unit. The results of both the wholesale banking unit and the manufactured housing operations have been accounted for as discontinued operations and are reported as income or loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, on the consolidated statements of income. We have no significant continuing involvement in these operations.The following table summarizes the results from discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016:Table 2.1: Results of Discontinued Operations   Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2017 2016Income (loss) from discontinued operations before income taxes $24 $(8)Income tax provision (benefit) 9 (3)Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax $15 $(5)The discontinued mortgage origination operations of our wholesale mortgage banking unit had remaining assets primarily consisting of a deferred tax asset related to the reserve for representations and warranties on loans previously sold to third parties. We also have contingent obligations to exercise certain mandatory clean-up calls associated with securitization transactions undertaken by the discontinued GreenPoint Credit, LLC manufactured housing operations in the event the third party servicer does not fulfill its obligation to exercise these clean-up calls. See “Note 6—Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations” and “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others” for information on the reserve related to our retained interests and obligations associated with GreenPoint Credit, LLC manufactured housing operations and the reserves we have established for our mortgage representation and warranty exposure. 69Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE 3—INVESTMENT SECURITIESOur investment portfolio consists primarily of the following: U.S. Treasury securities; U.S. government-sponsored enterprise or agency (“Agency”) and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”); Agency and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”); other asset-backed securities (“ABS”); and other securities.

As of March 31, 2017, our investments in non-agency RMBS and CMBS, other ABS and other securities accounted for $18 million, or 4%, of total gross unrealized losses on securities available for sale. As of March 31, 2017, the carrying value of approximately 170 securities classified as held to maturity exceeded their fair value by $185 million. Gross unrealized losses on our investment securities have decreased since December 31, 2016. The unrealized losses related to investment securities for which we have not recognized credit impairment were primarily attributable to changes in market interest rates. As discussed in more detail below, we conduct periodic reviews of all investment securities with unrealized losses to assess whether impairment is other-than-temporary. Maturities and Yields of Investment SecuritiesThe following tables summarize the remaining scheduled contractual maturities, assuming no prepayments, of our investment securities as of March 31, 2017.Table 3.5: Contractual Maturities of Securities Available for Sale March 31, 2017 (Dollars in millions) Amortized Cost Fair ValueDue in 1 year or less $646 $647Due after 1 year through 5 years 3,112 3,132Due after 5 years through 10 years 6,602 6,589Due after 10 years(1) 30,851 30,892Total $41,211 $41,260__________(1) Investments with no stated maturities, which consist of equity securities, are included with contractual maturities due after 10 years.Table 3.6: Contractual Maturities of Securities Held to Maturity  March 31, 2017 (Dollars in millions) Carrying Value Fair ValueDue after 1 year through 5 years $343 $349Due after 5 years through 10 years 1,217 1,270Due after 10 years 24,610 25,038Total $26,170 $26,657Because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay certain obligations, the expected maturities of our securities are likely to differ from the scheduled contractual maturities presented above.  73Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe table below summarizes, by major security type, the expected maturities and weighted-average yields of our investment securities as of March 31, 2017.

Our OTTI assessment is based on a discounted cash flow analysis which requires careful use of judgments and assumptions. A number of qualitative and quantitative criteria may be considered in our assessment as applicable, including the size and the nature of the portfolio; historical and projected performance such as prepayment, default and loss severity for the RMBS portfolio; recent credit events specific to the issuer and/or industry to which the issuer belongs; the payment structure of the security; external credit ratings of the issuer and any failure or delay of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments; the value of underlying collateral; our intent and ability to hold the security; and current and projected market and macro-economic conditions.If we intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, the entire difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and its fair value is recognized in earnings. As of March 31, 2017, for any securities with unrealized losses recorded in AOCI, we do not intend to sell, nor believe that we will be required to sell, these securities prior to recovery of their amortized cost. 74Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFor those securities that we do not intend to sell nor expect to be required to sell, an analysis is performed to determine if any of the impairment is due to credit-related factors or whether it is due to other factors, such as interest rates. Credit-related impairment is recognized in earnings, with the remaining unrealized non-credit-related impairment recorded in AOCI. We determine the credit component based on the difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected cash flows, discounted based on the effective yield.The table below presents a rollforward of the credit-related OTTI recognized in earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 on investment securities for which we had no intent to sell.Table 3.8: Credit Impairment Rollforward  Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2017 2016Credit loss component, beginning of period $207 $199Additions:    Subsequent credit impairment 0 6Total additions 0 6Reductions due to payoffs, disposals, transfers and other (1) (1)Credit loss component, end of period $206 $204Realized Gains and Losses on Securities and OTTI Recognized in EarningsThe following table presents the gross realized gains and losses on the sale and redemption of securities available for sale, and the OTTI losses recognized in earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.

Credit card loans consist of domestic and international credit card loans. Consumer banking loans consist of auto, home and retail banking loans. Commercial banking loans consist of commercial and multifamily real estate, commercial and industrial, and small-ticket commercial real estate loans.Our portfolio of loans held for investment also includes certain consumer and commercial loans acquired through business combinations that were recorded at fair value at acquisition and subsequently accounted for based on cash flows expected to be collected, which are referred to as PCI loans. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2016 Form 10-K for additional information on the accounting guidance for these loans.Credit QualityWe closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to manage and evaluate our exposure to credit risk. Trends in delinquency rates are an indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk within our loan portfolio. The level of nonperforming loans represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. Accordingly, key metrics we track and use in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming loan rates, as well as net charge-off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger balance commercial loans. The table below presents the composition and an aging analysis of our loans held for investment portfolio as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The delinquency aging includes all past due loans, both performing and nonperforming.Table 4.1: Loan Portfolio Composition and Aging Analysis  March 31, 2017(Dollars in millions) Current 30-59Days 60-89Days > 90Days TotalDelinquentLoans PCILoans TotalLoansCredit Card:              Domestic credit card $87,716 $945 $711 $1,720 $3,376 $0 $91,092International card businesses 7,816 114 70 121 305 0 8,121Total credit card 95,532 1,059 781 1,841 3,681 0 99,213Consumer Banking:              Auto 47,092 1,846 662 171 2,679 0 49,771Home loan 7,069 33 16 136 185 13,484 20,738Retail banking 3,409 15 8 17 40 24 3,473Total consumer banking 57,570 1,894 686 324 2,904 13,508 73,982Commercial Banking:              Commercial and multifamily real estate 27,152 9 0 26 35 31 27,218Commercial and industrial 38,677 70 14 314 398 563 39,638Total commercial lending 65,829 79 14 340 433 594 66,856Small-ticket commercial real estate 456 1 1 6 8 0 464Total commercial banking 66,285 80 15 346 441 594 67,320Other loans 64 3 2 4 9 0 73Total loans(1) $219,451 $3,036 $1,484 $2,515 $7,035 $14,102 $240,588% of Total loans 91.21% 1.26% 0.62% 1.04% 2.92% 5.87% 100.00%   76Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  December 31, 2016(Dollars in millions) Current 30-59Days 60-89Days > 90Days TotalDelinquentLoans PCI Loans TotalLoansCredit Card:              Domestic credit card $93,279 $1,153 $846 $1,840 $3,839 $2 $97,120International card businesses 8,115 124 72 121 317 0 8,432Total credit card 101,394 1,277 918 1,961 4,156 2 105,552Consumer Banking:              Auto 44,762 2,041 890 223 3,154 0 47,916Home loan 6,951 44 20 141 205 14,428 21,584Retail banking 3,477 22 7 20 49 28 3,554Total consumer banking 55,190 2,107 917 384 3,408 14,456 73,054Commercial Banking:              Commercial and multifamily real estate 26,536 45 0 0 45 28 26,609Commercial and industrial 38,831 27 84 297 408 585 39,824Total commercial lending 65,367 72 84 297 453 613 66,433Small-ticket commercial real estate 473 7 1 2 10 0 483Total commercial banking 65,840 79 85 299 463 613 66,916Other loans 56 3 0 5 8 0 64Total loans(1) $222,480 $3,466 $1,920 $2,649 $8,035 $15,071 $245,586% of Total loans 90.59% 1.41% 0.78% 1.08% 3.27% 6.14% 100.00%__________(1) Loans (other than PCI loans) include unearned income, unamortized premiums and discounts, and unamortized deferred fees and costs totaling $598 million and $558 million as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.We pledge loan collateral at the FHLB to secure borrowing capacity.

PCI loans are excluded from loans reported as 90 days or more past due and accruing interest as well as nonperforming loans. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2016 Form 10-K for additional information on our policies for nonperforming loans.Credit CardOur credit card loan portfolio is highly diversified across millions of accounts and numerous geographies without significant individual exposure. We therefore generally manage credit risk on a portfolio basis. The risk in our credit card loan portfolio correlates to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates and home values, as well as consumers’ financial condition, all of which can have a material effect on credit performance. The primary indicators we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our credit card portfolio are delinquency and charge-off trends, including an analysis of loan migration between delinquency categories over time.The table below displays the geographic profile of our credit card loan portfolio as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

Net charge-offs and the net charge-off rate are impacted periodically by fluctuations in recoveries, including loan sales.Consumer BankingOur consumer banking loan portfolio consists of auto, home and retail banking loans. Similar to our credit card loan portfolio, the risk in our consumer banking loan portfolio correlates to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates, gross domestic product (“GDP”) and home values, as well as consumers’ financial condition, all of which can have a material effect on credit performance. Delinquency, nonperforming loans and charge-off trends are key indicators we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our consumer banking loan portfolio.

In evaluating the credit quality and risk of our home loan portfolio, we continually monitor a variety of mortgage loan characteristics that may affect the default experience on this loan portfolio, such as vintage, geographic concentrations, lien priority and product type. Certain loan concentrations have experienced higher delinquency rates as a result of the significant decline in home prices after the peak in 2006 and subsequent rise in unemployment. These loan concentrations include loans originated between 2006 and 2008 in an environment of decreasing home sales, broadly declining home prices and more relaxed underwriting standards.

We assign internal risk ratings to loans based on relevant information about the ability of the borrowers to repay their debt. In determining the risk rating of a particular loan, some of the factors considered are the borrower’s current financial condition, historical and projected future credit performance, prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors, the estimated realizable value of any collateral and current economic trends. The scale based on our internal risk rating system is as follows:•Noncriticized: Loans that have not been designated as criticized, frequently referred to as “pass” loans.•Criticized performing: Loans in which the financial condition of the obligor is stressed, affecting earnings, cash flows or collateral values. The borrower currently has adequate capacity to meet near-term obligations; however, the stress, left unabated, may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects at some future date.•Criticized nonperforming: Loans that are not adequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as criticized nonperforming have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, which jeopardize the full repayment of the debt. These loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain a credit loss if the deficiencies are not corrected and are generally placed on nonaccrual status.We use our internal risk rating system for regulatory reporting, determining the frequency of credit exposure reviews, and evaluating and determining the allowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans. Loans of $1 million or more that are designated as criticized performing and criticized nonperforming are reviewed quarterly by management to determine if they are appropriately classified/rated and whether any impairment exists. Noncriticized loans greater than $1 million are specifically reviewed, at least annually, to determine the appropriate risk rating. In addition, we evaluate the risk rating during the renewal process of any loan or if a loan becomes past due.The following table presents the geographic distribution and internal risk ratings of our commercial loan portfolio as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.Table 4.8: Commercial Banking Risk Profile by Geographic Region and Internal Risk Rating  March 31, 2017(Dollars in millions) CommercialandMultifamilyReal Estate % ofTotal(1) CommercialandIndustrial % ofTotal(1) Small-ticketCommercialReal Estate % ofTotal(1)  TotalCommercial Banking % ofTotal(1) Geographic concentration:(2)                Northeast $15,580 57.2% $9,444 23.8% $286 61.6% $25,310 37.6%Mid-Atlantic 3,260 12.0 3,800 9.6 16 3.5 7,076 10.5South 3,917 14.4 14,934 37.7 32 6.9 18,883 28.1Other 4,461 16.4 11,460 28.9 130 28.0 16,051 23.8Total $27,218 100.0% $39,638 100.0% $464 100.0% $67,320 100.0%Internal risk rating:(3)                Noncriticized $26,881 98.8% $36,054 91.0% $455 98.1% $63,390 94.2%Criticized performing 271 1.0 2,220 5.6 1 0.2 2,492 3.7Criticized nonperforming 35 0.1 801 2.0 8 1.7 844 1.2PCI loans 31 0.1 563 1.4 0 0.0 594 0.9Total $27,218 100.0% $39,638 100.0% $464 100.0% $67,320 100.0% 83Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  December 31, 2016(Dollars in millions) CommercialandMultifamilyReal Estate % ofTotal(1) CommercialandIndustrial % ofTotal(1) Small-ticketCommercialReal Estate % ofTotal(1)  TotalCommercial Banking % ofTotal(1) Geographic concentration:(2)                Northeast $15,714 59.0% $9,628 24.2% $298 61.7% $25,640 38.3%Mid-Atlantic 3,024 11.4 3,450 8.7 16 3.3 6,490 9.7South 4,032 15.2 15,193 38.1 34 7.0 19,259 28.8Other 3,839 14.4 11,553 29.0 135 28.0 15,527 23.2Total $26,609 100.0% $39,824 100.0% $483 100.0% $66,916 100.0%Internal risk rating:(3)                Noncriticized $26,309 98.9% $36,046 90.5% $473 97.9% $62,828 93.9%Criticized performing 242 0.9 2,205 5.5 6 1.3 2,453 3.7Criticized nonperforming 30 0.1 988 2.5 4 0.8 1,022 1.5PCI loans 28 0.1 585 1.5 0 0.0 613 0.9Total $26,609 100.0% $39,824 100.0% $483 100.0% $66,916 100.0%__________(1) Percentages calculated based on total loans held for investment in each respective loan category using period-end amounts.(2) Geographic concentration is generally determined by the location of the borrower’s business or the location of the collateral associated with the loan.

Some loans may receive more than one type of concession as part of the modification.(3) Represents percentage of loans modified in TDRs during the period that were granted a reduced interest rate.(4) Due to multiple concessions granted to some troubled borrowers, percentages may total more than 100% for certain loan types.(5) Represents weighted average interest rate reduction for those loans that received an interest rate concession.(6) Represents percentage of loans modified in TDRs during the period that were granted a maturity date extension.(7) Represents weighted average change in maturity date for those loans that received a maturity date extension.(8) Represents percentage of loans modified in TDRs during the period that were granted forgiveness or forbearance of a portion of their balance.(9) Represents the gross balance forgiven. For loans modified in bankruptcy, the gross balance reduction represents collateral value write-downs associated with the discharge of the borrower’s obligations.TDR—Subsequent Defaults of Completed TDR ModificationsThe following table presents the type, number and recorded investment amount of loans modified in TDRs that experienced a default during the period and had completed a modification event in the twelve months prior to the default. A default occurs if the loan is either 90 days or more delinquent, has been charged off as of the end of the period presented or has been reclassified from accrual to nonaccrual status. 87Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSTable 4.11: TDR—Subsequent Defaults  Three Months Ended March 31,  2017 2016(Dollars in millions) Number ofContracts Amount Number ofContracts AmountCredit Card:        Domestic credit card 12,805 $26 10,594 $18International card businesses(1) 11,425 16 8,813 20Total credit card 24,230 42 19,407 38Consumer Banking:        Auto 2,179 25 1,852 21Home loan 11 3 10 1Retail banking 11 1 15 2Total consumer banking 2,201 29 1,877 24Commercial Banking:        Commercial and multifamily real estate 0 0 0 0Commercial and industrial 14 19 17 23Total commercial lending 14 19 17 23Small-ticket commercial real estate 1 1 0 0Total commercial banking 15 20 17 23Total 26,446 $91 21,301 $85__________(1) In the U.K., regulators require the acceptance of payment plan proposals in which the modified payments may be less than the contractual minimum amount. As a result, loans entering long-term TDR payment programs in the U.K. typically continue to age and ultimately charge off even when fully in compliance with the TDR program terms.PCI Loans Outstanding Balance and Carrying Value of PCI LoansThe table below presents the outstanding balance and the carrying value of PCI loans as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments, such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments. The provision for losses on unfunded lending commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income and the related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.

The component of the allowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans that we collectively evaluate for impairment is based on historical loss experience for loans with similar characteristics and consideration of credit quality supplemented by management judgment and interpretation.(2) The asset-specific component of the allowance for loan and lease losses for smaller-balance impaired loans is calculated on a pool basis using historical loss experience for the respective class of assets. The asset-specific component of the allowance for loan and lease losses for larger-balance commercial loans is individually calculated for each loan.(3) The PCI loans component of the allowance for loan and lease losses is accounted for based on expected cash flows. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2016 Form 10-K for details on these loans.(4) Allowance coverage ratio is calculated by dividing the period-end allowance for loan and lease losses by period-end loans held for investment within the specified loan category.We have certain credit card partnership arrangements in which our partner agrees to share a portion of the credit losses associated with the partnership that qualify for net accounting treatment. The expected reimbursements from these partners, which are netted against our allowance for loan and lease losses, result in reductions to reported net charge-offs and provision for credit losses.

Our primary involvement with VIEs has been related to our securitization transactions in which we transferred assets from our balance sheet to securitization trusts. We have primarily securitized credit card and home loans, which have provided a source of funding for us and enabled us to transfer a certain portion of the economic risk of the loans or related debt securities to third parties.The entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is referred to as the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE. The majority of the VIEs in which we are involved have been consolidated in our financial statements.Summary of Consolidated and Unconsolidated VIEsThe assets of our consolidated VIEs primarily consist of cash, credit card loan receivables and the related allowance for loan and lease losses, which we report on our consolidated balance sheets under restricted cash, loans held in consolidated trust, and allowance for loan and lease losses, respectively. The assets of a particular VIE are the primary source of funding to settle its obligations. The creditors of the VIEs typically do not have recourse to the general credit of the Company. The liabilities primarily consist of debt securities issued by the VIEs, which we report under securitized debt obligations. For unconsolidated VIEs, we present the carrying amount of assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets and our maximum exposure to loss. Our maximum exposure to loss is estimated based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and we are required to meet our maximum remaining funding obligations.The table below presents a summary of certain VIEs in which we had continuing involvement or held a variable interest, aggregated based on VIEs with similar characteristics as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. We separately present information for consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs.Table 6.1: Carrying Amount of Consolidated and Unconsolidated VIEs  March 31, 2017  Consolidated Unconsolidated(Dollars in millions) CarryingAmountof Assets CarryingAmount ofLiabilities CarryingAmountof Assets CarryingAmount ofLiabilities Maximum Exposure toLossSecuritization-Related VIEs:          Credit card loan securitizations(1) $29,257 $18,699 $0 $0 $0Home loan securitizations(2) 0 0 195 67 1,262Total securitization-related VIEs 29,257 18,699 195 67 1,262Other VIEs:(3)          Affordable housing entities 175 9 3,896 1,109 3,896Entities that provide capital to low-income and rural communities 955 127 0 0 0Other 0 0 219 0 219Total other VIEs 1,130 136 4,115 1,109 4,115Total VIEs $30,387 $18,835 $4,310 $1,176 $5,377 93Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  December 31, 2016  Consolidated Unconsolidated(Dollars in millions) CarryingAmountof Assets CarryingAmount ofLiabilities CarryingAmountof Assets CarryingAmount ofLiabilities MaximumExposure toLossSecuritization-Related VIEs:          Credit card loan securitizations(1) $33,550 $19,662 $0 $0 $0Home loan securitizations(2) 0 0 201 27 1,276Total securitization-related VIEs 33,550 19,662 201 27 1,276Other VIEs:(3)          Affordable housing entities  174 9 3,862 1,093 3,862Entities that provide capital to low-income and rural communities 927 127 0 0 0Other 0 0 187 0 187Total other VIEs 1,101 136 4,049 1,093 4,049Total VIEs $34,651 $19,798 $4,250 $1,120 $5,325__________(1) Represents the carrying amount of assets and liabilities owned by the VIE, which includes the seller’s interest and repurchased notes held by other related parties.(2) The carrying amount of assets of unconsolidated securitization-related VIEs consists of retained interests associated with the securitization of option-adjustable rate mortgage (“option-ARM”) loans and letters of credit related to manufactured housing securitizations. These are reported on our consolidated balance sheets within other assets. The carrying amount of liabilities of unconsolidated securitization-related VIEs is comprised of obligations on certain swap agreements associated with the securitizations of manufactured housing loans and other obligations. These are reported on our consolidated balance sheets within other liabilities.(3) In certain investment structures, we consolidate a VIE which in turn holds as its primary asset an investment in an unconsolidated VIE. In these instances, we disclose the carrying amount of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets in the unconsolidated VIEs to avoid duplicating our exposure, as the unconsolidated VIEs are generally the operating entities generating the exposure. The carrying amount of assets and liabilities included in the unconsolidated VIE columns above related to these investment structures were $1.9 billion of assets and $642 million of liabilities as of March 31, 2017 and $1.9 billion of assets and $618 million of liabilities as of December 31, 2016. Securitization-Related VIEsIn a securitization transaction, assets from our balance sheet are transferred to a trust, which generally meets the definition of a VIE. Our primary securitization activity is in the form of credit card securitizations, conducted through securitization trusts which we consolidate. Our continuing involvement in these securitization transactions mainly consists of acting as the primary servicer and holding certain retained interests.We transfer residential home loans and multifamily commercial loans that we originate to the government-sponsored enterprises (“GSEs”) and retain the right to service the transferred loans pursuant to the guidelines set forth by the GSEs. Subsequent to such transfers, these loans are commonly securitized into RMBS or CMBS by the GSEs. We also hold RMBS, CMBS and ABS in our investment portfolio, which represent an interest in the respective securitization trusts employed in the transactions under which those securities were issued. We do not consolidate the securitization trusts employed in these transactions as we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these securitization trusts. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with these VIEs is the carrying value of the mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) and investment securities on our consolidated balance sheets. See “Note 7—Goodwill and Intangible Assets” for information related to our MSRs associated with these residential home loan and multifamily commercial loan securitizations and “Note 3—Investment Securities” for more information on the securities held in our investment securities portfolio. We exclude these VIEs from the tables within this note because we do not consider our continuing involvement with these VIEs to be significant; we either invest in securities issued by the VIE and were not involved in the design of the VIE, or no transfers have occurred between the VIE and us. In addition, where we have certain lending arrangements in the normal course of business with entities that could be VIEs, we have also excluded these VIEs from the tables presented in this note. See “Note 4—Loans” for additional information regarding our lending arrangements in the normal course of business. 94Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSWe also may have exposure associated with contractual obligations to repurchase previously transferred loans due to breaches of representations and warranties. See “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others” for information related to reserves we have established for our mortgage representation and warranty exposure.The table below presents our continuing involvement in certain securitization-related VIEs as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Table 6.2: Continuing Involvement in Securitization-Related VIEs    Mortgage (Dollars in millions) CreditCard Option-ARM GreenPointHELOCs GreenPointManufacturedHousing March 31, 2017:         Securities held by third-party investors $18,528 $1,437 $52 $674 Receivables in the trust 29,550 1,485 46 679 Cash balance of spread or reserve accounts 0 8 N/A 127 Retained interests Yes Yes Yes Yes Servicing retained Yes Yes(1) No No(2) Amortization event(3) No No No No December 31, 2016:         Securities held by third-party investors $18,826 $1,499 $56 $697 Receivables in the trust 31,762 1,549 50 702 Cash balance of spread or reserve accounts 0 8 N/A 130 Retained interests Yes Yes Yes Yes Servicing retained Yes Yes(1) No No(2) Amortization event(3) No No No No __________(1) We continue to service only certain option-ARM securitizations.(2) The core servicing activities for the manufactured housing securitizations are completed by a third party.(3) Amortization events vary according to each specific trust agreement but generally are triggered by declines in performance or credit metrics of the underlying assets, such as net charge-off rates or delinquency rates, beyond certain predetermined thresholds. Generally, the occurrence of an amortization event changes the sequencing and amount of trust-related cash flows to the benefit of more senior interest holders.Credit Card SecuritizationsWe hold certain retained interests in our credit card securitizations and continue to service the receivables in these trusts. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we were deemed to be the primary beneficiary, and accordingly, all of these trusts have been consolidated in our financial statements. Mortgage SecuritizationsOption-ARM LoansWe had previously securitized option-ARM loans by transferring these loans to securitization trusts that had issued mortgage-backed securities to investors. The outstanding balance of debt securities held by third-party investors related to these mortgage loan securitization trusts was $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.We continue to service a portion of the remaining mortgage loans in these securitizations. We also retain rights to future cash flows arising from these securitizations, the most significant being certificated interest-only bonds issued by the trusts. We generally estimate the fair value of these retained interests based on the estimated present value of expected future cash flows, using our best estimates of the key assumptions which include credit losses, prepayment speeds and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. For the mortgage loans that we continue to service, we do not consolidate the related trusts because we do not have the right to receive benefits nor the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts. For the remaining  95Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTStrusts, for which we no longer service the underlying mortgage loans, we do not consolidate these entities since we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts.In connection with the securitization of certain option-ARM loans, a third party is obligated to advance a portion of any “negative amortization” resulting from monthly payments that are less than the interest accrued for that payment period. We have an agreement in place with the third party that mirrors this advance requirement. The amount advanced is tracked through mortgage-backed securities retained as part of the securitization transaction. As advances occur, we record an asset in the form of negative amortization bonds, which are held at fair value in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Our maximum exposure is affected by rate caps and monthly payment change caps, but the funding obligation cannot exceed the difference between the original loan balance multiplied by a preset negative amortization cap and the current unpaid principal balance. We have also entered into certain derivative contracts related to the securitization activities. These are classified as free-standing derivatives, with fair value adjustments recorded in non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income. See “Note 9—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” for further details on these derivatives.GreenPoint Mortgage Home Equity Lines of Credit (“HELOCs”)Our discontinued wholesale mortgage banking unit, GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, Inc. (“GreenPoint”), previously sold HELOCs in whole loan sales that were subsequently securitized by third parties. GreenPoint acquired residual interests in certain of those securitization trusts. We do not consolidate these trusts because we either lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts or because we do not have the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts. As the residual interest holder, GreenPoint is required to fund advances on the HELOCs when certain performance triggers are met due to deterioration in asset performance. On behalf of GreenPoint, we have funded cumulative advances of $30 million as of both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. We also have unfunded commitments of $5 million related to those interests for our non-consolidated VIEs as of both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.GreenPoint Credit Manufactured HousingWe have retained certain interests and obligations related to the discontinued manufactured housing operations of GreenPoint Credit, LLC, a subsidiary of GreenPoint. Such discontinued operations, including the related recourse obligations, servicing rights and the primary obligation to execute mandatory clean-up calls in certain securitization transactions were sold to a third party in 2004. We do not consolidate these securitization trusts because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts as we no longer service the loans.The unpaid principal balance of manufactured housing securitization transactions where we are the residual interest holder was $679 million and $702 million as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. In the event the third party servicer does not fulfill its obligation to exercise the clean-up calls on certain securitizations, the obligation reverts to us and we would be required to acquire a maximum of approximately $420 million of loan receivables and other assets upon our execution of these clean-up calls with the requirement to absorb any losses on the loan receivables and other assets. See “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others” for information related to these obligations. We were required to fund letters of credit to cover losses on certain manufactured housing securitizations. We have the right to receive any funds remaining in the letters of credit after the securities are released. The fair value of these letters of credit are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets and totaled $88 million and $85 million as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. We also have credit exposure on agreements that we entered into to absorb a portion of the risk of loss on certain manufactured housing securitizations not subject to the funded letters of credit. Our maximum credit exposure related to these agreements totaled $12 million as of both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. These agreements are included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, and our obligation under these agreements was $8 million as of both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. 96Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSOther VIEsAffordable Housing EntitiesAs part of our community reinvestment initiatives, we invest in private investment funds that make equity investments in multi-family affordable housing properties. We receive affordable housing tax credits for these investments. The activities of these entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. We account for certain of our investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method if certain criteria are met. The proportional amortization method amortizes the cost of the investment over the period in which the investor expects to receive tax credits and other tax benefits, and the resulting amortization is recognized as a component of income tax expense attributable to continuing operations. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, we recognized amortization of $115 million and $98 million, respectively, and tax credits of $114 million and $113 million, respectively, associated with these investments within income tax provision. The carrying value of our equity investments in these qualified affordable housing projects was $3.8 billion as of both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. We are periodically required to provide additional financial or other support during the period of the investments. We had recorded liabilities of $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion for these unfunded commitments as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, which is expected to be paid from 2017 to 2019.For those investment funds considered to be VIEs, we are not required to consolidate them if we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of those entities. We record our interests in these unconsolidated VIEs in loans held for investment, other assets and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our interests consisted of assets of approximately$3.9 billion as of both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Our maximum exposure to these entities is limited to our variable interests in the entities of $3.9 billion as of both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit and we do not provide additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it. The total assets of the unconsolidated VIE investment funds were approximately $11.0 billion and $11.5 billion as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.Entities that Provide Capital to Low-Income and Rural Communities We hold variable interests in entities (“Investor Entities”) that invest in community development entities (“CDEs”) that provide debt financing to businesses and non-profit entities in low-income and rural communities. Variable interests in the CDEs held by the consolidated Investor Entities are also our variable interests. The activities of the Investor Entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. The activities of the CDEs are financed solely with invested equity capital. We receive federal and state tax credits for these investments. We consolidate the VIEs in which we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and where we have the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE. We have also consolidated other investments and CDEs that are not considered to be VIEs, but where we hold a controlling financial interest. The assets of the VIEs that we consolidated, which totaled approximately $955 million and $927 million as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets in cash, loans held for investment, interest receivable and other assets. The liabilities are reflected in other liabilities. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit. We have not provided additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it.OtherOther VIEs include variable interests that we hold in companies that promote renewable energy sources and other equity method investments. We were not required to consolidate these entities because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance. Our maximum exposure to these entities is limited to the investment on our consolidated balance sheets of $219 million and $187 million as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The creditors of the other VIEs have no recourse to our general credit. We have not provided additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it.NOTE 7—GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETSThe table below displays the components of goodwill, intangible assets and MSRs as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

Securitized and Unsecured Debt ObligationsIn addition to our deposits, which serve as our primary funding source, we use a variety of other funding sources including short-term borrowings, the issuance of senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings, and securitization transactions. In addition, we utilize FHLB advances, which are secured by certain portions of our loan and investment securities portfolios, for our funding needs. The securitized debt obligations are separately presented on our consolidated balance sheets as they represent obligations of consolidated securitization trusts, while federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings, including FHLB advances, are included in other debt on our consolidated balance sheets.Securitized Debt ObligationsOur outstanding borrowings due to securitization investors decreased to $18.5 billion as of March 31, 2017, from $18.8 billion as of December 31, 2016. During the first quarter of 2017, $3.0 billion of new debt was issued to third-party investors from our credit card loan securitization trust offset by $3.3 billion of maturities.Senior and Subordinated NotesAs of March 31, 2017, we had $26.4 billion of senior and subordinated notes outstanding, inclusive of fair value hedging adjustments of $304 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had $23.4 billion of senior and subordinated notes outstanding, inclusive of fair value hedging adjustments of $280 million. During the first quarter of 2017, we issued $4.0 billion of long-term senior and subordinated debt comprised of $900 million of floating-rate notes and $3.1 billion of fixed-rate notes. During the first quarter of 2017, $1.0 billion of senior and subordinated notes were matured. See “Note 9—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” for information about our fair value hedging activities.FHLB Advances and OtherWe have access to funding through the FHLB system and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Our FHLB and Federal Reserve memberships require us to hold FHLB and Federal Reserve stock which totaled $1.2 billion and $1.9 billion as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, and are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.Our FHLB advances and lines of credit are secured by our investment securities, residential home loans, multifamily real estate loans, commercial real estate loans and HELOCs. Outstanding FHLB advances totaled $2.4 billion and $17.2 billion as of March 31, 2017 and December 2016, respectively, substantially all of which represented long-term advances generally callable on either a one-month or a three-month basis.We did not access the Federal Reserve Discount Window for funding during 2016 or the first quarter of 2017.Composition of Deposits, Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term DebtThe table below summarizes the components of our deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

Our primary market risks stem from the impact on our earnings and economic value of equity from changes in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, changes in foreign exchange rates. We employ several techniques to manage our interest rate sensitivity, which include changing the duration and re-pricing characteristics of various assets and liabilities by using interest rate derivatives. Our current policies also include the use of derivatives to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currency so we may limit our earnings and capital ratio exposures to foreign exchange risk. We execute our derivative contracts in both the over-the-counter (“OTC”) and exchange-traded derivative markets, and clear eligible derivative transactions through Central Counterparty Clearinghouses (“CCPs”), often referred to as “central clearinghouses,” as required under the Dodd-Frank Act. The majority of our derivatives are interest rate swaps. In addition, we may use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks. We offer various interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity derivatives as an accommodation to our customers within our Commercial Banking business, and usually offset our exposure through derivative transactions with other counterparties.Accounting for DerivativesOur derivatives are designated as either qualifying accounting hedges or free-standing derivatives. Qualifying accounting hedges are designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges. Free-standing derivatives primarily consist of customer-accommodation derivatives and economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting. •Fair Value Hedges: We designate derivatives as fair value hedges when they are used to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, which fluctuate in value as a result of movements in interest rates. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded in earnings together with offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item and any resulting ineffectiveness. Our fair value hedges consist of interest rate swaps that are intended to modify our exposure to interest rate risk on various fixed-rate assets and liabilities. •Cash Flow Hedges: We designate derivatives as cash flow hedges when they are used to manage our exposure to variability in cash flows related to forecasted transactions. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of AOCI, to the extent that the hedge relationships are effective, and amounts are reclassified from AOCI to earnings as the forecasted transactions impact earnings. To the extent that any ineffectiveness exists in the hedge relationships, the amounts are recorded in current period earnings. Our cash flow hedges use interest rate swaps and floors that are intended to hedge the variability in interest receipts or interest payments on some of our variable-rate assets or liabilities. We also enter into foreign currency forward derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to intercompany borrowings denominated in foreign currency. •Net Investment Hedges: We use net investment hedges to manage the foreign currency exposure related to our net investments in foreign operations that have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recorded in the translation adjustment component of AOCI, offsetting the translation gain or loss from those foreign operations. We execute net investment hedges using foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the translation exposure of the net investment in our foreign operations.•Free-Standing Derivatives: We use free-standing derivatives to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of residential MSRs, mortgage loan origination and purchase commitments and other interests held. We also categorize our customer accommodation derivatives and the related offsetting contracts as free-standing derivatives. Changes in the fair value of free-standing derivatives are recorded in earnings as a component of other non-interest income.Balance Sheet PresentationThe following table summarizes the notional and fair values of our derivative instruments on a gross basis as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, which are segregated by derivatives that are designated as accounting hedges and those that are not, and are further segregated by type of contract within those two categories. The total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and any associated cash collateral received or paid.  102Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSTable 9.1: Derivative Assets and Liabilities at Fair Value  March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016  Notional orContractualAmount Derivative(1) Notional orContractualAmount Derivative(1)(Dollars in millions) Assets Liabilities Assets LiabilitiesDerivatives designated as accounting hedges:            Interest rate contracts:            Fair value hedges $48,009 $246 $637 $40,480 $295 $569Cash flow hedges 52,200 60 369 50,400 151 287Total interest rate contracts 100,209 306 1,006 90,880 446 856Foreign exchange contracts:            Cash flow hedges 5,307 27 34 5,620 108 9Net investment hedges 2,535 62 24 2,396 163 0Total foreign exchange contracts 7,842 89 58 8,016 271 9Total derivatives designated as accounting hedges 108,051 395 1,064 98,896 717 865Derivatives not designated as accounting hedges:            Interest rate contracts covering:            MSRs(2) 1,551 20 13 1,696 17 21Customer accommodation 41,220 571 435 39,474 670 530Other interest rate exposures(3) 2,509 32 12 1,105 33 8Total interest rate contracts 45,280 623 460 42,275 720 559Other contracts 1,752 51 7 1,767 57 14Total derivatives not designated as accounting hedges 47,032 674 467 44,042 777 573Total derivatives $155,083 $1,069 $1,531 $142,938 $1,494 $1,438Less: netting adjustment(4)   (375) (246)   (539) (336)Total derivative assets/liabilities   $694 $1,285   $955 $1,102__________(1) Derivative assets and liabilities include interest accruals and exclude valuation adjustments related to non-performance risk.

See Table 9.2 for further information.Offsetting of Financial Assets and Liabilities Derivative contracts and repurchase agreements that we execute bilaterally in the OTC market are governed by enforceable master netting arrangements where we generally have the right to offset exposure with the same counterparty. Either counterparty can generally request to net settle all contracts through a single payment upon default on, or termination of, any one contract. We elect to offset the derivative assets and liabilities under netting arrangements for balance sheet presentation where a right of setoff exists. Derivative contracts that are cleared with central clearinghouses through our Future Commission Merchants (“FCMs”) are not subject to offsetting due to the uncertainty existing around an end-user’s ability to setoff these derivative contracts. Therefore, as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we did not offset our derivative positions cleared through clearinghouses.We also maintain collateral agreements with certain derivative counterparties. For bilateral derivatives, we review our collateral positions on a daily basis and exchange collateral with our counterparties in accordance with standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association documentation and other related agreements. Agreements with certain bilateral counterparties require both parties to maintain collateral in the event the fair values of derivative instruments exceed established exposure thresholds. For centrally cleared derivatives, we are subject to initial margin posting and daily variation margin exchange with the central clearinghouses. Acceptable types of collateral are typically in the form of cash or high quality liquid securities.  103Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe exchange of collateral is dependent upon the fair value of the derivative instruments as well as the fair value of the pledged collateral. When valuing collateral, an estimate of the variation in price and liquidity over time is subtracted in the form of a “haircut” to discount the value of the collateral pledged. The following table presents as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 the gross and net fair values of our derivative assets and liabilities and repurchase agreements, as well as the related offsetting amounts permitted under U.S. GAAP. The table also includes cash and non-cash collateral received or pledged associated with such arrangements. The collateral amounts shown are limited to the extent of the related net derivative fair values or outstanding balances, thus instances of over-collateralization are not shown.Table 9.2: Offsetting of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  GrossAmounts Gross Amounts Offset in the Balance Sheet Net Amounts as Recognized Securities Collateral Held Under Master Netting Agreements  (Dollars in millions)  FinancialInstruments Cash Collateral Received   NetExposureAs of March 31, 2017            Derivatives assets(1)(2) $1,069 $(194) $(181) $694 $0 $694As of December 31, 2016            Derivatives assets(1)(2) 1,494 (152) (387) 955 (11) 944  GrossAmounts Gross Amounts Offset in the Balance Sheet Net Amounts as Recognized Securities Collateral Pledged Under Master Netting Agreements  (Dollars in millions)  FinancialInstruments Cash Collateral Pledged   NetExposureAs of March 31, 2017            Derivatives liabilities(1)(2) $1,531 $(194) $(52) $1,285 $0 $1,285Repurchase agreements(3)(4) 1,046 0 0 1,046 (1,046) 0As of December 31, 2016            Derivatives liabilities(1)(2) 1,438 (152) (184) 1,102 0 1,102Repurchase agreements(3) 992 0 0 992 (992) 0__________(1) The gross balances include derivative assets and derivative liabilities as of March 31, 2017 that totaled $400 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, related to the centrally cleared derivative contracts.

(2) We received cash collateral from derivative counterparties totaling $208 million and $448 million as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. We also received securities from derivative counterparties with a fair value of $1 million and $16 million as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, which we have the ability to re-pledge. We posted $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion of cash collateral as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.(3) As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we only had repurchase obligations outstanding and did not have any reverse repurchase receivables.(4) Represents customer repurchase agreements that mature the next business day. As of March 31, 2017, we pledged collateral with a fair value of $1.1 billion under these customer repurchase agreements, which were primarily agency RMBS securities.Derivatives Counterparty Credit RiskDerivative instruments contain an element of credit risk that arises from the potential failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of the contract. Our exposure to derivative counterparty credit risk, at any point in time, is represented by the fair value of derivatives in a gain position, or derivative asset position, assuming no recoveries of underlying collateral. We also engage in certain foreign exchange derivatives that may give rise to counterparty settlement risk. To mitigate the risk of counterparty default, we enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements and collateral agreements, where possible, with certain derivative counterparties. We generally enter into these agreements on a bilateral basis with our counterparties.These bilateral agreements typically provide the right to offset exposures and require one counterparty to post collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position to the other counterparty. Certain of these bilateral agreements include provisions requiring that our debt maintain a credit rating of investment grade or above by each of the major credit rating agencies. In the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating below investment grade, some of our counterparties would have the right to  104Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSterminate the derivative contract and close out the existing positions. We also clear eligible OTC derivatives with central clearinghouses through FCMs as part of the regulatory requirement. The use of the central clearinghouses and the FCMs reduces our bilateral counterparty credit exposures while it increases our credit exposures to CCPs and FCMs. Our FCM agreements governing these derivative transactions generally include provisions that may require us to post more collateral or otherwise change terms in our agreements under certain circumstances.We record counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments on our OTC derivative contracts to properly reflect the credit quality of the counterparty. We consider collateral and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate our credit exposure to each counterparty in determining the counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment, which may be adjusted in future periods due to changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts, collateral and creditworthiness of the counterparty. The cumulative counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as a reduction to the derivative asset balance was $5 million and $6 million as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. We also adjust the fair value of our derivative liabilities to reflect the impact of our own credit quality. We calculate this adjustment by comparing the spreads on our credit default swaps to the discount benchmark curve. The cumulative credit risk valuation adjustment related to our credit quality recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as a reduction in the derivative liability balance was less than $1 million as of both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.Income Statement Presentation and AOCIFair Value Hedges and Free-Standing DerivativesThe net gains (losses) recognized in earnings related to derivatives in fair value hedging relationships and free-standing derivatives are presented below for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.Table 9.3: Gains and Losses on Fair Value Hedges and Free-Standing Derivatives  Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2017 2016Derivatives designated as accounting hedges:(1)    Fair value interest rate contracts:    Gains (losses) recognized in earnings on derivatives $(45) $208Gains (losses) recognized in earnings on hedged items 39 (192)Net fair value hedge ineffectiveness gains (losses) (6) 16Derivatives not designated as accounting hedges:(1)    Interest rate contracts covering:    MSRs 0 10Customer accommodation 10 5Other interest rate exposures 7 15Total interest rate contracts 17 30Foreign exchange contracts 0 0Other contracts 0 0Total gains on derivatives not designated as accounting hedges 17 30Net derivative gains recognized in earnings $11 $46__________(1) Amounts are recorded in our consolidated statements of income in other non-interest income. 105Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCash Flow and Net Investment Hedges The table below shows the net gains (losses) related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and net investment hedges for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.Table 9.4: Gains and Losses on Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges and Net Investment Hedges   Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2017 2016Gains (losses) recorded in AOCI:    Cash flow hedges:    Interest rate contracts $(30) $426Foreign exchange contracts 4 0Subtotal (26) 426Net investment hedges:    Foreign exchange contracts (22) 41Net derivatives gains (losses) recognized in AOCI $(48) $467Gains (losses) recorded in earnings:    Cash flow hedges:    Gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI into earnings:    Interest rate contracts(1)  $37 $50Foreign exchange contracts(2)  3 (1)Subtotal 40 49Gains (losses) recognized in earnings due to ineffectiveness:    Interest rate contracts(2)  (1) 3Net derivative gains (losses) recognized in earnings $39 $52__________(1) Amounts reclassified are recorded in our consolidated statements of income in interest income or interest expense.(2) Amounts are recorded in our consolidated statements of income in other non-interest income or other interest income.

The fair value accounting guidance provides a three-level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments. This hierarchy is based on the markets in which the assets or liabilities trade and whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable. The fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:Level 1: Valuation is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2: Valuation is based on observable market-based inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or models using inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data of substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3: Valuation is generated from techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. Valuation techniques include pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques.The accounting guidance for fair value measurements requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in determining fair value. The accounting guidance provides for the irrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-contract basis, to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value at inception of the contract and record any subsequent changes in fair value in earnings. We have not made any material fair value option elections as of or for the periods disclosed herein.The determination and classification of financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy is performed at the end of each reporting period. We consider all available information, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs. For additional information on the valuation techniques used in estimating the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities on a recurring or nonrecurring basis and for estimating the fair value for financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value, see “Note 17—Fair Value Measurement” in our 2016 Form 10-K.Fair Value Governance and ControlWe have a governance framework and a number of key controls that are intended to ensure that our fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable. Our governance framework provides for independent oversight and segregation of duties. Our control processes include review and approval of new transaction types, price verification and review of valuation judgments, methods, models, process controls and results. Groups independent of our trading and investing functions participate in the review and validation process. Tasks performed by these groups include periodic verification of fair value measurements to determine if assigned fair values are reasonable, including comparing prices from third-party pricing services to other available market information. Our Fair Value Committee (“FVC”), which includes representation from business areas, Risk Management and Finance divisions, provides guidance and oversight to ensure an appropriate valuation control environment. The FVC regularly reviews and approves our fair valuations to ensure that our valuation practices are consistent with industry standards and adhere to regulatory and accounting guidance. We have a model policy, established by an independent Model Risk Office, which governs the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for pricing and fair value measurements. The Model Risk Office validates all models and provides ongoing monitoring of their performance. The fair valuation governance process is set up in a manner that allows the Chairperson of the FVC to escalate valuation disputes that cannot be resolved by the FVC to a more senior committee called the Valuations Advisory Committee (“VAC”) for resolution. The VAC is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and includes other members of senior management. The VAC is only required to convene to review escalated valuation disputes 111Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisThe following table displays our assets and liabilities measured on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.

(3) The amount presented for unrealized gains (losses) for assets still held as of the reporting date primarily represents impairments of securities available for sale, accretion on certain fixed maturity securities, changes in fair value of derivative instruments and mortgage servicing rights transactions.(4) All Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis and are not reduced by the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to net positive and negative positions and the related payables and receivables for cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparty. Significant Level 3 Fair Value Asset and Liability Input SensitivityChanges in unobservable inputs may have a significant impact on fair value. Certain of these unobservable inputs will, in isolation, have a directionally consistent impact on the fair value of the instrument for a given change in that input. Alternatively, the fair value of the instrument may move in an opposite direction for a given change in another input. In general, an increase in the discount rate, default rates, loss severity and credit spreads, in isolation, would result in a decrease in the fair value measurement. In addition, an increase in default rates would generally be accompanied by a decrease in recovery rates, slower prepayment rates and an increase in liquidity spreads.Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value MeasurementsThe following table presents the significant unobservable inputs used to determine the fair values of our Level 3 financial instruments on a recurring basis. We utilize multiple third-party pricing services to obtain fair value for our securities. Several of our third-party pricing services are only able to provide unobservable input information for a limited number of securities due to software licensing restrictions. Other third-party pricing services are able to provide unobservable input information for all securities for which they provide a valuation. As a result, the unobservable input information for the securities available for sale presented below represents a composite summary of all information we are able to obtain. The unobservable input information for all other Level 3 financial instruments is based on the assumptions used in our internal valuation models. 114Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSTable 12.3: Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements  Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements(Dollars in millions) Fair Value at March 31, 2017 SignificantValuationTechniques SignificantUnobservableInputs Range WeightedAverageAssets:          Securities available for sale:          RMBS $449 Discounted cash flows (3rd party pricing) YieldConstant prepayment rateDefault rateLoss severity 1-7%0-30%0-17%3-85% 5%4%4%54%CMBS 78 Discounted cash flows (3rd party pricing) YieldConstant prepayment rate 2%0% 2%0%Other securities 9 Discounted cash flows Yield 1-2% 1%Other assets:          Derivative assets(1) 53 Discounted cash flows Swap rates 2-3% 2%Consumer MSRs 86 Discounted cash flows Total prepayment rateDiscount rateOption-adjusted spread rateServicing cost ($ per loan) 7-20%16%500-1500 bps$75-$100 15%16%584 bps$76Retained interests in securitization(2) 195 Discounted cash flows Life of receivables (months)Constant prepayment rateDiscount rateDefault rateLoss severity 2-792-13%4-12%1-5%8-104% N/ALiabilities:          Derivative liabilities(1) $31 Discounted cash flows Swap rates 2-3% 2%  Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements(Dollars in millions) Fair Value at December 31, 2016 SignificantValuationTechniques SignificantUnobservableInputs Range WeightedAverageAssets:          Securities available for sale:          RMBS $518 Discounted cash flows (3rd party pricing) YieldConstant prepayment rateDefault rateLoss severity 0-15%0-30%0-16%9-87% 5%4%4%57%CMBS 51 Discounted cash flows (3rd party pricing) YieldConstant prepayment rate 2%0% 2%0%Other securities 9 Discounted cash flows Yield 1-2% 1%Other assets:          Derivative assets(1) 47 Discounted cash flows Swap rates 2% 2%Consumer MSRs 80 Discounted cash flows Total prepayment rateDiscount rateOption-adjusted spread rateServicing cost ($ per loan) 8-20%15%580-1,500 bps$75-$100 15%15%636 bps$76Retained interests in securitization(2) 201 Discounted cash flows Life of receivables (months) Constant prepayment rateDiscount rateDefault rateLoss severity 6-872-11%4-11%1-6%7-102% N/ALiabilities:          Derivative liabilities(1) $29 Discounted cash flows Swap rates 2% 2%__________(1) All Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis and are not reduced by the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to net positive and negative positions and the related payables and receivables for cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparty.

These assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, from the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or when we evaluate for impairment). The following table presents the carrying amount of the assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and still held as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, and for which a nonrecurring fair value measurement was recorded during the three and twelve months then ended:Table 12.4: Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements  March 31, 2017  Estimated Fair Value Hierarchy Total(Dollars in millions) Level 2 Level 3 Loans held for investment $0 $265 $265Loans held for sale 246 2 248Other assets(1) 0 35 35Total $246 $302 $548  December 31, 2016  Estimated Fair Value Hierarchy Total(Dollars in millions) Level 2 Level 3 Loans held for investment $0 $587 $587Loans held for sale 157 0 157Other assets(1) 0 83 83Total $157 $670 $827__________(1) Other assets includes foreclosed property and repossessed assets of $29 million and long-lived assets held for sale of $6 million as of March 31, 2017, compared to foreclosed property and repossessed assets of $43 million and long-lived assets held for sale of $40 million as of December 31, 2016.In the above table, loans held for investment primarily include nonperforming loans for which specific reserves or charge-offs have been recognized. These loans are classified as Level 3, as they are valued based in part on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral and the non-recoverable rate, which is considered to be a significant unobservable input. Collateral fair value sources include the appraisal value obtained from independent appraisers, broker pricing opinions or other available market information. The non-recoverable rate ranged from 0% to 66%, with a weighted average of 21%, and from 0% to 73%, with a weighted average of 16%, as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The fair value of the loans held for sale and the other assets classified as Level 3 is determined based on appraisal value or listing price which involves significant judgment; the significant unobservable inputs and related quantitative information are not meaningful to disclose as they vary significantly across properties and collateral. 116Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe following table presents total nonrecurring fair value measurements for the period, included in earnings, attributable to the change in fair value relating to assets that are still held at March 31, 2017 and 2016.Table 12.5: Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements Included in Earnings  Total Gains (Losses)  Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2017 2016Loans held for investment $(38) $(71)Loans held for sale 0 0Other assets(1) (5) (4)Total $(43) $(75)__________(1) Other assets includes losses related to foreclosed property, repossessed assets and long-lived assets held for sale.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair value, including the level within the fair value hierarchy, of our financial instruments that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis on our consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.Table 12.6: Fair Value of Financial Instruments   March 31, 2017  CarryingAmount EstimatedFair Value Estimated Fair Value Hierarchy(Dollars in millions)   Level 1 Level 2 Level 3Financial assets:          Cash and cash equivalents $9,315 $9,315 $3,489 $5,826 $0Restricted cash for securitization investors 486 486 486 0 0Securities held to maturity 26,170 26,657 199 26,409 49Net loans held for investment 233,604 237,406 0 0 237,406Loans held for sale 735 742 0 740 2Interest receivable 1,368 1,368 0 1,368 0Other investments(1) 1,306 1,306 0 1,297 9Financial liabilities:          Deposits $241,182 $241,599 $26,364 $215,235 $0Securitized debt obligations 18,528 18,647 0 18,647 0Senior and subordinated notes 26,405 26,817 0 26,817 0Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase 1,046 1,046 0 1,046 0Other borrowings 2,460 2,428 0 2,428 0Interest payable 260 260 0 260 0 117Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  December 31, 2016  CarryingAmount EstimatedFair Value Estimated Fair Value Hierarchy(Dollars in millions)   Level 1 Level 2 Level 3Financial assets:          Cash and cash equivalents $9,976 $9,976 $4,185 $5,791 $0Restricted cash for securitization investors 2,517 2,517 2,517 0 0Securities held to maturity 25,712 26,196 199 25,962 35Net loans held for investment 239,083 242,935 0 0 242,935Loans held for sale 1,043 1,038 0 1,038 0Interest receivable 1,351 1,351 0 1,351 0Other investments(1) 2,029 2,029 0 2,020 9Financial liabilities:          Deposits $236,768 $237,082 $25,502 $211,580 $0Securitized debt obligations 18,826 18,920 0 18,920 0Senior and subordinated notes 23,431 23,774 0 23,774 0Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase 992 992 0 992 0Other borrowings 17,211 17,180 0 17,180 0Interest payable 327 327 0 327 0__________(1)      Other investments includes FHLB, Federal Reserve stock and cost method investments.

The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group, are included in the Other category.Basis of PresentationWe report the results of each of our business segments on a continuing operations basis. See “Note 2—Discontinued Operations” for a discussion of our discontinued operations. The results of our individual businesses reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. Business Segment Reporting MethodologyThe results of our business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. Our internal management and reporting process used to derive our segment results employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. Our funds transfer pricing process provides a funds credit for sources of funds, such as deposits generated by our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses, and a funds charge for the use of funds by each segment. Due to the integrated nature of our business segments, estimates and judgments have been made in allocating certain revenue and expense items. Transactions between segments are based on specific criteria or approximate third-party rates. We regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods. We provide additional information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in “Note 18—Business Segments” in our 2016 Form 10-K.Segment Results and Reconciliation We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment. The following tables present our business segment results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, selected balance sheet data as of March 31, 2017 and 2016, and a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated income from continuing operations, loans held for investment and deposits.  119Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSTable 13.1: Segment Results and Reconciliation  Three Months Ended March 31, 2017(Dollars in millions) CreditCard ConsumerBanking CommercialBanking(1) Other(1) ConsolidatedTotalNet interest income $3,346 $1,517 $566 $45 $5,474Non-interest income 738 195 158 (30) 1,061Total net revenue 4,084 1,712 724 15 6,535Provision (benefit) for credit losses 1,717 279 (2) (2) 1,992Non-interest expense 1,929 1,042 391 72 3,434Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 438 391 335 (55) 1,109Income tax provision (benefit) 167 143 122 (118) 314Income from continuing operations, net of tax $271 $248 $213 $63 $795Loans held for investment $99,213 $73,982 $67,320 $73 $240,588Deposits 0 188,216 33,735 19,231 241,182             Three Months Ended March 31, 2016(Dollars in millions) CreditCard ConsumerBanking CommercialBanking(1) Other(1) ConsolidatedTotalNet interest income  $3,033 $1,420 $537 $66 $5,056Non-interest income 847 191 118 8 1,164Total net revenue  3,880 1,611 655 74 6,220Provision (benefit) for credit losses 1,071 230 228 (2) 1,527Non-interest expense 1,863 990 322 48 3,223Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 946 391 105 28 1,470Income tax provision (benefit) 337 142 38 (65) 452Income from continuing operations, net of tax $609 $249 $67 $93 $1,018Loans held for investment $92,699 $70,591 $64,241 $82 $227,613Deposits 0 177,803 33,383 10,593 221,779__________ (1) Some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits. Accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory tax rate of 35% with offsetting reclassifications to the Other category. 120Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE 14—COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES, GUARANTEES AND OTHERSCommitments to LendOur unfunded lending commitments primarily consist of credit card lines, loan commitments to customers of both our Commercial Banking and Consumer Banking businesses, as well as standby and commercial letters of credit. These commitments, other than credit card lines, are legally binding conditional agreements that have fixed expirations or termination dates and specified interest rates and purposes. The contractual amount of these commitments represents the maximum possible credit risk to us should the counterparty draw upon the commitment. We generally manage the potential risk of unfunded lending commitments by limiting the total amount of arrangements, monitoring the size and maturity structure of these portfolios and applying the same credit standards for all of our credit activities. For unused credit card lines, we have not experienced and do not anticipate that all of our customers will access their entire available line at any given point in time. Commitments to extend credit other than credit card lines generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards. Collateral requirements and loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios are the same as those for funded transactions and are established based on management’s credit assessment of the customer. These commitments may expire without being drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future funding requirements.We also issue letters of credit, such as financial standby, performance standby and commercial letters of credit, to meet the financing needs of our customers. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party in a borrowing arrangement. Commercial letters of credit are short-term commitments issued primarily to facilitate trade finance activities for customers and are generally collateralized by the goods being shipped to the client. These collateral requirements are similar to those for funded transactions and are established based on management’s credit assessment of the customer. Management conducts regular reviews of all outstanding letters of credit and the results of these reviews are considered in assessing the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses.The following table presents contractual amount and carrying value of our unfunded lending commitments as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The carrying value represents our reserve and deferred revenue on legally binding commitments.Table 14.1: Unfunded Lending Commitments: Contractual Amount and Carrying Value  Contractual Amount Carrying Value(Dollars in millions) March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016Standby letter of credit and commercial letter of credit(1) $1,953 $1,936 $49 $42Credit card lines 320,446 312,864 N/A N/AOther loan commitments(2) 28,350 28,402 95 98Total unfunded lending commitments $350,749 $343,202 $144 $140__________(1) These financial guarantees have expiration dates ranging from 2017 to 2025 as of March 31, 2017.(2) Includes $667 million and $699 million of advised lines of credit as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.Loss Sharing Agreements and Other ObligationsWithin our Commercial Banking business, we originate multifamily commercial real estate loans with the intent to sell them to the GSEs. We enter into loss sharing agreements with the GSEs upon the sale of the loans. At inception, we record a liability representing the fair value of our obligation which is subsequently amortized as we are released from risk of payment under the loss sharing agreement. If payment under the loss sharing agreement becomes probable and estimable, an additional liability may be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and a non-interest expense may be recognized in the consolidated statements of income. The amount of liability recognized on our consolidated balance sheets for our loss sharing agreements was $49 million and $48 million as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. In certain securitizations in connection with the discontinued manufactured housing operations of GreenPoint Credit, LLC, the third party servicer has an obligation to exercise mandatory clean-up calls. In the event the third party servicer does not fulfill its obligation to exercise these clean-up calls, the obligation reverts to us. The amount of loan receivables and other assets subject to  121Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSthese clean-up calls is approximately $420 million. Based on our current projections, we expect these securitizations to reach their individual clean-up call thresholds beginning in 2017 and continuing through 2019. According to current information and estimates, we also expect the fair value of the loan receivables and other assets to be less than the contractual amount required to exercise the clean-up calls. We monitor the underlying assets for trends in delinquencies and related losses and review the third party servicer’s financial strength. As of March 31, 2017, we recorded a liability of $40 million associated with these clean-up call obligations. Our best estimate is that any reasonably possible future losses associated with these clean-up call obligations in excess of the liability recorded are not significant to the Company’s financial position.U.K. Payment Protection InsuranceIn the U.K., we previously sold payment protection insurance (“PPI”) and other ancillary cross sell products. In response to an elevated level of customer complaints across the industry, heightened media coverage and pressure from consumer advocacy groups, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), formerly the Financial Services Authority, investigated and raised concerns about the way the industry has handled complaints related to the sale of these insurance policies. For the past several years, the U.K.’s Financial Ombudsman Service (“FOS”) has been adjudicating customer complaints relating to PPI, escalated to it by consumers who disagree with the rejection of their complaint by firms, leading to customer remediation payments by us and others within the industry. On October 2, 2015, the FCA issued a Statement on PPI (“FCA Proposal”) announcing it has decided to consult on the introduction of a time bar for PPI complaints and on new rules and guidance about how banks should handle unfair relationship PPI complaints covered by s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act of 1974 (“Consumer Credit Act”). Following feedback on the FCA Proposal, the FCA issued a further Consultation Paper on August 2, 2016, suggesting some amendments to its proposed rules on how banks should handle unfair relationship PPI complaints and indicating an expectation that the complaint deadline will fall by the end of June 2019. This timetable was based on making a decision about whether to proceed, and making rules and guidance, by the end of December 2016. On December 9, 2016, the FCA issued a statement delaying any further announcement until the first quarter of 2017. On March 2, 2017, the FCA further issued a statement that sets out final rules and guidance on the PPI complaints deadline, which has been set as August 29, 2019. The statement also provides clarity on how to handle PPI complaints under s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act, including guidance on how redress for such complaints should be calculated. In determining our best estimate of incurred losses for future remediation payments, management considers numerous factors, including (i) the number of customer complaints we expect in the future; (ii) our expectation of upholding those complaints; (iii) the expected number of complaints customers escalate to the FOS; (iv) our expectation of the FOS upholding such escalated complaints; (v) the number of complaints that fall under the s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act; and (vi) the estimated remediation payout to customers. We monitor these factors each quarter and adjust our reserves to reflect the latest data.Management’s best estimate of incurred losses related to U.K. PPI totaled $324 million and $238 million as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we added $99 million to our reserve in response to the above FCA statement made on March 2, 2017. Other movements to the reserve were a combination of utilization of the reserve through customer refund payments and foreign exchange movements. Our best estimate of reasonably possible future losses beyond our reserve as of March 31, 2017 is approximately $200 million. The decrease in this estimate from the prior quarter is due to the publication of the FCA rules on March 2, 2017 which resulted in a number of factors previously considered reasonably possible becoming probable and therefore shifting into our reserve estimate. Mortgage Representation and Warranty LiabilitiesWe acquired three subsidiaries that originated residential mortgage loans and sold these loans to various purchasers, including purchasers who created securitization trusts. These subsidiaries are Capital One Home Loans, LLC, which was acquired in February 2005; GreenPoint, which was acquired in December 2006 as part of the North Fork acquisition; and Chevy Chase Bank, F.S.B. (“CCB”), which was acquired in February 2009 and subsequently merged into CONA (collectively, the “subsidiaries”).In connection with their sales of mortgage loans, the subsidiaries entered into agreements containing varying representations and warranties about, among other things, the ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing the loan, the loan’s compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the purchaser, including underwriting guidelines and the existence of mortgage insurance, and the loan’s compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws. The representations and warranties do not address the credit performance of the mortgage loans, but mortgage loan performance often influences whether a claim for breach of representation and warranty will be asserted and has an effect on the amount of any loss in the event of a breach of a representation or warranty. 122Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSEach of these subsidiaries may be required to repurchase mortgage loans in the event of certain breaches of these representations and warranties. In the event of a repurchase, the subsidiary is typically required to pay the unpaid principal balance of the loan together with interest and certain expenses (including, in certain cases, legal costs incurred by the purchaser and/or others). The subsidiary then recovers the loan or, if the loan has been foreclosed, the underlying collateral. The subsidiary is exposed to any losses on the repurchased loans, taking into account any recoveries on the collateral. In some instances, rather than repurchase the loans, a subsidiary may agree to make cash payments to make a purchaser whole on losses or to settle repurchase claims, possibly including claims for attorneys’ fees and interest. In addition, our subsidiaries may be required to indemnify certain purchasers and others against losses they incur as a result of certain breaches of representations and warranties.These subsidiaries, in total, originated and sold to non-affiliates approximately $111 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans between 2005 and 2008, which are the years (or “vintages”) with respect to which our subsidiaries have received the vast majority of the repurchase-related requests and other related claims.The following table presents the original principal balance of mortgage loan originations for the three general categories of purchasers of mortgage loans and the estimated unpaid principal balance as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.Table 14.2: Unpaid Principal Balance of Mortgage Loans Originated and Sold to Third Parties Based on Category of Purchaser   Estimated Unpaid Principal Balance Original Principal Balance(Dollars in billions) March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 2005-2008GSEs $2 $2 $11Insured Securitizations 3 3 20Uninsured Securitizations and Other 11 12 80Total $16 $17 $111Of the $20 billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans sold directly by our subsidiaries to private-label purchasers who placed the loans into securitizations supported by bond insurance (“Insured Securitizations”), approximately 48% of the original principal balance was covered by bond insurance. Further, approximately $16 billion original principal balance was placed in securitizations as to which the monoline bond insurers have made repurchase-related requests or loan file requests to one of our subsidiaries (“Active Insured Securitizations”) and the remaining approximately $4 billion original principal balance was placed in securitizations as to which the monoline bond insurers have not made repurchase-related requests or loan file requests to one of our subsidiaries (“Inactive Insured Securitizations”). Insured Securitizations often allow the monoline bond insurer to act independently of the investors. Bond insurers typically have indemnity agreements directly with both the mortgage originators and the securitizers, and they often have super-majority rights within the trust documentation that allow them to direct trustees to pursue mortgage repurchase-related requests without coordination with other investors.Because we do not service most of the loans our subsidiaries sold to others, we do not have complete information about the current ownership of a portion of the $80 billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans not sold directly to GSEs or placed in Insured Securitizations. We have determined based on information obtained from third-party databases that about $48 billion original principal balance of these mortgage loans was placed in private-label publicly issued securitizations not supported by bond insurance (“Uninsured Securitizations”). An additional approximately $22 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans were initially sold to private investors as whole loans. Various known and unknown investors purchased the remaining $10 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans.With respect to the $111 billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans originated and sold to others between 2005 and 2008, we estimate that approximately $16 billion in unpaid principal balance remains outstanding as of March 31, 2017, of which approximately $3 billion in unpaid principal balance is at least 90 days delinquent. Approximately $23 billion in losses have been realized by third parties. Because we do not service most of the loans we sold to others, we do not have complete information about the underlying credit performance levels for some of these mortgage loans. These amounts reflect our best estimates, including extrapolations of underlying credit performance where necessary. These estimates are dependent on the availability of performance data. The subsidiaries had open repurchase-related requests with regard to approximately $653 million original principal balance of mortgage loans as of March 31, 2017, a decrease of $716 million from $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2016. 123Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe substantial majority of remaining repurchase requests are related to ongoing litigation. The repurchase-related requests reflect the original principal balance amounts of the mortgage loans at issue and do not correspond to the losses our subsidiary would incur upon the repurchase of these loans. Total repurchase-related requests include all timely requests ever received by our subsidiaries where the requesting party has not formally rescinded the repurchase-related requests or our subsidiary has not agreed to either repurchase the loan at issue or make the requesting party whole with respect to its losses. We have received relatively few repurchase-related requests subsequent to the New York’s highest court ruling in 2015 that the statute of limitations for repurchase claims begins when the relevant representations and warranties were made, as opposed to some later date during the life of the loan. Additionally, we have received relatively few repurchase-related demands for vintages after 2007, mostly because GreenPoint ceased originating mortgages in August 2007.We established reserves for the $11 billion original principal balance of GSE loans, based on open claims and historic repurchase rates. We have entered into and completed repurchase or settlement agreements with respect to the majority of our repurchase exposure to the GSEs.Our reserves could also be impacted by any claims which may be brought by governmental agencies under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (“FIRREA”), the False Claims Act or other federal or state statutes. For example, GreenPoint and Capital One have received requests for information and/or subpoenas from various governmental regulators and law enforcement authorities, including members of the Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (“RMBS”) Working Group, relating to the origination of loans for sale to the GSEs and to RMBS participants. We are cooperating with these regulators and other authorities in responding to such requests.For the $16 billion original principal balance in Active Insured Securitizations, our reserving approach is based upon the expected resolution of litigation directed by the monoline bond insurers. Accordingly, our representation and warranty reserves related to Active Insured Securitizations are litigation reserves. In establishing these litigation reserves, we consider the current and future monoline insurer losses inherent within the securitization and apply legal judgment to the developing factual and legal record to estimate the liability for each securitization. We consider as factors within the analysis our own past monoline settlements in addition to publicly available industry monoline settlements. Our reserves with respect to the U.S. Bank Litigation, referenced below, are related to Active Insured Securitizations. Further, to the extent we have litigation reserves with respect to indemnification risks from certain representation and warranty lawsuits brought by monoline bond insurers against third-party securitizations sponsors, where one of our subsidiaries provided some or all of the mortgage collateral within the securitization but is not a defendant in the litigation, such reserves are also contained within this category.For the $4 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans in Inactive Insured Securitizations and the $48 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans in Uninsured Securitizations, we establish reserves based on an assessment of probable and estimable legal liability, if any, utilizing both our own experience and publicly available industry settlement information to estimate lifetime liability. In contrast with the bond insurers in the Insured Securitizations, investors in Uninsured Securitizations often face a number of legal and logistical hurdles before they can force a securitization trustee to pursue mortgage repurchases, including the need to coordinate with a certain percentage of investors holding the securities and to indemnify the trustee for any litigation it undertakes. Accordingly, we only reserve for such exposures when a trustee or investor with standing brings claims and it is probable we have incurred a loss. Some Uninsured Securitization investors are currently suing investment banks and securitization sponsors under federal and/or state securities laws. Although we face some indirect indemnity risks from these litigations, we generally have not established reserves with respect to these indemnity risks because we do not consider them to be both probable and reasonably estimable liabilities. In addition, to the extent we have litigation reserves with respect to indemnification risks from certain representation and warranty lawsuits brought by parties who purchased loans from our subsidiaries and subsequently re-sold the loans into securitizations, such reserves are also contained within this category.For the $22 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans sold to private investors as whole loans, we establish reserves based on open claims and historical repurchase rates. 124Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe aggregate reserve for all three subsidiaries totaled $516 million as of March 31, 2017 compared to $630 million as of December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to favorable legal developments. The table below summarizes changes in our representation and warranty reserve for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016.Table 14.3: Changes in Representation and Warranty Reserve(1)  Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2017 2016Representation and warranty reserve, beginning of period $630 $610Provision (benefit) for mortgage representation and warranty losses:    Recorded in continuing operations (25) (1)Recorded in discontinued operations (67) 3Total provision (benefit) for mortgage representation and warranty losses (92) 2Net realized recoveries (losses) (22) 1Representation and warranty reserve, end of period $516 $613__________(1) Reported on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities.As part of our business planning processes, we have considered various outcomes relating to the future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are possible but do not rise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying an incremental accrual under applicable accounting standards. Our current best estimate of reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond our reserves as of March 31, 2017 is approximately $1.4 billion, a decrease from our $1.5 billion estimate at December 31, 2016. The estimate as of March 31, 2017 covers all reasonably possible losses relating to representation and warranty claim activity, including those relating to the cases more specifically described below in Mortgage Repurchase Litigation.In estimating reasonably possible future losses in excess of our current reserves, for Active Insured Securitizations, we assume loss rates on the high end of those observed in monoline settlements or court rulings. For our remaining GSE exposures, Uninsured Securitizations and whole loan exposures, our reasonably possible risk estimates assume lifetime loss rates and claims rates at the highest levels of our past experience and also consider the limited instances of observed settlements. We do not however, based on industry precedent, assume claim rates or loss rates for these risk categories will be as high as those assumed for the Active Insured Securitizations. Should the number of claims or the loss rates on these claims increase significantly, our estimate of reasonably possible risk would increase materially. We also assume that repurchase-related requests will be resolved at discounts reflecting the nature of the claims, the vintage of the underlying loans and evolving legal precedents. Notwithstanding our ongoing attempts to estimate a reasonably possible amount of future losses beyond our current accrual levels based on current information, it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and our current estimate of the amount of reasonably possible losses. Our reserve and reasonably possible loss estimates involve considerable judgment and reflect that there is still significant uncertainty regarding numerous factors that may impact the ultimate loss levels, including, but not limited to: litigation outcomes; court rulings; governmental enforcement decisions; future repurchase and indemnification claim levels; securitization trustees pursuing mortgage repurchase litigation unilaterally or in coordination with investors; investors successfully pursuing repurchase litigation independently and without the involvement of the trustee as a party; ultimate repurchase and indemnification rates; future mortgage loan performance levels; actual recoveries on the collateral; and macroeconomic conditions (including unemployment levels and housing prices). In light of the significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability our subsidiaries may incur from these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period. 125Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSLitigationIn accordance with the current accounting standards for loss contingencies, we establish reserves for litigation related matters that arise from the ordinary course of our business activities when it is probable that a loss associated with a claim or proceeding has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. None of the amounts we currently have recorded individually or in the aggregate are considered to be material to our financial condition. Litigation claims and proceedings of all types are subject to many uncertain factors that generally cannot be predicted with assurance. Below we provide a description of potentially material legal proceedings and claims.For some of the matters disclosed below, we are able to determine estimates of potential future outcomes that are not probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying either the establishment of a reserve or an incremental reserve build, but which are reasonably possible outcomes. For other disclosed matters, such an estimate is not possible at this time. For those matters below where an estimate is possible (excluding the reasonably possible future losses relating to the Mortgage Repurchase Litigation described below, which are included within the estimate of reasonably possible representation and warranty losses discussed above), management currently estimates the reasonably possible future losses beyond our reserves as of March 31, 2017 is approximately $200 million. Notwithstanding our attempt to estimate a reasonably possible range of loss beyond our current accrual levels for some litigation matters based on current information, it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and the range of reasonably possible losses disclosed here. Given the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters, especially those involving governmental agencies, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from these litigation matters and an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period.Interchange LitigationIn 2005, a number of entities, each purporting to represent a class of retail merchants, filed antitrust lawsuits against MasterCard and Visa and several member banks, including our subsidiaries and us, alleging among other things, that the defendants conspired to fix the level of interchange fees. The complaints seek injunctive relief and civil monetary damages, which could be trebled. Separately, a number of large merchants have asserted similar claims against Visa and MasterCard only (together with the lawsuits described above, “Interchange Lawsuits”). In October 2005, the class and merchant Interchange Lawsuits were consolidated before the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for certain purposes, including discovery. In July 2012, the parties executed and filed with the court a Memorandum of Understanding agreeing to resolve the litigation on certain terms set forth in a settlement agreement attached to the Memorandum. The class settlement provides for, among other things, (i) payments by defendants to the class and individual plaintiffs totaling approximately $6.6 billion; (ii) a distribution to the class merchants of an amount equal to 10 basis points of certain interchange transactions for a period of eight months; and (iii) modifications to certain Visa and MasterCard rules regarding point of sale practices. In December 2013, the district court granted final approval of the proposed class settlement, which was appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in January 2014. On June 30, 2016, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the district court’s certification of the class, reversed approval of the proposed class settlement, and remanded the litigation to the district court for further proceedings, ruling that some of the merchants that were part of the proposed class settlement were not adequately represented. Because the Second Circuit ruling remands the litigation to the district court for further proceedings, the ultimate outcome in this matter is uncertain. Several merchant plaintiffs also opted out of the class settlement before it was overturned, and some of those plaintiffs have sued MasterCard, Visa and various member banks, including Capital One. The opt-out cases are consolidated before the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for certain purposes, including discovery. Visa and MasterCard have settled a number of individual opt-out cases, requiring non-material payments from all banks, including Capital One. Separate settlement and judgment sharing agreements between Capital One, MasterCard and Visa allocate the liabilities of any judgment or settlement arising from the Interchange Lawsuits and associated opt-out cases. Visa created a litigation escrow account following its IPO of stock in 2008, which funds any settlements for its member banks, and any settlements related to MasterCard allocated losses are reflected in Capital One’s reserves.Mortgage Repurchase LitigationIn February 2009, GreenPoint was named as a defendant in a lawsuit commenced in the New York County Supreme Court, by U.S. Bank, N. A., Syncora Guarantee Inc. and CIFG Assurance North America, Inc. (“U.S. Bank Litigation”). Plaintiffs allege, among other things, that GreenPoint breached certain representations and warranties in two contracts pursuant to which GreenPoint sold approximately 30,000 mortgage loans having an aggregate original principal balance of approximately $1.8 billion to a purchaser that ultimately transferred most of these mortgage loans to a securitization trust. Some of the securities issued by the  126Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTStrust were insured by Syncora and CIFG. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and an order compelling GreenPoint to repurchase the entire portfolio of 30,000 mortgage loans based on alleged breaches of representations and warranties relating to a limited sampling of loans in the portfolio, or, alternatively, the repurchase of specific mortgage loans to which the alleged breaches of representations and warranties relate. In March 2010, the court granted GreenPoint’s motion to dismiss with respect to plaintiffs Syncora and CIFG but denied the motion with respect to U.S. Bank. GreenPoint subsequently answered the complaint with respect to U.S. Bank, denying the allegations, and filed a counterclaim against U.S. Bank alleging breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In February 2012, the court denied plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file an amended complaint and dismissed Syncora and CIFG from the case. Syncora and CIFG appealed their dismissal to the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department (“First Department”), which affirmed the dismissal in April 2013. The New York Court of Appeals denied Syncora’s and CIFG’s motion for leave to appeal the First Department’s decision in February 2014. Therefore, the case is now proceeding with U.S. Bank as the sole plaintiff.In May, June and July 2012, FHFA (acting as conservator for Freddie Mac) filed three summonses with notice in the New York state court against GreenPoint, on behalf of the trustees for three RMBS trusts backed by loans originated by GreenPoint with an aggregate original principal balance of $3.4 billion. In January 2013, the plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint in the name of the three trusts, acting by the respective trustees, alleging breaches of contractual representations and warranties regarding compliance with GreenPoint underwriting guidelines relating to certain loans (“FHFA Litigation”). Plaintiffs seek specific performance of the repurchase obligations with respect to the loans for which they have provided notice of alleged breaches as well as all other allegedly breaching loans, rescissory damages, indemnification, costs and interest. On March 29, 2017, the trial court granted GreenPoint’s motion for summary judgment and dismissed plaintiff’s claims as untimely.As noted above in the section entitled Mortgage Representation and Warranty Liabilities, the Company’s subsidiaries establish reserves with respect to representation and warranty litigation matters, where appropriate, within the Company’s overall representation and warranty reserves. Anti-Money Laundering Capital One is being investigated by the New York District Attorney’s Office (“NYDA”), the Department of Justice and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) of the U.S. Department of Treasury with respect to certain former check casher clients of the Commercial Banking business and Capital One’s anti-money laundering (“AML”) program. Capital One is cooperating with all agencies involved in the investigation.In addition, Capital One is subject to an open consent order with the OCC dated July 10, 2015 concerning regulatory deficiencies in our AML program.Intellectual Ventures Corp., et al.In June 2013, Intellectual Ventures I, LLC and Intellectual Ventures II, LLC (collectively “IV”) sued Capital One Financial Corp., Capital One Bank (USA), N.A. and Capital One, N.A. (collectively “Capital One”) for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. In the Complaint, IV alleged infringement of patents related to various business processes across the Capital One enterprise. IV simultaneously filed patent infringement actions against numerous other financial institutions on the same and other patents in several other federal courts. Capital One filed an answer and counterclaim alleging antitrust violations. In December 2013, the court dismissed Capital One’s counterclaim and decided the parties’ arguments on claim construction. IV agreed to dismiss two patents in suit, and following claim construction, asked for a stipulation of non-infringement for one patent with an opportunity to appeal the court’s decision regarding claim construction. In April 2014, the court granted Capital One’s motion for summary judgment and found that the two remaining patents were either unpatentable or indefinite. In May 2014, IV appealed to the Federal Circuit, which affirmed the district court’s dismissal of all three remaining patents in July 2015. In January 2014, IV filed a second suit against Capital One for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. In the complaint, IV again alleges infringement of patents related to various business practices across the Capital One enterprise. In March 2015, the court granted Capital One’s motion for leave to add a counterclaim for antitrust violations. IV voluntarily dismissed one of the patents against Capital One and in September 2015, the court granted summary judgment in favor of Capital One on the remaining four patents and dismissed IV’s claims. IV appealed the dismissal of three of its claims to the Federal Circuit, which affirmed the district court’s dismissal in March 2017. The only claims remaining in the trial court are Capital One’s counterclaims for antitrust violations by IV. The parties are engaged in discovery related to the counterclaims. 127Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSOther Pending and Threatened LitigationIn addition, we are commonly subject to various pending and threatened legal actions relating to the conduct of our normal business activities. In the opinion of management, the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of all such other pending or threatened legal actions will not be material to our consolidated financial position or our results of operations. 128Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsItem 3.

Controls and Procedures OverviewWe are required under applicable laws and regulations to maintain controls and procedures, which include disclosure controls and procedures as well as internal control over financial reporting, as further described below.(a) Disclosure Controls and ProceduresDisclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our financial reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding our required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we must apply judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures.Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresAs required by Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of March 31, 2017, the end of the period covered by this Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2017, at a reasonable level of assurance, in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting information required to be disclosed within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms.(b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingWe regularly review our disclosure controls and procedures and make changes intended to ensure the quality of our financial reporting. There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred in the first quarter of 2017 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 129Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsPART II—OTHER INFORMATION Item 1.
