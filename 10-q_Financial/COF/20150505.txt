Unless otherwise specified, references to notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements as of March 31, 2015 included in this Report. Management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial condition. The following MD&A is intended to provide the reader with an understanding of our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity by focusing on changes from year to year in certain key measures used by management to evaluate performance, such as profitability, growth and credit quality metrics. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes in this Report and the more detailed information contained in our 2014 Form 10-K. INTRODUCTIONWe are a diversified financial services holding company with banking and non-banking subsidiaries. Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through branches, the internet and other distribution channels. As of March 31, 2015, our principal subsidiaries included:•Capital One Bank (USA), National Association (“COBNA”), which offers credit and debit card products, other lending products and deposit products; and•Capital One, National Association (“CONA”), which offers a broad spectrum of banking products and financial services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients.The Company is hereafter collectively referred to as “we,” “us” or “our.” COBNA and CONA are collectively referred to as the “Banks.” Certain business terms used in this document are defined in the “Glossary and Acronyms” section and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this Report. We had total loans held for investment of $204.0 billion, deposits of $210.4 billion and stockholders’ equity of $45.7 billion as of March 31, 2015, compared with total loans held for investment of $208.3 billion, deposits of $205.5 billion and stockholders’ equity of $45.1 billion as of December 31, 2014. Our consolidated total net revenues are derived primarily from lending to consumer and commercial customers net of funding costs associated with interest on deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. We also earn non-interest income which primarily consists of interchange income net of rewards expenses and service charges and other customer-related fees. Our expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating expenses (including salaries and associate benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, professional services, communication and data processing expenses and other miscellaneous expenses), marketing expenses and income taxes.Our principal operations are currently organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group, are included in the Other category.•Credit Card: Consists of our domestic consumer and small business card lending, national closed-end installment lending and the international card lending businesses in Canada and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”). 1Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents•Consumer Banking: Consists of our branch-based lending and deposit gathering activities for consumers and small businesses and national deposit gathering, auto lending and consumer home loan lending and servicing activities.•Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending, deposit gathering and servicing activities provided to commercial real estate and commercial and industrial customers. Our commercial and industrial customers typically include companies with annual revenues between $10 million and $1 billion.Recent Acquisitions and DispositionsWe regularly explore and evaluate opportunities to acquire financial services companies and financial assets, including credit card and other loan portfolios, and enter into strategic partnerships as part of our growth strategy. We also explore opportunities to acquire digital companies and related assets to improve our information technology infrastructure and to deliver on our digital strategy. We also regularly consider the potential disposition of certain assets, branches, partnership agreements or lines of business. We may issue equity or debt in connection with acquisitions, including public offerings, to fund such acquisitions. We did not have any significant acquisitions or dispositions in 2014 or the first quarter of 2015. 2Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsSUMMARY OF SELECTED FINANCIAL DATAThe following table presents selected consolidated financial data from our results of operations for the first quarters of 2015 and 2014 and selected comparative balance sheet data as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.

In comparison, we reported net income of $1.2 billion ($1.96 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $5.4 billion for the first quarter of 2014.Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, as calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach, including transition provisions, was 12.46% as of both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. We formally entered parallel run for Basel III Advanced Approaches on January 1, 2015. See “Capital Management” below for additional information.On March 26, 2014, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of shares of our common stock (the “2014 Stock Repurchase Program”). As of March 31, 2015, we completed the 2014 Stock Repurchase Program. Additionally, on March 11, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to $3.125 billion of shares of our common stock (the “2015 Stock Repurchase Program”) beginning in the second quarter of 2015 through the end of the second quarter of 2016. The Board of Directors also authorized an increase in the quarterly dividend on our common stock from the current level of $0.30 per share to $0.40 per share. See “Capital Management” below for additional information.Below are additional highlights of our performance in the first quarter of 2015. These highlights generally are based on a comparison between the results of the first quarters of 2015 and 2014, except as otherwise noted. The changes in our financial condition and credit performance are generally based on our financial condition and credit performance as of March 31, 2015 compared to our financial condition and credit performance as of December 31, 2014. We provide a more detailed discussion of our financial performance in the sections following this “Executive Summary and Business Outlook.”Total Company•Earnings: Our net income remained flat at $1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014 as the increase in net income from continuing operations was offset by the decrease in net income from discontinued operations. The increase in net income from continuing operations was driven by (i) an increase in interest income due to growth in our credit card, auto and commercial loan portfolios partially offset by the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio; and (ii) an increase in non-interest income primarily attributable to higher interchange fees partially offset by lower service charges and other customer-related fees in our Credit Card business. These increases were partially offset by (i) an increase in provision for credit losses due to the change from an allowance release in the first quarter of 2014 to an allowance build in the first quarter of 2015; and (ii) an increase in non-interest expense driven by higher operating and marketing expenses associated with loan growth. The decrease in net income from discontinued operations was due to a smaller release in representation and warranty reserve in the first quarter of 2015.•Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment decreased by $4.3 billion, or 2%, to $204.0 billion as of March 31, 2015 from December 31, 2014, driven by seasonal paydowns in our credit card loan portfolio in our Credit Card business and the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio partially offset by growth in the auto loan portfolio in our Consumer Banking business. Average loans held for investment increased by $11.5 billion, or 6%, to $205.2 billion in the first quarter of 2015, compared to the first quarter 2014, primarily due to continued strong auto loan originations  5Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contentsoutpacing the planned run-off of the acquired home loan portfolio in our Consumer Banking business and growth in our commercial and credit card loan portfolios. •Net Charge-off and Delinquency Statistics: Our net charge-off rate decreased by 20 basis points to 1.72% in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014, primarily driven by lower charge-offs in our Credit Card business and average loan growth. The overall low net charge-off rates compared to our historical levels were largely due to continued economic improvement and portfolio seasoning. Our 30+ day delinquency rate declined to 2.58% as of March 31, 2015 from 2.91% as of December 31, 2014, primarily due to seasonally lower delinquency inventories. We provide additional information on our credit quality metrics below under “Business Segment Financial Performance” and “Credit Risk Profile.”•Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses: Our allowance for loan and lease losses increased by $22 million to $4.4 billion as of March 31, 2015 from December 31, 2014. The increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses was primarily driven by portfolio-specific risks in our commercial loan portfolio in our Commercial Banking business and loan growth in our auto loan portfolio in our Consumer Banking business, partially offset by an allowance release as credit improved in our credit card loan portfolio in our Credit Card business. The allowance coverage ratio increased by 6 basis points to 2.16% as of March 31, 2015 from December 31, 2014.•Representation and Warranty Reserve: The mortgage representation and warranty reserve decreased by $58 million to $673 million as of March 31, 2015 from December 31, 2014. The decrease in the representation and warranty reserve was primarily driven by claims paid and legal developments, which includes settlements. We recorded a net benefit for mortgage representation and warranty losses of $18 million (which includes a provision of $1 million before taxes in continuing operations and a benefit of $19 million before taxes in discontinued operations) in the first quarter of 2015. Business Segment Financial PerformanceTable 2 summarizes our business segment results, which we report based on revenue and income from continuing operations, net of tax, for the first quarters of 2015 and 2014. We provide information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results under “Note 19—Business Segments” in our 2014 Form 10-K. We also provide a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our consolidated generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) results in “Note 13—Business Segments” of this Report.

Period-end loans held for investment in our Credit Card business decreased by $4.1 billion to $81.8 billion as of March 31, 2015 from December 31, 2014, primarily due to expected seasonal paydowns.•Consumer Banking: Our Consumer Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $266 million in the first quarter of 2015, compared to net income from continuing operations of $330 million in the first quarter of 2014. The decrease in net income was primarily attributable to an allowance build in the first quarter of 2015 compared to a release in the first quarter of 2014 and higher non-interest expenses largely driven by higher infrastructure spending in our retail banking business and growth in our auto loan portfolio. The decrease was partially offset by higher net interest income generated by growth in our auto loan portfolio partially offset by the planned run-off of the acquired home loan portfolio. Period-end loans held for investment in our Consumer Banking business decreased by $60 million to $71.4 billion as of March 31, 2015 from December 31, 2014, primarily due to the continued run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio mostly offset by growth in the auto loan portfolio. •Commercial Banking: Our Commercial Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $155 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to net income from continuing operations of $137 million in the first quarter of 2014. The increase in net income was primarily due to higher revenue net of related operating expenses driven by the growth in our average commercial loan portfolio, as well as increased fee-based services and products, partially offset by a larger allowance build. Period-end loans held for investment in our Commercial Banking business decreased by $149 million to $50.7 billion as of March 31, 2015 from December 31, 2014.Business Outlook We discuss below our current expectations regarding our total company performance and the performance of each of our business segments over the near-term based on market conditions, the regulatory environment and our business strategies as of the time we filed this Report. The statements contained in this section are based on our current expectations regarding our outlook for our financial results and business strategies. Our expectations take into account, and should be read in conjunction with, our expectations regarding economic trends and analysis of our business as discussed in “Part I—Item 1. Business” and “Part I—Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2014 Form 10-K. Certain statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise disclosed, forward-looking statements do not reflect: (i) any change in current dividend or repurchase strategies, (ii) the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures or similar transactions that have not been previously disclosed, or (iii) any changes in laws, regulations or regulatory interpretations, in each case after the date as of which such statements are made. See “Forward-Looking Statements” in this Report for more information on forward-looking statements included in this Report and “Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2014 Form 10-K for factors that could materially influence our results.Total Company ExpectationsWe delivered attractive risk-adjusted returns in the first quarter of 2015, and we expect that will continue. For full-year 2015, we expect growth in revenues compared to 2014, driven by growth in average loans. We expect the full-year 2015 efficiency ratio to be at the higher end of a range between 53.5% and 54.5%, or possibly modestly above that range, excluding non-recurring items. We are experiencing very strong Domestic Card growth, and we are likely to increase marketing to take advantage of the opportunities we see to help sustain the current trajectory. While growth opportunities would drive long-term value creation, higher marketing and the higher operating expense of additional volumes would put pressure on our efficiency ratio. We also expect that the ratio will vary, perhaps significantly, from quarter to quarter based on factors such as day count, the timing of growth and associated revenues, and the timing of investments throughout the year. We believe our actions have created a well-positioned balance sheet with strong capital and liquidity. Pursuant to our approved 2015 capital plan, we increased our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.30 per share to $0.40 per share starting in the second quarter of 2015. We also expect to repurchase up to $3.125 billion of shares of our common stock pursuant to the 2015 Stock Repurchase Program beginning in the second quarter of 2015 through the second quarter of 2016. The timing and exact amount of any common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including market conditions, opportunities for growth, and our capital position and amount of retained earnings. The 2015 Stock Repurchase Program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time. See “MD&A—Capital Management—Dividend Policy and Stock Purchases” for more information. 7Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsBusiness Segment ExpectationsCredit Card: In our Domestic Card business, as first quarter delinquency favorability rolls through to charge-offs, we expect quarterly charge-off rates in the lower end of our previously communicated mid-to-high 3% range, perhaps even getting into the low 3% range at the third quarter seasonal low point. Longer term, as new loan balances season, we expect growth to put upward pressure on the charge-off rate. While this impact on the charge-off rate is modest at first, we expect that the impact will grow throughout 2015 and beyond. We expect growth to drive our quarterly charge-off rate to be in the mid-to-high three percent range in the fourth quarter, and higher from there in 2016. In addition, we expect growth to drive allowance additions going forward. In the near term, we also expect favorable credit to drive lower-than-expected past due fees, putting modest pressure on revenue. We believe that our Credit Card business is well-positioned to deliver growth with attractive and resilient returns. Consumer Banking: In our Consumer Banking business, we continue to experience a change in product mix as a result of continued growth in auto originations offset by the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio. While our auto business remains well-positioned, we remain cautious and continue to closely monitor pricing, underwriting practices, used vehicle prices and other competitor and market factors. Returns on new auto originations are lower than returns in the overall auto loan portfolio, but remain resilient and within ranges that support an attractive business. We expect to continue to pursue opportunities in our auto business that are consistent with our long-standing focus on resilience, including adding new relationships with well-qualified dealers and gaining a greater share of originations with existing dealers. We expect persistently low interest rates will continue to pressure returns in our deposit businesses, even if rates begin to rise in 2015. Commercial Banking: Commercial charge-offs, non-performing loans and criticized loans remain strong. While we continue to closely manage credit risk, we do not expect these levels to be sustainable through the cycle. Our Commercial Banking business is well-positioned to navigate a challenging environment, in which intense competition continues to put pressure on growth, margins and returns.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses on the consolidated financial statements. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We provide a summary of our significant accounting policies under “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2014 Form 10-K.We have identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. These critical accounting policies govern:•Loan loss reserves•Asset impairment•Fair value of financial instruments•Representation and warranty reserves•Customer rewards reservesWe evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them, as necessary, based on changing conditions. Management has discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.We provide additional information on our critical accounting policies and estimates under “MD&A—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in our 2014 Form 10-K.ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTSAccounting for Derivative Assets and Liabilities 8Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)As of January 1, 2015, we changed our accounting principle to move from a gross basis of presentation to a net basis, for presenting qualifying derivative assets and liabilities, as well as the related fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable), for instruments executed with the same counterparty where a right of setoff exists. This newly adopted policy is preferable as it more accurately reflects the Company’s counterparty credit risk as well as our contractual rights and obligations under these arrangements. Further, this change will align our presentation with that of the majority of our peer institutions. We retrospectively adopted this change in accounting principle and our consolidated balance sheet has been recast for all prior periods presented. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe section below provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated financial performance for the first quarters of 2015 and 2014. Following this section, we provide a discussion of our business segment results. You should read this section together with our “Executive Summary and Business Outlook” where we discuss trends and other factors that we expect will affect our future results of operations.Net Interest IncomeNet interest income represents the difference between the interest income, including certain fees, earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense on our interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities and other interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, and other borrowings. Generally, we include in interest income any past due fees on loans that we deem collectible. Our net interest margin, based on our consolidated results, represents the difference between the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, including the notional impact of non-interest bearing funding. We expect net interest income and our net interest margin to fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  9Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 3 below presents, for each major category of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the average outstanding balances, interest income earned, interest expense incurred, average yield and rate for the first quarters of 2015 and 2014.Table 3: Average Balances, Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin(1)  Three Months Ended March 31,  2015 2014(Dollars in millions) AverageBalance InterestIncome/Expense(2)(3) Yield/Rate AverageBalance InterestIncome/Expense(2)(3) Yield/RateAssets:            Interest-earning assets:            Loans:            Credit card:            Domestic credit card $74,875 $2,660 14.21% $69,800 $2,478 14.20%International credit card 7,811 291 14.90 7,690 319 16.59Total credit card 82,686 2,951 14.28 77,490 2,797 14.44Consumer banking 71,595 1,120 6.26 70,836 1,094 6.18Commercial banking 51,461 415 3.23 45,561 395 3.47Other 112 54 192.86 133 21 63.16Total loans, including loans held for sale 205,854 4,540 8.82 194,020 4,307 8.88Investment securities 63,181 406 2.57 62,124 416 2.68Cash equivalents and other interest-earning assets 9,392 28 1.19 6,515 30 1.84Total interest-earning assets $278,427 $4,974 7.15 $262,659 $4,753 7.24Cash and due from banks 3,099     2,881    Allowance for loan and lease losses (4,371)     (4,306)    Premises and equipment, net 3,701     3,838    Other assets 28,545     28,479    Total assets $309,401     $293,551    Liabilities and stockholders’ equity:            Interest-bearing liabilities:            Deposits $182,998 $271 0.59 $184,183 $276 0.60Securitized debt obligations 11,563 33 1.14 10,418 38 1.46Senior and subordinated notes 20,595 79 1.53 14,162 77 2.17Other borrowings and liabilities 14,721 15 0.41 11,398 12 0.42Total interest-bearing liabilities $229,877 $398 0.69 $220,161 $403 0.73Non-interest bearing deposits 24,853     21,659    Other liabilities 8,274     8,872    Total liabilities 263,004     250,692    Stockholders’ equity 46,397     42,859    Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity $309,401     $293,551    Net interest income/spread   $4,576 6.46   $4,350 6.51Impact of non-interest bearing funding     0.11     0.11Net interest margin     6.57%     6.62%__________ (1)  As of January 1, 2015, we changed our accounting principle to move from a gross basis of presentation to a net basis, for presenting qualifying derivative assets and liabilities, as well as the related right to reclaim cash collateral or obligation to return cash collateral. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for additional information. Prior period results have been recast to conform to this presentation. (2) Past due fees included in interest income totaled approximately $354 million and $359 million in the first quarters of 2015 and 2014, respectively.(3) Interest income and interest expense and the calculation of average yields on interest-earning assets and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities include the impact of hedge accounting.Net interest income increased by $226 million or 5%, to $4.6 billion in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014, primarily driven by higher average interest-earning assets due to continued strong growth in our auto, commercial and credit  10Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contentscard loan portfolios. The net interest margin decreased 5 basis points to 6.57% in the first quarter of 2015 primarily attributable to lower yield on average interest earning assets, partially offset by lower cost of funds.Table 4 displays the change in our net interest income between periods and the extent to which the variance is attributable to: (i) changes in the volume of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; or (ii) changes in the interest rates related to these assets and liabilities.Table 4: Rate/Volume Analysis of Net Interest Income(1)   Three Months Ended March 31,  2015 vs. 2014(Dollars in millions) Total Variance Volume RateInterest income:      Loans:      Credit card $154 $185 $(31)Consumer banking 26 12 14Commercial banking 20 47 (27)Other 33 (3) 36Total loans, including loans held for sale 233 241 (8)Investment securities (10) 7 (17)Cash equivalents and other interest-earning assets (2) 9 (11)Total interest income 221 257 (36)Interest expense:      Deposits (5) (2) (3)Securitized debt obligations (5) 3 (8)Senior and subordinated notes 2 25 (23)Other borrowings and liabilities 3 4 (1)Total interest expense (5) 30 (35)Net interest income $226 $227 $(1) __________ (1) We calculate the change in interest income and interest expense separately for each item. The portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate is allocated proportionately when the calculation results in a positive value. When the portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate results in a negative value, the total amount is allocated to volume or rate, depending on which amount is positive.Non-Interest IncomeNon-interest income primarily consists of interchange income net of rewards expense, service charges and other customer-related fees, and other non-interest income. Other non-interest income includes the pre-tax net benefit (provision) for mortgage representation and warranty losses related to continuing operations. It also includes gains and losses from the sale of investment securities, gains and losses on derivatives not accounted for in hedge accounting relationships, and hedge ineffectiveness, which we generally do not allocate to our business segments because they relate to centralized asset/liability and market risk management activities undertaken by our Corporate Treasury group.  11Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 5 displays the components of non-interest income for the first quarters of 2015 and 2014.Table 5: Non-Interest Income  Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2015 2014Service charges and other customer-related fees $437 $474Interchange fees, net 496 440Net other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings (15) (5)Other non-interest income:    Provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses(1) (1) (14)Net gains from the sale of investment securities 2 13Net fair value gains on free-standing derivatives 10 13Other 142 99Total other non-interest income 153 111Total non-interest income $1,071 $1,020 __________ (1) Represents the provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses recorded in continuing operations. For the total impact to the net provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses, including the portion recognized in our consolidated statements of income as a component of discontinued operations, see “MD&A—Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis—Table 14: Changes in Representation and Warranty Reserve.”Non-interest income increased by $51 million, or 5%, to $1.1 billion in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter 2014. The main drivers for the increase in non-interest income include (i) an increase in interchange fees due to strong purchase volume in our Credit Card business; (ii) higher other non-interest income driven by growth in our commercial and multifamily real estate business; and (iii) lower provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses. The increase was partially offset by other customer-related fees in our Credit Card business.Provision for Credit LossesOur provision for credit losses in each period is driven by net charge-offs, changes to the allowance for loan and lease losses and changes to the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $935 million and $735 million in the first quarters of 2015 and 2014, respectively. The provision for credit losses as a percentage of net interest income was 20.4% and 16.9%, in the first quarters of 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in the provision for credit losses of $200 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014, was primarily due to (i) a smaller release in the allowance for loan and lease losses in our credit card portfolio, partially offset by lower net charge-offs; (ii) a larger allowance build and higher net charge-offs due to the growth in our auto loan portfolio; and (iii) a larger allowance build in our commercial loan portfolio attributable to portfolio-specific risks.We provide additional information on the provision for credit losses and changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses within “Credit Risk Profile—Summary of Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses,” “Note 4—Loans” and “Note 5—Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.” For information on the allowance methodology for each of our loan categories, see “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2014 Form 10-K.Non-Interest ExpenseNon-interest expense consists of ongoing operating costs, such as salaries and associate benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, professional services, communications and data processing expenses and other miscellaneous expenses, as well as marketing costs and amortization of intangibles.  12Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 6 displays the components of non-interest expense for the first quarters of 2015 and 2014.Table 6: Non-Interest Expense  Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2015 2014Salaries and associate benefits $1,211 $1,161Occupancy and equipment 435 405Marketing 375 325Professional services 296 287Communications and data processing 202 196Amortization of intangibles 110 143Other non-interest expense:    Collections 84 99Fraud losses 67 73Bankcard, regulatory and other fee assessments 109 113Other 160 130Other non-interest expense 420 415Total non-interest expense $3,049 $2,932Non-interest expense increased by $117 million, or 4%, to $3.0 billion in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014, primarily driven by (i) higher expenses related to technology and digital investments; (ii) higher marketing and operating expenses attributable to growth in our auto, commercial and credit card loan portfolios; and (iii) higher provision for litigation matters. These increases were partially offset by a decline in the amortization of intangibles.Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of TaxIncome from discontinued operations reflects ongoing costs, which primarily consist of mortgage loan repurchase representation and warranty charges, related to the mortgage origination operations of our wholesale mortgage banking unit, GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, Inc. (“GreenPoint”), which was closed in 2007. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $19 million in the first quarter of 2015, compared to $30 million in the first quarter of 2014. We recorded a total pre-tax benefit for mortgage representation and warranty reserve of $19 million ($12 million net of tax) in the first quarter of 2015, compared to $47 million ($30 million net of tax) in the first quarter of 2014.We provide additional information on the net provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses and the related reserve for representation and warranty claims in “Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis—Mortgage Representation and Warranty Reserve” and “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others.”Income TaxesWe recorded income tax provisions of $529 million (31.8% effective income tax rate) and $579 million (34.0% effective income tax rate) in the first quarters of 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations varies between periods due, in part, to fluctuations in our pre-tax earnings, which affects the relative tax benefit of tax-exempt income, tax credits and other permanent tax items.The decrease in our effective income tax rate in the first quarter of 2015, from the first quarter of 2014, was primarily attributable to increased net tax credits and reduced discrete tax expense. We recorded discrete tax expense of $28 million in the first quarter of 2014 for certain state law changes that required a reduction of deferred tax assets and adjustments for the resolution of certain tax issues and audits. In comparison, we recorded net discrete tax expense of $2 million in the first quarter of 2015. Our effective income tax rate, excluding the impact of discrete tax items discussed above, was 31.7% and 32.4% in the first quarters of 2015 and 2014, respectively.We provide additional information on items affecting our income taxes and effective tax rate under “Note 17—Income Taxes” in our 2014 Form 10-K. 13Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsBUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEOur principal operations are currently organized into three major business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group, are included in the Other category.The results of our individual businesses, which we report on a continuing operations basis, reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. We provide additional information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in “Note 19—Business Segments” in our 2014 Form 10-K.We refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our “managed” presentation, which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on U.S. GAAP. There is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to U.S. GAAP; therefore, the managed presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial services companies. In addition, our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Below we summarize our business segment results for the first quarters of 2015 and 2014 and provide a comparative discussion of these results. We also discuss changes in our financial condition and credit performance statistics as of March 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014. We provide a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated results in “Note 13—Business Segments.” Additionally, we provide information on the outlook for each of our business segments as described above under “Executive Summary and Business Outlook.”Credit Card BusinessThe primary sources of revenue for our Credit Card business are interest income, fees collected from customers and interchange fees. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs such as salaries and associate benefits, occupancy and equipment, professional services, communications and data processing expenses and marketing expenses. Rewards costs are generally netted against interchange fees.Our Credit Card business generated net income from continuing operations of $668 million in both the first quarters of 2015 and 2014.  14Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 7 summarizes the financial results of our Credit Card business, which is comprised of Domestic Card and International Card, and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.Table 7: Credit Card Business Results  Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2015 2014 ChangeSelected income statement data:      Net interest income $2,666 $2,525 6%Non-interest income 816 785 4Total net revenue(1) 3,482 3,310 5Provision for credit losses 669 558 20Non-interest expense 1,776 1,726 3Income from continuing operations before income taxes 1,037 1,026 1Income tax provision 369 358 3Income from continuing operations, net of tax $668 $668 —Selected performance metrics:      Average loans held for investment(2) $82,581 $77,502 7Average yield on loans held for investment(3) 14.30% 14.43% (13)bpsTotal net revenue margin(4) 16.87 17.08 (21)Net charge-offs $719 $780 (8)%Net charge-off rate 3.48% 4.02% (54)bpsCard loan premium amortization and other intangible accretion(5) $11 $37 (70)%Purchased credit card relationship (“PCCR”) intangible amortization 84 98 (14)Purchase volume(6) 57,383 47,434 21       (Dollars in millions) March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 ChangeSelected period-end data:      Loans held for investment(2) $81,754 $85,876 (5)%30+ day performing delinquency rate 2.91% 3.24% (33)bps30+ day delinquency rate 2.97 3.30 (33)Nonperforming loan rate 0.08 0.08 —Allowance for loan and lease losses $3,130 $3,204 (2)%Allowance coverage ratio(7) 3.83% 3.73% 10bps__________(1) We recognize billed finance charges and fee income on open-ended loans in accordance with the contractual provisions of the credit arrangements and estimate the uncollectible amount on a quarterly basis.

The increase in net interest income was primarily driven by loan growth in the Domestic Card business.•Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income increased by $31 million, or 4%, to $816 million in the first quarter of 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in interchange fees driven by higher purchase volume, partially offset by a decline in service charges and other customer-related fees in our Credit Card business.•Provision for Credit Losses: The provision for credit losses increased by $111 million, or 20%, to $669 million in the first quarter of 2015. The increase was primarily due to a smaller release in the allowance for loan and lease losses in our Domestic Card business, partially offset by lower net charge-offs across the Credit Card business. •Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $50 million, or 3%, to $1.8 billion in the first quarter of 2015. The increase was largely due to higher marketing expenses associated with loan growth, partially offset by lower operating expenses and lower PCCR intangible amortization.•Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment decreased by $4.1 billion, or 5%, to $81.8 billion as of March 31, 2015 from December 31, 2014, primarily due to expected seasonal paydowns. Average loans held for investment increased by $5.1 billion, or 7%, to $82.6 billion in the first quarter of 2015 compared to first quarter of 2014, primarily due to loan growth in the Domestic Card business.•Net Charge-off and Delinquency Statistics: Our net charge-off rate decreased by 54 basis points to 3.48% in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014 largely due to loan growth, continued economic improvement and portfolio seasoning. The 30+ day delinquency rate decreased 33 basis points to 2.97% as of March 31, 2015 from December 31, 2014 due to seasonally lower delinquency inventories.Domestic Card BusinessDomestic Card generated net income from continuing operations of $621 million and $595 million in the first quarters of 2015 and 2014, respectively. Domestic Card accounted for 91% of total net revenues of our Credit Card business in the first quarter of 2015 compared to 89% in the first quarter of 2014. Income attributable to Domestic Card represented 93% of net income for our Credit Card business in the first quarter of 2015, compared to 89% in the first quarter of 2014.  16Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 7.1 summarizes the financial results for Domestic Card and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.Table 7.1: Domestic Card Business Results  Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2015 2014 ChangeSelected income statement data:      Net interest income $2,421 $2,255 7%Non-interest income 743 702 6Total net revenue(1) 3,164 2,957 7Provision for credit losses 610 486 26Non-interest expense 1,580 1,545 2Income from continuing operations before income taxes 974 926 5Income tax provision 353 331 7Income from continuing operations, net of tax $621 $595 4Selected performance metrics:      Average loans held for investment(2) $74,770 $69,810 7Average yield on loans held for investment(3) 14.23% 14.19% 4bpsTotal net revenue margin(4) 16.93 16.94 (1)Net charge-offs $664 $700 (5)%Net charge-off rate 3.55% 4.01% (46)bpsCard loan premium amortization and other intangible accretion(5) $11 $37 (70)%PCCR intangible amortization 84 98 (14)Purchase volume(6) 52,025 44,139 18       (Dollars in millions) March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 ChangeSelected period-end data:      Loans held for investment(2) $74,131 $77,704 (5)%30+ day delinquency rate 2.92% 3.27% (35)bpsAllowance for loan and lease losses $2,824 $2,878 (2)%Allowance coverage ratio(7) 3.81% 3.70% 11bps__________(1) We recognize billed finance charges and fee income on open-ended loans in accordance with the contractual provisions of the credit arrangements and estimate the uncollectible amount on a quarterly basis.

The primary driver of the increase in net income for our Domestic Card business in the first quarter of 2015, compared to the first quarter of 2014, was higher revenue primarily driven by loan growth partially offset by higher provision for credit losses largely due to a smaller release in the allowance for loan and lease losses. 17Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsInternational Card BusinessInternational Card generated net income from continuing operations of $47 million and $73 million in the first quarters of 2015 and 2014, respectively. Income attributable to International Card represented 7% of net income for our Credit Card business in the first quarter of 2015, compared to 11% for the first quarter of 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of foreign exchange rates driven by strengthening of the U.S. dollar and higher operating expenses from new and expanded partnerships in Canada partially offset by lower provision for credit losses due to a renegotiated partnership arrangement with a retail partner.Table 7.2 summarizes the financial results for International Card and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.Table 7.2: International Card Business Results   Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2015 2014 ChangeSelected income statement data:      Net interest income $245 $270 (9)%Non-interest income 73 83 (12)Total net revenue 318 353 (10)Provision for credit losses 59 72 (18)Non-interest expense 196 181 8Income from continuing operations before income taxes 63 100 (37)Income tax provision 16 27 (41)Income from continuing operations, net of tax $47 $73 (36)Selected performance metrics:     Average loans held for investment(1) $7,811 $7,692 2Average yield on loans held for investment(2) 14.93% 16.64% (171)bpsTotal net revenue margin(3) 16.31 18.38 (207)Net charge-offs $55 $80 (31)%Net charge-off rate 2.80% 4.17% (137)bpsPurchase volume(4) $5,358 $3,295 63 %       (Dollars in millions) March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 ChangeSelected period-end data:      Loans held for investment(1) $7,623 $8,172 (7)%30+ day performing delinquency rate 2.81% 2.94% (13)bps30+ day delinquency rate 3.44 3.60 (16)Nonperforming loan rate 0.84 0.86 (2)Allowance for loan and lease losses $306 $326 (6)%Allowance coverage ratio(5) 4.02% 3.99% 3bps__________ (1) Period-end loans held for investment and average loans held for investment include accrued finance charges and fees, net of the estimated uncollectible amount.(2) Calculated by dividing annualized interest income for the period by average loans held for investment during the period.

The increase was driven by changes in the product mix in Consumer Banking as a result of growth in our auto loan portfolio and the run-off of the acquired home loan portfolio. The increase in our auto loan portfolio in relation to our total consumer banking loan portfolio drove an increase in the total Consumer Banking yield, even as the average yield on auto loans decreased by 74 basis points to 8.2% in the first quarter of 2015. This decrease was primarily attributable to a shift to a higher proportion of prime auto loans and increased competition in the auto business. The average yield on the home loan portfolio increased by 16 basis points to 3.9% in the first quarter of 2015, driven by an increase in expected cash flows as a result of credit improvement on the acquired home loan portfolio. •Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income increased by $8 million, or 5%, to $158 million in the first quarter of 2015, primarily driven by a lower provision for representation and warranty losses in our home loan portfolio.•Provision for Credit Losses: The provision for credit losses increased by $66 million, or 47%, to $206 million in the first quarter of 2015, driven by an allowance build and higher net charge-offs due to the growth in our auto loan portfolio, as  20Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contentswell as the absence of an allowance release in our home loan portfolio that occurred in the first quarter of 2014 due to favorable credit trends.•Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $40 million, or 4%, to $970 million in the first quarter of 2015, largely due to higher infrastructure spending in our retail banking business and the growth in our auto loan portfolio. •Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment decreased by $60 million, or 0.1%, to $71.4 billion as of March 31, 2015 from December 31, 2014, primarily due to the continued run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio, mostly offset by growth in the auto loan portfolio. Average loans held for investments increased by $778 million, or 1%, to $71.4 billion in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014, due to the growth in our auto loan portfolio outpacing the run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio.•Deposits: Period-end deposits increased by $4.4 billion, or 3%, to $172.5 billion as of March 31, 2015 from December 31, 2014, primarily driven by seasonality of our consumer deposits as well as our continued focus on deepening deposit relationships with existing customers and attract new customers.•Net Charge-off and Delinquency Statistics: The net charge-off rate increased by 5 basis points to 0.89% in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014. The increase in the net charge-off rate reflected the run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio and a greater portion of auto loan portfolio. The 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 77 basis points to 3.46% as of March 31, 2015 from December 31, 2014 primarily attributable to seasonally lower auto delinquency inventories.Commercial Banking BusinessThe primary sources of revenue for our Commercial Banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits and non-interest income from customer fees and other transactions. Because we have some investments that generate tax-exempt income or tax credits, we make certain reclassifications to our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues on a taxable-equivalent basis. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs, such as salaries and associate benefits, occupancy, equipment, professional services, communications and data processing expenses, as well as marketing expenses.Our Commercial Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $155 million and $137 million in the first quarters of 2015 and 2014, respectively. 21Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 9 summarizes the financial results of our Commercial Banking business and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.Table 9: Commercial Banking Business Results  Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2015 2014 Change Selected income statement data:      Net interest income $461 $421 10%Non-interest income 114 87 31Total net revenue(1) 575 508 13Provision for credit losses 60 40 50Non-interest expense 272 255 7Income from continuing operations before income taxes 243 213 14Income tax provision 88 76 16Income from continuing operations, net of tax $155 $137 13Selected performance metrics:      Average loans held for investment:(2)      Commercial and multifamily real estate $23,120 $20,962 10Commercial and industrial 27,190 23,541 16Total commercial lending 50,310 44,503 13Small-ticket commercial real estate 760 932 (18)Total commercial banking $51,070 $45,435 12Average yield on loans held for investment(1) 3.22% 3.47% (25)bpsAverage deposits $32,845 $31,627 4%Average deposit interest rate 0.24% 0.25% (1)bpsCore deposit intangible amortization $4 $6 (33)%Net charge-offs 3 4 (25)Net charge-off rate 0.02% 0.04% (2)bps       (Dollars in millions) March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 ChangeSelected period-end data:      Loans held for investment:(2)      Commercial and multifamily real estate $22,831 $23,137 (1)%Commercial and industrial 27,172 26,972 1Total commercial lending 50,003 50,109 —Small-ticket commercial real estate 738 781 (6)Total commercial banking $50,741 $50,890 —Nonperforming loans rate 0.31% 0.34% (3)bpsNonperforming asset rate(3) 0.31 0.36 (5)Allowance for loan and lease losses $444 $395 12%Allowance coverage ratio(4) 0.87% 0.78% 9bpsDeposits $32,575 $31,954 2%Loans serviced for others(5) 14,804 14,131 5__________(1)  The average yield on loans held for investment is calculated by dividing annualized interest income for the period by average loans held for investment during the period. Annualized interest income excludes various allocations including funds transfer pricing that assigns certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses attributable to each business segment. Some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits. Accordingly, we make certain reclassifications within our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory tax rate of 35%.(2) The period-end commercial banking loans held for investments includes Acquired Loans with carrying value of $160 million and $191 million as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.

The increase was driven by growth in commercial and multifamily real estate and commercial and industrial loans, partially offset by lower loan yields driven by market and competitive pressures. •Non-Interest Income: Non-interest income increased by $27 million, or 31%, to $114 million in the first quarter of 2015, primarily driven by increased revenue from fee-based services and products related to our multifamily finance business.•Provision for Credit Losses: The provision for credit losses increased by $20 million, or 50% to $60 million in the first quarter of 2015, primarily due to a larger allowance build in the first quarter of 2015 attributable to portfolio specific risks, partially offset by a smaller reserve build for unfunded lending commitments.•Non-Interest Expense: Non-interest expense increased by $17 million, or 7%, to $272 million in the first quarter of 2015, driven by higher operating expenses associated with continued investments in business growth.•Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment decreased by $149 million, or less than 1%, to $50.7 billion as of March 31, 2015 from December 31, 2014 as paydowns offset originations. Average loans held for investment increased by $5.6 billion, or 12%, to $51.1 billion in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014, driven by loan growth in the commercial and industrial and commercial and multifamily real estate businesses.•Deposits: Period-end deposits increased by $621 million, or 2%, to $32.6 billion as of March 31, 2015 from December 31, 2014, driven by our strategy to strengthen existing relationships and increase liquidity from commercial customers.•Net Charge-off and Nonperforming Statistics: The net charge-off rate decreased by 2 basis points to 0.02% in the first quarter of 2015 compared to the first quarter of 2014. The nonperforming loans rate decreased by 3 basis points to 0.31% as of March 31, 2015 from December 31, 2014. Other CategoryOther includes unallocated amounts related to our centralized Corporate Treasury group activities, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management, gains and losses on our investment securities portfolio and certain capital management activities. Other also includes foreign exchange-rate fluctuations on foreign currency-denominated transactions; certain gains and losses on the sale and securitization of loans; unallocated corporate expenses that do not directly support the operations of the business segments or for which the business segments are not considered financially accountable in evaluating their performance, such as certain acquisition and restructuring charges; a portion of the net provision for representation and warranty losses related to continuing operations; certain material items that are non-recurring in nature; and offsets related to certain line-item reclassifications. 23Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 10 summarizes the financial results of our Other category for the periods indicated.Table 10: Other Category Results  Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2015 2014 ChangeSelected income statement data:      Net interest income (expense)(1) $15 $(29) **Non-interest income (17) (2) **Total net loss (2) (31) (94)%Benefit for credit losses 0 (3) (100)Non-interest expense 31 21 48Loss from continuing operations before income taxes (33) (49) (33)Income tax benefit (78) (38) 105Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax $45 $(11) **__________**Change is not meaningful.(1) Some of our tax-related commercial investments generate tax-exempt income or tax credits, accordingly we make certain reclassifications within our Commercial Banking business results to present revenues and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated assuming an effective tax rate approximately equal to our federal statutory tax rate of 35%, with offsetting reclassifications within Other.Net income from continuing operations recorded in the Other category was $45 million in the first quarter of 2015, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $11 million in the first quarter of 2014. The shift to a net profit from a net loss was primarily due to higher income from asset/liability management actions and higher income tax benefit reflecting residual impact of tax allocations, largely driven by a lower effective income tax rate for continuing operations.CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ANALYSISTotal assets decreased by $1.9 billion to $306.2 billion as of March 31, 2015 from December 31, 2014 primarily attributable to a decrease of $4.3 billion in loans held for investment in our Credit Card business due to seasonality and the planned run-off of our acquired home loan portfolio partially offset by growth in the auto loan portfolio in our Consumer Banking business. Total liabilities decreased by $2.6 billion to $260.5 billion as of March 31, 2015, primarily driven by lower liquidity-related short-term funding due to expected seasonality. Stockholders’ equity increased by $677 million to $45.7 billion as of March 31, 2015. The increase in stockholders’ equity was primarily attributable to our net income of $1.2 billion in the first quarter of 2015, partially offset by share repurchases under our 2014 Stock Repurchase Program and dividend payments. The following is a discussion of material changes in the major components of our assets and liabilities during the first quarter of 2015. Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management activities that are intended to ensure the adequacy of capital while managing our liquidity requirements for the Company and our customers and our market risk exposure in accordance with our risk appetite.Investment Securities Our investment portfolio consists primarily of the following: U.S. Treasury securities; corporate debt securities guaranteed by U.S. government agencies; U.S. government-sponsored enterprise or agency (“Agency”) and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) and commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”); other asset-backed securities (“ABS”); and other investments. The carrying value of our investments in U.S. Treasury, Agency securities and other securities guaranteed by the U.S. government or agencies of the U.S. government represented 87% and 86% of our total investment securities portfolio as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.During the first quarter of 2015, the fair value of our investment portfolio increased by $832 million, or 1%, to $64.0 billion as of March 31, 2015 from December 31, 2014. This increase was driven by purchases of securities coupled with lower market interest rates.We had gross unrealized gains of $968 million and gross unrealized losses of $128 million on available-for sale investment securities as of March 31, 2015, compared to gross unrealized gains of $886 million and gross unrealized losses of $237 million as of  24Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsDecember 31, 2014. The increase in gross unrealized gains and the decrease in gross unrealized losses in the first quarter of 2015 were primarily driven by lower interest rates. Of the $128 million in gross unrealized losses as of March 31, 2015, $108 million was related to securities that had been in a loss position for more than 12 months. We provide information on other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) recognized in earnings on our investment securities above in “Consolidated Results of Operations—Non-Interest Income.”Table 11 presents the amortized cost, carrying value and fair value for the major categories of our portfolio of investment securities as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.Table 11: Investment Securities  March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014(Dollars in millions) AmortizedCost  FairValue AmortizedCost  FairValueInvestment securities available for sale        U.S. Treasury securities $4,411 $4,440 $4,114 $4,118Corporate debt securities guaranteed by U.S. government agencies 600 598 819 800RMBS:        Agency(1) 22,344 22,607 21,804 21,995Non-agency 2,943 3,441 2,938 3,386Total RMBS 25,287 26,048 24,742 25,381CMBS:        Agency(1) 3,672 3,676 3,751 3,723Non-agency 1,711 1,753 1,780 1,796Total CMBS 5,383 5,429 5,531 5,519Other ABS(2) 2,025 2,028 2,618 2,662Other securities(3) 775 778 1,035 1,028Total investment securities available for sale $38,481 $39,321 $38,859 $39,508         (Dollars in millions) Carrying Value FairValue Carrying Value FairValueInvestment securities held to maturity        U.S. Treasury securities $198 $199 $0 $0Agency RMBS 20,484 21,763 20,163 21,210Agency CMBS 2,559 2,691 2,337 2,424Total investment securities held to maturity $23,241 $24,653 $22,500 $23,634__________ (1) Agency includes Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) and Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”).(2) ABS collateralized by credit card loans constituted approximately 59% and 56% of the other ABS portfolio as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, and ABS collateralized by auto dealer floor plan inventory loans and leases constituted approximately 18% and 16% of the other ABS portfolio as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.

Total deposits increased by $4.9 billion to $210.4 billion as of March 31, 2015 from December 31, 2014. The increase in deposits was primarily driven by seasonality and the growth in our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses as a result of our continued focus on deepening deposit relationships with existing customers and our continued marketing strategy to attract new business. We provide information on the composition of our deposits, average outstanding balances, interest expense and yield below in “Liquidity Risk Profile.” 26Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsSecuritized Debt ObligationsSecuritized debt obligations increased by $1.1 billion during the first quarter of 2015, to $12.7 billion as of March 31, 2015 from December 31, 2014 primarily driven by debt issuances of $1.3 billion, offset by debt maturities of $175 million during the first quarter of 2015. We provide additional information on our borrowings below in “Liquidity Risk Profile.”Other DebtOther debt, which consists primarily of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, senior and subordinated notes and Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLB”) advances, totaled $28.3 billion as of March 31, 2015, of which $6.7 billion represented short-term borrowings and $21.6 billion represented long-term debt. Other debt totaled $36.8 billion as of December 31, 2014, of which $17.1 billion represented short-term borrowings and $19.7 billion represented long-term debt. The decrease in other debt of $8.5 billion in the first quarter of 2015 was primarily attributable to a net decrease of $10.4 billion in FHLB advances, partially offset by a net increase of $1.9 billion in unsecured senior notes. We provide additional information on our borrowings below in “Liquidity Risk Profile” and in “Note 8—Deposits and Borrowings.”Mortgage Representation and Warranty ReserveWe acquired three subsidiaries that originated residential mortgage loans and sold these loans to various purchasers, including purchasers who created securitization trusts. These subsidiaries are Capital One Home Loans, LLC, which was acquired in February 2005; GreenPoint, which was acquired in December 2006 as part of the North Fork Bancorporation, Inc. (“North Fork”) acquisition; and Chevy Chase Bank, F.S.B (“CCB”), which was acquired in February 2009 and subsequently merged into CONA.We have established representation and warranty reserves for losses associated with the mortgage loans sold by each subsidiary that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable, including both litigation and non-litigation liabilities. These reserves are reported on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities. The reserve setting process relies heavily on estimates, which are inherently uncertain, and requires judgment. We evaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis. We build our representation and warranty reserves through the provision for mortgage representation and warranty losses, which we report in our consolidated statements of income as a component of non-interest income for loans originated and sold by CCB and Capital One Home Loans, LLC and as a component of discontinued operations for loans originated and sold by GreenPoint. The aggregate reserve for all three entities totaled $673 million as of March 31, 2015, compared to $731 million as of December 31, 2014.The table below summarizes changes in our representation and warranty reserve in the first quarters of 2015 and 2014.Table 14: Changes in Representation and Warranty Reserve(1)  Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2015 2014Representation and warranty reserve, beginning of period $731 $1,172Provision (benefit) for mortgage representation and warranty losses:    Recorded in continuing operations 1 14Recorded in discontinued operations (19) (47)Total benefit for mortgage representation and warranty losses (18) (33)Net realized losses (40) (11)Representation and warranty reserve, end of period $673 $1,128__________ (1) Reported on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities. As part of our business planning processes, we have considered various outcomes relating to the future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are possible but do not rise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying an incremental accrual under applicable accounting standards. Our current best estimate of reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond what was in our reserve as of March 31, 2015, is approximately $2.1 billion, unchanged from our estimate of $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2014.  27Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsWe provide additional information related to the representation and warranty reserve, including factors that may impact the adequacy of the reserve and the ultimate amount of losses incurred by our subsidiaries, in “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others.”OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIESIn the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various types of arrangements with limited liability companies, partnerships or trusts that often involve special purpose entities and variable interest entities (“VIE”). Some of these arrangements are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or may be recorded in amounts different from the full contract or notional amount of the arrangements, depending on the nature or structure of, and accounting required to be applied to, the arrangement. These arrangements may expose us to potential losses in excess of the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. Our involvement in these arrangements can take many forms, including securitization and servicing activities, the purchase or sale of mortgage-backed or other asset-backed securities in connection with our home loan portfolio and loans to VIEs that hold debt, equity, real estate or other assets.Our continuing involvement in unconsolidated VIEs primarily consists of certain mortgage loan trusts and community reinvestment and development entities. We provide a discussion of our activities related to these VIEs in “Note 6—Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations.”CAPITAL MANAGEMENTThe level and composition of our capital are determined by multiple factors, including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements and internal risk-based capital assessments such as internal stress testing and economic capital. The level and composition of our capital may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment, conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments.Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective ActionBank holding companies and national banks are subject to capital adequacy standards adopted by the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), respectively. The capital adequacy standards set forth minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements that are based on quantitative and qualitative measures of assets and off-balance sheet items. National banks, as insured depository institutions, are also subject to Prompt Corrective Action (“PCA”) capital regulations, which require the U.S. federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” for banks that do not meet the PCA capital requirements.In July 2013, the Federal Banking Agencies finalized a new capital rule that implements the Basel III capital accord (the “Final Basel III Capital Rules”) developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“Basel Committee”) and certain Dodd-Frank Act capital provisions and updates the PCA capital requirements. The Final Basel III Capital Rules amended both the Basel I and Basel II Advanced Approaches frameworks, establishing a new common equity Tier 1 capital requirement and setting higher minimum capital ratio requirements. The Company refers to the amended Basel I framework as the “Basel III Standardized Approach,” and the amended Advanced Approaches framework as the “Basel III Advanced Approaches.”At the end of 2012, the Company met one of the two independent eligibility criteria set by banking regulators for becoming subject to the Advanced Approaches capital rules. As a result, the Company has undertaken a multi-year process of implementing the Advanced Approaches regime for calculating risk-weighted assets and regulatory capital levels. Certain provisions of the Final Basel III Capital Rules began to take effect on January 1, 2014 for Advanced Approaches banking organizations, including the Company. The Company entered parallel run under Advanced Approaches on January 1, 2015, during which it will calculate capital ratios under both the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches, though it will continue to use the Basel III Standardized Approach for purposes of meeting regulatory capital requirements. By rule, the parallel run must last at least four consecutive quarters. Therefore, the first quarter of 2016 is the earliest possible date on which the Company would use the Basel III Advanced Approaches framework in calculating its regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets for purposes of risk-based capital requirements. Consistent with the experience of other U.S. banks, it is possible that our parallel run will last longer than the four quarter minimum. Under the Dodd-Frank Act and the Final Basel III Capital Rules, organizations subject to Basel III Advanced Approaches may not hold less capital than would be required under the Basel III Standardized Approach. Therefore,  28Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contentseven after we exit parallel run, we will continue to calculate regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets under the Basel III Standardized Approach. As of January 1, 2014, the minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements for Advanced Approaches banking organizations included a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 4.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 5.5%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0%, and a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 4.0%. On January 1, 2015, the minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements increased to 4.5% for the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio and to 6.0% for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio. The minimum requirements for the total risk-based capital ratio and the Tier 1 leverage capital ratio did not change from 2014 to 2015.The Final Basel III Capital Rules also introduced a new supplementary leverage ratio for all Advanced Approaches banking organizations with a minimum requirement of 3.0%. In September 2014 the Federal Banking Agencies issued a final rule that revised the calculation of total leverage exposures and implemented the supplementary leverage ratio. The supplementary leverage ratio compares Tier 1 capital to total leverage exposures, and includes all on-balance sheet assets and many off-balance sheet assets, including derivatives and unused commitments. The new supplementary leverage ratio becomes effective on January 1, 2018. However, as an Advanced Approaches banking organization, we are required to calculate and publicly disclose our supplementary leverage ratio beginning in the first quarter of 2015. Insured depository institutions are also subject to PCA capital regulations. The Final Basel III Capital Rules increased some of the thresholds for the PCA capital categories and added the new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to the PCA regulations, effective January 1, 2015. As of January 1, 2014, an insured depository institution was considered to be well-capitalized if it maintains a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 6.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0%, a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of at least 5.0%, and is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or PCA directive issued by its regulator. Beginning on January 1, 2015, the well-capitalized level for the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio increased to 8.0%, and the well-capitalized level for the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was established at 6.5%. The well-capitalized levels for the total risk-based capital ratio and the Tier 1 leverage capital ratio did not change.We disclose a non-GAAP TCE ratio in “MD&A—Summary of Selected Financial Data.” While the TCE ratio is a capital measure widely used by investors, analysts, rating agencies, and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies, it may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We provide information on the calculation of this ratio in “MD&A—Table A—Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures and Calculation of Regulatory Capital Measures.”Table 15 provides a comparison of our regulatory capital ratios under the Federal Banking Agencies’ capital adequacy standards as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Under the Final Basel III Capital Rules, beginning on January 1, 2014, as an Advanced Approaches banking organization we began using the Basel III Standardized Approach for calculating our regulatory capital, subject to applicable transition provisions. Throughout 2014, we continued to use Basel I for calculating our risk-weighted assets in our regulatory capital ratios, as required under the Final Basel III Capital Rules. On January 1, 2015, we began using the Basel III Standardized Approach for calculating our risk-weighted assets in our regulatory capital ratios. 29Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 15: Capital Ratios(1)  March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014  CapitalRatio MinimumCapitalAdequacy Well-Capitalized CapitalRatio MinimumCapitalAdequacy Well-CapitalizedCapital One Financial Corp:            Common equity Tier 1 capital(2) 12.46% 4.50% N/A 12.46% 4.00% N/ATier 1 risk-based capital(3) 13.22 6.00 6.00% 13.23 5.50 6.00%Total risk-based capital(4)  15.07 8.00 10.00 15.14 8.00 10.00Tier 1 leverage(5) 10.66 4.00 N/A 10.77 4.00 N/ASupplementary leverage ratio(6) 9.22 N/A N/A N/A N/A N/ACapital One Bank (USA), N.A.:           Common equity Tier 1 capital(2) 12.36% 4.50% 6.50% 11.33% 4.00% N/ATier 1 risk-based capital(3) 12.36 6.00 8.00 11.33 5.50 6.00%Total risk-based capital(4)  15.66 8.00 10.00 14.57 8.00 10.00Tier 1 leverage(5) 10.22 4.00 5.00 9.64 4.00 5.00Supplementary leverage ratio(6) 8.37 N/A N/A N/A N/A N/ACapital One, N.A.:           Common equity Tier 1 capital(2) 12.72% 4.50% 6.50% 12.53% 4.00% N/ATier 1 risk-based capital(3) 12.72 6.00 8.00 12.53 5.50 6.00%Total risk-based capital(4)  13.78 8.00 10.00 13.57 8.00 10.00Tier 1 leverage(5) 8.83 4.00 5.00 8.90 4.00 5.00Supplementary leverage ratio(6) 7.96 N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A__________ (1) Capital ratios are calculated based on the Basel III Standardized Approach framework, subject to applicable transition provisions.

Capital One Financial Corporation exceeded Federal Banking Agencies’ minimum capital requirements and the Banks exceeded minimum regulatory requirements and were “well-capitalized” under PCA requirements as of both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, as calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach, subject to transition provisions, was 12.46% as of both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.The calculation of our Basel III Standardized Approach common equity Tier 1 capital under the Final Basel III Capital Rules includes adjustments and deductions which are subject to transitions provisions, such as the inclusion of the unrealized gains and losses on available for sale investment securities included in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and adjustments related to intangibles other than goodwill. The inclusion of AOCI and the adjustments related to intangibles are phased-in at 20% for 2014, 40% for 2015, 60% for 2016, 80% for 2017 and 100% for 2018. The following table compares our common equity Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as of March 31, 2015, calculated based on the Final Basel III Capital Rules, subject to applicable transition provisions, to our estimated common equity Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as of March 31, 2015, calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach, as it applies when fully phased-in for Advanced Approaches banks like us that have not yet exited parallel run. Our estimated common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the fully phased-in Basel III Standardized Approach is based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and is subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. As we continue to engage with our regulators during our parallel run, we anticipate that there could be further changes to the calculation.  30Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 16: Estimated Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio under Fully Phased-In Basel III Standardized Approach(1) (Dollars in millions) March 31, 2015Common equity Tier 1 capital under Basel III Standardized $29,671Adjustments related to AOCI(2) (186)Adjustments related to intangibles(2) (675)Other adjustments(2) —Estimated common equity Tier 1 capital under fully phased-in Basel III Standardized $28,810Risk-weighted assets under Basel III Standardized $238,144Adjustments for fully phased-in Basel III Standardized(3) (282)Estimated risk-weighted assets under fully phased-in Basel III Standardized  $237,862Estimated common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under fully phased-in Basel III Standardized(4) 12.1%__________ (1) Estimated common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the fully phased-in Basel III Standardized Approach is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Additional calculation adjustments are likely to apply to the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio under fully phased-in Basel III Standardized Approach following our exit from Advanced Approaches parallel run.Under the Final Basel III Capital Rules, when we complete our parallel run for the Advanced Approaches, our minimum risk-based capital requirement will be the greater requirement of the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches. See “Part I—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation” in our 2014 Form 10-K for additional information. Based on our business mix, we anticipate that we will need to hold more regulatory capital under the Basel III Advanced Approaches than under the Basel III Standardized Approach to meet our minimum required regulatory capital ratios.Capital Planning and Regulatory Stress TestingIn November 2011, the Federal Reserve finalized capital planning rules applicable to large bank holding companies like us. Under these rules, bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more must submit a capital plan to the Federal Reserve on an annual basis that contains a description of all planned capital actions, including dividends or stock repurchases, over a nine-quarter planning horizon beginning with the fourth quarter of the calendar year prior to the submission of the capital plan Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR cycle”). The bank holding company may take the capital actions in its capital plan if the Federal Reserve provides a non-objection to the plan. On October 17, 2014, the Federal Reserve issued a final rule to modify the regulations for capital planning and stress testing. The final rule changes the annual capital plan and stress test cycle start date from October 1 to January 1, effective for the cycle beginning January 1, 2016. To allow for a transition to the change in timing, the Federal Reserve’s objection or non-objection applied to the capital actions spanning the five quarters starting with the second quarter of 2015 for the 2015 CCAR cycle. Subsequent submissions each would cover a four-quarter period. For additional information on the Final Rule, see “Part 1—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation” in our 2014 Form 10-K.After the Federal Reserve’s non-objection to our 2014 capital plan, we maintained our quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share for all four quarters in 2014. In addition, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of shares of common stock through the end of the first quarter of 2015. During 2014, we repurchased approximately $2.0 billion of common stock and the remaining amount of the 2014 Stock Repurchase Program was completed during the first quarter of 2015. On January 5, 2015 we submitted our capital plan to the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve as part of the 2015 CCAR cycle. On March 11, 2015, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve publicly disclosed its non-objection to our proposed capital distribution plans submitted pursuant to CCAR. As a result of this non-objection to our capital plan, the Board of Directors also authorized an increase in the quarterly dividend on our common stock from the current level of $0.30 per share to $0.40 per share. In addition, the company's Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $3.125 billion of shares of the company's common stock beginning in the second quarter of 2015 through the end of the second quarter of 2016.  31Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsDividend Policy and Stock PurchasesOn April 30, 2015, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.30 per share to $0.40 per share, payable on May 21, 2015 to stockholders of record at the close of the business on May 11, 2015. Our Board of Directors also approved quarterly dividends on our Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock, and Series D Preferred Stock payable on June 1, 2015 to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 15, 2015. Based on these declarations, the Company will pay approximately $219 million in common equity dividends and approximately $29 million in total preferred dividends in the second quarter of 2015. Under the terms of our outstanding preferred stock, the ability of the Company to pay dividends on, make distributions with respect to, or to repurchase, redeem or acquire its common stock or any preferred stock ranking on parity with or junior to the preferred stock, is subject to restrictions in the event that the Company does not declare and either pay or set aside a sum sufficient for payment of dividends on the preferred stock for the immediately preceding dividend period.We paid common stock dividends of $0.30 per share in the first quarter of 2015. We paid preferred stock dividends of $15.00 per share on the outstanding shares of our 6.00% fixed-rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series B (the “Series B Preferred Stock”); $15.625 per share on the outstanding shares of our 6.25% fixed-rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series C (the “Series C Preferred Stock”); and $22.5194 per share on the outstanding shares of our 6.70% fixed-rate non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series D (the “Series D Preferred Stock”) during the first quarter of 2015.The declaration and payment of dividends to our stockholders, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. As a bank holding company, our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries. Regulatory restrictions exist that limit the ability of the Banks to transfer funds to our bank holding company. Funds available for dividend payments from COBNA was $1.3 billion as of March 31, 2015. There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends to stockholders.In addition and consistent with our 2015 capital plan, our Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to $3.125 billion of shares of common stock beginning in the second quarter of 2015 through the end of the second quarter of 2016. The timing and exact amount of any future common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including market conditions, opportunities for growth, our capital position and amount of retained earnings. Our stock repurchase program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time. For additional information on dividends and stock repurchases, see “Part I—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation—Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Transfer of Funds” in our 2014 Form 10-K.RISK MANAGEMENTOverview We use a risk framework to manage risk. We execute against our risk management framework with the “Three Lines of Defense” risk management model to demonstrate and structure the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities in the organization for taking and managing risk. The “First Line of Defense” is comprised of the business areas that through their day-to-day business activities take risk on our behalf. As the business owner, the first line is responsible for identifying, assessing, managing and controlling that risk, and for mitigating our overall risk exposure. The first line formulates strategy and operates within the risk appetite and framework. The “Second Line of Defense” provides oversight of first line risk taking and management, and is primarily comprised of our Risk Management organization. The second line assists in determining risk capacity, risk appetite, and the strategies, policies and structure for managing risks. The second line owns the risk framework. The second line is both an ‘expert advisor’ to the first line and an ‘effective challenger’ of first line risk activities. The “Third Line of Defense” is comprised of our Internal Audit and Credit Review functions. The third line provides independent and objective assurance to senior management and to the Board of Directors that first and second line risk management and internal control systems and governance processes are well-designed and working as intended.  32Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsOur risk framework consists of the following eight key elements:•Establish Governance Processes, Accountabilities, and Risk Appetites•Identify and Assess Risks and Ownership•Develop and Operate Controls, Monitoring and Mitigation Plans•Test and Detect Control Gaps and Perform Corrective Action•Escalate Key Risks and Gaps to Executive Management and, when Appropriate, the Board of Directors•Calculate and Allocate Capital in Alignment with Risk Management and Measurement Processes (including Stress Testing)•Support with the Right Culture, Talent and Skills•Enable with the Right Data, Infrastructure and ProgramsWe provide additional discussion of our risk management principles, roles and responsibilities, framework and risk appetite under “MD&A—Risk Management” in our 2014 Form 10-K. CREDIT RISK PROFILEOur loan portfolio accounts for the substantial majority of our credit risk exposure. Our lending activities are governed under our credit policy and are subject to independent review and approval. Below we provide information about the composition of our loan portfolio, key concentrations and credit performance metrics.We also engage in certain non-lending activities that may give rise to credit and counterparty settlement risk, including the purchase of securities for our investment securities portfolio, entering into derivative transactions to manage our market risk exposure and to accommodate customers, short-term advances on syndications activity, certain operational cash balances in other financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions, and customer overdrafts. We provide additional information on credit risk related to our investment securities portfolio under “Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis—Investment Securities” and credit risk related to derivative transactions in “Note 9—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”Loan Portfolio CompositionWe provide a variety of lending products. Our primary products include credit cards, auto loans, home loans and commercial lending products. For information on our lending policies and procedures, including our underwriting criteria for our primary loan products, see “MD&A—Credit Risk Profile” in our 2014 Form 10-K.Our loan portfolio consists of loans held for investment, including restricted loans underlying our consolidated securitization trusts and loans held for sale. Table 17 presents the composition of our portfolio of loans held for investment, including Acquired Loans, by portfolio segment, as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Table 17 and the credit metrics presented in this section exclude loans held for sale, which are carried at lower of cost or fair value and totaled $1.3 billion and $626 million as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. 33Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 17: Loan Portfolio Composition  March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014(Dollars in millions) Loans % of Total Loans % of TotalCredit Card:        Domestic credit card(1) $74,131 36.3% $77,704 37.3%International credit card 7,623 3.7 8,172 3.9Total credit card 81,754 40.0 85,876 41.2Consumer Banking:        Auto 38,937 19.1 37,824 18.2Home loan 28,905 14.2 30,035 14.4Retail banking 3,537 1.7 3,580 1.7Total consumer banking 71,379 35.0 71,439 34.3Commercial Banking:        Commercial and multifamily real estate 22,831 11.2 23,137 11.1Commercial and industrial 27,172 13.3 26,972 12.9Total commercial lending 50,003 24.5 50,109 24.0Small-ticket commercial real estate 738 0.4 781 0.4Total commercial banking 50,741 24.9 50,890 24.4Other:        Other loans 104 0.1 111 0.1Total loans held for investment $203,978 100.0% $208,316 100.0%__________ (1) Includes installment loans of $123 million and $144 million as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.Commercial LoansFor purposes of portfolio risk management, we aggregate our commercial loan portfolio according to market segmentation primarily based on standard industry codes.

See “MD&A—Glossary and Acronyms” for the definition of ING Direct, CCB and 2012 U.S. card acquisitions. These loans were recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition. Acquired Loans accounted for based on expected cash flows to be collected were $22.3 billion as of March 31, 2015, compared to $23.5 billion as of December 31, 2014.The difference between the fair value at acquisition and expected cash flows represents the accretable yield, which is recognized in interest income over the life of the loans. The difference between the contractual payments on the loans and expected cash flows represents the nonaccretable difference or the amount of principal and interest not considered collectible, which incorporates future expected credit losses over the life of the loans. We regularly update our estimate of expected principal and interest to be collected from these loans and evaluate the results for each accounting pool that was established at acquisition based on loans with common risk characteristics. Probable decreases in expected cash flows would trigger the recognition of an allowance for loan and lease losses through our provision for credit losses. Probable and significant increases in expected cash flows would first reverse any previously recorded allowance for loan and lease losses established subsequent to acquisition, with any remaining increase in expected cash flows recognized prospectively in interest income over the remaining estimated life of the underlying loans. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2014 Form 10-K for additional information on Acquired Loans.Home LoansThe substantial majority of our home loan portfolio was acquired in the ING Direct and CCB acquisitions, and they accounted for 99.0% and 98.9% of our total Acquired Loans as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The expected cash flows for our acquired home loan portfolio are significantly impacted by future expectations of home prices and interest rates. Decreases in expected cash flows that result from declining conditions, particularly associated with these variables, could result in an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses and reduction in accretable yield. Charge-offs on these loans are not recorded until the expected credit losses within the nonaccretable difference are depleted. In addition, Acquired Loans are not initially classified as delinquent or nonperforming as we expect to collect our net investment in these loans and the nonaccretable difference is expected to absorb the majority of the losses associated with these loans.

The analysis reflects a hypothetical decline of 10% in the home price index and its impact on lifetime future cash flow expectations, accretable yield and allowance for loan and lease losses. Any significant economic events or variables not considered could impact results that are presented below.Table 20: Sensitivity Analysis - Acquired Loans - Home Loan Portfolio(1)(Dollars in millions) March 31, 2015 Estimated ImpactExpected cash flows $26,552 $(137)Accretable yield 4,471 2Allowance for loan and lease losses 33 139__________(1) The estimated impact is the change in the balance as of March 31, 2015 from the hypothetical decline of 10% in the home price index. Changes in the accretable yield would be recognized in interest income in our consolidated statements of income over the life of the loans. Changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses would be recognized immediately in the provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income.Credit Risk Measurement We closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to assess and manage our exposure to credit risk. Key metrics we track in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming asset rates, as well as net charge-off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger balance commercial loans. Trends in delinquency rates are a primary indicator of credit risk within our consumer loan portfolios, as changes in delinquency rates provide an early warning of changes in credit losses. The primary indicator of credit risk in our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings. Because we generally classify loans that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming, the level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of our loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on regional economic conditions. We underwrite most consumer loans using proprietary models, which are typically based on credit bureau data, including borrower credit scores, along with application information and, where applicable, collateral and deal structure data. We continuously adjust our management of credit lines and collection strategies based on customer behavior and risk profile changes. We use borrower credit scores for subprime classification, for competitive benchmarking and, in some cases, to drive product segmentation decisions. The following table provides details on the credit scores of our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios as of March 31, 2015, December 31, 2014, and March 31, 2014.

These scores are obtained from one of the major credit bureaus at origination and are refreshed monthly thereafter. We approximate non-FICO credit scores to comparable FICO scores for consistency purposes. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 660 or below category.(2) Credit scores represent FICO scores. These scores are obtained from three credit bureaus at the time of application and are not refreshed thereafter. The FICO score distribution is based on the average scores. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 620 or below category. 36Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsWe present information in the section below on the credit performance of our loan portfolio, including the key metrics we use in tracking changes in the credit quality of our loan portfolio. See “Note 4—Loans” in this Report for additional credit quality information. Also, see “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2014 Form 10-K for information on our accounting policies for delinquent and nonperforming loans, net charge-offs and TDRs for each of our loan categories. Delinquency RatesWe consider the entire balance of an account to be delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the customer’s due date, measured at the reporting date. Our 30+ day delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due, whereas our 30+ day performing delinquency metrics include loans that are 30 or more days past due but currently classified as performing and accruing interest. The 30+ day delinquency and 30+ day performing delinquency metrics are generally the same for credit card loans, as we continue to classify the substantial majority of credit card loans as performing until the account is charged-off, typically when the account is 180 days past due. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2014 Form 10-K for information on our policies for classifying loans as nonperforming for each of our loan categories.Table 22 presents our 30+ day performing delinquency rates and 30+ day delinquency rates of our portfolio of loans held for investment, including Acquired Loans, by portfolio segment, as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.Table 22: 30+ Day Delinquencies  March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014  30+ Day Performing Delinquencies 30+ Day Delinquencies 30+ Day Performing Delinquencies 30+ Day Delinquencies(Dollars in millions) Amount Rate(1) Amount Rate(1) Amount Rate(1) Amount Rate(1)Credit Card:Domestic credit card $2,163 2.92% $2,163 2.92% $2,538 3.27% $2,538 3.27%International credit card 214 2.81 262 3.44 240 2.94 294 3.60Total credit card 2,377 2.91 2,425 2.97 2,778 3.24 2,832 3.30Consumer Banking:Auto 2,029 5.21 2,149 5.52 2,486 6.57 2,682 7.09Home loan(2) 52 0.18 282 0.97 64 0.21 302 1.01Retail banking 21 0.60 40 1.12 23 0.64 40 1.11Total consumer banking(2) 2,102 2.95 2,471 3.46 2,573 3.60 3,024 4.23Commercial Banking:Commercial and multifamily real estate 72 0.31 99 0.43 85 0.37 117 0.51Commercial and industrial 181 0.67 249 0.92 15 0.05 73 0.27Total commercial lending 253 0.51 348 0.70 100 0.20 190 0.38Small-ticket commercial real estate 4 0.49 13 1.82 6 0.72 10 1.28Total commercial banking 257 0.51 361 0.71 106 0.21 200 0.39Other:Other loans 3 3.37 13 12.58 3 2.84 14 12.23Total(2) $4,739 2.32 $5,270 2.58 $5,460 2.62 $6,070 2.91__________ (1) Calculated by loan category by dividing 30+ day delinquent loans as of the end of the period by period-end loans held for investment for the specified loan category, including Acquired Loans as applicable.(2)  Excluding the impact of Acquired Loans, the 30+ day performing delinquency rate for our home loan portfolio, total consumer banking and total loans held for investment was 0.77%, 4.27% and 2.61%, respectively, as of March 31, 2015, and 0.94%, 5.34%, and 2.95%, respectively, as of December 31, 2014.

These loans consist primarily of credit card accounts between 90 days and 179 days past due. As permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”), we generally continue to accrue interest and fees on domestic credit card loans through the date of charge-off, which is typically in the period the account becomes 180 days past due. While domestic credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until the loan is charged-off, we reduce the balance of our credit card receivables by the amount of finance charges and fees billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from revenue.Table 24: 90+ Day Delinquent Loans Accruing Interest   March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014(Dollars in millions) Amount % ofTotal Loans(1) Amount % ofTotal Loans(1)Loan category:        Credit card $1,134 1.39% $1,254 1.46%Consumer banking 1 0.00 1 0.00Commercial banking 84 0.17 8 0.01Total $1,219 0.60 $1,263 0.61Geographic region:        Domestic $1,155 0.59% $1,190 0.59%International 64 0.85 73 0.90Total $1,219 0.60 $1,263 0.61__________ (1) Delinquency rates are calculated for each loan category by dividing 90+ day delinquent loans accruing interest by period-end loans held for investment for the specified loan category.Nonperforming Loans and Nonperforming AssetsNonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, foreclosed property and repossessed assets and the net realizable value of auto loans that have been charged-off as a result of a bankruptcy. Nonperforming loans generally include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status and certain restructured loans whose contractual terms have been modified in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty.

Interest income forgone related to nonperforming loans was $15 million and $16 million in the first quarters of 2015 and 2014, respectively. Forgone interest income represents the amount of interest income that would have been recorded during the period for nonperforming loans as of the end of the period had the loans performed according to their contractual terms.(2) Excluding the impact of Acquired Loans, the nonperforming loan ratio for our home loan portfolio, total consumer banking and total nonperforming loans held for investment was 4.94%, 0.98% and 0.39%, respectively, as of March 31, 2015, compared to 4.86%, 1.14% and 0.44%, respectively, as of December 31, 2014.

We exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and fraud losses from charge-offs. Net charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for loan and lease losses and subsequent recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan and lease losses. Costs incurred to recover charged-off loans are recorded as collection expenses and included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest expense. Our charge-off policy for loans varies based on the loan type. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2014 Form 10-K for information on our charge-off policy for each of our loan categories.Table 26 presents our net charge-off amounts and rates, by portfolio segment, in the first quarters of 2015 and 2014.

It excludes loan modifications that do not meet the definition of a TDR and Acquired Loans accounted for based on expected cash flows, which we track and report separately.Table 27: Loan Modifications and Restructurings  March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014(Dollars in millions) Amount % of Total Modifications Amount % of Total ModificationsModified and restructured loans:        Credit card $673 41.0% $692 41.9%Consumer banking:        Auto 453 27.5 435 26.3Home loan 219 13.3 218 13.2Retail banking 36 2.2 35 2.1Total consumer banking 708 43.0 688 41.6Commercial banking 263 16.0 272 16.5Total $1,644 100.0% $1,652 100.0%Status of modified and restructured loans:        Performing $1,198 72.9% $1,203 72.8%Nonperforming 446 27.1 449 27.2Total $1,644 100.0% $1,652 100.0% The majority of our credit card TDRs involve reducing the interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. We determine the effective interest rate for purposes of measuring impairment on modified loans that involve a reduction and are considered to be a TDR based on the interest rate in effect immediately prior to the loan entering the modification program. In some cases, the interest rate on a credit card account is automatically increased due to non-payment, late payment or similar events. In all cases, we cancel the customer’s available line of credit on the credit card. If the customer does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement may revert to its original payment terms, with the amount of any loan outstanding reflected in the appropriate delinquency category. The loan amount may then be charged off in accordance with our standard charge-off policy. In the Consumer Banking business, the majority of our modified loans receive an extension, while a portion receive an interest rate reduction or principal reduction. Their impairment is determined using the present value of expected cash flows or a collateral evaluation for certain auto and home loans where the collateral value is lower than the recorded investment. In the Commercial Banking business, the majority of modified loans receive an extension, with a portion of these loans receiving an interest rate reduction. The impairment on modified commercial loans is generally determined based on the underlying collateral value. We provide additional information on modified loans accounted for as TDRs, including the performance of those loans subsequent to modification, in “Note 4—Loans.”Impaired LoansA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan. Generally, we report loans as impaired based on the method for measuring impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. Loans defined as individually impaired include larger balance commercial nonperforming loans and TDRs. Loans held for sale are not reported as impaired, as these loans are recorded at lower of cost or fair value. Impaired loans also exclude Acquired Loans accounted for based on expected cash flows because this accounting methodology takes into consideration future credit losses expected to be incurred.  41Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsImpaired loans, including TDRs, totaled $1.9 billion as of both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Loans modified in TDRs accounted for $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion of impaired loans as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. We provide additional information on our impaired loans, including the allowance for loan and lease losses established for these loans, in “Note 4—Loans” and “Note 5—Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses.”Allowance for Loan and Lease LossesOur allowance for loan and lease losses represents management’s best estimate of incurred loan and lease credit losses inherent in our held for investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date. The allowance for loan and lease losses is increased through the provision for credit losses and reduced by net charge-offs. We provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for loan and lease losses under “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2014 Form 10-K.Our allowance for loan and lease losses increased by $22 million to $4.4 billion as of March 31, 2015 from December 31, 2014. The allowance coverage ratio increased to 2.16% as of March 31, 2015, from 2.10% as of December 31, 2014. The increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses was primarily driven by portfolio-specific risks in our commercial loan portfolio in our Commercial Banking business and loan growth in our auto loan portfolio in our Consumer Banking business, partially offset by an allowance release as credit improved in our credit card loan portfolio in our Credit Card business.Table 28 presents changes in our allowance for loan and lease losses for the first quarters of 2015 and 2014, and details the provision for credit losses recognized in our consolidated statements of income and charge-offs and recoveries by portfolio segment. 42Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 28: Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Activity  Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2015 2014Balance at beginning of period $4,383 $4,315Provision for credit losses(1)  927 723Charge-offs:    Credit Card:    Domestic credit card (924) (964)International credit card (98) (131)Total credit card (1,022) (1,095)Consumer Banking:    Auto (233) (205)Home loan (4) (11)Retail banking (13) (15)Total consumer banking (250) (231)Commercial Banking:    Commercial and multifamily real estate — (2)Commercial and industrial (7) (4)Total commercial lending (7) (6)Small-ticket commercial real estate (2) (1)Total commercial banking (9) (7)Other:    Other loans (3) (2)Total charge-offs (1,284) (1,335)Recoveries:    Credit Card:    Domestic credit card 260 264International credit card 43 51Total credit card 303 315Consumer Banking:    Auto 85 71Home loan 2 6Retail banking 4 6Total consumer banking 91 83Commercial Banking:    Commercial and multifamily real estate 2 1Commercial and industrial 3 2Total commercial lending 5 3Small-ticket commercial real estate 1 —Total commercial banking 6 3Other:    Other loans 3 3Total recoveries 403 404Net charge-offs (881) (931)Other changes(2) (24) (9)Balance at end of period $4,405 $4,098Allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans held for investment 2.16% 2.12%__________ (1) The total provision for credit losses reported in our consolidated statements of income consists of a provision for loan and lease losses and a provision for unfunded lending commitments.

Our practices include maintaining an adequate liquidity reserve to cover our funding requirements as well as any potential deposit run-off and maintaining access to diversified funding sources to avoid over-dependence on volatile, less reliable funding markets. Our liquidity reserves consist of readily-marketable or pledgable assets which can be used as a source of liquidity, if needed. 44Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 30 below presents the composition of our liquidity reserves as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.Table 30: Liquidity Reserves(Dollars in millions) March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014Cash and cash equivalents $8,891 $7,242Investment securities available for sale, at fair value 39,321 39,508Investment securities held to maturity, at fair value 24,653 23,634Total investment securities portfolio(1)(2) 63,974 63,142FHLB borrowing capacity secured by loans 28,389 29,547Outstanding FHLB advances and letters of credit secured by loans (7,268) (17,720)Outstanding FHLB advances and letters of credit secured by securities(3) (4) (4)Securities encumbered for Public Funds and others (10,998) (10,627)Total liquidity reserves $82,984 $71,580__________(1) The weighted average life of our securities was approximately 5.4 years and 5.7 years as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.(2) As part of our liquidity management strategy, we pledge securities to secure borrowings from counterparties and to secure trust and public deposits and other purposes as required or permitted by law. We pledged securities available for sale with a fair value of $3.0 billion and $3.5 billion as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. We also pledged securities held to maturity with a carrying value of $9.1 billion and $9.0 billion as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. (3) As of March 31, 2015, we pledged $13 million of securities available for sale to secure our FHLB borrowing capacity. Our liquidity reserves increased by $11.4 billion, or 16%, in the first quarter of 2015, to $83.0 billion as of March 31, 2015, from December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to lower short-term FHLB advances as we experienced a seasonal drop in loan balances. See “MD&A—Risk Management” in our 2014 Form 10-K for additional information on our management of liquidity risk. In September 2014, the Federal Banking Agencies issued final rules implementing the Basel III LCR in the United States (the “Final LCR Rule”). The Final LCR Rule applies to institutions with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in total consolidated on-balance sheet foreign exposure, and their respective consolidated subsidiary depository institutions with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The LCR is calculated by dividing the amount of an institution’s high quality, unencumbered liquid assets, as defined and calculated in accordance with the haircuts and limitations of the LCR rules, by its estimated net cash outflow, which are determined by applying assumed outflow factors in the LCR rules.The Final LCR Rule phases-in the minimum LCR standard as follows: 80% by January 1, 2015; 90% by January 1, 2016; and 100% by January 1, 2017 and thereafter. The Final LCR Rule came into effect in January 2015 and requires us to calculate the LCR as of the last business day of each month from January 2015 until July 2016, and then on a daily basis thereafter. At March 31, 2015, we exceeded the fully phased-in LCR requirement. The calculation and the underlying components are based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and are subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. FundingThe Company’s primary source of funding comes from deposits which provide us with a stable and relatively low cost of funds. In addition to deposits, the Company raises funding through the purchase of federal funds, the issuance of brokered deposits, FHLB advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios, the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, the issuance of securitized debt obligations and other borrowings. A key objective in our use of these markets is to maintain access to a diversified mix of wholesale funding sources. 45Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsDepositsTable 31 provides a comparison of the composition of our deposits, average balances, interest expense and average deposit rates for the first quarter of 2015 and full year of 2014.Table 31: Deposit Composition and Average Deposit Rates  Three Months Ended March 31, 2015(Dollars in millions) Period EndBalance AverageBalance InterestExpense % ofAverageDeposits AverageDepositRateNon-interest bearing accounts $25,232 $24,853 N/A 12.0% N/AInterest-bearing checking accounts(1) 43,183 42,309 $51 20.3 0.48%Saving deposits(2) 133,059 131,580 191 63.3 0.58Time deposits less than $100,000 5,712 5,885 17 2.8 1.12Total core deposits 207,186 204,627 259 98.4 0.51Time deposits of $100,000 or more 2,197 2,211 11 1.1 1.96Foreign time deposits(3) 1,057 1,013 1 0.5 0.34Total deposits $210,440 $207,851 $271 100.0% 0.52  Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2014(Dollars in millions) Period EndBalance AverageBalance InterestExpense % ofAverageDeposits AverageDepositRateNon-interest bearing accounts $25,081 $24,639 N/A 12.0% N/AInterest-bearing checking accounts(1) 41,022 41,702 $204 20.3 0.49%Saving deposits(2) 130,156 129,868 752 63.1 0.58Time deposits less than $100,000 6,051 5,856 75 2.8 1.29Total core deposits 202,310 202,065 1,031 98.2 0.51Time deposits of $100,000 or more 2,261 2,560 53 1.3 2.07Foreign time deposits(3) 977 1,050 4 0.5 0.34Total deposits $205,548 $205,675 $1,088 100.0% 0.53__________(1) Includes Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (“NOW”) accounts. (2) Includes Money Market Deposit Accounts (“MMDA”).(3) Substantially all of our foreign time deposits were greater than $100,000 as of both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Our deposits include brokered deposits, which we obtained through the use of third-party intermediaries. Those brokered deposits are reported as saving deposits and time deposits in the above table and totaled $5.0 billion and $5.1 billion as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.The Federal Deposit Issuance Corporation (“FDIC”) limits the use of brokered deposits to “well-capitalized” insured depository institutions and, with a waiver from the FDIC, to “adequately capitalized” institutions. COBNA and CONA were “well-capitalized,” as defined under the federal banking regulatory guidelines, as of both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, and therefore were permitted to maintain brokered deposits.Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term DebtWe access the capital markets to meet our funding needs through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligation transactions, and federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. In addition, we may utilize short-term and long-term FHLB advances secured by our investment securities, residential home loans, multifamily real estate loans, commercial real estate loans and home equity lines of credit. Our short-term borrowings include those borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less and do not include the current portion of long-term debt. The short-term borrowings, which consist of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, and short-term FHLB advances, decreased by $10.4 billion to $6.7 billion as of March 31,  46Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents2015 from December 31, 2014. This decrease reflects $11.9 billion in payoffs of FHLB advances, partially offset by $1.4 billion in new FHLB advances during the first quarter of 2015, primarily driven by lower liquidity-related short-term funding due to expected seasonality.Our long-term debt, which consists of securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, and long-term FHLB advances, increased by $3.0 billion, to $34.3 billion as of March 31, 2015 from December 31, 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to net increases of $1.9 billion in unsecured notes and $1.1 billion in securitized debt obligations.Table 32 displays the maturity profile, based on contractual maturities, of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt including securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings as of March 31, 2015, and the outstanding balances as of December 31, 2014.Table 32: Contractual Maturity Profile of Outstanding Debt   March 31, 2015  (Dollars in millions) Up to1 Year > 1 Yearto 2 Years > 2 Yearsto 3 Years > 3 Yearsto 4 Years > 4 Yearsto 5 Years > 5 Years Total December 31, 2014Short-term borrowings:                Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase $933 $— $— $— $— $— $933 $880FHLB advances 5,750 — — — — — 5,750 16,200Total short-term borrowings 6,683 — — — — — 6,683 17,080Long-term debt:                Securitized debt obligations 1,652 5,482 4,370 588 550 75 12,717 11,624Senior and subordinated notes:                Unsecured senior debt 1,627 2,521 4,463 1,612 2,535 5,146 17,904 16,054Unsecured subordinated debt — 1,067 — — 328 1,260 2,655 2,630Total senior and subordinated notes 1,627 3,588 4,463 1,612 2,863 6,406 20,559 18,684Other long-term borrowings:                FHLB advances 1,016 20 25 5 2 2 1,070 1,069Total long-term debt(1) 4,295 9,090 8,858 2,205 3,415 6,483 34,346 31,377Total short-term borrowings and long-term debt $10,978 $9,090 $8,858 $2,205 $3,415 $6,483 $41,029 $48,457Percentage of total 27% 22% 22% 5% 8% 16% 100% 100%__________(1) Includes unamortized discounts, premiums and other cost basis adjustments, which together result in a net reduction of $222 million and $233 million as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.We provide additional information on our short-term borrowings and long-term debt under “Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis—Securitized Debt Obligations,” “Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis—Other Debt” and in “Note 8—Deposits and Borrowings.”Borrowing CapacityWe filed a new shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on March 31, 2015, which expires in 2018. Under this shelf registration, we may periodically offer and sell an indeterminate aggregate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units. There is no limit under this shelf registration statement to the amount or number of such securities that we may offer and sell, subject to market conditions. In addition to our issuance capacity under the shelf registration statement, we also have access to FHLB advances with a maximum borrowing capacity of $28.4 billion as of March 31, 2015, of which $21.1 billion was still available to us to borrow as of March 31, 2015. To secure this borrowing capacity, we pledged loan collateral with an outstanding balance of $35.6 billion and security collateral with a fair value of $13 million as of March 31, 2015. The ability to draw down funding is based on membership status and the amount is dependent upon the Banks’ ability to post collateral. Our FHLB membership is secured by our investment in  47Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsFHLB stock of $320 million and $807 million as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, which was determined in part based on our outstanding advances. We also have access to the Federal Reserve Discount Window through which we had a borrowing capacity of $8.4 billion as of March 31, 2015. Although available, we do not view this borrowing capacity as a primary source of liquidity and did not utilize it in 2014 or the first quarter of 2015.Credit RatingsOur credit ratings have a significant impact on our ability to access capital markets and our non-deposit borrowing costs. Rating agencies base their ratings on numerous factors, including liquidity, capital adequacy, asset quality, quality of earnings and the probability of systemic support. Significant changes in these factors could result in different ratings. Such ratings help to support our cost effective unsecured funding as part of our overall financing programs. Table 33 provides a summary of the credit ratings for the senior unsecured debt of Capital One Financial Corporation, COBNA and CONA as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.Table 33: Senior Unsecured Debt Credit Ratings   March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014  Capital OneFinancialCorporation Capital OneBank (USA),N.A.

On March 17, 2015 Moody announced that they would be adopting a new bank rating methodology that could potentially result in changes in the ratings of the securities of many banks including Capital One’s. As part of that announcement, Moody’s put COF’s subordinated debt and preferred stock on review for a possible one notch ratings upgrade and COBNA and CONA’s senior unsecured debt on review for a possible one notch ratings downgrade.MARKET RISK PROFILEMarket risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and activities, including loans, deposits, securities, short-term borrowings, long-term debt and derivatives. Below we provide additional information about our primary sources of market risk, our market risk management strategies and the measures we use to evaluate our market risk exposure.Primary Market Risk ExposuresOur primary source of market risk is interest rate risk. We also have exposure to foreign exchange risk.Interest Rate RiskInterest rate risk, which represents exposure to instruments whose yield or price varies with the volatility of interest rates, is our most significant source of market risk exposure. Banks are inevitably exposed to interest rate risk due to differences in the timing between the maturities or repricing of assets and liabilities.  48Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsForeign Exchange RiskForeign exchange risk represents exposure to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies. Our primary exposure is related to the funding of our non-dollar net investments in our International Card business in the U.K. and Canada. Our intercompany funding exposes our income statement to foreign exchange transaction risk, while our equity investments in our foreign operations results in translation risk in AOCI. We manage our transaction risk by entering into forward foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to foreign currency denominated intercompany borrowings. In the third quarter of 2014, we began entering into net investment hedges to manage our AOCI exposure. We apply hedge accounting to both of the intercompany funding hedges and the net investment hedges. We measure our total exposure by regularly tracking the equity value of our net equity invested in our U.K. and Canadian foreign operations as well as their funding requirements. We apply a 30 percent U.S. dollar appreciation shock against each of our Great British Pound (“GBP”) and Canadian Dollar (“CAD”) net investment exposures. This shock approximates a 99 percent confidence interval over a one year time horizon for our combined GBP and CAD net investment exposure. Our gross equity exposures were 1.3 billion GBP as of both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014  and 605 million CAD and 581 million CAD as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 respectively. As a result of our derivative management activities, we believe our net exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal. Market Risk ManagementWe employ several techniques to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk, which include, but are not limited to, altering the duration and re-pricing characteristics of our various assets and liabilities through interest rate derivatives or mitigating the foreign exchange exposure of certain non-dollar denominated equity or transactions through derivatives. Derivatives are one of the primary tools we use in managing interest rate and foreign exchange risk. Our current asset and liability management policy includes the use of derivatives. We execute our derivative contracts in both over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivative markets. Although the majority of our derivatives are interest rate swaps, we also use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage both our interest rate and foreign currency risk. The outstanding notional amount of our derivative contracts totaled $91.8 billion as of March 31, 2015, compared to $88.6 billion as of December 31, 2014, driven by an increase in our hedging activities.Market Risk MeasurementWe have prescribed risk management policies and limits established by our Market and Liquidity Risk Policy and approved by the Board of Directors. Our objective is to manage our asset and liability risk position and exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and prescribed limits based on prevailing market conditions and long-term expectations. Because no single measure can reflect all aspects of market risk, we use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analysis to measure, assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and foreign exchange rates on our non-dollar denominated earnings and non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations. We provide additional information below in “Economic Value of Equity.” We consider the impact on both net interest income and economic value of equity in measuring and managing our interest rate risk. Because the federal funds rate was lowered to near zero in December 2008, and since then has remained in a target range of 0% to 0.25%, we use a 50 basis points decrease as our declining interest rate scenario, since a scenario where interest rates would decline by 200 basis points is unlikely. In scenarios where a 50 basis points decline would result in a rate less than 0%, we assume a rate of 0%. Below we discuss the assumptions used in calculating each of these measures. Net Interest Income SensitivityThis sensitivity measure estimates the impact on our projected 12-month base-line interest rate sensitive revenue resulting from movements in interest rates. Interest rate sensitive revenue consists of net interest income and certain components of other non-interest income significantly impacted by movements in interest rates, including changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and free-standing interest rate swaps. Adjusted net interest income consists of net interest income and changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, including related derivative hedging activity, and changes in the fair value of free-standing interest rate swaps. In addition to our existing assets and liabilities, we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions, such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, and plans for projected changes in our funding mix in our baseline forecast. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our projected interest rate sensitive revenue, we assume an instantaneous +200 basis points and -50 basis points shock, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above. 49Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsEconomic Value of EquityOur economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact on the net present value of our assets and liabilities, including derivative hedging activity, resulting from movements in interest rates. Our economic value of equity sensitivity measures are calculated based on our existing assets and liabilities, including derivatives, and do not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected plans for funding mix changes. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our economic value of equity, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates of +200 basis points and -50 basis points to spot rates, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above. Table 34 shows the estimated percentage impact on our projected base-line net interest income and economic value of equity, calculated under the methodology described above, as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Table 34: Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis  March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014Estimated impact on projected base-line net interest income    +200 basis points 4.0% 4.5%–50 basis points (2.3) (2.1)Estimated impact on economic value of equity    +200 basis points (2.2) (3.4)–50 basis points (1.6) (1.2)Our projected net interest income and economic value of equity sensitivity measures were within our prescribed asset/liability policy limits as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. In addition to these industry standard measures, we will continue to factor into our internal interest rate risk management decisions the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios, such as stressed rate shocks as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios.Limitations of Market Risk MeasuresThe interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information, internally-developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies, which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments. Other market inputs, such as interest rates, market prices and interest rate volatility, are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures. We regularly evaluate, update and enhance these assumptions, models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities.There are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates.

(collectively, “HSBC”), we closed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumed liabilities of HSBC’s credit card and private label credit card business in the United States (other than the HSBC Bank USA, consumer credit card program and certain other retained assets and liabilities). Acquired Loans: Refers to the substantial majority of consumer and commercial loans acquired in the ING Direct and Chevy Chase Bank acquisitions, and a limited portion of the credit card loans acquired in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition, which were recorded at fair value at acquisition and subsequently accounted for based on expected cash flows to be collected (under the accounting standard formerly known as “Statement of Position 03-3, Accounting for Certain Loans or Debt Securities Acquired in a Transfer,” commonly referred to as “SOP 03-3” or “ASC 310-30”). The difference between the fair value at acquisition and expected cash flows represents the accretable yield, which is recognized into interest income over the life of the loans. The difference between the contractual payments on the loans and expected cash flows represents the nonaccretable difference or the amount of principal and interest not considered collectible, which incorporates future expected credit losses over the life of the loans. Decreases in expected cash flows from the previous estimate resulting from further credit deterioration will generally result in an impairment charge recognized in our provision for credit losses and an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses. Charge-offs are not recorded until the expected credit losses within the nonaccretable difference is depleted. In addition, Acquired Loans are not classified as delinquent or nonperforming as we expect to collect our net investment in these loans and the nonaccretable difference will absorb the majority of the losses associated with these loans.

CompanyCapital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware Corporation established in 1994 and headquartered in McLean, Virginia, is a diversified financial services holding company with banking and non-banking subsidiaries. Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) offers a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through branches, the internet and other distribution channels. As of March 31, 2015, our principal subsidiaries included:•Capital One Bank (USA), National Association (“COBNA”), which offers credit and debit card products, other lending products and deposit products; and•Capital One, National Association (“CONA”), which offers a broad spectrum of banking products and financial services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients.The Company and its subsidiaries are hereafter collectively referred to as “we,” “us” or “our.” COBNA and CONA are collectively referred to as the “Banks.”We also offer products outside of the United States of America (“U.S.”) principally through Capital One (Europe) plc (“COEP”), an indirect subsidiary of COBNA organized and located in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), and through a branch of COBNA in Canada. COEP has authority, among other things, to provide credit card loans. Our branch of COBNA in Canada also has the authority to provide credit card loans.Our principal operations are currently organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. We provide details on our business segments, the integration of recent acquisitions into our business segments, and the allocation methodologies and accounting policies used to derive our business segment results in “Note 13—Business Segments.”Basis of Presentation and Use of EstimatesThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and in the related disclosures. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. While management makes its best judgment, actual amounts or results could differ from these estimates. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Capital One Financial Corporation and all other entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. We determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”). All significant intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated.Change in Accounting Principle As of January 1, 2015, we changed our accounting principle to move from a gross basis of presentation to a net basis, for presenting qualifying derivative assets and liabilities, as well as the related fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable), for instruments executed with the same counterparty where a right of setoff exists. This newly adopted policy is preferable as it more accurately reflects the Company’s counterparty credit risk as well as our contractual rights and obligations under these arrangements. Further, this change will align our presentation with that of the majority of our peer institutions. We retrospectively adopted this change in accounting principle and our consolidated balance sheet has been recast for all prior periods presented. As a result, our interest receivable, other assets and total assets as of December 31, 2014 were reduced by $356 million, $331 million and $687 million, respectively. Interest payable, other liabilities and total liabilities decreased as of December 31, 2014 by $63 million, $624 million and $687 million, respectively. There was no impact to operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows or any line item within the consolidated statements of income. See “Note 9—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” for additional detail on the accounting for derivative instruments.New Accounting Standards AdoptedAccounting for Repurchase TransactionsIn June 2014, the FASB issued guidance that requires repurchase-to-maturity transactions to be accounted for as secured borrowings rather than sales. New disclosures will also be required for certain transactions accounted for as secured borrowings and transfers accounted for as sales when the transferor retains substantially all of the exposure to the economic return on the transferred financial assets. Our adoption of the accounting guidance in the first quarter of 2015 did not have a significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity as the guidance is consistent with our current practice. As required by the new guidance, the new disclosures will be effective and provided beginning in the second quarter of 2015. Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service PeriodIn June 2014, the FASB issued guidance clarifying that a performance target contained within a share-based payment award that affects vesting and can be achieved after the requisite service period has been completed is to be accounted for as a performance condition. Accordingly, the grantor of such awards should recognize compensation cost in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved. The amount of the compensation cost recognized should represent the cost attributable to the requisite service period fulfilled. The guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. Our adoption of this guidance in the first quarter of 2015 did not have a significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity as the guidance is consistent with our current practice.Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an EntityIn April 2014, the FASB issued guidance raising the threshold for a disposal to qualify as a discontinued operation. Under the new guidance, a component of an entity or group of components that has been disposed by sale, disposed of other than by sale or is classified as held for sale and that represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results should be reported as discontinued operations. The guidance should be applied prospectively for disposals or classifications as held for sale of components of an entity that occur within annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2014, with early adoption permitted in certain circumstances. Our adoption of this guidance in the first quarter of 2015 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements due to the prospective transition provisions. Reclassification of Residential Real Estate Collateralized Consumer Mortgage Loans Upon Foreclosure In January 2014, the FASB issued guidance clarifying when an entity should reclassify a consumer mortgage loan collateralized by residential real estate to foreclosed property. Reclassification should occur when the creditor obtains legal title to the residential real estate property or when the borrower conveys all interest in the residential real estate property to the creditor to satisfy that loan through completion of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or through a similar legal agreement. An entity should not wait until a redemption period, if any, has expired to reclassify a consumer mortgage loan to foreclosed property. The guidance was effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2014. Our adoption of this guidance in the first quarter of 2015 did not have a significant impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity as the guidance is materially consistent with our current practice. Recently Issued but Not Yet Adopted Accounting Standards Simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costsIn April 2015, the FASB issued guidance simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs. Under the new guidance, the debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability will be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The guidance should be applied retrospectively and is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact from the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements. 67Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE 2—DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSShutdown of Mortgage Origination Operations of our Wholesale Mortgage Banking UnitIn the third quarter of 2007, we closed the mortgage origination operations of our wholesale mortgage banking unit, GreenPoint, which we acquired in December 2006 as part of the North Fork Bancorporation, Inc. (“North Fork”) acquisition. The results of the wholesale banking unit have been accounted for as a discontinued operation and are therefore not included in our results from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014. We have no significant continuing involvement in these operations.The following table summarizes the results from discontinued operations related to the closure of the mortgage origination operations of our wholesale mortgage banking unit: Table 2.1: Results of Discontinued Operations   Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2015 2014Non-interest income, net $30 $47Income from discontinued operations before income taxes 30 47Income tax provision 11 17Income from discontinued operations, net of tax $19 $30The discontinued mortgage origination operations of our wholesale mortgage banking unit had remaining assets which primarily consisted of the deferred tax asset related to the reserve for representations and warranties; and liabilities which primarily consisted of reserves for representations and warranties on loans previously sold to third parties.

As of March 31, 2015, our investments in non-agency RMBS and CMBS, other ABS, and other securities accounted for $16 million, or 13%, of total gross unrealized losses on securities available for sale. As of March 31, 2015, the carrying value of approximately 10 securities classified as held to maturity exceeded their fair value by $3 million. Gross unrealized losses on our investment securities have generally decreased since December 31, 2014. The unrealized losses related to investment securities for which we have not recognized credit impairment are primarily attributable to changes in market interest rates. As discussed in more detail below, we conduct periodic reviews of all investment securities with unrealized losses to assess whether impairment is other-than-temporary. We believe the securities with an unrealized loss in AOCI are not other-than-temporarily impaired as of March 31, 2015.

Our OTTI assessment is based on a discounted cash flow analysis which requires careful use of judgments and assumptions. A number of qualitative and quantitative criteria may be considered in our  73Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSassessment as applicable, including the size and the nature of the portfolio; historical and projected performance such as prepayment, default and loss severity for the RMBS portfolio; recent credit events specific to the issuer and/or industry to which the issuer belongs; the payment structure of the security; external credit ratings of the issuer and any failure or delay of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments; the value of underlying collateral; our intent and ability to hold the security; and current and projected market and macro-economic conditions.If we intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, the entire difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and its fair value is recognized in earnings. As of March 31, 2015, we do not intend to sell any securities with unrealized losses recorded in AOCI nor believe that we will be required to sell any securities prior to recovery of their amortized cost.For those securities that we do not intend to sell nor expect to be required to sell, an analysis is performed to determine if any of the impairment is due to credit-related factors or whether it is due to other factors, such as interest rates. Credit-related impairment is recognized in earnings, with the remaining unrealized non-credit related impairment recorded in AOCI. We determine the credit component based on the difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected cash flows, discounted based on the effective yield. The table below presents a rollforward of the credit related OTTI recognized in earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 on investment securities for which we had no intent to sell.Table 3.8: Credit Impairment Rollforward  Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2015 2014Credit loss component, beginning of period $175 $160Additions:    Initial credit impairment 5 1Subsequent credit impairment 10 4Total additions 15 5Credit loss component, end of period $190 $165Realized Gains and Losses on Securities and OTTI Recognized in EarningsThe following table presents the gross realized gains and losses on the sale and redemption of securities available for sale, and the OTTI losses recognized in earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014.

We pledged securities available for sale with a fair value of $3.0 billion and $3.5 billion as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. We pledged securities held to maturity with a carrying value of $9.1 billion and $9.0 billion as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Of the total securities pledged as collateral, we have encumbered $11.0 billion and $10.6 billion as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, primarily related to Public Fund deposits and our derivative transactions. We accepted pledges of securities with a fair value of $137 million and $91 million as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, primarily related to our derivative transactions.Acquired SecuritiesThe table below presents the outstanding balance, carrying value and amortized cost of the acquired credit-impaired debt securities as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.Table 3.10: Outstanding Balance and Carrying Value of Acquired Securities(Dollars in millions) March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014Outstanding balance $4,076 $4,259Carrying value 2,787 2,839Amortized cost 2,307 2,354Changes in Accretable Yield of Acquired SecuritiesThe following table presents changes in the accretable yield related to the acquired credit-impaired debt securities:Table 3.11: Changes in Accretable Yield of Acquired Securities(Dollars in millions) AcquiredCredit-ImpairedSecuritiesAccretable yield as of December 31, 2014 $1,250Accretion recognized in earnings (61)Reduction due to payoffs, disposals, transfers and other (1)Net reclassifications from (to) nonaccretable difference (17)Accretable yield as of March 31, 2015 $1,171 75Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE 4—LOANSLoan Portfolio CompositionOur loan portfolio consists of loans held for investment, including restricted loans underlying our consolidated securitization trusts, and loans held for sale, and is divided into three portfolio segments: credit card, consumer banking and commercial banking loans. Credit card loans consist of domestic and international credit card loans. Consumer banking loans consist of auto, home and retail banking loans. Commercial banking loans consist of commercial and multifamily real estate, commercial and industrial and small-ticket commercial real estate loans.Our portfolio of loans held for investment also includes loans acquired in the ING Direct, CCB and 2012 U.S. card acquisitions. These loans were recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition and are referred to as Acquired Loans. The substantial majority of the loans purchased in the 2012 U.S. card acquisition had existing revolving privileges; therefore, they were excluded from the Acquired Loans and accounted for based on contractual cash flows at acquisition. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2014 Form 10-K for additional information on accounting guidance for these loans.Credit QualityWe closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to manage and evaluate our exposure to credit risk. Trends in delinquency ratios are an indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk within our loan portfolio. The level of nonperforming loans represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. Accordingly, key metrics we track and use in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming loan rates, as well as net charge-off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger balance commercial loans. The table below presents the composition and an aging analysis of our loans held for investment portfolio, which includes restricted loans for securitization investors, as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The delinquency aging includes all past due loans, both performing and nonperforming.Table 4.1: Loan Portfolio Composition and Aging Analysis  March 31, 2015(Dollars in millions) Current 30-59Days 60-89Days > 90Days TotalDelinquentLoans AcquiredLoans TotalLoansCredit Card:              Domestic credit card(1) $71,947 $637 $456 $1,070 $2,163 $21 $74,131International credit card 7,361 102 61 99 262 0 7,623Total credit card 79,308 739 517 1,169 2,425 21 81,754Consumer Banking:              Auto 36,788 1,514 515 120 2,149 0 38,937Home loan 6,509 49 25 208 282 22,114 28,905Retail banking 3,458 17 9 14 40 39 3,537Total consumer banking 46,755 1,580 549 342 2,471 22,153 71,379Commercial Banking:              Commercial and multifamily real estate 22,695 43 5 51 99 37 22,831Commercial and industrial 26,800 14 120 115 249 123 27,172Total commercial lending 49,495 57 125 166 348 160 50,003Small-ticket commercial real estate 725 4 4 5 13 0 738Total commercial banking 50,220 61 129 171 361 160 50,741Other:              Other loans 91 4 1 8 13 0 104Total loans(2) $176,374 $2,384$1,196$1,690 $5,270 $22,334 $203,978% of Total loans 86.47% 1.17% 0.58% 0.83% 2.58% 10.95% 100.00%  76Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  December 31, 2014(Dollars in millions) Current 30-59Days 60-89Days > 90Days TotalDelinquentLoans AcquiredLoans TotalLoansCredit Card:              Domestic credit card(1) $75,143 $790 $567 $1,181 $2,538 $23 $77,704International credit card 7,878 114 69 111 294 0 8,172Total credit card 83,021 904 636 1,292 2,832 23 85,876Consumer Banking:              Auto 35,142 1,751 734 197 2,682 0 37,824Home loan 6,492 57 27 218 302 23,241 30,035Retail banking 3,496 17 7 16 40 44 3,580Total consumer banking 45,130 1,825 768 431 3,024 23,285 71,439Commercial Banking:              Commercial and multifamily real estate 22,974 74 7 36 117 46 23,137Commercial and industrial 26,753 29 10 34 73 146 26,972Total commercial lending 49,727 103 17 70 190 192 50,109Small-ticket commercial real estate 771 6 1 3 10 0 781Total commercial banking 50,498 109 18 73 200 192 50,890Other:              Other loans 97 3 2 9 14 0 111Total loans(2) $178,746 $2,841 $1,424 $1,805 $6,070 $23,500 $208,316% of Total loans 85.81% 1.36% 0.68% 0.87% 2.91% 11.28% 100.00%__________(1) Includes installment loans of $123 million and $144 million as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.(2) Loans as presented are net of unearned income, unamortized premiums and discounts, and net unamortized deferred fees and costs totaling $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.We had total loans held for sale of $1.3 billion and $626 million as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.Table 4.2 presents loans 90 days or more past due that continue to accrue interest and loans classified as nonperforming as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.Table 4.2: 90+ Day Delinquent Loans Accruing Interest and Nonperforming Loans(1)   March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014(Dollars in millions) > 90 Days and Accruing Nonperforming Loans > 90 Days and Accruing Nonperforming LoansCredit Card:        Domestic credit card $1,070 $0 $1,181 $0International credit card 64 64 73 70Total credit card 1,134 64 1,254 70Consumer Banking:        Auto 0 120 0 197Home loan 0 336 0 330Retail banking 1 25 1 22Total consumer banking 1 481 1 549          77Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCommercial Banking:        Commercial and multifamily real estate 24 40 7 62Commercial and industrial 60 106 1 106Total commercial lending 84 146 8 168Small-ticket commercial real estate 0 12 0 7Total commercial banking 84 158 8 175Other:        Other loans 0 14 0 15Total $1,219 $717 $1,263 $809% of Total loans 0.60% 0.35% 0.61% 0.39%__________(1) Nonperforming loans generally include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status. Acquired Loans are excluded from loans reported as 90 days and accruing interest as well as nonperforming loans.Credit CardOur credit card loan portfolio is generally highly diversified across millions of accounts and numerous geographies without significant individual exposure. We therefore generally manage credit risk on a portfolio basis. The risk in our credit card portfolio correlates to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates, gross domestic product (“GDP”), and home values, as well as customer liquidity, which can have a material effect on credit performance. The primary factors we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our credit card portfolio are delinquency and charge-off trends, including an analysis of the migration of loans between delinquency categories over time.The table below displays the geographic profile of our credit card loan portfolio and delinquency statistics as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.

Home LoanOur home loan portfolio consists of both first-lien and second-lien residential mortgage loans. In evaluating the credit quality and risk of our home loan portfolio, we continually monitor a variety of mortgage loan characteristics that may affect the default experience on our overall home loan portfolio, such as vintage, geographic concentrations, lien priority and product type. Certain loan concentrations have experienced higher delinquency rates as a result of the significant decline in home prices since the peak in 2006 and subsequent rise in unemployment. These loan concentrations include loans originated between 2006 and 2008 in an environment of decreasing home sales, broadly declining home prices and more relaxed underwriting standards.  81Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe following table presents the distribution of our home loan portfolio as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, based on selected key risk characteristics.Table 4.7: Home Loan: Risk Profile by Vintage, Geography, Lien Priority and Interest Rate Type  March 31, 2015  Loans Acquired Loans Total Home Loans(Dollars in millions) Amount % ofTotal(1) Amount % ofTotal(1) Amount % ofTotal(1)Origination year:(2)            < = 2006 $2,706 9.4% $5,520 19.1% $8,226 28.5%2007 309 1.1 4,648 16.0 4,957 17.12008 178 0.6 3,337 11.6 3,515 12.22009 104 0.4 1,870 6.4 1,974 6.82010 113 0.4 2,864 9.9 2,977 10.32011 208 0.7 3,251 11.3 3,459 12.02012 1,536 5.3 500 1.7 2,036 7.02013 633 2.2 81 0.3 714 2.52014 734 2.5 35 0.1 769 2.62015 270 0.9 8 0.1 278 1.0Total $6,791 23.5% $22,114 76.5% $28,905 100.0%Geographic concentration:(3)            California $931 3.2% $5,765 19.9% $6,696 23.1%New York 1,363 4.7 1,024 3.5 2,387 8.2Illinois 93 0.3 1,699 5.9 1,792 6.2Maryland 464 1.6 1,210 4.2 1,674 5.8Virginia 395 1.3 1,105 3.9 1,500 5.2New Jersey 337 1.2 1,134 3.9 1,471 5.1Florida 162 0.6 1,155 4.0 1,317 4.6Arizona 90 0.3 1,165 4.0 1,255 4.3Louisiana 1,171 4.1 36 0.1 1,207 4.2Washington 105 0.4 985 3.4 1,090 3.8Other 1,680 5.8 6,836 23.7 8,516 29.5Total $6,791 23.5% $22,114 76.5% $28,905 100.0%Lien type:            1st lien $5,776 20.0% $21,766 75.3% $27,542 95.3%2nd lien 1,015 3.5 348 1.2 1,363 4.7Total $6,791 23.5% $22,114 76.5% $28,905 100.0%Interest rate type:            Fixed rate $2,513 8.7% $2,702 9.3% $5,215 18.0%Adjustable rate 4,278 14.8 19,412 67.2 23,690 82.0Total $6,791 23.5% $22,114 76.5% $28,905 100.0% 82Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  December 31, 2014  Loans Acquired Loans Total Home Loans(Dollars in millions) Amount % ofTotal(1) Amount % ofTotal(1) Amount % ofTotal(1)Origination year:(2)            < = 2006 $2,827 9.4% $5,715 19.1% $8,542 28.5%2007 320 1.1 4,766 15.8 5,086 16.92008 187 0.6 3,494 11.7 3,681 12.32009 107 0.4 1,999 6.6 2,106 7.02010 120 0.4 3,108 10.3 3,228 10.72011 221 0.7 3,507 11.7 3,728 12.42012 1,620 5.4 533 1.8 2,153 7.22013 661 2.2 85 0.3 746 2.52014 731 2.4 34 0.1 765 2.5Total $6,794 22.6% $23,241 77.4% $30,035 100.0%Geographic concentration:(3)            California $924 3.1% $6,019 20.0% $6,943 23.1%New York 1,379 4.6 1,073 3.6 2,452 8.2Illinois 86 0.3 1,787 5.9 1,873 6.2Maryland 457 1.5 1,263 4.2 1,720 5.7Virginia 385 1.3 1,153 3.8 1,538 5.1New Jersey 341 1.1 1,188 4.0 1,529 5.1Florida 161 0.5 1,214 4.1 1,375 4.6Arizona 89 0.3 1,215 4.1 1,304 4.4Louisiana 1,205 4.0 38 0.1 1,243 4.1Washington 109 0.4 1,038 3.4 1,147 3.8Other 1,658 5.5 7,253 24.2 8,911 29.7Total $6,794 22.6% $23,241 77.4% $30,035 100.0%Lien type:            1st lien $5,756 19.2% $22,883 76.2% $28,639 95.4%2nd lien 1,038 3.4 358 1.2 1,396 4.6Total $6,794 22.6% $23,241 77.4% $30,035 100.0%Interest rate type:            Fixed rate $2,446 8.1% $2,840 9.5% $5,286 17.6%Adjustable rate 4,348 14.5 20,401 67.9 24,749 82.4Total $6,794 22.6% $23,241 77.4% $30,035 100.0%__________(1) Percentages within each risk category are calculated based on total home loans held for investment.(2) The Acquired Loans origination balances in the years subsequent to 2012 are related to refinancing of previously acquired home loans.(3) Represents the ten states in which we have the highest concentration of home loans.Our recorded investment in home loans for properties that are in process of foreclosure was $583 million as of March 31, 2015.

We assign internal risk ratings to loans based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt. In determining the risk rating of a particular loan, among the factors considered are the borrower’s current financial condition, historical credit performance, projected future credit performance, prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors, the estimated realizable value of any collateral and current economic trends. The ratings scale based on our internal risk-rating system is as follows:•Noncriticized: Loans that have not been designated as criticized, frequently referred to as “pass” loans.•Criticized performing: Loans in which the financial condition of the obligor is stressed, affecting earnings, cash flows or collateral values. The borrower currently has adequate capacity to meet near-term obligations; however, the stress, left unabated, may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects at some future date.•Criticized nonperforming: Loans that are not adequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as criticized nonperforming have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, which jeopardize the repayment of the debt. These loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain a credit loss if the deficiencies are not corrected and are generally placed on nonaccrual status.We use our internal risk-rating system for regulatory reporting, determining the frequency of credit exposure reviews, and evaluating and determining the allowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans. Loans of $1 million or more designated as criticized performing and criticized nonperforming are reviewed quarterly by management for further deterioration or improvement to determine if they are appropriately classified/graded and whether impairment exists. Noncriticized loans greater than $1 million are specifically reviewed, at least annually, to determine the appropriate loan grading. In addition, we evaluate the risk rating during the renewal process of any loan or if a loan becomes past due.The following table presents the geographic distribution and internal risk ratings of our commercial loan portfolio as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.Table 4.8: Commercial Banking: Risk Profile by Geographic Region and Internal Risk Rating  March 31, 2015(Dollars in millions) CommercialandMultifamilyReal Estate % ofTotal(1) CommercialandIndustrial % ofTotal(1) Small-ticketCommercialReal Estate % ofTotal(1)  TotalCommercial Banking % ofTotal(1) Geographic concentration:(2)                Loans:                Northeast $14,677 64.3% $6,448 23.7% $452 61.2% $21,577 42.5%Mid-Atlantic 2,578 11.3 2,138 7.9 28 3.8 4,744 9.3South 3,375 14.8 12,133 44.7 46 6.2 15,554 30.7Other 2,201 9.6 6,453 23.7 212 28.8 8,866 17.5Total $22,831 100.0% $27,172 100.0% $738 100.0% $50,741 100.0%Internal risk rating:(3)                Loans:                Noncriticized $22,283 97.6% $25,933 95.4% $722 97.8% $48,938 96.5%Criticized performing 508 2.2 1,133 4.2 4 0.6 1,645 3.2Criticized nonperforming 40 0.2 106 0.4 12 1.6 158 0.3Total $22,831 100.0% $27,172 100.0% $738 100.0% $50,741 100.0% 84Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  December 31, 2014(Dollars in millions) CommercialandMultifamilyReal Estate % ofTotal(1) CommercialandIndustrial % ofTotal(1) Small-ticketCommercialReal Estate % ofTotal(1)  TotalCommercial Banking % ofTotal(1) Geographic concentration:(2)                Loans:                Northeast $15,135 65.4% $6,384 23.7% $478 61.2% $21,997 43.2%Mid-Atlantic 2,491 10.8 2,121 7.9 30 3.8 4,642 9.1South 3,070 13.3 12,310 45.6 48 6.2 15,428 30.3Other 2,441 10.5 6,157 22.8 225 28.8 8,823 17.4Total $23,137 100.0% $26,972 100.0% $781 100.0% $50,890 100.0%Internal risk rating:(3)                Loans:                Noncriticized $22,535 97.4% $25,982 96.3% $767 98.2% $49,284 96.9%Criticized performing 540 2.3 884 3.3 7 0.9 1,431 2.8Criticized nonperforming 62 0.3 106 0.4 7 0.9 175 0.3Total $23,137 100.0% $26,972 100.0% $781 100.0% $50,890 100.0%__________(1) Percentages calculated based on total held for investment commercial loans in each respective loan category as of the end of the reported period.(2) Northeast consists of CT, ME, MA, NH, NJ, NY, PA and VT.

Unused credit card lines available to our customers totaled $296.6 billion and $292.9 billion as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. While these amounts represented the total available unused credit card lines, we have not experienced and do not anticipate that all of our customers will access their entire available line at any given point in time.In addition to available unused credit card lines, we enter into commitments to extend credit that are legally binding conditional agreements having fixed expirations or termination dates and specified interest rates and purposes. These commitments generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards. Collateral requirements and loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios are the same as those for funded transactions and are established based on management’s credit assessment of the customer. These commitments may expire without being drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future funding requirements. The outstanding unfunded commitments to extend credit, other than credit card lines, were approximately $22.7 billion and $23.6 billion as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. 90Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE 5—ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSESOur allowance for loan and lease losses represents management’s best estimate of incurred loan and lease losses inherent in our loans held for investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date. In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments, such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, and binding unfunded loan commitments. The provision for unfunded lending commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income and the related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of our 2014 Form 10-K for further discussion on the methodology and policy for determining our allowance for loan and lease losses for each of our loan portfolio segments.Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses ActivityThe allowance for loan and lease losses is increased through the provision for credit losses and reduced by net charge-offs. The provision for credit losses, which is recorded in earnings, reflects credit losses we believe have been incurred and will eventually be reflected over time in our net charge-offs. Charge-offs of uncollectible amounts are deducted from the allowance for loan and lease losses and subsequent recoveries are included. We have certain credit card partnership arrangements in which our partner agrees to share in a portion of the credit losses associated with the partnership. The loss sharing amounts due from our partners resulted in reductions in reported charge-offs of $44 million and $42 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and reductions in the provision for loan and lease losses of $57 million and $35 million for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The expected reimbursement from these partners, which is netted against our allowance for loan and lease losses, was approximately $156 million and $143 million as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of our 2014 Form 10-K for further discussion on our card partnership agreements. The table below summarizes changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses, by portfolio segment, for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014.Table 5.1: Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses                       CreditCard Consumer Banking Commercial Banking Other(1) TotalAllowance UnfundedLendingCommitmentsReserve CombinedAllowance&UnfundedReserve(Dollars in millions) Auto HomeLoan RetailBanking TotalConsumerBanking Balance as of December 31, 2014 $3,204 $661 $62 $56 $779 $395 $5 $4,383 $113 $4,496Provision for credit losses 669 184 8 14 206 52 0 927 8 935Charge-offs (1,022) (233) (4) (13) (250) (9) (3) (1,284) 0 (1,284)Recoveries 303 85 2 4 91 6 3 403 0 403Net charge-offs (719) (148) (2) (9) (159) (3) 0 (881) 0 (881)Other changes(2) (24) 0 0 0 0 0 0 (24) 0 (24)Balance as of March 31, 2015 $3,130 $697 $68 $61 $826 $444 $5 $4,405 $121 $4,526 91Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  CreditCard Consumer Banking Commercial Banking Other(1) TotalAllowance UnfundedLendingCommitmentsReserve CombinedAllowance&UnfundedReserve(Dollars in millions) Auto HomeLoan RetailBanking TotalConsumerBanking Balance as of December 31, 2013 $3,214 $606 $83 $63 $752 $338 $11 $4,315 $87 $4,402Provision (benefit) for credit losses 558 136 (6) 10 140 28 (3) 723 12 735Charge-offs (1,095) (205) (11) (15) (231) (7) (2) (1,335) 0 (1,335)Recoveries 315 71 6 6 83 3 3 404 0 404Net charge-offs (780) (134) (5) (9) (148) (4) 1 (931) 0 (931)Other changes(2) (8) 0 0 0 0 0 (1) (9) 0 (9)Balance as of March 31, 2014 $2,984 $608 $72 $64 $744 $362 $8 $4,098 $99 $4,197_________(1)  Other consists of our discontinued GreenPoint mortgage operations loan portfolio and our community redevelopment loan portfolio.(2)  Represents foreign currency translation adjustments and the net impact of loan transfers and sales.Components of Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses by Impairment MethodologyThe table below presents the components of our allowance for loan and lease losses, by portfolio segment and impairment methodology, and the recorded investment of the related loans as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.Table 5.2: Components of Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses by Impairment Methodology  March 31, 2015    Consumer Banking      (Dollars in millions) CreditCard Auto HomeLoan RetailBanking TotalConsumer Banking Commercial Banking Other TotalAllowance for loan and lease losses:Collectively evaluated(1) $2,920 $675 $19 $52 $746 $411 $5 $4,082Asset-specific(2) 210 22 16 9 47 32 0 289Acquired Loans(3) 0 0 33 0 33 1 0 34Total allowance for loan and lease losses $3,130 $697 $68 $61 $826 $444 $5 $4,405Loans held for investment:Collectively evaluated(1) $81,060 $38,688 $6,426 $3,444 $48,558 $50,237 $104 $179,959Asset-specific(2) 673 249 365 54 668 344 0 1,685Acquired Loans(3) 21 0 22,114 39 22,153 160 0 22,334Total loans held for investment $81,754 $38,937 $28,905 $3,537 $71,379 $50,741 $104 $203,978Allowance as a percentage of period-end loans held for investment 3.83% 1.79% 0.23% 1.74% 1.16% 0.87% 4.48% 2.16% 92Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  December 31, 2014    Consumer Banking      (Dollars in millions) CreditCard Auto HomeLoan RetailBanking TotalConsumer Banking Commercial Banking Other TotalAllowance for loan and lease losses:                Collectively evaluated(1) $2,985 $642 $18 $50 $710 $356 $5 $4,056Asset-specific(2) 219 19 17 6 42 39 0 300Acquired Loans(3) 0 0 27 0 27 0 0 27Total allowance for loan and lease losses $3,204 $661 $62 $56 $779 $395 $5 $4,383Loans held for investment:                Collectively evaluated(1) $85,161 $37,594 $6,427 $3,486 $47,507 $50,328 $111 $183,107Asset-specific(2) 692 230 367 50 647 370 0 1,709Acquired Loans(3) 23 0 23,241 44 23,285 192 0 23,500Total loans held for investment $85,876 $37,824 $30,035 $3,580 $71,439 $50,890 $111 $208,316Allowance as a percentage of period-end loans held for investment 3.73% 1.75% 0.21% 1.58% 1.09% 0.78% 4.68% 2.10%__________(1) The component of the allowance for loan and lease losses for credit card and other consumer loans that we collectively evaluate for impairment is based on a statistical calculation supplemented by management judgment and interpretation.

See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2014 Form 10-K for details on these loans. 93Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE 6—VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES AND SECURITIZATIONSIn the normal course of business, we enter into various types of transactions with entities that are considered to be VIEs. Our primary involvement with VIEs has been related to our securitization transactions in which we transferred assets from our balance sheet to securitization trusts. We have primarily securitized credit card loans and home loans, which have provided a source of funding for us and enabled us to transfer a certain portion of the economic risk of the loans or debt securities to third parties.The entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is referred to as the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE. The majority of the VIEs in which we are involved have been consolidated on our financial statements.Summary of Consolidated and Unconsolidated VIEsThe table below presents a summary of VIEs, aggregated based on VIEs with similar characteristics, in which we had continuing involvement or held a variable interest as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. We separately present information for consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs.For consolidated VIEs, we present the carrying amount of assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. The assets of consolidated VIEs primarily consist of cash and loans, which we report on our consolidated balance sheets under restricted cash and restricted loans, respectively, for securitization investors. The assets of a particular VIE are the primary source of funds to settle its obligations. The creditors of the VIEs typically do not have recourse to the general credit of the Company. The liabilities primarily consist of debt securities issued by the VIEs, which we report under securitized debt obligations. For unconsolidated VIEs, we present the carrying amount of assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets and our maximum exposure to loss. Our maximum exposure to loss is estimated based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and we are required to meet our maximum remaining funding obligations.Table 6.1: Carrying Amount of Consolidated and Unconsolidated VIEs  March 31, 2015  Consolidated Unconsolidated(Dollars in millions) CarryingAmountof Assets CarryingAmount ofLiabilities CarryingAmountof Assets CarryingAmount ofLiabilities Maximum Exposure toLossSecuritization-related VIEs:          Credit card loan securitizations(1) $34,172 $13,425 $0 $0 $0Home loan securitizations(2) 0 0 223 28 892Total securitization-related VIEs 34,172 13,425 223 28 892Other VIEs:          Affordable housing entities 0 0 3,502 463 3,502Entities that provide capital to low-income and rural communities 384 100 0 0 0Other 0 0 70 0 70Total other VIEs 384 100 3,572 463 3,572Total VIEs $34,556 $13,525 $3,795 $491 $4,464 94Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  December 31, 2014  Consolidated Unconsolidated(Dollars in millions) CarryingAmountof Assets CarryingAmount ofLiabilities CarryingAmountof Assets CarryingAmount ofLiabilities MaximumExposure toLossSecuritization-related VIEs:          Credit card loan securitizations(1) $36,779 $12,350 $0 $0 $0Home loan securitizations(2) 0 0 221 31 876Total securitization-related VIEs 36,779 12,350 221 31 876Other VIEs:          Affordable housing entities 0 0 3,500 488 3,500Entities that provide capital to low-income and rural communities 374 99 1 0 1Other 4 0 74 0 74Total other VIEs 378 99 3,575 488 3,575Total VIEs $37,157 $12,449 $3,796 $519 $4,451__________(1) Represents the gross amount of assets and liabilities owned by the VIE, which includes seller’s interest and retained and repurchased notes held by other related parties.(2) The carrying amount of assets of unconsolidated securitization-related VIEs consists of retained interests associated with the securitization of option-adjustable rate mortgage loans (“option-ARM”) and letters of credit related to manufactured housing securitizations. These are reported on our consolidated balance sheets under other assets. The carrying amount of liabilities of unconsolidated securitization-related VIEs is comprised of obligations on certain swap agreements associated with the securitization of manufactured housing loans and other obligations. These are reported on our consolidated balance sheets under other liabilities.Securitization-Related VIEsIn a securitization transaction, assets from our balance sheet are transferred to a trust we establish, which typically meets the definition of a VIE. Our continuing involvement in the majority of our securitization transactions consists primarily of holding certain retained interests and acting as the primary servicer. We have the option to repurchase receivables from the trust if the outstanding balance of the receivables falls to a level where the cost exceeds the benefits of servicing such receivables. In some cases, we are contractually required to exercise the repurchase option if the primary servicer fails to do so. We also may have exposure associated with contractual obligations to repurchase previously transferred loans due to breaches of representations and warranties. See “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others” for information related to reserves we have established for our mortgage representation and warranty exposure. 95Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe table below presents the securitization-related VIEs in which we had continuing involvement as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.Table 6.2: Continuing Involvement in Securitization-Related VIEs  Non-Mortgage Mortgage (Dollars in millions) CreditCard OptionARM GreenPointHELOCs GreenPointManufacturedHousing March 31, 2015:         Securities held by third-party investors $12,717 $1,971 $90 $862 Receivables in the trust 33,938 2,037 84 868 Cash balance of spread or reserve accounts 0 8 N/A 145 Retained interests Yes Yes Yes Yes Servicing retained Yes Yes(1) No No(2) Amortization event(3) No No No No December 31, 2014:         Securities held by third-party investors $11,624 $2,026 $95 $887 Receivables in the trust 36,545 2,094 89 893 Cash balance of spread or reserve accounts 0 8 N/A 143 Retained interests Yes Yes Yes Yes Servicing retained Yes Yes(1) No(1) No(2) Amortization event(3) No No No No __________(1) We retained servicing of the outstanding balance for a portion of securitized mortgage receivables.(2) The core servicing activities for the manufactured housing securitizations are completed by a third party.(3) Amortization events vary according to each specific trust agreement but generally are triggered by declines in performance or credit metrics, such as net charge-off rates or delinquency rates, below certain predetermined thresholds. Generally, the occurrence of an amortization event changes the sequencing and amount of trust-related cash flows to the benefit of senior noteholders.Non-Mortgage SecuritizationsAs of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we were deemed to be the primary beneficiary of all of our non-mortgage securitization trusts. Accordingly, all of these trusts have been consolidated in our financial statements. Mortgage SecuritizationsOption-ARM LoansWe had previously securitized option-ARM loans by transferring the mortgage loans to securitization trusts that had issued mortgage-backed securities to investors. The outstanding balance of debt securities held by third-party investors related to our mortgage loan securitization trusts was $2.0 billion as of both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.We continue to service a portion of the outstanding balance of securitized mortgage receivables. We also retain rights to future cash flows arising from the receivables, the most significant being certificated interest-only bonds issued by the trusts. We generally estimate the fair value of these retained interests based on the estimated present value of expected future cash flows from securitized and sold receivables, using our best estimates of the key assumptions which include credit losses, prepayment speeds and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. For the trusts that we continue to service, we do not consolidate these entities because we do not have the right to receive benefits nor the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts. For the remaining trusts, for which we no longer service the underlying mortgage loans, we do not consolidate these entities since we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts.In connection with the securitization of certain option-ARM loans, a third party is obligated to advance a portion of any “negative amortization” resulting from monthly payments that are less than the interest accrued for that payment period. We have an agreement in place with the third party that mirrors this advance requirement. The amount advanced is tracked through mortgage-backed  96Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSsecurities retained as part of the securitization transaction. As advances occur, we record an asset in the form of negative amortization bonds, which are held at fair value in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Our maximum exposure is affected by rate caps and monthly payment change caps, but the funding obligation cannot exceed the difference between the original loan balance multiplied by a preset negative amortization cap and the current unpaid principal balance. We have also entered into certain derivative contracts related to the securitization activities. These are classified as free-standing derivatives, with fair value adjustments recorded in non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income. See “Note 9—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” for further details on these derivatives.GreenPoint Mortgage Home Equity Lines of Credit (“HELOCs”)Our discontinued wholesale mortgage banking unit, GreenPoint, previously sold HELOCs in whole loan sales and subsequently acquired residual interests in certain trusts which securitized some of those loans. We do not consolidate these trusts because we either lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts or because we do not have the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts. As the residual interest holder, GreenPoint is required to fund advances on the HELOCs when certain performance triggers are met due to deterioration in asset performance. On behalf of GreenPoint, we have funded cumulative advances of $30 million as of both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. These advances are generally expensed as funded due to the low likelihood of recovery. We also have unfunded commitments of $6 million related to those interests for our non-consolidated VIEs as of both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.GreenPoint Credit Manufactured HousingWe retain the primary obligation for certain provisions of corporate guarantees, recourse sales and clean-up calls related to the discontinued manufactured housing operations of GreenPoint Credit, LLC, which was a subsidiary of GreenPoint and was sold to a third party in 2004. Although we are the primary obligor, recourse obligations related to aforementioned whole loan sales, commitments to exercise mandatory clean-up calls on certain securitization transactions and servicing were transferred to a third party in the sale transaction. We do not consolidate the trusts used for the securitization of manufactured housing loans because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts since we no longer service the loans.We were required to fund letters of credit in 2004 to cover losses and are obligated to fund future amounts under swap agreements for certain transactions. We have the right to receive any funds remaining in the letters of credit after the securities are released.The unpaid principal balance of manufactured housing securitization transactions where we are the residual interest holder was $868 million and $893 million as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. In the event the third-party servicer does not fulfill its obligation to exercise the clean-up calls on certain transactions, the obligation reverts to us and we would assume approximately $420 million of loans receivable upon our execution of the clean-up call with the requirement to absorb any losses on the loans receivable.We monitor the underlying assets for trends in delinquencies and related losses and review the purchaser’s financial strength as well as servicing performance. These factors are considered in assessing the adequacy of the liabilities established for these obligations and the valuations of the assets.Other VIEsAffordable Housing EntitiesAs part of our community reinvestment initiatives, we invest in private investment funds that make equity investments in multi-family affordable housing properties. We receive affordable housing tax credits for these investments. The activities of these entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. We account for certain of our investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method if certain criteria are met. The proportional amortization method amortizes the cost of the investment over the period in which the investor expects to receive tax credits and other tax benefits, and the resulting amortization is recognized as a component of income tax expense attributable to continuing operations. For the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized amortization  97Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSof $86 million and $74 million, respectively, and tax credits of $102 million and $90 million, respectively, associated with these investments within income taxes. The carrying value of our investments in these qualified affordable housing projects was $3.2 billion as of both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. We are periodically required to provide additional financial or other support during the period of the investments. We recorded a liability of $1.2 billion for these unfunded commitments as of March 31, 2015, which is expected to be paid from 2015 to 2018. For those investment funds considered to be VIEs, we are not required to consolidate them if we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of those entities. We record our interests in these unconsolidated VIEs in loans held for investment, other assets and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our interests consisted of assets of approximately $3.5 billion as of both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Our maximum exposure to these entities is limited to our variable interests in the entities was $3.5 billion as of both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit and we do not provide additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide. The total assets of the unconsolidated VIE investment funds were $10.2 billion as of both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.Entities that Provide Capital to Low-Income and Rural Communities We hold variable interests in entities (“Investor Entities”) that invest in community development entities (“CDEs”) that provide debt financing to businesses and non-profit entities in low-income and rural communities. Variable interests in the CDEs held by the consolidated Investor Entities are also our variable interests. The activities of the Investor Entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. The activities of the CDEs are financed solely with invested equity capital. We receive federal and state tax credits for these investments. We consolidate the VIEs in which we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE. We have also consolidated other investments and CDEs that are not considered to be VIEs, but where we hold a controlling financial interest. The assets of the VIEs that we consolidated, which totaled approximately $384 million and $374 million as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets in cash, loans held for investment, interest receivable and other assets. The liabilities are reflected in other liabilities. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit. We have not provided additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide.OtherOther VIEs include a variable interest that we hold in a trust that has a royalty interest in certain oil and gas properties. The activities of the trust are financed solely with debt. The total assets of the trust were $149 million and $159 million as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. We were not required to consolidate the trust because we do not have the power to direct the activities of the trust that most significantly impact the trust’s economic performance. Our maximum exposure to this entity is limited to our retained interest of $70 million and $74 million as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The creditors of the trust have no recourse to our general credit.

Securitized and Unsecured Debt ObligationsWe use a variety of funding sources other than deposits, including short-term borrowings, the issuance of senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings, and securitization transactions. In addition, we utilize FHLB advances, which are secured by certain portions of our loan and investment securities portfolios, for our funding needs. The securitization debt obligations are separately presented on our consolidated balance sheets, while federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings, including FHLB advances, are included in other debt on our consolidated balance sheets. Securitized Debt ObligationsOur outstanding borrowings due to securitization investors were $12.7 billion and $11.6 billion as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. During the first quarter of 2015, $1.3 billion of new debt was issued to third-party investors from our loan securitization trusts, offset by $175 million of debt maturities. Senior and Subordinated NotesAs of March 31, 2015, we had $20.6 billion of senior and subordinated notes outstanding, net of fair value hedging losses of $303 million. As of December 31, 2014, we had $18.7 billion of senior and subordinated notes outstanding, net of fair value hedging losses of $179 million. During the first quarter of 2015, we issued $3.0 billion of long-term senior unsecured debt, comprised of $400 million of floating rate notes and $2.6 billion of fixed rate notes. During the first quarter of 2015, $1.3 billion of outstanding unsecured notes matured. See “Note 9—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” for information about our fair value hedging activities.FHLB Advances and OtherIn addition to the issuance capacity under the registration statement, we also have access to funding through the FHLB system and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Our FHLB and Federal Reserve memberships require us to hold FHLB and Federal Reserve stock which totaled $1.5 billion and $2.0 billion as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, and are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.We had outstanding FHLB advances and lines of credit, which were secured by our investment securities, residential home loans, multifamily real estate loans, commercial real estate loans and HELOCs, totaling $6.8 billion and $17.3 billion as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. We did not access the Federal Reserve Discount Window for funding during 2015 or 2014.Composition of Deposits, Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term DebtThe table below summarizes the components of our deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Our total short-term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase and other short-term borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less. Our long-term debt consists of borrowings with an original contractual maturity of greater than one year. The amounts presented for outstanding borrowings include unamortized debt premiums and discounts, net of fair value hedge accounting adjustments. 100Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSTable 8.1: Components of Deposits, Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt(Dollars in millions) March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014Deposits:    Non-interest bearing deposits $25,232 $25,081Interest-bearing deposits 185,208 180,467Total deposits $210,440 $205,548Short-term borrowings:    Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase $933 $880FHLB advances 5,750 16,200Total short-term borrowings $6,683 $17,080  March 31, 2015  (Dollars in millions) MaturityDate Interest Rate WeightedAverageInterest Rate  Outstanding Amount December 31, 2014Long-term debt:          Securitized debt obligations(1) 2015 -2025 0.21 - 5.75% 1.35% $12,717 $11,624Senior and subordinated notes:(1)          Fixed unsecured senior debt 2015 - 2025 1.00 - 6.75% 2.73 16,624 15,174Floating unsecured senior debt 2015 - 2018 0.71 - 0.94% 0.84 1,280 880Total unsecured senior debt     2.60 17,904 16,054Fixed unsecured subordinated debt 2016 - 2023 3.38 - 8.80% 4.97 2,655 2,630Total senior and subordinated notes       20,559 18,684Other long-term borrowings:          FHLB advances 2015 - 2023 0.22 - 6.88% 0.55 1,070 1,069Total long-term debt       34,346 31,377Total short-term borrowings and long-term debt       $41,029 $48,457___________(1) Outstanding amount includes the impact from hedge accounting.Components of Interest ExpenseThe following table displays interest expense attributable to short-term borrowings and long-term debt for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014:Table 8.2: Components of Interest Expense on Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt  Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2015 2014Short-term borrowings:    Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase $0 $0FHLB advances 8 6Total short-term borrowings 8 6Long-term debt:    Securitized debt obligations(1) 33 38Senior and subordinated notes(1) 79 77Other long-term borrowings 7 6Total long-term debt 119 121Total interest expense on short-term borrowings and long-term debt $127 $127__________(1)  Interest expense includes the impact from hedge accounting.  101Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE 9—DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIESUse of DerivativesWe manage our asset and liability position and market risk exposure in accordance with prescribed risk management policies and limits established by our Market and Liquidity Risk Policy which is approved by our Board of Directors. Our primary market risk stems from the impact on our earnings and economic value of equity from changes in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, changes in foreign exchange rates. We employ several techniques to manage our interest rate sensitivity, which include changing the duration and re-pricing characteristics of various assets and liabilities by using interest rate derivatives. Our current asset and liability management policy also includes the use of derivatives to hedge foreign currency denominated exposures to limit our earnings and capital ratio exposure to foreign exchange risk. We execute our derivative contracts in both the over-the-counter (“OTC”) and exchange-traded derivative markets. The majority of our derivatives are interest rate swaps. In addition, we may use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We offer various derivatives to our customers as part of our Commercial Banking business but usually offset our exposure through derivative transactions with other counterparties. We also enter into interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts with our commercial lending customers as a customer accommodation.Accounting for DerivativesOur derivatives are designated as either qualifying accounting hedges or free-standing derivatives. Free-standing derivatives primarily consist of customer-accommodation derivatives and economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Qualifying accounting hedges are designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.•Fair Value Hedges: We designate derivatives as fair value hedges to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, which fluctuate in value as a result of movements in interest rates. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded in earnings together with offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item and any resulting ineffectiveness. Our fair value hedges consist of interest rate swaps that are intended to modify our exposure to interest rate risk on various fixed-rate assets and liabilities. •Cash Flow Hedges: We designate derivatives as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to variability in cash flows related to forecasted transactions. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of AOCI, to the extent that the hedge relationships are effective, and amounts are reclassified from AOCI to earnings as the forecasted transactions impact earnings. To the extent that any ineffectiveness exists in the hedge relationships, the amounts are recorded in current period earnings. Our cash flow hedges consist of interest rate swaps that are intended to hedge the variability in interest payments on some of our variable-rate assets through 2020. These hedges have the effect of converting some of our variable-rate assets to a fixed rate. We also have entered into forward foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to foreign currency denominated intercompany borrowings.•Net Investment Hedges: We use net investment hedges to manage the foreign currency exposure related to our net investments in foreign operations that have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recorded in the translation adjustment component of AOCI, offsetting the translation gain or loss from those foreign operations. During 2014, we executed net investment hedges using foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the translation exposure of the net investment in our foreign operations.•Free-Standing Derivatives: We use free-standing derivatives to hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of residential MSRs, mortgage loan origination and purchase commitments and other interests held. We also categorize our customer accommodation derivatives and the related offsetting contracts as free-standing derivatives. Changes in the fair value of free-standing derivatives are recorded in earnings as a component of other non-interest income.Balance Sheet PresentationAs of January 1, 2015, we changed our accounting principle to move from a gross basis of presentation to a net basis, for presenting qualifying derivative assets and liabilities, as well as the related fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable), for instruments executed with the same counterparty where a  102Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSright of setoff exists. See additional information in “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” The following table summarizes the notional and fair values of our derivative instruments on a gross basis as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, which are segregated by derivatives that are designated as accounting hedges and those that are not, and are further segregated by type of contract within those two categories. The total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and any associated cash collateral received or paid.

See Table 9.2 for further information. 103Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSOffsetting of Financial Assets and Liabilities We execute the majority of our derivative transactions and repurchase agreements under master netting arrangements. Under our existing enforceable master netting arrangements, we generally have the right to offset exposure with the same counterparty. In addition, either counterparty can generally request the net settlement of all contracts through a single payment upon default on, or termination of, any one contract. As of January 1, 2015, the Company changed its accounting principle to begin offsetting derivative assets and liabilities for purposes of balance sheet presentation where a right of setoff exists. As of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, derivative contracts that are executed bilaterally with a counterparty in the OTC market and then novated to and cleared through a central clearing house, are not subject to offsetting due to current uncertainty about the legal enforceability of our right of setoff with the clearinghouses. The following table presents as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the gross and net fair values of our derivative assets and liabilities and repurchase agreements, as well as the related offsetting amount permitted under U.S. GAAP. The table also includes cash and non-cash collateral received or pledged associated with such arrangements. The collateral amounts shown are limited to the extent of the related net derivative fair values or outstanding balances, thus instances of over-collateralization are not shown.Table 9.2: Offsetting of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  GrossAmounts Gross Amounts Offset in the Balance Sheet Net Amounts as Recognized Securities Collateral Held Under Master Netting Agreements  (Dollars in millions)  FinancialInstruments Cash Collateral Received   NetExposureAs of March 31, 2015            Derivatives assets(1) $1,939 $(70) $(596) $1,273 $(121) $1,152As of December 31, 2014            Derivatives assets(1) $1,452 $(101) $(523) $828 $(80) $748  GrossAmounts Gross Amounts Offset in the Balance Sheet Net Amounts as Recognized Securities Collateral Pledged Under Master Netting Agreements  (Dollars in millions)  FinancialInstruments Cash Collateral Pledged   NetExposureAs of March 31, 2015            Derivatives liabilities(1) $422 $(70) $(95) $257 $0 $257Repurchase agreements(2) 924 0 0 924 (924) 0As of December 31, 2014            Derivatives liabilities(1) $339 $(101) $(63) $175 $0 $175Repurchase agreements(2) 869 0 0 869 (869) 0__________(1) The gross balances include derivative assets and derivative liabilities as of March 31, 2015 totaling $650 million and $207 million, respectively, related to the centrally cleared derivative contracts. The comparable amounts as of December 31, 2014 totaled $360 million and $127 million, respectively. These contracts were not subject to offsetting as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.(2) As of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the Company only had repurchase obligations outstanding and did not have any reverse repurchase receivables. Credit Risk-Related Contingency Features and CollateralCertain of our derivatives contracts include provisions requiring that our debt maintain a credit rating of investment grade or above by each of the major credit rating agencies. In the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating below investment grade, some of our derivatives counterparties would have the right to terminate the derivative contract and close out the existing positions, or demand immediate and ongoing full overnight collateralization on derivative instruments in a net liability position. Certain of our derivatives contracts may also allow, in the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating of any kind, our derivatives counterparties to demand additional collateralization on such derivatives instruments in a net liability position. We posted $171 million and $87 million of cash collateral as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. If our debt credit rating had fallen below investment grade, we would have been required to post an additional variation margin, which represents the impact of daily position  104Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSmark-to-market calculations, of less than $1 million as of both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. In addition, we would have been required to post independent margin of $60 million and $65 million as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, in compliance with the terms of certain of our swap agreements. The fair value of derivatives instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features in a net liability position was $1 million and less than $1 million as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.Derivatives Counterparty Credit Risk Derivatives instruments contain an element of credit risk that arises from the potential failure of a counterparty to perform according to the contractual terms of the contract. Our exposure to derivatives counterparty credit risk, at any point in time, is represented by the fair value of derivatives in a gain position, or derivatives assets, assuming no recoveries of underlying collateral. To mitigate the risk of counterparty default, we enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements and maintain collateral agreements with certain derivative counterparties. We generally enter into these agreements on a bilateral basis with our counterparties, however since June 2013 we have begun to clear eligible OTC derivatives through a central clearinghouse in accordance with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. These agreements typically provide for the right to offset exposures and require both parties to maintain collateral in the event the fair values of derivative financial instruments exceed established thresholds. We received cash collateral from derivatives counterparties totaling $994 million and $695 million as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. We also received securities from derivatives counterparties totaling $137 million and $91 million as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, which we have the ability to re-pledge. We record counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments on our derivative assets to properly reflect the credit quality of the counterparty. We consider collateral and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate our credit exposure to each counterparty in determining the counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment, which may be adjusted in future periods due to changes in the fair value of the derivatives contracts, collateral and creditworthiness of the counterparty. The cumulative counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as a reduction in the derivatives asset balance was $5 million as of both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. We also adjust the fair value of our derivatives liabilities to reflect the impact of our own credit quality. We calculate this adjustment by comparing the spreads on our credit default swaps to the discount benchmark curve. The cumulative credit risk valuation adjustment related to our credit quality recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as a reduction in the derivative liability balance was less than $1 million and $1 million as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.Income Statement Presentation and AOCIThe following tables summarize the impact of derivatives and the related hedged items in our consolidated statements of income and AOCI.Fair Value Hedges and Free-Standing DerivativesThe net gains (losses) recognized in earnings related to derivatives in fair value hedging relationships and free-standing derivatives are presented below for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014: 105Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSTable 9.3: Gains and Losses on Fair Value Hedges and Free-Standing Derivatives  Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2015 2014Derivatives designated as accounting hedges:(1)    Fair value interest rate contracts:    Gains recognized in earnings on derivatives $153 $31Losses recognized in earnings on hedged items (148) (23)Net fair value hedge ineffectiveness gains 5 8Derivatives not designated as accounting hedges:(1)    Interest rate contracts covering:    MSRs 6 7Customer accommodation 4 4Other interest rate exposures 2 5Total interest rate contracts 12 16Other contracts (2) (3)Total gains on derivatives not designated as accounting hedges 10 13Net derivative gains recognized in earnings $15 $21__________(1) Amounts are recorded in our consolidated statements of income in other non-interest income.Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges The table below shows the net gains (losses) related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and net investment hedges for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014:Table 9.4: Gains and Losses on Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges and Net Investment Hedges   Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2015 2014Gains (losses) recorded in AOCI:    Cash flow hedges:    Interest rate contracts $210 $45Foreign exchange contracts (5) (5)Subtotal 205 40Net investment hedges:    Foreign exchange contracts 75 0Net derivatives gains recognized in AOCI $280 $40Gains (losses) recorded in earnings:    Cash flow hedges:    Gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI into earnings:    Interest rate contracts(1)  $47 $26Foreign exchange contracts(2)  (4) (5)Subtotal 43 21Gains (losses) recognized in earnings due to ineffectiveness:    Interest rate contracts(2)  2 1Net derivative gains recognized in earnings $45 $22__________(1) Amounts reclassified are recorded in our consolidated statements of income in interest income or interest expense.(2) Amounts reclassified are recorded in our consolidated statements of income in other non-interest income. 106Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSIn the next 12 months, we expect to reclassify to earnings net after-tax gains of $155 million currently recorded in AOCI as of March 31, 2015.

The fair value accounting guidance provides a three-level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments. This hierarchy is based on the markets in which the assets or liabilities trade and whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable. The fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:Level 1: Valuation is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2: Valuation is based on observable market-based inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or models using inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data of substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3: Valuation is generated from techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. Valuation techniques include pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques.The accounting guidance for fair value measurements requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in determining fair value. The accounting guidance provides for the irrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-contract basis, to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value at inception of the contract and record any subsequent changes in fair value in earnings. We have not made any material fair value option elections as of or for the periods disclosed herein.Fair Value Governance and ControlWe have a governance framework and a number of key controls that are intended to ensure that our fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable. Our governance framework provides for independent oversight and segregation of duties. Our control processes include review and approval of new transaction types, price verification and review of valuation judgments, methods, models, process controls and results. Groups independent from our trading and investing functions, including our Corporate Valuations Group (“CVG”), Fair Value Committee (“FVC”) and Model Validation Group (“MVG”), participate in the review and validation process. The fair valuation governance process is set up in a manner that allows the Chairperson of the FVC to escalate valuation disputes that cannot be resolved by the FVC to a more senior committee called the Valuations Advisory Committee (“VAC”) for resolution. The VAC is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and includes other members of senior management. The VAC is only required to convene to review escalated valuation disputes and may meet for a general update on the valuation process. The CVG performs periodic verification of fair value measurements to determine if assigned fair values are reasonable. For example, in cases where we rely on third-party pricing services to obtain fair value measures, we analyze pricing variances among different pricing sources and validate the final price used by comparing the information to additional sources, including dealer pricing indications in transaction results and other internal sources, where necessary. Additional validation procedures performed by the CVG include reviewing (either directly or indirectly through the reasonableness of assigned fair values) valuation inputs and assumptions and monitoring acceptable variances between recommended prices and validation prices. The CVG and the Trade Analytics and Valuation (“TAV”) team perform due diligence reviews of the third-party pricing services by comparing their prices to those from other sources and reviewing other control documentation. Additionally, when necessary, the CVG and TAV challenge prices from third-party vendors to ensure reasonableness of prices through a pricing challenge process. This may include a request for transparency of the assumptions used by the third party.The FVC, which includes representation from our Risk Management and Finance divisions, is a forum for discussing fair market valuations, inputs, assumptions, methodologies, variance thresholds, valuation control environments and material risks or concerns related to fair market valuations. Additionally, the FVC is empowered to resolve valuation disputes between the primary valuation providers and the CVG, and provides guidance and oversight to ensure an appropriate valuation control environment. The FVC regularly reviews and approves our valuation methodologies to ensure that our methodologies and practices are consistent with industry standards and adhere to regulatory and accounting guidance. The Chief Financial Officer determines when material issues or concerns regarding valuations shall be raised to the Audit Committee or another delegated committee of the Board of Directors. 111Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSWe have a model policy, established by an independent Model Risk Office, which governs the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for pricing. The MVG is part of the Model Risk Office and validates all models and provides ongoing monitoring of their performance, including the validation and monitoring of the performance of all valuation models.Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisThe following table displays our assets and liabilities measured on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:Table 12.1: Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis  March 31, 2015  Fair Value Measurements Using  (Dollars in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 TotalAssets:        Securities available for sale:        U.S. Treasury securities $4,440 $0 $0 $4,440Corporate debt securities guaranteed by U.S. government agencies 0 426 172 598RMBS 0 25,493 555 26,048CMBS 0 5,255 174 5,429Other ABS 0 2,021 7 2,028Other securities 112 648 18 778Total securities available for sale 4,552 33,843 926 39,321Other assets:        Consumer MSRs 0 0 53 53Derivative assets(1)(2) 3 1,863 73 1,939Retained interests in securitizations 0 0 223 223Total assets $4,555 $35,706 $1,275 $41,536Liabilities:        Other liabilities:        Derivative liabilities(1)(2) $3 $371 $48 $422Total liabilities $3 $371 $48 $422 112Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  December 31, 2014  Fair Value Measurements Using  (Dollars in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 TotalAssets:        Securities available for sale:        U.S. Treasury securities $4,117 $1 $0 $4,118Corporate debt securities guaranteed by U.S. government agencies 0 467 333 800RMBS 0 24,820 561 25,381CMBS 0 5,291 228 5,519Other ABS 0 2,597 65 2,662Other securities 111 899 18 1,028Total securities available for sale 4,228 34,075 1,205 39,508Other assets:        Consumer MSRs 0 0 53 53Derivative assets(1)(2) 4 1,382 66 1,452Retained interests in securitizations 0 0 221 221Total assets $4,232 $35,457 $1,545 $41,234Liabilities:        Other liabilities:        Derivative liabilities(1)(2) $3 $293 $43 $339Total liabilities $3 $293 $43 $339__________(1) As of January 1, 2015, we changed our accounting principle to move from a gross basis of presentation to a net basis, for presenting qualifying derivative assets and liabilities, as well as the related right to reclaim cash collateral or obligation to return cash collateral. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for additional information. Prior period results have been recast to conform to this presentation. The balances represent gross derivative amounts and are not reduced by the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to net positive and negative positions and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparty. The net derivative assets were $1.3 billion and $828 million, and the net derivative liabilities were $257 million and $175 million as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. See “Note 9—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” for further information. (2) Does not reflect $5 million and $4 million recognized as a net valuation allowance on derivative assets and liabilities for non-performance risk as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Non-performance risk is reflected in other assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and offset through other income in the consolidated statements of income. The determination of the classification of financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy is performed at the end of each reporting period. We consider all available information, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs. Based upon the specific facts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument category, judgments are made regarding the significance of the unobservable inputs to the instruments’ fair value measurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are considered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. The process for determining fair value using unobservable inputs is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions. During the three months ended March 31, 2015 we had minimal movements between Levels 1 and 2.Level 3 Recurring Fair Value RollforwardThe table below presents a reconciliation for all assets and liabilities measured and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014.

(3) The amount presented for unrealized gains (losses) for assets still held as of the reporting date primarily represents impairments of securities available for sale, accretion on certain fixed maturity securities, changes in fair value of derivative instruments and mortgage servicing rights transactions. Impairment is reported in total other-than-temporary impairment, which is a component of non-interest income, in our consolidated statements of income.(4) All level 3 derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis and are not reduced by the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to net positive and negative positions and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparty. Significant Level 3 Fair Value Asset and Liability Input SensitivityChanges in unobservable inputs may have a significant impact on fair value. Certain of these unobservable inputs will, in isolation, have a directionally consistent impact on the fair value of the instrument for a given change in that input. Alternatively, the fair value of the instrument may move in an opposite direction for a given change in another input. In general, an increase in the discount rate, default rates, loss severity and credit spreads, in isolation, would result in a decrease in the fair value measurement. In addition, an increase in default rates would generally be accompanied by a decrease in recovery rates, slower prepayment rates and an increase in liquidity spreads.Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value MeasurementsThe following table presents the significant unobservable inputs relied upon to determine the fair values of our recurring Level 3 financial instruments. We utilize multiple third-party pricing services to obtain fair value measures for our securities. Several of our third-party pricing services are only able to provide unobservable input information for a limited number of securities due to software licensing restrictions. Other third-party pricing services are able to provide unobservable input information for all securities for which they provide a valuation. As a result, the unobservable input information for the securities available for sale presented below represents a composite summary of all information we are able to obtain for a majority of our securities. The unobservable input information for all other Level 3 financial instruments is based on the assumptions used in our internal valuation models.Table 12.3: Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements  Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements(Dollars in millions) Fair Value at March 31, 2015 SignificantValuationTechniques SignificantUnobservableInputs Range WeightedAverageAssets:          Securities available for sale:          RMBS $555 Discounted cash flows (3rd party pricing) YieldConstant prepayment rateDefault rateLoss severity 1-22%0-22%0-15%0-85% 6%4%5%59%CMBS 174 Discounted cash flows (3rd party pricing) YieldConstant prepayment rate 1-2%0-100% 2%5%Other ABS 7 Discounted cash flows (3rd party pricing) YieldConstant prepayment rateDefault rateLoss severity 2%0%1%30% 2%0%1%30%U.S. government guaranteed debt and other securities 190 Discounted cash flows (3rd party pricing) Yield 1-4% 3%Other assets:          Consumer MSRs 53 Discounted cash flows Total prepayment rateDiscount rateOption Adjusted Spread rateServicing cost ($ per loan) 9-20%14%435-1500 bps$93.18-$208.70 18%14%489 bps$100.45Derivative assets(1) 73 Discounted cash flows Swap rates 2% 2%Retained interests in securitization(2) 223 Discounted cash flows Life of receivables (months) Constant prepayment rateDiscount rateDefault rateLoss severity 24-842-11%4-11%2-6%16-91% N/ALiabilities:          Derivative liabilities(1) $48 Discounted cash flows Swap rates 2% 2% 115Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements(Dollars in millions) Fair Value at December 31, 2014 SignificantValuationTechniques SignificantUnobservableInputs Range WeightedAverageAssets:          Securities available for sale:          RMBS $561 Discounted cash flows (3rd party pricing) YieldConstant prepayment rateDefault rateLoss severity 0-18%0-23%0-15%0-85% 6%4%5%55%CMBS 228 Discounted cash flows (3rd party pricing) YieldConstant prepayment rate 1-4%0-100% 1%5%Other ABS 65 Discounted cash flows (3rd party pricing) YieldConstant prepayment rateDefault rateLoss severity 2-7%0-3%1-10%30-88% 5%2%7%71%U.S. government guaranteed debt and other securities 351 Discounted cash flows (3rd party pricing) Yield 1-4% 3%Other assets:          Consumer MSRs 53 Discounted cash flows Total prepayment rateDiscount rateOption Adjusted Spread rateServicing cost ($ per loan) 12-27%12%435-1,500 bps$93.18-$208.70 18%12%478 bps$100.63Derivative assets(1) 66 Discounted cash flows Swap rates 2-3% 2%Retained interests in securitization(2) 221 Discounted cash flows Life of receivables (months) Constant prepayment rateDiscount rateDefault rateLoss severity 25-722-13%4-9%2-8%19-95% N/ALiabilities:          Derivative liabilities(1) $43 Discounted cash flows Swap rates 2-3% 2%__________(1) All level 3 derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis and are not reduced by the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to net positive and negative positions and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparty.

These assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, from the application of LOCOM accounting or when we evaluate for impairment). The following table presents the carrying amount of the assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and still held as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, and for which a nonrecurring fair value measurement was recorded during the three and twelve months then ended:Table 12.4: Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements Related to Assets Still Held at Period End  March 31, 2015  Estimated Fair Value Hierarchy Total(Dollars in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets:        Loans held for investment $0 $0 $63 $63Loans held for sale 0 15 0 15Other assets(1) 0 0 28 28Total $0 $15 $91 $106 116Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  December 31, 2014  Estimated Fair Value Hierarchy Total(Dollars in millions) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Assets:        Loans held for investment $0 $0 $121 $121Loans held for sale 0 34 0 34Other assets(1) 0 0 65 65Total $0 $34 $186 $220__________(1) Includes foreclosed property and repossessed assets of $28 million as of March 31, 2015, compared to foreclosed property and repossessed assets of $60 million and long-lived assets held for sale of $5 million as of December 31, 2014.In the above table, loans held for investment primarily include nonperforming loans for which specific reserves or charge-offs have been recognized. These loans are classified as Level 3 as they are valued based in part on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral and the non-recoverable rate, which is considered to be a significant unobservable input. Collateral fair value sources include the appraisal value obtained from independent appraisers, broker pricing opinions, or other available market information. The non-recoverable rate ranged from 9% to 74%, with a weighted average of 34%, and from 0% to 74%, with a weighted average of 30%, as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The fair value of the other assets classified as Level 3 is determined based on appraisal value or listing price which involves significant judgment; the significant unobservable inputs and related quantitative information are not meaningful to disclose as they vary significantly across properties and collateral.The following table presents total nonrecurring fair value measurements for the period, included in earnings, attributable to the change in fair value relating to assets that are still held at March 31, 2015 and 2014:Table 12.5: Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements Included in Earnings Related to Assets Still Held at Period End  Total Gains (Losses)  Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2015 2014Assets:    Loans held for investment $(5) $(9)Loans held for sale 0 (1)Other assets(1) (4) (3)Total $(9) $(13)__________(1) Includes losses related to foreclosed property and repossessed assets and long-lived assets held for sale.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe following table presents the fair value of financial instruments, whether or not recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value, as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014: 117Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSTable 12.6: Fair Value of Financial Instruments  March 31, 2015 Estimated Fair Value Hierarchy(Dollars in millions) CarryingAmount EstimatedFair Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3Financial assets:          Cash and cash equivalents $8,891 $8,891 $8,891 $0 $0Restricted cash for securitization investors 234 234 234 0 0Securities available for sale 39,321 39,321 4,552 33,843 926Securities held to maturity 23,241 24,653 199 24,197 257Net loans held for investment 199,573 202,522 0 0 202,522Loans held for sale 1,331 1,358 0 1,358 0Interest receivable(1) 1,078 1,078 0 1,078 0Derivative assets(1)(2) 1,939 1,939 3 1,863 73Retained interests in securitizations 223 223 0 0 223Financial liabilities:     Non-interest bearing deposits $25,232 $25,232 $25,232 $0 $0Interest-bearing deposits 185,208 180,037 0 11,253 168,784Securitized debt obligations 12,717 12,826 0 12,826 0Senior and subordinated notes 20,599 20,967 0 20,967 0Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase 933 933 933 0 0Other borrowings 6,820 6,823 0 6,823 0Interest payable(1) 195 195 0 195 0Derivative liabilities(1)(2) 422 422 3 371 48  December 31, 2014 Estimated Fair Value Hierarchy(Dollars in millions) CarryingAmount EstimatedFair Value Level 1 Level 2 Level 3Financial assets:          Cash and cash equivalents $7,242 $7,242 $7,242 $0 $0Restricted cash for securitization investors 234 234 234 0 0Securities available for sale 39,508 39,508 4,228 34,075 1,205Securities held to maturity 22,500 23,634 0 23,503 131Net loans held for investment 203,933 207,104 0 0 207,104Loans held for sale 626 650 0 650 0Interest receivable(1) 1,079 1,079 0 1,079 0Derivatives assets(1)(2) 1,452 1,452 4 1,382 66Retained interests in securitizations 221 221 0 0 221Financial liabilities:          Non-interest bearing deposits $25,081 $25,081 $25,081 $0 $0Interest-bearing deposits 180,467 174,074 0 11,668 162,406Securitized debt obligations 11,624 11,745 0 11,745 0Senior and subordinated notes 18,684 19,083 0 19,083 0Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase 880 880 880 0 0Other borrowings 17,269 17,275 0 17,275 0Interest payable(1) 254 254 0 254 0Derivatives liabilities(1)(2) 339 339 3 293 43__________(1) As of January 1, 2015, we changed our accounting principle to move from a gross basis of presentation to a net basis, for presenting qualifying derivative assets and liabilities, as well as the related right to reclaim cash collateral or obligation to return cash collateral. Prior period results have been recast to conform this presentation. See additional information in “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”(2) The balances represent gross derivative amounts and are not reduced by the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to net  118Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSpositive and negative positions and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparty. See additional information in “Note 9—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” for additional information. The following describes the valuation techniques used in estimating the fair value of our financial instruments as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. We applied the fair value provisions to the financial instruments not recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value, which include securities held to maturity, loans held for investment, loans held for sale, interest receivable, interest-bearing deposits, securitized debt obligations, other borrowings and senior and subordinated notes. The provisions requiring us to maximize the use of observable inputs and to measure fair value using a notion of exit price were factored into our selection of inputs for our established valuation techniques.Financial Assets and LiabilitiesCash and Cash EquivalentsThe carrying amounts of cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell and interest-bearing deposits with banks approximate fair value.Restricted Cash for Securitization InvestorsThe carrying amount of restricted cash for securitization investors approximates the fair value due to its relatively short-term nature.Investment Securities Quoted prices in active markets are used to measure the fair value of U.S. Treasury debt obligations. For other investment categories, we utilize multiple third-party pricing services to obtain fair value measurements for the large majority of our securities. A pricing service may be considered as the primary pricing provider for certain types of securities, and the designation of the primary pricing provider may vary depending on the type of securities. The determination of the primary pricing provider is based on our experience and validation benchmark of the pricing service’s performance in terms of providing fair value measurements for the various types of securities.Certain securities are classified as Level 2 and 3, the majority of which are collateralized mortgage obligations and mortgage-backed securities. Level 2 and 3 classifications indicate that significant valuation assumptions are not consistently observable in the market. When significant assumptions are not consistently observable, fair values are derived using the best available data. Such data may include quotes provided by a dealer, the use of external pricing services, independent pricing models, or other model-based valuation techniques such as calculation of the present values of future cash flows incorporating assumptions such as benchmark yields, spreads, prepayment speeds, credit ratings and losses. The techniques used by the pricing services utilize observable market data to the extent available. Pricing models may be used, which can vary by asset class and may incorporate available trade, bid and other market information. Across asset classes, information such as trader/dealer input, credit spreads, forward curves and prepayment speeds are used to help determine appropriate valuations. Because many fixed income securities do not trade on a daily basis, the evaluated pricing applications may apply available information through processes such as benchmarking curves, like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing to prepare valuations. In addition, model processes are used by the pricing services to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios.We validate the pricing obtained from the primary pricing providers through comparison of pricing to additional sources, including other pricing services, dealer pricing indications in transaction results and other internal sources. Pricing variances among different pricing sources are analyzed and validated. Additionally, on an on-going basis, we may select a sample of securities and test the third-party valuation by obtaining more detailed information about the pricing methodology, sources of information and assumptions used to value the securities.The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of our residential, asset-backed and commercial securities include yield, prepayment rate, default rate and loss severity in the event of default. Significant increases or decreases in any of those inputs in isolation or combination would result in a significant change in fair value measurement. Generally, an increase in the yield assumption will result in a decrease in fair value measurement; however, an increase or decrease in prepayment rate, default rate or loss severity may have a different impact on the fair value given various characteristics of the security including the capital structure of the deal, credit enhancement for the security or other factors. 119Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNet Loans Held For InvestmentLoans held for investment that are individually impaired are carried at the lower of cost or fair value of the underlying collateral, less the estimated cost to sell. The fair values of credit card loans, installment loans, auto loans, home loans and commercial loans are estimated using a discounted cash flow method, which is a form of the income approach. Discount rates are determined considering rates at which similar portfolios of loans would be made under current conditions and considering liquidity spreads applicable to each loan portfolio based on the secondary market. The fair value of credit card loans excludes any value related to customer account relationships. For those loans held for investment that are recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets on a nonrecurring basis, the fair value is determined using appraisal values that are obtained from independent appraisers, broker pricing opinions or other available market information, adjusted for the estimated costs to transact the sale.Due to the use of significant unobservable inputs, loans held for investment are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. Fair value adjustments for individually impaired collateralized loans held for investment are recorded in provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income.Loans Held For SaleLoans held for sale are carried at the lower of aggregate cost, net of deferred fees and deferred origination costs, or fair value. We originate loans with the intent to sell them. Commercial mortgage loans are sold to government-sponsored enterprises as part of a delegated underwriting and servicing (“DUS”) program. For DUS commercial mortgage loans, the fair value is estimated primarily using contractual prices and other observable market-based inputs. For residential mortgage loans classified as held for sale, the fair value is estimated using observable market prices for loans with similar characteristics as the primary component, with the secondary component derived from typical securitization activities and market conditions. Credit card loans held for sale are valued based on other observable market-based inputs. These assets are therefore classified as Level 2. Fair value adjustments to loans held for sale are recorded in other non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income.Interest ReceivableThe carrying amount of interest receivable approximates the fair value of this asset due to its relatively short-term nature.Derivative Assets and LiabilitiesWe use both exchange-traded derivatives and OTC derivatives to manage our interest rate and foreign currency risk exposure. Quoted market prices are available and used for our exchange-traded derivatives, which we classify as Level 1. However, predominantly all of our derivatives are traded in OTC markets where quoted market prices are not always readily available. Therefore, we value most OTC derivatives using valuation techniques, which include internally-developed models. We primarily rely on market observable inputs for our models, such as interest rate yield curves, credit curves, option volatility and currency rates, that vary depending on the type of derivative and nature of the underlying rate, price or index upon which the derivative’s value is based. Where model inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the model does not require significant judgment, such derivatives are typically classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. When instruments are traded in less liquid markets and significant inputs are unobservable, such as interest rate swaps whose remaining terms do not correlate with market observable interest rate yield curves, the derivatives are classified as Level 3. The impact of counterparty non-performance risk is considered when measuring the fair value of derivative assets. These derivatives are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.We validate the pricing obtained from the internal models through comparison of pricing to additional sources, including external valuation agents and other internal sources. Pricing variances among different pricing sources are analyzed and validated.Mortgage Servicing Rights We record consumer MSRs at fair value on a recurring basis, while commercial MSRs are subsequently measured at amortized cost with impairment recognized as a reduction in other non-interest income. MSRs do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices. Accordingly, we determine the fair value of MSRs using a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. The model incorporates assumptions that we believe other market participants use in estimating future net servicing income, including estimates of prepayment speeds, discount rate/option-adjusted spreads, cost to service, contractual servicing fee income, ancillary income and late fees. Fair value measurements of MSRs use significant unobservable inputs and, accordingly, are classified as Level 3. In the event we enter into an agreement with a third party to sell  120Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSthe MSRs, the valuation is based on the agreed upon sale price which is considered to be the determined exit price for the assets and the MSRs are classified as Level 2. Retained Interests in Securitizations We have retained interests in various mortgage securitization deals from previous acquisitions. Our retained interest includes rights to future cash flows arising from the receivables, the most significant being certificated interest-only bonds issued by the trust. We record our interest in these deals at fair value using valuation models to calculate the present value of future income. The model incorporates various assumptions that market participants use in estimating future income including weighted-average life, constant prepayment rate, discount rate, default rate and severity. Other AssetsIncluded in other assets are foreclosed property, other repossessed assets and long-lived assets held for sale. Foreclosed property and other repossessed assets are carried at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. The fair value is determined based on the appraisal value or listing price of the property or collateral provided by independent appraisers, and is adjusted for the estimated costs to transact the sale. Due to the use of significant unobservable inputs, foreclosed property is classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. Fair value adjustments for foreclosed property are recorded in other non-interest expense in the consolidated statements of income. Long-lived assets held for sale are also subject to fair value measurement on a nonrecurring basis, and carried at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell. The fair value is determined based on the appraisal value or listing price of the property or collateral provided by independent appraisers, and is adjusted for the estimated costs to transact the sale. Due to the use of significant unobservable inputs, long-lived assets held for sale are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. Fair value adjustments for long-lived assets are recorded in other non-interest expense in the consolidated statements of income.Non-Interest Bearing DepositsThe carrying amount of non-interest bearing deposits approximates fair value.Interest-Bearing DepositsThe fair value of interest-bearing deposits is determined based on discounted expected cash flows using discount rates consistent with current market rates for similar products with similar remaining terms.Securitized Debt ObligationsWe utilized multiple third-party pricing services to obtain fair value measurements for the large majority of our securitized debt obligations. The techniques used by the pricing services utilize observable market data to the extent available; and pricing models may be used which incorporate available trade, bid and other market information as described in the above section. We used internal pricing models, discounted cash flow models or similar techniques to estimate the fair value of certain securitization trusts where third-party pricing was not available.Senior and Subordinated NotesWe engage multiple third-party pricing services in order to estimate the fair value of senior and subordinated notes. The pricing services utilize pricing models that incorporate available trade, bid and other market information. It also incorporates spread assumptions, volatility assumptions and relevant credit information into the pricing models.Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Loaned or Sold under Agreements to Repurchase and Other BorrowingsThe carrying amount of federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements approximates fair value. The fair value of FHLB advances is determined based on discounted expected cash flows using discount rates consistent with current market rates for FHLB advances with similar remaining terms. Interest PayableThe carrying amount of interest payable approximates the fair value of this liability due to its relatively short-term nature. 121Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE 13—BUSINESS SEGMENTSOur principal operations are currently organized into three major business segments, which are defined based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio and asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group, are included in the Other category.Basis of PresentationWe report the results of each of our business segments on a continuing operations basis. See “Note 2—Discontinued Operations” for a discussion of discontinued operations. The results of our individual businesses reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. Business Segment Reporting MethodologyThe results of our business segments are intended to reflect each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. Our internal management and reporting process used to derive our segment results employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. Our funds transfer pricing process provides a funds credit for sources of funds, such as deposits generated by our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses, and a funds charge for the use of funds by each segment. Due to the integrated nature of our business segments, estimates and judgments have been made in allocating certain revenue and expense items. Transactions between segments are based on specific criteria or approximate third-party rates. We regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods. We provide additional information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in “Note 19—Business Segments” in our 2014 Form 10-K.Segment Results and Reconciliation We may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies and changes in organizational alignment. The following tables present our business segment results for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, selected balance sheet data as of March 31, 2015 and 2014, and a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated income from continuing operations, assets and deposits. Prior period amounts have been recast to conform to the current period.  122Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSTable 13.1: Segment Results and Reconciliation  Three Months Ended March 31, 2015(Dollars in millions) CreditCard ConsumerBanking CommercialBanking Other ConsolidatedTotalNet interest income $2,666 $1,434 $461 $15 $4,576Non-interest income 816 158 114 (17) 1,071Total net revenue (loss) 3,482 1,592 575 (2) 5,647Provision for credit losses 669 206 60 0 935Non-interest expense:          Amortization of intangibles:          PCCR intangible amortization 84 0 0 0 84Core deposit intangible amortization 0 22 4 0 26Total PCCR and core deposit intangible amortization 84 22 4 0 110Other non-interest expense 1,692 948 268 31 2,939Total non-interest expense 1,776 970 272 31 3,049Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 1,037 416 243 (33) 1,663Income tax provision (benefit) 369 150 88 (78) 529Income from continuing operations, net of tax $668 $266 $155 $45 $1,134Loans held for investment $81,754 $71,379 $50,741 $104 $203,978Deposits 0 172,502 32,575 5,363 210,440             Three Months Ended March 31, 2014(Dollars in millions) CreditCard ConsumerBanking CommercialBanking Other ConsolidatedTotalNet interest income (expense) $2,525 $1,433 $421 $(29) $4,350Non-interest income 785 150 87 (2) 1,020Total net revenue (loss) 3,310 1,583 508 (31) 5,370Provision (benefit) for credit losses 558 140 40 (3) 735Non-interest expense:          Amortization of intangibles:          PCCR intangible amortization 98 0 0 0 98Core deposit intangible amortization 0 30 6 0 36Total PCCR and core deposit intangible amortization 98 30 6 0 134Other non-interest expense 1,628 900 249 21 2,798Total non-interest expense 1,726 930 255 21 2,932Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 1,026 513 213 (49) 1,703Income tax provision (benefit) 358 183 76 (38) 579Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax $668 $330 $137 $(11) $1,124Loans held for investment $75,850 $70,727 $46,230 $134 $192,941Deposits 0 171,529 31,485 5,310 208,324            123Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE 14—COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES, GUARANTEES AND OTHERSGuaranteesWe have credit exposure on agreements that we entered into to absorb a portion of the risk of loss on certain manufactured housing securitizations issued by GreenPoint Credit, LLC in 2000. Our maximum credit exposure related to these agreements totaled $13 million and $14 million as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. These agreements are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities and our obligations under these agreements was $9 million and $12 million as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. See “Note 6—Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations” for additional information about our manufactured housing securitization transactions.Letters of Credit and Loss Sharing AgreementsWe issue letters of credit (financial standby, performance standby and commercial) to meet the financing needs of our customers. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party in a borrowing arrangement. Commercial letters of credit are short-term commitments issued primarily to facilitate trade finance activities for customers and are generally collateralized by the goods being shipped to the client. These collateral requirements are similar to those for funded transactions and are established based on management’s credit assessment of the customer. Management conducts regular reviews of all outstanding letters of credit and customer acceptances, and the results of these reviews are considered in assessing the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses.On November 1, 2013, we acquired Beech Street Capital, a privately-held, DUS lender that originates multifamily commercial real estate loans with the intent to sell them to a government-sponsored enterprise (“GSE”). Beech Street Capital was renamed Capital One Multifamily Finance in 2014. We enter into loss sharing agreements with Fannie Mae upon the sale of the DUS commercial loans. Under these agreements, we share losses on the covered loans with Fannie Mae on a pari-passu basis. At inception, we record a liability representing the fair value of our obligation which is subsequently amortized as we are released from risk of payment under the loss sharing agreement. If payment under the loss sharing agreement becomes probable and estimable, an additional liability may be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and a non-interest expense may be recognized in the consolidated statements of income. The associated MSRs are also reviewed for impairment annually. We had standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit with contractual amounts of $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The carrying value of outstanding letters of credit, which we include in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, was $3 million as of both March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. These financial guarantees had expiration dates ranging from 2015 to 2025 as of March 31, 2015. The amount of liability recognized on our consolidated balance sheets for Fannie Mae and other loss sharing agreements was $37 million and $36 million as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. No additional collateral or recourse provisions exist to reduce this exposure.U.K. Cross SellIn the U.K., we previously sold payment protection insurance (“PPI”) and other ancillary cross sell products. In response to an elevated level of customer complaints across the industry, heightened media coverage and pressure from consumer advocacy groups, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) investigated and raised concerns about the way some companies have handled complaints related to the sale of these insurance policies. Management’s best estimate of incurred losses related to U.K. cross sell products, including PPI, totaled $92 million and $116 million as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The decrease to the reserve for the three months ended March 31, 2015 was a combination of utilization of the reserve through customer refund payments and foreign exchange movements. Given the inherent uncertainty involved in this matter, it is possible our ultimate liability may differ from our current estimate. 124Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSMortgage Representation and Warranty LiabilitiesWe acquired three subsidiaries that originated residential mortgage loans and sold these loans to various purchasers, including purchasers who created securitization trusts. These subsidiaries are Capital One Home Loans, LLC, which was acquired in February 2005; GreenPoint, which was acquired in December 2006 as part of the North Fork acquisition; and CCB, which was acquired in February 2009 and subsequently merged into CONA (collectively, the “subsidiaries”).In connection with their sales of mortgage loans, the subsidiaries entered into agreements containing varying representations and warranties about, among other things, the ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing the loan, the loan’s compliance with any applicable loan criteria established by the purchaser, including underwriting guidelines and the existence of mortgage insurance, and the loan’s compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws. The representations and warranties do not address the credit performance of the mortgage loans, but mortgage loan performance often influences whether a claim for breach of representation and warranty will be asserted and has an effect on the amount of any loss in the event of a breach of a representation or warranty.Each of these subsidiaries may be required to repurchase mortgage loans in the event of certain breaches of these representations and warranties. In the event of a repurchase, the subsidiary is typically required to pay the unpaid principal balance of the loan together with interest and certain expenses (including, in certain cases, legal costs incurred by the purchaser and/or others). The subsidiary then recovers the loan or, if the loan has been foreclosed, the underlying collateral. The subsidiary is exposed to any losses on the repurchased loans, taking into account any recoveries on the collateral. In some instances, rather than repurchase the loans, a subsidiary may agree to make cash payments to make an investor whole on losses or to settle repurchase claims, possibly including claims for attorneys’ fees and interest. In addition, our subsidiaries may be required to indemnify certain purchasers and others against losses they incur as a result of certain breaches of representations and warranties.These subsidiaries, in total, originated and sold to non-affiliates approximately $111 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans between 2005 and 2008, which are the years (or “vintages”) with respect to which our subsidiaries have received the vast majority of the repurchase requests and other related claims.The following table presents the original principal balance of mortgage loan originations, by vintage for 2005 through 2008, for the three general categories of purchasers of mortgage loans and the estimated unpaid principal balance as of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:Table 14.1: Unpaid Principal Balance of Mortgage Loans Originated and Sold to Third Parties Based on Category of Purchaser   Estimated Unpaid Principal Balance Original Principal Balance(Dollars in billions) March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 Total 2008 2007 2006 2005GSEs $2 $3 $11 $1 $4 $3 $3Insured Securitizations 4 4 20 0 2 8 10Uninsured Securitizations and Other 16 16 80 3 15 30 32Total $22 $23 $111 $4 $21 $41 $45Between 2005 and 2008, our subsidiaries sold an aggregate amount of $11 billion in original principal balance mortgage loans to the GSEs.Of the $20 billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans sold directly by our subsidiaries to private-label purchasers who placed the loans into securitizations supported by bond insurance (“Insured Securitizations”), approximately 48% of the original principal balance was covered by bond insurance. Further, approximately $16 billion original principal balance was placed in securitizations as to which the monoline bond insurers have made repurchase requests or loan file requests to one of our subsidiaries (“Active Insured Securitizations”) and the remaining approximately $4 billion original principal balance was placed in securitizations as to which the monoline bond insurers have not made repurchase requests or loan file requests to one of our subsidiaries (“Inactive Insured Securitizations”). Insured Securitizations often allow the monoline bond insurer to act independently of the investors. Bond insurers typically have indemnity agreements directly with both the mortgage originators and the securitizers, and they often have super-majority rights within the trust documentation that allow them to direct trustees to pursue mortgage repurchase requests without coordination with other investors. 125Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSBecause we do not service most of the loans our subsidiaries sold to others, we do not have complete information about the current ownership of a portion of the $80 billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans not sold directly to GSEs or placed in Insured Securitizations. We have determined based on information obtained from third-party databases that about $48 billion original principal balance of these mortgage loans was placed in private-label publicly issued securitizations not supported by bond insurance (“Uninsured Securitizations”). An additional approximately $22 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans were initially sold to private investors as whole loans. Various known and unknown investors purchased the remaining $10 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans.With respect to the $111 billion in original principal balance of mortgage loans originated and sold to others between 2005 and 2008, we estimate that approximately $22 billion in unpaid principal balance remains outstanding as of March 31, 2015, of which approximately $4 billion in unpaid principal balance is at least 90 days delinquent. Approximately $22 billion in losses have been realized by third parties. Because we do not service most of the loans we sold to others, we do not have complete information about the underlying credit performance levels for some of these mortgage loans. These amounts reflect our best estimates, including extrapolations of underlying credit performance where necessary. These estimates could change as we get additional data or refine our analysis.The subsidiaries had open repurchase requests relating to approximately $2.5 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans as of March 31, 2015, unchanged from December 31, 2014. Currently, repurchase demands predominantly relate to the 2006 and 2007 vintages. We have received relatively few repurchase demands from the 2008 and 2009 vintages, mostly because GreenPoint ceased originating mortgages in August 2007.The following table presents information on pending repurchase requests by counterparty category and timing of initial repurchase request. The amounts presented are based on original loan principal balances.Table 14.2: Open Pipeline All Vintages (all entities)(1)(Dollars in millions) GSEs InsuredSecuritizations UninsuredSecuritizationsand Other TotalOpen claims as of December 31, 2013 $89 $1,614 $1,122 $2,825Gross new demands received 22 0 742 764Loans repurchased/made whole (31) 0 (5) (36)Demands rescinded (64) (965) (12) (1,041)Open claims as of December 31, 2014 $16 $649 $1,847 $2,512Gross new demands received 6 0 1 7Loans repurchased/made whole (3) 0 (1) (4)Demands rescinded (2) (1) (8) (11)Open claims as of March 31, 2015 $17 $648 $1,839 $2,504__________(1) The open pipeline includes all repurchase requests ever received by our subsidiaries where either the requesting party has not formally rescinded the repurchase request and where our subsidiary has not agreed to either repurchase the loan at issue or make the requesting party whole with respect to its losses. Accordingly, repurchase requests denied by our subsidiaries and not pursued by the counterparty remain in the open pipeline, with the exception of certain aged repurchase requests submitted by parties without contractual standing to pursue such requests, which may be removed from the pipeline. Finally, the amounts reflected in this chart are the original principal balance amounts of the mortgage loans at issue and do not correspond to the losses our subsidiary would incur upon the repurchase of these loans. 126Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe following table summarizes changes in our representation and warranty reserve for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014:Table 14.3: Changes in Representation and Warranty Reserve(1)  Three Months Ended March 31,(Dollars in millions) 2015 2014Representation and warranty reserve, beginning of period $731 $1,172Provision (benefit) for mortgage representation and warranty losses:    Recorded in continuing operations 1 14Recorded in discontinued operations (19) (47)Total benefit for mortgage representation and warranty losses (18) (33)Net realized losses (40) (11)Representation and warranty reserve, end of period $673 $1,128__________(1) Reported on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of other liabilities.The following table summarizes the allocation of our representation and warranty reserve as March 31, 2015 and 2014:Table 14.4: Allocation of Representation and Warranty Reserve  Reserve Liability Loans Sold2005 to 2008(1) (Dollars in millions, except for loans sold) March 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 Selected period-end data:      GSEs and Active Insured Securitizations $492 $499 $27Inactive Insured Securitizations and Others 181 232 84Total(2) $673 $731 $111__________(1) Reflects, in billions, the total original principal balance of loans originated by our subsidiaries and sold to third-party investors between 2005 and 2008.(2) The total reserve liability includes an immaterial amount related to loans that were originated after 2008.We established reserves for the $11 billion original principal balance of GSE loans, based on open claims and historic repurchase rates. We have entered into and completed repurchase or settlement agreements with respect to the majority of our repurchase exposure within this category. Our reserves also could be impacted by any claims which may be brought by governmental agencies under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act (“FIRREA”), the False Claims Act, or other federal or state statutes. For example, GreenPoint and Capital One have received requests for information and/or subpoenas from various governmental regulators and law enforcement authorities, including members of the RMBS Working Group, relating to the origination of loans for sale to the GSEs and to RMBS participants. We are cooperating with these regulators and other authorities in responding to such requests.For the $16 billion original principal balance in Active Insured Securitizations, our reserving approach is based upon the expected resolution of litigation with the monoline bond insurers. Accordingly, our representation and warranty reserves for this category are litigation reserves. In establishing litigation reserves for this category, we consider the current and future monoline insurer losses inherent within the securitization and apply legal judgment to the developing factual and legal record to estimate the liability for each securitization. We consider as factors within the analysis our own past monoline settlements in addition to publicly available industry monoline settlements. Our reserves with respect to the U.S. Bank Litigation, referenced below, are contained within the Active Insured Securitization reserve category. Further, to the extent we have litigation reserves with respect to indemnification risks from certain representation and warranty lawsuits brought by monoline bond insurers against third-party securitizations sponsors, where one of our subsidiaries provided some or all of the mortgage collateral within the securitization but is not a defendant in the litigation, such reserves are also contained within this category. 127Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFor the $4 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans in the Inactive Insured Securitizations category and the $48 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans in the Uninsured Securitizations category, we establish reserves based on an assessment of probable and estimable legal liability, if any, utilizing both our own experience and publicly available industry settlement information to estimate lifetime liability. In contrast with the bond insurers in the Insured Securitizations, investors in Uninsured Securitizations often face a number of legal and logistical hurdles before they can force a securitization trustee to pursue mortgage repurchases, including the need to coordinate with a certain percentage of investors holding the securities and to indemnify the trustee for any litigation it undertakes. Accordingly, we only reserve for such exposures when a trustee or investor with standing brings claims and it is probable we have incurred a loss. Some Uninsured Securitization investors from this category are currently suing investment banks and securitization sponsors under federal and/or state securities laws. Although we face some indirect indemnity risks from these litigations, we generally have not established reserves with respect to these indemnity risks because we do not consider them to be both probable and reasonably estimable liabilities. In addition, to the extent we have litigation reserves with respect to indemnification risks from certain representation and warranty lawsuits brought by parties who purchased loans from our subsidiaries and subsequently re-sold the loans into securitizations, such reserves are also contained within this category.For the $22 billion original principal balance of mortgage loans sold to private investors as whole loans, we establish reserves by relying on our historical and anticipated claims and repurchase rates to estimate lifetime liability.The aggregate reserve for all three subsidiaries totaled $673 million as of March 31, 2015, compared to $731 million as of December 31, 2014. We recorded a net benefit for mortgage representation and warranty losses of $18 million (which includes a provision of $1 million before taxes in continuing operations and a benefit of $19 million before taxes in discontinued operations) in the first quarter of 2015. The decrease in the representation and warranty reserve was primarily driven by claims paid and legal developments including settlements. As part of our business planning processes, we have considered various outcomes relating to the future representation and warranty liabilities of our subsidiaries that are possible but do not rise to the level of being both probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying an incremental accrual under applicable accounting standards. Our current best estimate of reasonably possible future losses from representation and warranty claims beyond what was in our reserve as of March 31, 2015 is approximately $2.1 billion, remains unchanged from our estimate at December 31, 2014. The estimate as of March 31, 2015 covers all reasonably possible losses relating to representation and warranty claim activity, including those relating to the U.S. Bank Litigation, the FHFA Litigation, and the LXS Trust Litigation described below.In estimating reasonably possible future losses in excess of our current reserves, we assume a portion of the inactive securitizations become active and for all Insured Securitizations, we assume loss rates on the high end of those observed in monoline settlements or court rulings. For our remaining GSE exposures, Uninsured Securitizations and whole loan exposures, our reasonably possible risk estimates assume lifetime loss rates and claims rates at the highest levels of our past experience and also consider the limited instances of observed settlements. We do not assume claim rates or loss rates for these risk categories will be as high as those assumed for the Active Insured Securitizations, however, based on industry precedent. Should the number of claims or the loss rates on these claims increase significantly, our estimate of reasonably possible risk would increase materially. We also assume that we will resolve any loan repurchase requests relating to loans originated more than six years ago at a discount as compared to those originated within six years of a repurchase claim because of the pending legal arguments in various matters concerning the applicable statute of limitations.Notwithstanding our ongoing attempts to estimate a reasonably possible amount of future losses beyond our current accrual levels based on current information, it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and our current estimate of the amount of reasonably possible losses. Our reserve and reasonably possible estimates involve considerable judgment and reflect that there is still significant uncertainty regarding numerous factors that may impact the ultimate loss levels, including, but not limited to: litigation outcomes; court rulings; governmental enforcement decisions; future repurchase and indemnification claim levels; securitization trustees pursuing mortgage repurchase litigation unilaterally or in coordination with investors; investors successfully pursuing repurchase litigation independently and without the involvement of the trustee as a party; ultimate repurchase and indemnification rates; future mortgage loan performance levels; actual recoveries on the collateral; and macroeconomic conditions (including unemployment levels and housing prices). In light of the significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability our subsidiaries may incur from these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period. 128Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSLitigationIn accordance with the current accounting standards for loss contingencies, we establish reserves for litigation related matters when it is probable that a loss associated with a claim or proceeding has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Litigation claims and proceedings of all types are subject to many uncertain factors that generally cannot be predicted with assurance. Below we provide a description of potentially material legal proceedings and claims.For some of the matters disclosed below, we are able to determine estimates of potential future outcomes that are not probable and reasonably estimable outcomes justifying either the establishment of a reserve or an incremental reserve build, but which are reasonably possible outcomes. For other disclosed matters, such an estimate is not possible at this time. For those matters below where an estimate is possible (excluding the reasonably possible future losses relating to the U.S. Bank Litigation, the FHFA Litigation, and the LXS Trust Litigation, because reasonably possible losses with respect to those litigations are included within the reasonably possible representation and warranty liabilities discussed above) management currently estimates the reasonably possible future losses beyond what was in our reserve as of March 31, 2015 was approximately $200 million. Notwithstanding our attempt to estimate a reasonably possible range of loss beyond our current accrual levels for some litigation matters based on current information, it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and the range of reasonably possible losses disclosed here. Given the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters, especially those involving governmental actors, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from these litigation matters and an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period.Interchange LitigationIn 2005, a number of entities, each purporting to represent a class of retail merchants, filed antitrust lawsuits (the “Interchange Lawsuits”) against MasterCard and Visa and several member banks, including our subsidiaries and us, alleging among other things, that the defendants conspired to fix the level of interchange fees. The complaints seek injunctive relief and civil monetary damages, which could be trebled. Separately, a number of large merchants have asserted similar claims against Visa and MasterCard only. In October 2005, the class and merchant Interchange Lawsuits were consolidated before the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for certain purposes, including discovery. In July 2012, the parties executed and filed with the court a Memorandum of Understanding agreeing to resolve the litigation on certain terms set forth in a settlement agreement attached to the Memorandum. The class settlement provides for, among other things, (i) payments by defendants to the class and individual plaintiffs totaling approximately $6.6 billion; (ii) a distribution to the class merchants of an amount equal to 10 basis points of certain interchange transactions for a period of eight months; and (iii) modifications to certain Visa and MasterCard rules regarding point of sale practices. In December 2013, the court granted final approval of the proposed class settlement, which was appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in January 2014. Several merchant plaintiffs have also opted out of the class settlement, some of which have sued MasterCard, Visa and various member banks, including Capital One (collectively “the Opt-Out Plaintiffs”). Relatedly, in December 2013, individual consumer plaintiffs also filed a proposed national class action against a number of banks, including Capital One, alleging that because the banks conspired to fix interchange fees, consumers were forced to pay more for the fees than appropriate. The consumer case and virtually all of the opt-out cases were consolidated before the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for certain purposes, including discovery. In November 2014, the court dismissed the proposed consumer class action. The remaining consolidated cases are in their preliminary stages, and Visa and MasterCard have settled a number of individual opt-out cases, requiring non-material payments from all banks, including Capital One.As members of Visa, our subsidiary banks have indemnification obligations to Visa with respect to final judgments and settlements, including the Interchange Lawsuits. In the first quarter of 2008, Visa completed an IPO of its stock. With IPO proceeds, Visa established an escrow account for the benefit of member banks to fund certain litigation settlements and claims, including the Interchange Lawsuits. As a result, in the first quarter of 2008, we reduced our Visa-related indemnification liabilities of $91 million recorded in other liabilities with a corresponding reduction of other non-interest expense. We made an election in accordance with the accounting guidance for fair value option for financial assets and liabilities on the indemnification guarantee to Visa, and the fair value of the guarantee as of March 31, 2015 was zero. Separately, in January 2011, we entered into a MasterCard Settlement and Judgment Sharing Agreement, along with other defendant banks, which apportions between MasterCard and its member banks the costs and liabilities of any judgment or settlement arising from the Interchange Lawsuits.In March 2011, a furniture store owner named Mary Watson filed a proposed class action in the Supreme Court of British Columbia against Visa, MasterCard, and several banks, including Capital One (the “Watson Litigation”). The lawsuit asserts, among other  129Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSthings, that the defendants conspired to fix the merchant discount fees that merchants pay on credit card transactions in violation of Section 45 of the Competition Act and seeks unspecified damages and injunctive relief. In addition, Capital One has been named as a defendant in similar proposed class action claims filed in other jurisdictions in Canada. In March 2014, the court granted a partial motion for class certification. Both parties appealed the decision to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia, which heard oral argument in December 2014. In April 2015, the merchant plaintiffs and Capital One agreed to settle all matters filed in Canada as to Capital One, subject to court approval.Credit Card Interest Rate LitigationThe Capital One Bank Credit Card Interest Rate Multi-district Litigation matter was created as a result of a June 2010 transfer order issued by the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multi-district Litigation (“MDL”), which consolidated for pretrial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia two pending putative class actions against COBNA-Nancy Mancuso, et al. v. Capital One Bank (USA), N.A., et al., (E.D. Virginia); and Kevin S. Barker, et al. v. Capital One Bank (USA), N.A., (N.D. Georgia). A third action, Jennifer L. Kolkowski v. Capital One Bank (USA), N.A., (C.D. California) was subsequently transferred into the MDL. In August 2010, the plaintiffs in the MDL filed a Consolidated Amended Complaint alleging that COBNA breached its contractual obligations, and violated the Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”), the California Consumers Legal Remedies Act, the Unfair Competition Law (“UCL”), the California False Advertising Act, the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act, and the Kansas Consumer Protection Act when it raised interest rates on certain credit card accounts. As a result of a settlement in another matter, the California-based UCL and TILA claims in the MDL are extinguished. The MDL plaintiffs seek statutory damages, restitution, attorney’s fees and an injunction against future rate increases. In August 2011, after the completion of fact discovery, Capital One filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted in September 2014. Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in October 2014.Mortgage Repurchase LitigationIn February 2009, GreenPoint was named as a defendant in a lawsuit commenced in the New York County Supreme Court, by U.S. Bank, N. A., Syncora Guarantee Inc. and CIFG Assurance North America, Inc. (the “U.S. Bank Litigation”). Plaintiffs allege, among other things, that GreenPoint breached certain representations and warranties in two contracts pursuant to which GreenPoint sold approximately 30,000 mortgage loans having an aggregate original principal balance of approximately $1.8 billion to a purchaser that ultimately transferred most of these mortgage loans to a securitization trust. Some of the securities issued by the trust were insured by Syncora and CIFG. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and an order compelling GreenPoint to repurchase the entire portfolio of 30,000 mortgage loans based on alleged breaches of representations and warranties relating to a limited sampling of loans in the portfolio, or, alternatively, the repurchase of specific mortgage loans to which the alleged breaches of representations and warranties relate. In March 2010, the court granted GreenPoint’s motion to dismiss with respect to plaintiffs Syncora and CIFG and denied the motion with respect to U.S. Bank. GreenPoint subsequently answered the complaint with respect to U.S. Bank, denying the allegations, and filed a counterclaim against U.S. Bank alleging breach of covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In February 2012, the court denied plaintiffs’ motion for leave to file an amended complaint and dismissed Syncora and CIFG from the case. Syncora and CIFG appealed their dismissal to the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department (the “First Department”), which affirmed the dismissal in April 2013. The New York Court of Appeals denied Syncora’s and CIFG’s motion for leave to appeal the First Department’s decision in February 2014. Therefore, the case is now proceeding with U.S. Bank as the sole plaintiff.In May, June, and July 2012, FHFA (acting as conservator for Freddie Mac) filed three summonses with notice in the New York state court against GreenPoint, on behalf of the trustees for three RMBS trusts backed by loans originated by GreenPoint with an aggregate original principal balance of $3.4 billion. In January 2013, the plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint in the name of the three trusts, acting by the respective trustees, alleging breaches of contractual representations and warranties regarding compliance with GreenPoint underwriting guidelines relating to certain loans (the “FHFA Litigation”). Plaintiffs seek specific performance of the repurchase obligations with respect to the loans for which they have provided notice of alleged breaches as well as all other allegedly breaching loans, rescissory damages, indemnification, costs and interest. GreenPoint moved to dismiss the case as untimely under New York’s statute of limitations, and the court denied the motion without prejudice to renew it after the completion of relevant discovery.In July 2013, Lehman XS Trust, Series 2006-4N, by its trustee U.S. Bank, N.A. filed a lawsuit in the Southern District of New York against GreenPoint alleging breaches of representations and warranties made in certain loan sale agreements, pursuant to which GreenPoint sold mortgage loans with an original principal balance of $915 million to Lehman Brothers for securitization  130Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSand sale to investors. The lawsuit (“the LXS Trust Litigation”) seeks specific performance of GreenPoint’s obligation to repurchase certain allegedly breaching loans, or in the alternative, the repurchase of all loans in the trust, the award of rescissory damages, costs, fees and interest. In January 2014, the court granted GreenPoint’s motion to dismiss based on the statute of limitations, ruling that New York’s six-year statute of limitations began running no later than the time of the mortgage securitization. The plaintiff has appealed the dismissal of the complaint.As noted above in the section entitled Mortgage Representation and Warranty Liabilities, the Company’s subsidiaries establish reserves with respect to representation and warranty litigation matters, where appropriate, within the Company’s overall representation and warranty reserves. Please see above for more details.Anti-Money Laundering InvestigationCapital One has received requests for subpoenas and testimony from the New York District Attorney’s Office (“NYDA”) with respect to certain check casher clients of the Commercial Banking business and Capital One’s anti-money laundering program. In early 2015, we received similar requests from the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) of the U.S. Department of Treasury. Capital One is cooperating with all agencies involved in the investigation.Subprime Auto Loan InvestigationsCapital One has received a subpoena from the NYDA seeking information regarding the Company’s subprime auto finance business. Capital One has also received a subpoena from the DOJ’s New Jersey office requesting information related to subprime auto origination and securitization activities. Capital One is cooperating with both investigations.Checking Account Overdraft LitigationIn May 2010, Capital One Financial Corporation and COBNA were named as defendants in a putative class action named Steen v. Capital One Financial Corporation, et al., filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Plaintiff challenges practices relating to fees for overdraft and non-sufficient funds fees on consumer checking accounts. Plaintiff alleges that our methodology for posting transactions to customer accounts was designed to maximize the generation of overdraft fees, supporting claims for breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unconscionability, conversion, unjust enrichment and violations of state unfair trade practices laws. Plaintiff seeks a range of remedies, including restitution, disgorgement, injunctive relief, punitive damages and attorneys’ fees. In May 2010, the case was transferred to the Southern District of Florida for coordinated pre-trial proceedings as part of a multi-district litigation (“MDL”) involving numerous defendant banks, captioned In re Checking Account Overdraft Litigation. In January 2011, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint against CONA in the MDL court. In February 2011, CONA filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. In March 2011, the MDL court granted CONA’s motion to dismiss claims of breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing under Texas law, but denied the motion to dismiss in all other respects. In June 2012, the MDL court granted plaintiff’s motion for class certification. The parties reached an agreement to resolve the class claims in October 2014, and the court preliminarily approved the proposed settlement in January 2015.Intellectual Ventures Corp., et al.In June 2013, Intellectual Ventures I, LLC and Intellectual Ventures II, LLC (collectively “IV”) sued Capital One Financial Corp., Capital One Bank (USA), N.A. and Capital One, N.A. (collectively “Capital One”) for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. In the Complaint, IV alleges infringement of patents related to various business processes across the Capital One enterprise. IV simultaneously filed patent infringement actions against numerous other financial institutions on the same and other patents in several other federal courts. Capital One’s motion to dismiss was denied without prejudice in August 2013. Capital One filed an answer and counterclaim alleging antitrust violations. In December 2013, the court dismissed Capital One’s counterclaim and decided the parties’ arguments on claim construction. IV agreed to dismiss two patents in suit, and following claim construction, asked for a stipulation of non-infringement for one patent with an opportunity to appeal the court’s decision regarding claim construction. In April 2014, the court granted Capital One’s motion for summary judgment and found that the two remaining patents were either unpatentable or indefinite. In May 2014, IV appealed to the Federal Circuit, which will hear oral argument in May 2015. In January 2014, IV filed a second suit against Capital One for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland. In the complaint, IV again alleges infringement of patents related to various business practices across the Capital One enterprise. IV has voluntarily dismissed one of the patents against Capital One. The parties are currently engaged in discovery and  131Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSpreparing for claim construction on the remaining patents. In March 2015, the court granted Capital One’s motion for leave to add a counterclaim for antitrust violations by IV.Telephone Consumer Protection Act LitigationIn December 2012, the Capital One Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) Litigation Multi-district Litigation matter was created as a result of a transfer order issued by the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multi-district Litigation (“TCPA MDL”), which consolidated for pretrial proceedings in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois three pending putative class actions-Bridgett Amadeck, et al. v. Capital One Financial Corporation, et al. (W.D. Washington); Nicholas Martin, et al. v. Capital One Bank (USA), N.A., et al. (N.D. Illinois); and Charles C. Patterson v. Capital One Bank (USA), N.A., et al. (N.D. Illinois) and several individual lawsuits. In February 2013, the putative class action plaintiffs in the TCPA MDL filed a Consolidated Master Class Action Complaint alleging that COBNA and/or entities acting on its behalf violated the TCPA by contacting consumers on their cellular telephones using an automatic telephone dialing system and/or artificial or prerecorded voice without first obtaining prior express consent to do so. The plaintiffs seek statutory damages for alleged negligent and willful violations of the TCPA, attorneys' fees, costs, and injunctive relief. In June 2014, the parties filed a settlement agreement resolving the litigation. The court granted preliminary approval of the class settlement in July 2014, and granted final approval in February 2015. Some class members filed Notices of Appeal to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in February and March 2015.Other Pending and Threatened LitigationIn addition, we are commonly subject to various pending and threatened legal actions relating to the conduct of our normal business activities. In the opinion of management, the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of all such other pending or threatened legal actions will not be material to our consolidated financial position or our results of operations. 132Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskFor a discussion of the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see “MD&A—Risk Management—Market Risk Management” and “MD&A—Market Risk Profile.”Item 4. Controls and ProceduresOverviewWe are required under applicable laws and regulations to maintain controls and procedures, which include disclosure controls and procedures as well as internal control over financial reporting, as further described below.(a) Disclosure Controls and ProceduresDisclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our financial reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding our required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we must apply judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures.Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresAs required by Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of March 31, 2015, the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2015, at a reasonable level of assurance, in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting information required to be disclosed within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms.(b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingWe regularly review our disclosure controls and procedures and make changes intended to ensure the quality of our financial reporting.
