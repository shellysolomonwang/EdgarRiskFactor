Unless otherwise specified, references to notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2018 included in this Report. Management monitors a variety of key indicators to evaluate our business results and financial condition. The following MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes in this Report and the more detailed information contained in our 2017 Form 10-K.INTRODUCTIONWe are a diversified financial services holding company with banking and non-banking subsidiaries. Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through branches, the internet and other distribution channels. As of June 30, 2018, our principal subsidiaries included:•Capital One Bank (USA), National Association (“COBNA”), which offers credit and debit card products, other lending products and deposit products; and•Capital One, National Association (“CONA”), which offers a broad spectrum of banking products and financial services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients.The Company is hereafter collectively referred to as “we,” “us” or “our.” COBNA and CONA are collectively referred to as the “Banks.” Certain business terms used in this document are defined in the “MD&A—Glossary and Acronyms” and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this Report.Our consolidated total net revenues are derived primarily from lending to consumer and commercial customers net of funding costs associated with interest on deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt. We also earn non-interest income which primarily consists of interchange income net of reward expenses, and service charges and other customer-related fees. Our expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating expenses, marketing expenses and income taxes.Our principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio, asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group and residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments, are included in the Other category.•Credit Card: Consists of our domestic consumer and small business card lending, and international card businesses in Canada and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”).•Consumer Banking: Consists of our branch-based lending and deposit gathering activities for consumers and small businesses, national deposit gathering and national auto lending.   1Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents•Commercial Banking: Consists of our lending, deposit gathering, capital markets and treasury management services to commercial real estate and commercial and industrial customers. Our commercial and industrial customers typically include companies with annual revenues between $20 million and $2 billion.Business DevelopmentsWe regularly explore and evaluate opportunities to acquire financial services and financial assets, including credit card and other loan portfolios, and enter into strategic partnerships as part of our growth strategy. We also explore opportunities to acquire digital companies and related assets to improve our information technology infrastructure and to deliver on our digital strategy. In addition, we regularly consider the potential disposition of certain of our assets, branches, partnership agreements or lines of business. We may issue equity or debt, including through one or more public offerings, to fund our acquisitions.On July 26, 2018, we announced that we entered into a new, long-term credit card program agreement with Walmart Inc. (“Walmart”). Under the terms of the agreement, we will become the exclusive issuer of Walmart’s private label and co-branded credit card program in the U.S. beginning August 1, 2019.In the fourth quarter of 2017, we announced our decision to cease new originations of residential mortgage and home equity loan products within our Consumer Banking business. In the first quarter of 2018, we sold the substantial majority of the mortgage servicing rights related to loans serviced for others. In the second quarter of 2018, we sold the substantial majority of our consumer home loan portfolio and the related servicing. We also transferred the remaining portfolio to loans held for sale as of June 30, 2018.On September 25, 2017, we completed the acquisition from Synovus Bank of credit card assets and related liabilities of World’s Foremost Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cabela’s Incorporated (“Cabela’s acquisition”). The Cabela’s acquisition added approximately $5.7 billion to our domestic credit card loans held for investment portfolio as of the acquisition date.  2Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsSUMMARY OF SELECTED FINANCIAL DATAThe following table presents selected consolidated financial data and performance from our results of operations for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 and 2017 and selected comparative balance sheet data as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. We also provide selected key metrics we use in evaluating our performance, including certain metrics that are computed using non-GAAP measures.

In comparison, we reported net income of $1.0 billion ($1.94 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $6.7 billion and net income of $1.8 billion ($3.49 per diluted common share) on total net revenue of $13.2 billion for the second quarter and first six months of 2017, respectively.Our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio as calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach, including transition provisions, was 11.1% and 10.3% as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. See “MD&A—Capital Management” below for additional information.In the second quarter of 2018, we sold the substantial majority of our consumer home loan portfolio and the related servicing. We also transferred the remaining portfolio of $398 million to loans held for sale as of June 30, 2018. These actions resulted in a net gain of $400 million, including a benefit for credit losses of $46 million, which is reflected in the Other category.On June 28, 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.85 billion of shares of our common stock from the third quarter of 2017 through the end of the second quarter of 2018. In December 2017, the Board of Directors reduced the authorized repurchases of our common stock to up to $1.0 billion for the remaining 2017 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) period, which ended June 30, 2018 (“2017 Stock Repurchase Program”). Through the end of the second quarter of 2018, we repurchased approximately $1.0 billion of shares of our common stock under the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program.  Additionally, on June 28, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.2 billion of shares of our common stock (“2018 Stock Repurchase Program”) beginning the third quarter of 2018 through the end of the second quarter of 2019. See “MD&A—Capital Management—Dividend Policy and Stock Purchases” for additional information.Below are additional highlights of our performance in the second quarter and first six months of 2018. These highlights are generally based on a comparison between the results of the second quarter and first six months of 2018 and 2017, except as otherwise noted. The changes in our financial condition and credit performance are generally based on our financial condition and credit performance as of June 30, 2018 compared to our financial condition and credit performance as of December 31, 2017. We provide a more detailed discussion of our financial performance in the sections following this “Executive Summary and Business Outlook.”  5Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTotal Company Performance•Earnings: Our net income increased by $870 million to $1.9 billion in the second quarter of 2018 and increased by $1.4 billion to $3.3 billion in the first six months of 2018 primarily driven by:◦lower provision for credit losses driven by the allowance releases in our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios largely due to improvements in credit trends and lower charge-offs mainly due to elevated charge-offs in the second quarter of 2017 in our oil and gas and taxi medallion lending portfolios; ◦higher non-interest income largely driven by the net gain from the sale of the substantial majority of our consumer home loan portfolio; and◦higher net interest income due to growth in our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios and higher yields on interest earning assets as a result of higher interest rates, partially offset by higher interest expense due to the net effect of higher interest rates.•Loans Held for Investment:◦Period-end loans held for investment decreased by $18.3 billion to $236.1 billion as of June 30, 2018 from December 31, 2017 primarily driven by the sale of the substantial majority of our consumer home loan portfolio and the transfer of the remaining portfolio to loans held for sale, as well as seasonal paydowns in our domestic credit card loan portfolio, partially offset by growth in our commercial and auto loan portfolios.◦Average loans held for investment decreased by $1.5 billion to $240.8 billion in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 primarily due to growth in our domestic credit card loan portfolio, mainly due to loans obtained in the Cabela’s acquisition, and growth in our auto loan portfolio being more than offset by the impact of the sale of the substantial majority of our consumer home loan portfolio and the transfer of the remaining portfolio to loans held for sale. These same factors drove average loans held for investment to increase by $3.3 billion to $245.2 billion in the first six months of 2018 compared to the first six months of 2017 as the growth in our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios more than offset the impact of the sale of the substantial majority of our consumer home loan portfolio and the transfer of the remaining portfolio to loans held for sale.•Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: Our net charge-off rate decreased by 25 basis points to 2.42% in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 and decreased by 8 basis points to 2.51% in the first six months of 2018 compared to the first six months of 2017 primarily driven by elevated charge-offs in the second quarter of 2017 in our oil and gas and taxi medallion lending portfolios.Our 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 43 basis points to 3.05% as of June 30, 2018 from December 31, 2017 primarily due to seasonally lower delinquency inventories in our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios, partially offset by the sale of the substantial majority of our consumer home loan portfolio.•Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses: Our allowance for loan and lease losses decreased by $134 million to $7.4 billion as of June 30, 2018 from December 31, 2017 primarily driven by an allowance release in our auto loan portfolio largely due to improvements in credit trends and an allowance release due to the sale of the substantial majority of our consumer home loan portfolio. The allowance coverage ratio increased by 17 basis points to 3.12% as of June 30, 2018 from December 31, 2017 primarily driven by lower loan balances largely due to the sale of the substantial majority of our consumer home loan portfolio and seasonal paydowns in our domestic credit card loan portfolio, partially offset by allowance releases in our auto and domestic credit card loan portfolios.  6Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsBusiness OutlookWe discuss below our current expectations regarding our total company performance and the performance of our business segments over the near-term based on market conditions, the regulatory environment and our business strategies as of the time we filed this Report. The statements contained in this section are based on our current expectations regarding our outlook for our financial results and business strategies. Our expectations take into account, and should be read in conjunction with, our expectations regarding economic trends and analysis of our business as discussed in “Part I—Item 1. Business” and “Part II—Item 7. MD&A” in our 2017 Form 10-K. Certain statements are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results could differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise disclosed, forward-looking statements do not reflect:•any change in current dividend or repurchase strategies;•the effect of any acquisitions, divestitures or similar transactions that have not been previously disclosed; or•any changes in laws, regulations or regulatory interpretations, in each case after the date as of which such statements are made.See “MD&A—Forward-Looking Statements” in this Report for more information on the forward-looking statements and “Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our 2017 Form 10-K for factors that could materially influence our results.Total Company ExpectationsWe continue to expect our 2018 corporate annual effective tax rate to be around 20% before discrete items.After two years of significant improvement, we expect our annual 2018 operating efficiency ratio, net of adjusting items, will be roughly flat compared to our 2017 operating efficiency ratio, net of adjusting items. While efficiency ratio can vary in any given year, over the long term, we continue to believe that we will be able to achieve gradual efficiency improvement driven by growth and digital productivity gains. We expect our long-term improvements in total efficiency ratio will mostly come from an improving operating efficiency ratio.We continue to expect marketing expense in 2018 will be higher than 2017, with essentially all of the increase coming in the second half of the year.We believe the increases in deposit costs will continue, which will be a headwind to net interest margin going forward.Business Segment ExpectationsConsumer Banking: In our Consumer Banking business, we expect further increases in average deposit costs driven by higher market rates and increasing competition for deposits, as well as changing product mix as our national banking growth strategy continues to gain traction. Over the longer term, we continue to expect that the charge-off rate in our auto finance business will increase gradually.CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe section below provides a comparative discussion of our consolidated financial performance for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 and 2017. We provide a discussion of our business segment results in the following section, “MD&A—Business Segment Financial Performance.” You should read this section together with our “MD&A—Executive Summary and Business Outlook,” where we discuss trends and other factors that we expect will affect our future results of operations.Net Interest IncomeNet interest income represents the difference between the interest income, including certain fees, earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest expense on our interest-bearing liabilities. Interest-earning assets include loans, investment securities and   7Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contentsother interest-earning assets, while our interest-bearing liabilities include interest-bearing deposits, securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, other borrowings, and other interest-bearing liabilities. Generally, we include in interest income any past due fees on loans that we deem collectible. Our net interest margin, based on our consolidated results, represents the difference between the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities, including the notional impact of non-interest-bearing funding. We expect net interest income and our net interest margin to fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  8Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 2 below presents, for each major category of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the average outstanding balance, interest income earned, interest expense incurred and average yield for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 and 2017.

Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking interest income and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory rate (21% and 35% for all periods presented in 2018 and 2017, respectively) and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category. Taxable-equivalent adjustments included in the interest income and yield computations for our Commercial banking loans totaled approximately $21 million and $41 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, and $32 million and $64 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, respectively, with corresponding reductions to Other category.(3) Interest income and interest expense and the calculation of average yields on interest-earning assets and average rates on interest-bearing liabilities include the impact of hedge accounting. In the first quarter of 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. As a result, interest income and interest expense amounts shown above for the three months ended June 30, 2018 include $2 million and $16 million, respectively, and for the six months ended June 30, 2018 include $3 million and $46 million, respectively, related to hedge ineffectiveness that would previously have been included in other non-interest income.               10Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsNet interest income increased by $78 million to $5.6 billion in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 and increased by $322 million to $11.3 billion in the first six months of 2018 compared to the first six months of 2017 primarily driven by higher interest income due to growth in our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios, and higher yields as a result of higher interest rates, partially offset by higher interest expense due to the net effect of higher interest rates. Net interest margin decreased by 22 basis points to 6.66% in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 and decreased by 9 basis points to 6.79% in the first six months of 2018 compared to the first six months of 2017 primarily driven by higher interest expense due to the net effect of higher interest rates, partially offset by product mix changes and higher yields in our interest-earning assets. Table 3 displays the change in our net interest income between periods and the extent to which the variance is attributable to:•changes in the volume of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities; or•changes in the interest rates related to these assets and liabilities.Table 3: Rate/Volume Analysis of Net Interest Income(1)  Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,  2018 vs. 2017 2018 vs. 2017(Dollars in millions) Total Variance Volume Rate Total Variance Volume RateInterest income:            Loans:(1)            Credit card $275 $296 $(21) $658 $613 $45Consumer banking (5) (130) 125 91 (104) 195Commercial banking(2) 97 (10) 107 165 (24) 189Other(2) (47) (27) (20) (86) (34) (52)Total loans, including loans held for sale 320 129 191 828 451 377Investment securities 106 72 34 142 78 64Cash equivalents and other interest-earning assets 42 27 15 65 34 31Total interest income 468 228 240 1,035 563 472Interest expense:            Deposits 240 16 224 426 27 399Securitized debt obligations 42 3 39 80 15 65Senior and subordinated notes 110 32 78 212 70 142Other borrowings and liabilities (2) 1 (3) (5) (12) 7Total interest expense 390 52 338 713 100 613Net interest income $78 $176 $(98) $322 $463 $(141)__________(1) We calculate the change in interest income and interest expense separately for each item. The portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate is allocated proportionately when the calculation results in a positive value. When the portion of interest income or interest expense attributable to both volume and rate results in a negative value, the total amount is allocated to volume or rate, depending on which amount is positive.(2) Some of our commercial loans generate tax-exempt income. Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking interest income and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory rate (21% and 35% for all periods presented in 2018 and 2017, respectively) and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category.   11Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsNon-Interest IncomeTable 4 displays the components of non-interest income for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 and 2017.Table 4: Non-Interest Income  Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,(Dollars in millions) 2018 2017 2018 2017Interchange fees, net $723 $676 $1,366 $1,246Service charges and other customer-related fees 391 418 823 789Net securities gains (losses) (1) (4) 7 (4)Other non-interest income:        Mortgage banking revenue 440 41 478 110Treasury and other investment income 38 36 46 50Other 50 64 112 101Total other non-interest income 528 141 636 261Total non-interest income $1,641 $1,231 $2,832 $2,292Non-interest income increased by $410 million to $1.6 billion in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 and increased by $540 million to $2.8 billion in the first six months of 2018 compared to the first six months of 2017 primarily driven by:•the net gain from the sale of the substantial majority of our consumer home loan portfolio; and•an increase in net interchange fees primarily due to higher purchase volume.Provision for Credit LossesOur provision for credit losses in each period is driven by net charge-offs and changes to the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. We recorded a provision for credit losses of $1.3 billion and $3.0 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, compared to $1.8 billion and $3.8 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, respectively. The provision for credit losses as a percentage of net interest income was 23.0% and 26.2% in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, compared to 32.9% and 34.6% in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, respectively.Our provision for credit losses decreased by $524 million in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 and decreased by $842 million in the first six months of 2018 compared to the first six months of 2017 primarily driven by:•allowance releases in our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios largely due to improvements in credit trends; and•elevated charge-offs in the second quarter of 2017 in our oil and gas and taxi medallion lending portfolios.We provide additional information on the provision for credit losses and changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses within “MD&A—Credit Risk Profile,” “Note 4—Loans” and “Note 5—Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments.” For information on the allowance methodology for each of our loan categories, see “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2017 Form 10-K.  12Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsNon-Interest ExpenseTable 5 displays the components of non-interest expense for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 and 2017.Table 5: Non-Interest Expense  Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,(Dollars in millions) 2018 2017 2018 2017Salaries and associate benefits $1,430 $1,383 $2,950 $2,854Occupancy and equipment 503 474 993 945Marketing 425 435 839 831Professional services 234 279 444 526Communications and data processing 317 289 623 577Amortization of intangibles 43 61 87 123Other non-interest expense:        Bankcard, regulatory and other fee assessments 65 146 234 282Collections 104 88 212 173Fraud losses 89 78 186 156Other 214 181 429 381Total other non-interest expense 472 493 1,061 992Total non-interest expense $3,424 $3,414 $6,997 $6,848Non-interest expense remained flat at $3.4 billion in the second quarter of 2018. Non-interest expense increased by $149 million to $7.0 billion in the first six months of 2018 compared to the first six months of 2017 primarily due to:•higher operating expenses associated with loan growth, as well as continued investments in technology and infrastructure; and•restructuring activities, which primarily consisted of severance and related benefits pursuant to our ongoing benefit programs, that are the result of exiting certain business activities and locations.These increases were partially offset by lower bankcard, regulatory and other fee assessments. Income TaxesWe recorded income tax provisions of $575 million (23.1% effective income tax rate) and $894 million (21.5% effective income tax rate) in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, compared to $443 million (29.7% effective income tax rate) and $757 million (29.1% effective income tax rate) in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, respectively.The decrease in our effective income tax rate in the second quarter and first six months of 2018 compared to the second quarter and first six months of 2017 was primarily due to the federal statutory tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% as a result of the Tax Act, partially offset by higher income relative to our tax credits and higher discrete tax expense.We provide additional information on items affecting our income taxes and effective tax rate in “Note 16—Income Taxes” in our 2017 Form 10-K.  13Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ANALYSISTotal assets decreased by $1.7 billion to $364.0 billion as of June 30, 2018 from December 31, 2017 primarily attributable to a decrease in loans held for investment driven by the sale of the substantial majority of our consumer home loan portfolio and expected seasonal paydowns in our domestic credit card loan portfolio, partially offset by an increase in investment securities and growth in our commercial and auto loan portfolios.Total liabilities decreased by $2.9 billion to $314.1 billion as of June 30, 2018 from December 31, 2017 primarily driven by a decrease in our Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLB”) advances outstanding, which are included in other debt. This decrease was partially offset by:•deposit growth in our Consumer Banking business; and•net issuances of senior and subordinated notes.Stockholders’ equity increased by $1.2 billion to $49.9 billion as of June 30, 2018 from December 31, 2017 primarily due to our net income of $3.3 billion in the first six months of 2018. This driver was partially offset by:•treasury stock purchases and dividend payments to our stockholders; and•unrealized losses on our available for sale securities and cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive loss primarily driven by higher interest rates. The following is a discussion of material changes in the major components of our assets and liabilities during the first six months of 2018. Period-end balance sheet amounts may vary from average balance sheet amounts due to liquidity and balance sheet management activities that are intended to ensure the adequacy of capital while managing the liquidity requirements of the Company, our customers and our market risk exposure in accordance with our risk appetite.Investment SecuritiesOur investment securities portfolio consists primarily of the following: U.S. Treasury securities; U.S. government-sponsored enterprise or agency (“Agency”) and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”); Agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”); other asset-backed securities (“ABS”); and other securities. Agency securities include Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) guaranteed securities, Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) issued securities. The carrying value of our investments in U.S. Treasury and Agency securities represented 96% and 95% of our total investment securities as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.The fair value of our available for sale securities portfolio increased by $13.0 billion to $50.7 billion as of June 30, 2018 from December 31, 2017 primarily due to a one-time transfer of held to maturity securities to available for sale as a result of our adoption of ASU No. 2017-12. The fair value of our held to maturity securities portfolio increased by $3.7 billion to $33.1 billion as of June 30, 2018 from December 31, 2017 primarily driven by purchases in the second quarter of 2018 as we invested a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the substantial majority of our consumer home loan portfolio into securities, partially offset by the one-time transfer to available for sale.   14Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 6 presents the amortized cost, carrying value and fair value for the major categories of our investment securities portfolio as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.Table 6: Investment Securities  June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017(Dollars in millions) AmortizedCost FairValue AmortizedCost FairValueInvestment securities available for sale:        U.S. Treasury securities $8,603 $8,624 $5,168 $5,171RMBS:        Agency 34,870 33,742 26,013 25,678Non-agency 1,563 1,940 1,722 2,114Total RMBS 36,433 35,682 27,735 27,792Agency CMBS 4,858 4,763 3,209 3,175Other ABS 296 294 513 512Other securities(1) 1,331 1,328 1,003 1,005Total investment securities available for sale $51,521 $50,691 $37,628 $37,655         (Dollars in millions) Carrying Value FairValue Carrying Value FairValueInvestment securities held to maturity:        U.S. Treasury securities — — $200 $200Agency RMBS $30,377 $30,108 24,980 25,395Agency CMBS 3,087 2,989 3,804 3,842Total investment securities held to maturity $33,464 $33,097 $28,984 $29,437__________(1) Includes primarily supranational bonds and foreign government bonds.Credit RatingsOur portfolio of investment securities continues to be concentrated in securities that generally have high credit ratings and low credit risk, such as securities issued and guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury and Agencies. We categorize the credit ratings of our investment securities based on the credit ratings issued by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (“S&P”) as of June 30, 2018 and the lower of the credit ratings issued by S&P and Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) as of December 31, 2017.Approximately 97% and 96% of our total investment securities portfolio was rated AA+ or its equivalent, or better, as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, while approximately 2% and 3% was below investment grade as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.  15Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 7 provides information on the credit ratings of our non-agency RMBS, other ABS and other securities in our portfolio as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.Table 7: Non-Agency Investment Securities Credit Ratings  June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017(Dollars in millions) Fair Value AAA OtherInvestmentGrade BelowInvestmentGrade/Not Rated(1) Fair Value AAA OtherInvestmentGrade BelowInvestmentGrade/Not Rated(1)Non-agency RMBS $1,940 — 6% 94% $2,114 — 3% 97%Other ABS 294 59% — 41 512 100% — —Other securities 1,328 88 12 — 1,005 71 19 10__________(1) Includes investment securities that were not rated by S&P as of June 30, 2018 and investment securities not rated by S&P or Moody’s as of December 31, 2017.

For additional information on our investment securities, see “Note 3—Investment Securities.”Loans Held for InvestmentTotal loans held for investment consist of both unsecuritized loans and loans held in our consolidated trusts. Table 8 summarizes the carrying value of our portfolio of loans held for investment by portfolio segment, the allowance for loan and lease losses, and net loan balances as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.Table 8: Loans Held for Investment  June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017(Dollars in millions) Loans Allowance Net Loans Loans Allowance Net LoansCredit Card $109,777 $5,624 $104,153 $114,762 $5,648 $109,114Consumer Banking 58,727 1,120 57,607 75,078 1,242 73,836Commercial Banking 67,609 624 66,985 64,575 611 63,964Other 11 — 11 58 1 57Total $236,124 $7,368 $228,756 $254,473 $7,502 $246,971Loans held for investment decreased by $18.3 billion to $236.1 billion as of June 30, 2018 from December 31, 2017 primarily driven by the sale of the substantial majority of our consumer home loan portfolio and the transfer of the remaining portfolio to loans held for sale and expected seasonal paydowns in our domestic credit card loan portfolio, partially offset by growth in our commercial and auto loan portfolios.We provide additional information on the composition of our loan portfolio and credit quality below in “MD&A—Credit Risk Profile,” “MD&A—Consolidated Results of Operations” and “Note 4—Loans.”Funding SourcesOur primary source of funding comes from deposits, which provide a stable and relatively low cost of funds. In addition to deposits, we also raise funding through the issuance of securitized debt obligations and other debt. Other debt primarily consists of senior and subordinated notes, FHLB advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios, and federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase.  16Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 9 provides the composition of our primary sources of funding as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.Table 9: Funding Sources Composition  June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017(Dollars in millions) Amount % of Total Amount % of TotalDeposits:(1)        Consumer Banking $194,962 65% $185,842 61%Commercial Banking 31,078 10 33,938 11Other 22,185 7 23,922 8Total deposits 248,225 82 243,702 80Securitized debt obligations 19,649 7 20,010 7Other debt 33,661 11 40,271 13Total funding sources $301,535 100% $303,983 100%__________(1)  Includes brokered deposits of $23.3 billion and $25.1 billion as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.Total deposits increased by $4.5 billion to $248.2 billion as of June 30, 2018 from December 31, 2017 primarily driven by growth in our deposit products that are sold to both existing and new customers in our Consumer Banking business.Securitized debt obligations remained relatively flat at $19.6 billion as of June 30, 2018.Other debt decreased by $6.6 billion to $33.7 billion as of June 30, 2018 from December 31, 2017 primarily driven by a decrease in our FHLB advances outstanding, partially offset by senior and subordinated notes issuances. We provide additional information on our funding sources in “MD&A—Liquidity Risk Profile” and in “Note 8—Deposits and Borrowings.”OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In the ordinary course of business, we engage in certain activities that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, generally referred to as off-balance sheet arrangements. These activities typically involve transactions with unconsolidated variable interest entities (“VIEs”) as well as other arrangements, such as letters of credit, loan commitments and guarantees, to meet the financing needs of our customers and support their ongoing operations. We provide additional information regarding these types of activities in “Note 6—Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations” and “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others.”BUSINESS SEGMENT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEOur principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio, asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group and residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments, are included in the Other category.The results of our individual businesses, which we report on a continuing operations basis, reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources. We provide additional information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in “Note 18—Business Segments” in our 2017 Form 10-K.  17Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsWe refer to the business segment results derived from our internal management accounting and reporting process as our “managed” presentation, which differs in some cases from our reported results prepared based on U.S. GAAP. There is no comprehensive authoritative body of guidance for management accounting equivalent to U.S. GAAP; therefore, the managed presentation of our business segment results may not be comparable to similar information provided by other financial services companies. In addition, our individual business segment results should not be used as a substitute for comparable results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.We summarize our business segment results for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 and 2017 and provide a comparative discussion of these results, as well as changes in our financial condition and credit performance metrics as of June 30, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. We provide a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated results in “Note 13—Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” Business Segment Financial PerformanceTable 10 summarizes our business segment results, which we report based on revenue and net income from continuing operations, for the second quarter and first six months of 2018 and 2017.

Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking revenue and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory tax rate (21% and 35% for all periods presented in 2018 and 2017, respectively) and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category.(4) In the first quarter of 2018, we made a change in how revenue is measured in our Commercial Banking business to include the tax benefits of losses on certain tax-advantaged investments. These tax benefits are included in revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis within our Commercial Banking business, with an offsetting reduction to the Other category. In addition, all revenue presented on a taxable-equivalent basis in our Commercial Banking business was impacted by the reduction of the federal tax rate set forth in the Tax Act. The net impact of the measurement change and the reduction of the federal tax rate was a decrease of $28 million and $56 million in revenue in our Commercial Banking business in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, with an offsetting impact to the Other category.  18Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCredit Card BusinessThe primary sources of revenue for our Credit Card business are interest income, net interchange income and fees collected from customers.

Average loans held for investment increased by $7.9 billion to $107.9 billion in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 and increased by $8.1 billion to $108.7 billion in the first six months of 2018 compared to the first six months of 2017 primarily due to growth in our domestic credit card loan portfolio largely driven by loans obtained in the Cabela’s acquisition.•Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: The net charge-off rate decreased by 35 basis points to 4.67% in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 primarily driven by the loans obtained in the Cabela’s acquisition, which have a lower charge-off rate, and favorability realized from portfolio seasoning.The net charge-off rate decreased by 17 basis points to 4.85% in the first six months of 2018 compared to the first six months of 2017 primarily driven by the loans obtained in the Cabela’s acquisition, which have a lower charge-off rate.The 30+ day delinquency rate decreased by 66 basis points to 3.33% as of June 30, 2018 from December 31, 2017 primarily driven by seasonally lower delinquency inventories and improvements in credit trends in our domestic credit card loan portfolio. Domestic Card BusinessDomestic Card generated net income from continuing operations of $881 million and $1.5 billion in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, compared to net income from continuing operations of $482 million and $760 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, respectively.

These drivers were largely offset by higher operating expenses driven by growth in our auto loan portfolio.•Loans Held for Investment: Period-end loans held for investment decreased by $16.4 billion to $58.7 billion as of June 30, 2018 from December 31, 2017, and average loans held for investment decreased by $8.0 billion to $66.5 billion in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017 and decreased by $3.2 billion to $70.7 billion in the first six months of 2018 compared to the first six months of 2017. These decreases were primarily driven by the sale of the substantial majority of our consumer home loan portfolio and the transfer of the remaining portfolio to loans held for sale, partially offset by growth in our auto loan portfolio.•Deposits: Period-end deposits increased by $9.1 billion to $195.0 billion as of June 30, 2018 from December 31, 2017 as a result of strong growth in our deposit products that are sold to both existing and new customers. •Net Charge-Off and Delinquency Metrics: The net charge-off rate decreased by 6 basis points to 1.19% in the second quarter of 2018 compared to the second quarter of 2017, and decreased by 3 basis points to 1.19% in the first six months of 2018 compared to the first six months of 2017. These decreases were primarily driven by lower charge-offs in our auto loan portfolio, partially offset by lower loan balances due to the sale of the substantial majority of our consumer home loan portfolio.The 30+ day delinquency rate increased by 46 basis points to 5.80% as of June 30, 2018 from December 31, 2017 primarily driven by lower loan balances due to the sale of the substantial majority of our consumer home loan portfolio, partially offset by seasonally lower delinquency inventories in our auto loan portfolio.Commercial Banking BusinessThe primary sources of revenue for our Commercial Banking business are net interest income from loans and deposits and non-interest income from customer fees and other transactions. Because our Commercial Banking business has loans and investments that generate tax-exempt income, tax credits or other tax benefits, we present the revenues on a taxable-equivalent basis. Expenses primarily consist of the provision for credit losses, operating costs and marketing expenses.Our Commercial Banking business generated net income from continuing operations of $242 million and $498 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, and $146 million and $359 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2017, respectively.  24Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 13 summarizes the financial results of our Commercial Banking business and displays selected key metrics for the periods indicated.Table 13: Commercial Banking Business Results  Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,(Dollars in millions, except as noted) 2018 2017 Change 2018 2017 ChangeSelected income statement data:            Net interest income $549 $569 (4)% $1,085 $1,135 (4)%Non-interest income 209 183 14 396 341 16Total net revenue(1)(2) 758 752 1 1,481 1,476 —Provision for credit losses(3) 34 140 (76) 20 138 (86)Non-interest expense 409 381 7 812 772 5Income from continuing operations before income taxes 315 231 36 649 566 15Income tax provision 73 85 (14) 151 207 (27)Income from continuing operations, net of tax $242 $146 66 $498 $359 39Selected performance metrics:            Average loans held for investment:            Commercial and multifamily real estate $27,302 $27,401 — $26,924 $26,997 —Commercial and industrial 38,686 39,815 (3) 38,467 39,845 (3)Total commercial lending 65,988 67,216 (2) 65,391 66,842 (2)Small-ticket commercial real estate 376 453 (17) 385 463 (17)Total commercial banking $66,364 $67,669 (2) $65,776 $67,305 (2)Average yield on loans held for investment(1)(4) 4.43 % 3.81% 62bps 4.30% 3.73% 57bpsAverage deposits $32,951 $34,263 (4)% $33,501 $34,241 (2)%Average deposits interest rate 0.65 % 0.36% 29bps 0.59% 0.34% 25bpsNet charge-offs $(7) $136 ** $12 $159 (92)%Net charge-off rate (0.04)% 0.80% (84)bps 0.04% 0.47% (43)bps             (Dollars in millions, except as noted) June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 Change      Selected period-end data:            Loans held for investment:            Commercial and multifamily real estate $28,292 $26,150 8 %      Commercial and industrial 38,948 38,025 2      Total commercial lending 67,240 64,175 5      Small-ticket commercial real estate 369 400 (8)      Total commercial banking $67,609 $64,575 5      Nonperforming loan rate 0.34 % 0.44% (10)bps      Nonperforming asset rate(5) 0.37 0.52 (15)      Allowance for loan and lease losses(3) $624 $611 2 %      Allowance coverage ratio 0.92 % 0.95% (3)bps      Deposits $31,078 $33,938 (8)%      Loans serviced for others 30,060 27,764 8      __________(1) Some of our commercial investments generate tax-exempt income, tax credits or other tax benefits.

The increase in net income in the second quarter and first six months of 2018 was primarily driven by the net gain of $400 million from the sale of the substantial majority of our consumer home loan portfolio, partially offset by:•higher operating expense primarily due to continued investments in technology and infrastructure;•higher interest expense due to the net effect of higher interest rates; and •restructuring activities, which primarily consisted of severance and related benefits pursuant to our ongoing benefit programs, that are the result of exiting certain business activities and locations.  27Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATESThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses on the consolidated financial statements. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We provide a summary of our significant accounting policies under “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2017 Form 10-K.We have identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. These critical accounting policies govern:•Loan loss reserves•Asset impairment•Fair value of financial instruments•Customer rewards reserveWe evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them, as necessary, based on changing conditions. There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates described in our 2017 Form 10-K under “MD&A—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.”ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND DEVELOPMENTSSee “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for information on accounting standards adopted in 2018, as well as recently issued accounting standards not yet required to be adopted and the expected impact of these changes in accounting standards.CAPITAL MANAGEMENTThe level and composition of our capital are determined by multiple factors, including our consolidated regulatory capital requirements and internal risk-based capital assessments such as internal stress testing and economic capital. The level and composition of our capital may also be influenced by rating agency guidelines, subsidiary capital requirements, the business environment, conditions in the financial markets and assessments of potential future losses due to adverse changes in our business and market environments.Capital Standards and Prompt Corrective ActionWe are subject to capital adequacy standards adopted by the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) (collectively, the “Federal Banking Agencies”), including the capital rules that implemented the Basel III capital framework (“Basel III Capital Rule”) developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“Basel Committee”). Moreover, the Banks, as insured depository institutions, are subject to prompt corrective action (“PCA”) capital regulations.In July 2013, the Federal Banking Agencies adopted the Basel III Capital Rule, which, in addition to implementing the Basel III capital framework, also implemented certain Dodd-Frank Act and other capital provisions, and updated the PCA capital framework to reflect the new regulatory capital minimums. The Basel III Capital Rule amended both the Basel I and Basel II Advanced Approaches frameworks, established a new common equity Tier 1 capital requirement and set higher minimum capital ratio requirements. We refer to the amended Basel I framework as the “Basel III Standardized Approach,” and the amended Advanced Approaches framework as the “Basel III Advanced Approaches.”  28Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsAt the end of 2012, we met one of the two independent eligibility criteria set by banking regulators for becoming subject to the Advanced Approaches capital rules. As a result, we have undertaken a multi-year process of implementing the Advanced Approaches regime for calculating risk-weighted assets and regulatory capital levels. We entered parallel run under Advanced Approaches on January 1, 2015, during which we are required to calculate capital ratios under both the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches, though we continue to use the Standardized Approach for purposes of meeting regulatory capital requirements.The Basel III Capital Rule also introduced the supplementary leverage ratio for all Advanced Approaches banking organizations with a minimum requirement of 3.0%. The supplementary leverage ratio compares Tier 1 capital to total leverage exposure, which includes all on-balance sheet assets and certain off-balance sheet exposures, including derivatives and unused commitments. Given that we are in our Basel III Advanced Approaches parallel run, we calculate the ratio based on Tier 1 capital under the Standardized Approach. The minimum requirement for the supplementary leverage ratio became effective as of January 1, 2018. As an Advanced Approaches banking organization, however, we were required to calculate and publicly disclose our supplementary leverage ratio beginning in the first quarter of 2015.The Market Risk Rule supplements both the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches by requiring institutions subject to the Market Risk Rule to adjust their risk-based capital ratios to reflect the market risk in their trading portfolios. The Market Risk Rule generally applies to institutions with aggregate trading assets and liabilities equal to the lesser of (i) 10% or more of total assets or (ii) $1 billion or more. As of June 30, 2018, the Company and CONA are subject to the Market Risk Rule. See “MD&A—Market Risk Profile” below for additional information.In October 2017, the Federal Banking Agencies proposed certain limited changes to the Basel III Capital Rule. There is uncertainty regarding how any of the proposed changes may impact the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches. Additionally, in December 2017, the Basel Committee finalized certain modifications to the international Basel III capital standards, which would require rulemaking in the United States prior to becoming effective for United States banking organizations. There is uncertainty around which of those changes may be adopted in the United States and how those changes may impact the United States capital framework.  29Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 15 provides a comparison of our regulatory capital ratios under the Basel III Standardized Approach subject to the applicable transition provisions, the regulatory minimum capital adequacy ratios and the PCA well-capitalized level for each ratio, where applicable, as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.Table 15: Capital Ratios under Basel III(1)(2)  June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017  CapitalRatio MinimumCapitalAdequacy Well-Capitalized CapitalRatio MinimumCapitalAdequacy Well-CapitalizedCapital One Financial Corp:            Common equity Tier 1 capital(3) 11.1% 4.5% N/A 10.3% 4.5% N/ATier 1 capital(4) 12.6 6.0 6.0% 11.8 6.0 6.0%Total capital(5) 15.1 8.0 10.0 14.4 8.0 10.0Tier 1 leverage(6) 10.3 4.0 N/A 9.9 4.0 N/ASupplementary leverage(7) 8.8 3.0 N/A 8.4 N/A N/ACOBNA:           Common equity Tier 1 capital(3) 15.2 4.5 6.5 14.3 4.5 6.5Tier 1 capital(4) 15.2 6.0 8.0 14.3 6.0 8.0Total capital(5) 17.6 8.0 10.0 16.9 8.0 10.0Tier 1 leverage(6) 13.6 4.0 5.0 12.7 4.0 5.0Supplementary leverage(7) 11.2 3.0 N/A 10.4 N/A N/ACONA:           Common equity Tier 1 capital(3) 13.4 4.5 6.5 12.2 4.5 6.5Tier 1 capital(4) 13.4 6.0 8.0 12.2 6.0 8.0Total capital(5) 14.6 8.0 10.0 13.4 8.0 10.0Tier 1 leverage(6) 9.2 4.0 5.0 8.6 4.0 5.0Supplementary leverage(7) 8.1 3.0 N/A 7.7 N/A N/A__________(1) Capital ratios are calculated based on the Basel III Standardized Approach framework, subject to applicable transition provisions, such as the inclusion of the unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale included in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) and adjustments related to intangible assets other than goodwill. The inclusion of AOCI and the adjustments related to intangible assets are phased-in at 80% for 2017 and 100% for 2018. Capital requirements that are not applicable are denoted by “N/A.”(2) Ratios as of June 30, 2018 are preliminary. As we continue to validate our data, the calculations are subject to change until we file our June 30, 2018 Form FR Y-9C—Consolidated Financial Statements for Holding Companies and Call Reports.(3) Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on common equity Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets.(4) Tier 1 capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets.(5) Total capital ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on total capital divided by risk-weighted assets.(6) Tier 1 leverage ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average assets.(7) Supplementary leverage ratio is a regulatory capital measure calculated based on Tier 1 capital divided by total leverage exposure.The Company exceeded the minimum capital requirements and each of the Banks exceeded the minimum regulatory requirements and were well capitalized under PCA requirements as of both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.The Basel III Capital Rule requires banks to maintain a capital conservation buffer, composed of common equity Tier 1 capital, of 2.5% above the regulatory minimum ratios. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in over a transition period that commenced on January 1, 2016 and will be fully phased-in on January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer is 1.875% in 2018.For banks subject to the Advanced Approaches, including the Company and the Banks, the capital conservation buffer may be supplemented by an incremental countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% (once fully phased-in) composed of common equity Tier 1 capital and set at the discretion of the Federal Banking Agencies. As of June 30, 2018, the countercyclical capital buffer is zero percent in the United States. A determination to increase the countercyclical capital buffer generally would be effective twelve   30Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contentsmonths after the announcement of such an increase, unless the Federal Banking Agencies set an earlier effective date. The countercyclical capital buffer, if set to an amount greater than zero percent, would be subject to the same transition period as the capital conservation buffer, which commenced on January 1, 2016.For 2018, the minimum capital requirement plus capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer for common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital ratios is 6.375%, 7.875% and 9.875%, respectively, for the Company and the Banks. A common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, or total capital ratio below the applicable regulatory minimum ratio plus the applicable capital conservation buffer and the applicable countercyclical buffer (if set to an amount greater than zero percent) might restrict a bank’s ability to distribute capital and make discretionary bonus payments. As of June 30, 2018, the Company and each of the Banks were all above the applicable combined thresholds.Additionally, banks designated as global systemically important banks (“G-SIBs”) are subject to an additional regulatory capital surcharge above the combined capital conservation and countercyclical capital buffers established by the Basel III Capital Rule. We are currently not designated as a G-SIB and therefore not subject to this surcharge.Under the Basel III Capital Rule, when we complete our parallel run for the Advanced Approaches, our minimum risk-based capital requirement will be determined by the greater of our risk-weighted assets under the Basel III Standardized Approach and the Basel III Advanced Approaches. See “Part I—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation” in our 2017 Form 10-K for additional information. Once we exit parallel run, based on clarification of the Basel III Capital Rule from our regulators, any amount by which our expected credit losses exceed eligible credit reserves, as each term is defined under the Basel III Capital Rule, will be deducted from our Basel III Standardized Approach numerator, subject to transition provisions. Inclusive of this impact, based on current capital rules and our business mix, we estimate that our Basel III Advanced Approaches ratios will be lower than our Basel III Standardized Approach ratios. However, there is uncertainty whether this will remain the case in light of potential changes to the United States capital rules.Capital Planning and Regulatory Stress TestingOn April 5, 2018, we submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve as part of the 2018 CCAR cycle. On June 28, 2018, the Federal Reserve informed us that they had “no objection” to our CCAR 2018 Capital Plan submission. As a result of this non-objection to our capital plan, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.2 billion of shares of our common stock beginning in the third quarter of 2018 through the end of the second quarter of 2019. The Board of Directors also authorized the quarterly dividend on our common stock of $0.40 per share. For the description of the regulatory capital planning rules we are subject to, see “Part I—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation” in our 2017 Form 10-K.Dividend Policy and Stock PurchasesIn the first six months of 2018, we declared and paid common stock dividends of $395 million, or $0.80 per share, and preferred stock dividends of $132 million.The following table summarizes the dividends declared and paid per share on our various preferred stock series in the first six months of 2018.  31Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 16: Preferred Stock Dividends Paid Per Share Series Description Issuance Date Per Annum Dividend Rate Dividend Frequency 2018 2018 Q2 Q1Series B 6.00% Non-Cumulative August 20, 2012 6.00% Quarterly $15.00 $15.00Series C 6.25% Non-Cumulative June 12, 2014 6.25 Quarterly 15.63 15.63Series D 6.70% Non-Cumulative October 31, 2014 6.70 Quarterly 16.75 16.75Series E Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative May 14, 2015 5.55% through 5/31/2020; 3-mo.

As a bank holding company (“BHC”), our ability to pay dividends is largely dependent upon the receipt of dividends or other payments from our subsidiaries. Regulatory restrictions exist that limit the ability of the Banks to transfer funds to our BHC. As of June 30, 2018, funds available for dividend payments from COBNA and CONA were $2.5 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends to stockholders. Consistent with our 2017 Stock Repurchase Program, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.85 billion of shares of common stock beginning in the third quarter of 2017 through the end of the second quarter of 2018. In December 2017, the Board of Directors reduced the authorized repurchases of our common stock to up to $1.0 billion for the remainder of the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program. Through the end of the second quarter of 2018, we repurchased approximately $1.0 billion of shares of our common stock under the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program.The timing and exact amount of any future common stock repurchases will depend on various factors, including regulatory approval, market conditions, opportunities for growth, our capital position and the amount of retained earnings. Our stock repurchase program does not include specific price targets, may be executed through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including utilizing Rule 10b5-1 programs, and may be suspended at any time. For additional information on dividends and stock repurchases, see “Part I—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation—Dividends, Stock Repurchases and Transfer of Funds” in our 2017 Form 10-K.RISK MANAGEMENTRisk FrameworkWe use a risk framework to provide an overall enterprise-wide approach for effectively managing risk. We execute against our risk framework with the “Three Lines of Defense” risk management model to demonstrate and structure the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities in the organization for taking and managing risk. The “First Line of Defense” is comprised of the business areas that through their day-to-day business activities take risk on our behalf. As the business owner, the first line is responsible for identifying, assessing, managing and controlling that risk. This principle places ultimate accountability for the management of risks and ownership of risk decisions with the CEO and business heads. The “Second Line of Defense” provides oversight of first line risk taking and management, and is primarily comprised of our Risk Management organization. The second line assists in determining risk appetite and the strategies, policies and structures for managing risks. The second line is both an “expert advisor” to the first line and an “effective challenger” of first line risk   32Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contentsactivities. The “Third Line of Defense” is comprised of our Internal Audit and Credit Review functions. The third line provides independent and objective assurance to senior management and to the Board of Directors that first and second line risk management and internal control systems and its governance processes are well-designed and working as intended.The risk framework is also used to guide design of risk programs and performance of risk activity within each risk category and across the entire enterprise.There are eight elements that comprise the risk framework:•Establish Governance Processes, Accountabilities and Risk Appetites•Identify and Assess Risks and Ownership•Develop and Operate Controls, Monitoring and Mitigation Plans•Test and Detect Control Gaps and Perform Corrective Action•Escalate Key Risks and Gaps to Executive Management and, when Appropriate, the Board of Directors•Calculate and Allocate Capital in Alignment with Risk Management and Measurement Processes (including Stress Testing)•Support with the Right Culture, Talent and Skills•Enabled by the Right Data, Infrastructure and ProgramsWe provide additional discussion of our risk management principles, roles and responsibilities, framework and risk appetite under “MD&A—Risk Management” in our 2017 Form 10-K.CREDIT RISK PROFILEOur loan portfolio accounts for the substantial majority of our credit risk exposure. Our lending activities are governed under our credit policy and are subject to independent review and approval. Below we provide information about the composition of our loan portfolio, key concentrations and credit performance metrics.We also engage in certain non-lending activities that may give rise to credit and counterparty settlement risk, including the purchase of securities for our investment securities portfolio, entering into derivative transactions to manage our market risk exposure and to accommodate customers, short-term advances on syndication activity (including bridge financing transactions we have underwritten), certain operational cash balances in other financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and customer overdrafts. We provide additional information on credit risk related to our investment securities portfolio under “MD&A—Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis—Investment Securities” and credit risk related to derivative transactions in “Note 9—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”Loans Held for Investment Portfolio CompositionWe provide a variety of lending products. Our primary products include credit cards, auto loans and commercial lending products. In the second quarter of 2018, we sold the substantial majority of our consumer home loan portfolio and the related servicing. We also transferred the remaining portfolio of $398 million to loans held for sale as of June 30, 2018.  For information on our lending policies and procedures, including our underwriting criteria for our primary loan products, see “MD&A—Credit Risk Profile” in our 2017 Form 10-K.Our loan portfolio consists of loans held for investment, including loans held in our consolidated trusts, and loans held for sale. Table 17 presents the composition of our portfolio of loans held for investment by portfolio segment as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Table 17 and the credit metrics presented in this section exclude loans held for sale, which are carried at lower of cost or fair value and totaled $1.5 billion and $971 million as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.  33Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 17: Loans Held for Investment Portfolio Composition  June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017(Dollars in millions) Loans % of Total Loans % of TotalCredit Card:        Domestic credit card $100,714 42.7% $105,293 41.4%International card businesses 9,063 3.8 9,469 3.7Total credit card 109,777 46.5 114,762 45.1Consumer Banking:        Auto 55,781 23.7 53,991 21.2Home loan — — 17,633 6.9Retail banking 2,946 1.2 3,454 1.4Total consumer banking 58,727 24.9 75,078 29.5Commercial Banking:        Commercial and multifamily real estate 28,292 12.0 26,150 10.3Commercial and industrial 38,948 16.5 38,025 14.9Total commercial lending 67,240 28.5 64,175 25.2Small-ticket commercial real estate 369 0.1 400 0.2Total commercial banking 67,609 28.6 64,575 25.4Other loans 11 — 58 —Total loans held for investment $236,124 100.0% $254,473 100.0%Commercial LoansTable 18 summarizes our commercial loans held for investment portfolio by industry classification as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.

Key metrics we track in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming asset rates, as well as net charge-off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger-balance commercial loans. Trends in delinquency rates are one of the primary indicators of credit risk within our consumer loan portfolios, particularly in our credit card loan portfolios, as changes in delinquency rates can provide an early warning of changes in credit losses. The primary indicator of credit risk in our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings. Because we generally classify loans that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming, the level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. In addition to delinquency rates, the geographic distribution of our loans provides insight as to the exposure of the portfolio to regional economic conditions.We underwrite most consumer loans using proprietary models, which are typically based on credit bureau data, including borrower credit scores, along with application information and, where applicable, collateral and deal structure data. We continuously adjust our management of credit lines and collection strategies based on customer behavior and risk profile changes. We also use borrower credit scores for subprime classification, for competitive benchmarking and, in some cases, to drive product segmentation decisions.The following table provides details on the credit scores of our domestic credit card and auto loans held for investment portfolios as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.Table 19: Credit Score Distribution(Percentage of portfolio) June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017Domestic credit card—Refreshed FICO scores:(1)    Greater than 660 68% 66%660 or below 32 34Total 100% 100%Auto—At origination FICO scores:(2)    Greater than 660 50% 51%621-660 19 18620 or below 31 31Total 100% 100%__________(1) Percentages represent period-end loans held for investment in each credit score category. Domestic card credit scores generally represent FICO scores. These scores are obtained from one of the major credit bureaus at origination and are refreshed monthly thereafter. We approximate non-FICO credit scores to comparable FICO scores for consistency purposes. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 660 or below category.(2) Percentages represent period-end loans held for investment in each credit score category. Auto credit scores generally represent average FICO scores obtained from three credit bureaus at the time of application and are not refreshed thereafter. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 620 or below category.We present information in the sections below on the credit performance of our loan portfolio, including the key metrics we use in tracking changes in the credit quality of our loan portfolio.See “Note 4—Loans” in this Report for additional credit quality information and see “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2017 Form 10-K for information on our accounting policies for delinquent and nonperforming loans, net charge-offs and troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) for each of our loan categories.Delinquency RatesWe consider the entire balance of an account to be delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the customer’s due date, measured at each balance sheet date. Our 30+ day delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due, whereas our 30+ day performing delinquency metrics include loans that are 30 or more days past due but are currently classified as performing and accruing interest. The 30+ day delinquency and 30+ day performing delinquency metrics   35Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contentsare the same for domestic credit card loans, as we continue to classify these loans as performing until the account is charged off, typically when the account is 180 days past due.

These loans consist primarily of credit card accounts between 90 days and 179 days past due. As permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, we continue to accrue interest and fees on domestic credit card loans through the date of charge-off, which is typically in the period the account becomes 180 days past due. While domestic credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until the loan is charged off, we reduce the balance of our credit card receivables by the amount of finance charges and fees billed but not expected to be collected and exclude this amount from revenue.Table 22: 90+ Day Delinquent Loans Accruing Interest  June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017(Dollars in millions) Amount Rate(1) Amount Rate(1)Loan category:        Credit card $1,688 1.54% $2,221 1.94%Commercial banking 4 0.01 12 0.02Total $1,692 0.72 $2,233 0.88Geographic region:        Domestic $1,573 0.69 $2,105 0.86International 119 1.31 128 1.35Total $1,692 0.72 $2,233 0.88__________(1) Delinquency rates are calculated by dividing delinquency amounts by period-end loans held for investment for each specified loan category, including PCI loans as applicable.Nonperforming Loans and Nonperforming AssetsNonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, foreclosed properties and repossessed assets, and the net realizable value of certain partially charged off auto loans. Nonperforming loans include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status.

Interest income foregone related to nonperforming loans was $31 million and $34 million in the first six months of 2018 and 2017, respectively. Foregone interest income represents the amount of interest income that would have been recorded during the period for nonperforming loans as of the end of the period had the loans performed according to their contractual terms.(2) Nonperforming loan rates are calculated based on nonperforming loans for each category divided by period-end total loans held for investment for each respective category.(3) Excluding the impact of domestic credit card loans, nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans held for investment was 0.44% and 0.60% as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.(4) The denominators used in calculating nonperforming asset rates consist of total loans held for investment and total other nonperforming assets.  38Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsNet Charge-OffsNet charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine to be uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We charge off loans as a reduction to the allowance for loan and lease losses when we determine the loan is uncollectible and record subsequent recoveries of previously charged-off amounts as increases to the allowance for loan and lease losses. Uncollectible finance charges and fees are reversed through revenue and certain fraud losses are recorded in other non-interest expense. Generally, costs to recover charged-off loans are recorded as collection expenses as incurred and included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest expense. Our charge-off policy for loans varies based on the loan type. See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2017 Form 10-K for information on our charge-off policy for each of our loan categories.Table 24 presents our net charge-off amounts and rates, by portfolio segment, in the second quarter and first six months of 2018 and 2017.Table 24: Net Charge-Offs (Recoveries)  Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,  2018 2017 2018 2017(Dollars in millions) Amount Rate(1) Amount Rate(1) Amount Rate(1) Amount Rate(1)Credit Card:                Domestic credit card $1,166 4.72 % $1,172 5.11 % $2,487 4.99 % $2,368 5.12 %International card businesses 94 4.14 84 4.08 150 3.32 159 3.88Total credit card 1,260 4.67 1,256 5.02 2,637 4.85 2,527 5.02Consumer Banking:                Auto 182 1.32 215 1.70 390 1.42 414 1.67Home loan — — 2 0.04 (1) (0.02) 4 0.03Retail banking 16 2.07 15 1.71 32 1.97 32 1.81Total consumer banking 198 1.19 232 1.25 421 1.19 450 1.22Commercial Banking:                Commercial and multifamily real estate — — 2 0.03 — — 2 0.02Commercial and industrial (7) (0.07) 134 1.34 12 0.06 156 0.78Total commercial lending (7) (0.04) 136 0.81 12 0.04 158 0.47Small-ticket commercial real estate 0 (0.40) 0 (0.22) 0 (0.29) 1 0.43Total commercial banking (7) (0.04) 136 0.80 12 0.04 159 0.47Other loans 8 167.92 (6) (39.95) 7 46.30 (8) (24.27)Total net charge-offs $1,459 2.42 $1,618 2.67 $3,077 2.51 $3,128 2.59Average loans held for investment $240,758   $242,241   $245,218   $241,875  __________(1) Net charge-off (recovery) rate is calculated by dividing annualized net charge-offs (recoveries) by average loans held for investment for the period for each loan category.Troubled Debt RestructuringsAs part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may provide short-term (three to twelve months) or long-term (greater than twelve months) modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to improve long-term collectability of the loan and to avoid the need for foreclosure or repossession of collateral.  39Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsTable 25 presents our recorded investment of loans modified in TDRs as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, which excludes loan modifications that do not meet the definition of a TDR, and PCI loans, which we track and report separately.Table 25: Troubled Debt Restructurings  June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017(Dollars in millions) Amount % of Total Modifications Amount % of Total ModificationsCredit card $835 46.7% $812 36.9%Consumer banking:        Auto 383 21.4 481 21.9Home loan — — 192 8.7Retail banking 36 2.0 37 1.7Total consumer banking 419 23.4 710 32.3Commercial banking 535 29.9 679 30.8Total $1,789 100.0% $2,201 100.0%Status of TDRs:        Performing $1,580 88.3% $1,850 84.1%Nonperforming 209 11.7 351 15.9Total $1,789 100.0% $2,201 100.0%In our Credit Card business, the majority of our credit card loans modified in TDRs involve reducing the interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. The effective interest rate in effect immediately prior to the loan modification is used as the effective interest rate for purposes of measuring impairment using the present value of expected cash flows. If the customer does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement may revert to its original payment terms, generally resulting in any loan outstanding reflected in the appropriate delinquency category, and charged off in accordance with our standard charge-off policy.In our Consumer Banking business, the majority of our loans modified in TDRs receive an extension, an interest rate reduction or principal reduction, or a combination of these concessions. In addition, TDRs also occur in connection with bankruptcy of the borrower. In certain bankruptcy discharges, the loan is written down to the collateral value and the charged off amount is reported as principal reduction. Impairment is determined using the present value of expected cash flows or a collateral evaluation for certain auto and home loans where the collateral value is lower than the recorded investment.In our Commercial Banking business, the majority of loans modified in TDRs receive an extension, with a portion of these loans receiving an interest rate reduction or a gross balance reduction. The impairment on modified commercial loans is generally determined based on the underlying collateral value.We provide additional information on modified loans accounted for as TDRs, including the performance of those loans subsequent to modification, in “Note 4—Loans.”Impaired LoansA loan is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan. Generally, we report loans as impaired based on the method for measuring impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. Loans defined as individually impaired include larger-balance commercial nonperforming loans and TDRs. Loans held for sale are not reported as impaired, as these loans are recorded at lower of cost or fair value. Impaired loans also exclude PCI loans, which are accounted for based on expected cash flows because this accounting methodology takes into consideration future credit losses expected to be incurred.Impaired loans totaled $1.9 billion and $2.4 billion as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. These amounts include TDRs of $1.8 billion and $2.2 billion as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. We provide additional   40Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contentsinformation on our impaired loans, including the allowance for loan and lease losses established for these loans, in “Note 4—Loans” and “Note 5—Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments.”Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending CommitmentsOur allowance for loan and lease losses represents management’s best estimate of incurred loan and lease credit losses inherent to our held for investment portfolio as of each balance sheet date. The allowance for loan and lease losses is increased through the provision for credit losses and reduced by net charge-offs.

The allowance coverage ratio increased by 17 basis points to 3.12% as of June 30, 2018 from December 31, 2017 primarily driven by lower loan balances largely due to the sale of the substantial majority of our consumer home loan portfolio and seasonal paydowns in our domestic credit card loan portfolio, partially offset by allowance releases in our auto and domestic credit card loan portfolios. LIQUIDITY RISK PROFILEWe have established liquidity practices that are intended to ensure that we have sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover our funding requirements and maintain adequate reserves to withstand the potential impact of deposit attrition or diminished liquidity in the funding markets. In addition to our cash position, we maintain reserves in the form of available for sale securities, held to maturity securities and certain loans that are either readily-marketable or pledgeable. Table 28 below presents the composition of our liquidity reserves as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.Table 28: Liquidity Reserves(Dollars in millions) June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017Cash and cash equivalents $12,273 $14,040Investment securities portfolio:    Investment securities available for sale, at fair value 50,691 37,655Investment securities held to maturity, at fair value 33,097 29,437Total investment securities portfolio 83,788 67,092FHLB borrowing capacity secured by loans 11,314 20,927Outstanding FHLB advances and letters of credit secured by loans (467) (9,115)Investment securities encumbered for Public Funds and others (8,048) (8,619)Total liquidity reserves $98,860 $84,325Our liquidity reserves increased by $14.5 billion to $98.9 billion as of June 30, 2018 from December 31, 2017 primarily driven by a decrease in our FHLB advances outstanding as well as an increase in our investment securities portfolio. The increase in our investment securities portfolio and the decrease in our FHLB borrowing capacity secured by loans were primarily due to the sale   44Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contentsof the substantial majority of our consumer home loan portfolio in the second quarter of 2018. See “MD&A—Risk Management” in our 2017 Form 10-K for additional information on our management of liquidity risk.Liquidity Coverage RatioWe are subject to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio Rule (“LCR Rule”) as implemented by the Federal Banking Agencies. The LCR Rule requires us to calculate our LCR daily. Beginning in the second quarter of 2018, we are required to make quarterly public disclosure of our LCR and certain related quantitative liquidity metrics along with a qualitative discussion of our LCR. Our LCR during the second quarter of 2018 exceeded the LCR requirement of 100%. The calculation and the underlying components are based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and are subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. See “Part I—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation” in our 2017 Form 10-K for additional information.Borrowing CapacityWe filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC in March 2018, which expires in March 2021. Under this shelf registration, we may periodically offer and sell an indeterminate aggregate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units. There is no limit under this shelf registration to the amount or number of such securities that we may offer and sell, subject to market conditions. We also filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC in January 2016, which expires in January 2019 and allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $23 billion of securitized debt obligations from our credit card loan securitization trust.In addition to our issuance capacity under the shelf registration statements, we also have access to FHLB advances. As of June 30, 2018, we pledged both loans and securities to FHLB to secure a maximum borrowing capacity of $20.9 billion, of which $20.4 billion was still available to us to borrow. The ability to draw down funding is based on membership status and the amount is dependent upon the Banks’ ability to post collateral. Our FHLB membership is secured by our investment in FHLB stock of $30 million and $360 million as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, which was determined in part based on our outstanding advances. We also have access to the Federal Reserve Discount Window through which we had a borrowing capacity of $6.1 billion as of June 30, 2018. Our membership with the Federal Reserve is secured by our investment in Federal Reserve stock, totaling $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.FundingOur primary source of funding comes from deposits, which provide a stable and relatively low cost of funds. In addition to deposits, the Company raises funding through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations and brokered deposits, as well as federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, and FHLB advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios. A key objective in our use of these markets is to maintain access to a diversified mix of wholesale funding sources. See “MD&A—Consolidated Balance Sheet Analysis—Funding Sources Composition” for additional information on our primary sources of funding.  45Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsDepositsTable 29 provides a comparison of average balances, interest expense and average deposit interest rates for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.Table 29: Deposits Composition and Average Deposits Interest Rates  Three Months Ended June 30,  2018 2017(Dollars in millions) AverageBalance InterestExpense AverageDepositsInterest Rate AverageBalance InterestExpense AverageDepositsInterest RateInterest-bearing checking accounts(1) $40,329 $60 0.60% $45,380 $57 0.50%Saving deposits(2) 150,150 378 1.01 144,883 234 0.65Time deposits less than $100,000 25,604 153 2.40 19,932 76 1.52Total interest-bearing core deposits 216,083 591 1.10 210,195 367 0.70Time deposits of $100,000 or more 6,612 30 1.80 3,721 14 1.46Foreign deposits 384 1 0.38 496 1 0.77Total interest-bearing deposits $223,079 $622 1.12 $214,412 $382 0.71  Six Months Ended June 30,  2018 2017(Dollars in millions) AverageBalance InterestExpense AverageDepositsInterest Rate AverageBalance InterestExpense AverageDepositsInterest RateInterest-bearing checking accounts(1) $41,213 $118 0.58% $45,542 $111 0.49%Saving deposits(2) 148,689 713 0.97 145,188 459 0.63Time deposits less than $100,000 25,450 280 2.22 19,101 139 1.45Total interest-bearing core deposits 215,352 1,111 1.04 209,831 709 0.67Time deposits of $100,000 or more 5,648 49 1.74 3,375 25 1.45Foreign deposits 384 1 0.41 490 1 0.39Total interest-bearing deposits $221,384 $1,161 1.05 $213,696 $735 0.69__________(1) Includes negotiable order of withdrawal accounts.(2) Includes money market deposit accounts.The FDIC limits the acceptance of brokered deposits by well-capitalized insured depository institutions and, with a waiver from the FDIC, by adequately-capitalized institutions.

We provide additional information on the composition of deposits under “MD&A—Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis—Funding Sources Composition” and in “Note 8—Deposits and Borrowings.”Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term DebtWe access the capital markets to meet our funding needs through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations, and federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. In addition, we may utilize short-term and long-term FHLB advances secured by our investment securities, multifamily real estate loans, and commercial real estate loans. Substantially all of our long-term FHLB advances are structured with either a monthly or a quarterly call option at our discretion.  46Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsOur short-term borrowings include those borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less and do not include the current portion of long-term debt. The short-term borrowings, which consist of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, decreased by $23 million to $553 million as of June 30, 2018 from December 31, 2017.Our long-term debt, which primarily consists of securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, and long-term FHLB advances, decreased by $6.9 billion to $52.8 billion as of June 30, 2018 from December 31, 2017, primarily driven by a decrease in our FHLB advances outstanding, partially offset by senior and subordinated notes issuances.

Rating agencies base their ratings on numerous factors, including liquidity, capital adequacy, asset quality, quality of earnings and the probability of systemic support. Significant changes in these factors could result in different ratings.

Below we provide additional information about our primary sources of market risk, our market risk management strategies and the measures we use to evaluate our market risk exposure.Primary Market Risk ExposuresOur primary source of market risk is interest rate risk. We also have exposure to foreign exchange risk and customer-related trading risk, both of which we believe are minimal after considering the impact of our associated risk management activities discussed below.Interest Rate RiskInterest rate risk, which represents exposure to instruments whose yield or price varies with the volatility of interest rates, is our most significant source of market risk exposure. Banks are inevitably exposed to interest rate risk due to differences in the timing between the maturities or re-pricing of assets and liabilities.Foreign Exchange RiskForeign exchange risk represents exposure to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies. Our primary exposure to foreign exchange risk is related to the operations of our international businesses in the U.K. and Canada. The largest foreign exchange exposure arising from these operations is the funding they are provided in the Great British pound (“GBP”) and the Canadian dollar (“CAD”), respectively. We also have foreign exchange exposure through our net equity investments in these operations and through the dollar-denominated value of future earnings and cash flows they generate.Our intercompany funding exposes our consolidated statements of income to foreign exchange transaction risk, while our equity investments in our foreign operations result in translation risk exposure in AOCI and our capital ratios. We manage our transaction risk by entering into forward foreign currency derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to foreign currency-denominated intercompany borrowings. We use foreign currency derivative contracts as net investment hedges to manage our AOCI exposure. We apply hedge accounting to both our intercompany funding hedges and our net investment hedges, with the primary net investments subject to hedging denominated in GBP.We measure our total exposure from non-dollar-denominated intercompany borrowings to our international businesses by regularly tracking the value of the loans made to our foreign operations and the associated forward foreign currency derivative contracts we use to hedge them. We apply a 1% U.S. dollar appreciation shock against these exposures to measure the impact to our consolidated statements of income from foreign exchange transaction risk. The intercompany borrowings to our international businesses were 786 million GBP and 741 million GBP as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, and 6.2 billion CAD and 6.4 billion CAD as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.We measure our total exposure in non-dollar-denominated equity by regularly tracking the value of net equity invested in our foreign operations, the largest of which is in our U.K. and Canadian operations. Our measurement of net equity includes the impact of net investment hedges where applicable. We apply a 30% U.S. dollar appreciation shock against these net investment exposures, which we believe approximates a significant adverse foreign exchange movement over a one-year time horizon. Our gross equity exposures in our U.K. and Canadian operations were 1.6 billion GBP as of both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 and 1.1 billion CAD and 1.0 billion CAD as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.As a result of our derivative management activities, we believe our net exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal.Customer-Related Trading RiskWe offer various interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity derivatives as an accommodation to customers within our Commercial Banking business and offset the majority of our exposures through derivative transactions with other counterparties. These exposures are measured and monitored on a daily basis. As a result of offsetting our customer exposures with other counterparties, we believe our net exposure to customer-related trading risk is minimal.  48Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsWe employ value-at-risk (“VaR”) as the primary method to both measure and monitor the market risk in our customer-related trading activities. VaR is a statistical-based risk measure used to estimate the potential loss from adverse market movements in a normal market environment. We employ a historical simulation approach using the most recent 500 business days and use a 99 percent confidence level and a holding period of one business day. We use internal models to produce a daily VaR measure of the market risk of all customer-related trading exposures.For further information on our customer-related trading exposures, see “Note 9—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”Market Risk ManagementWe employ several techniques to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk, which include, but are not limited to, altering the duration and re-pricing characteristics of our various assets and liabilities and mitigating the foreign exchange exposure of certain non-dollar-denominated equity or transactions. Derivatives are the primary tools that we use for managing interest rate and foreign exchange risk. Use of derivatives is included in our current market risk management policies. We execute our derivative contracts in both over-the-counter and exchange-traded derivative markets and have exposure to both bilateral and clearinghouse counterparties. Although the majority of our derivatives are interest rate swaps, we also use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage both our interest rate and foreign currency risk. The outstanding notional amount of our derivative contracts increased to $220.9 billion as of June 30, 2018 from $196.6 billion as of December 31, 2017 primarily driven by an increase in our hedging activities.Market Risk MeasurementWe have risk management policies and limits established by our market risk management policies and approved by the Board of Directors. Our objective is to manage our asset and liability risk position and exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and prescribed limits based on prevailing market conditions and long-term expectations. Because no single measure can reflect all aspects of market risk, we use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analysis to measure, assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on our non-dollar-denominated earnings and non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations. We provide additional information below in “Economic Value of Equity.”We consider the impact on both net interest income and economic value of equity in measuring and managing our interest rate risk. Due to recent increases in interest rates, we have incorporated a 150 basis points decline scenario into our interest rate sensitivity analysis. We use this 150 basis points decrease as our largest magnitude declining interest rate scenario, since a scenario where interest rates would decline by 200 basis points is unlikely. In scenarios where a 150 basis points decline would result in a rate less than 0%, we assume a rate of 0%. Net Interest Income SensitivityThis sensitivity measure estimates the impact on our projected 12-month baseline interest rate-sensitive revenue resulting from movements in interest rates. Interest rate-sensitive revenue consists of net interest income and certain components of other non-interest income significantly impacted by movements in interest rates, including changes in the fair value of free-standing interest rate swaps. In addition to our existing assets and liabilities, we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions, such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, and plans for projected changes in our funding mix in our baseline forecast. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our projected interest rate-sensitive revenue, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates of +200 basis points, +100 basis points, +50 basis points, -50 basis points, -100 basis points and -150 basis points to spot rates, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above. At the current level of interest rates, our net interest income remains largely unchanged in most scenarios and decreases moderately in the -150 basis points scenario.Economic Value of EquityOur economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact on the net present value of our assets and liabilities, including derivative hedging activity, resulting from movements in interest rates. Our economic value of equity sensitivity measures are calculated based on our existing assets and liabilities, including derivatives, and do not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected plans for funding mix changes. In measuring the sensitivity of interest rate movements on our economic value of equity, we assume a hypothetical instantaneous parallel shift in the level of interest rates of +200 basis points, +100 basis points,   49Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of Contents+50 basis points, -50 basis points, -100 basis points and -150 basis points to spot rates, with the lower rate scenario limited to zero as described above.Calculating our economic value of equity and its sensitivity to interest rates requires projecting cash flows for assets, liabilities and derivative instruments and discounting those cash flows at the appropriate discount rates. Key assumptions in our economic value of equity calculation include projecting rate sensitive prepayments for mortgage securities, loans and other assets, term structure modeling of interest rates, discount spreads, and deposit volume and pricing assumptions.Our current economic value of equity sensitivity profile demonstrates that our economic value of equity generally decreases as interest rates increase indicating that the economic value of our assets and derivative positions is more sensitive to interest rate changes than our liabilities.Table 32 shows the estimated percentage impact on our projected baseline net interest income and economic value of equity calculated under the methodology described above as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.Table 32: Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis  June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017Estimated impact on projected baseline net interest income:    +200 basis points 0.0 % (0.8)%+100 basis points (0.3) (0.3)+50 basis points (0.2) 0.0–50 basis points 0.1 (0.3)–100 basis points (0.2) (1.3)–150 basis points (1.0) N/AEstimated impact on economic value of equity:    +200 basis points (8.5) (7.5)+100 basis points (3.9) (3.1)+50 basis points (1.8) (1.2)–50 basis points 1.0 0.1–100 basis points 1.0 (1.5)–150 basis points (0.6) N/AIn addition to these industry standard measures, we will continue to factor into our internal interest rate risk management decisions, the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios, such as stressed rate shocks, as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios.Limitations of Market Risk MeasuresThe interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information, internally-developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies, which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments. Other market inputs, such as interest rates, market prices and interest rate volatility, are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures. We regularly evaluate, update and enhance these assumptions, models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities.There are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. The sensitivity analysis described above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is performed at a particular point in time based on the existing balance sheet and, in some cases, expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions.

We are continuing to analyze the CCPA in order to determine its applicability and impact to our business.United KingdomThe U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) final rules and remedies on the Credit Card Market Study were published on March 1, 2018 and must be implemented by September 1, 2018. Under the FCA’s new “persistent debt” rules, firms are required to intervene in relation to those customers whose payments over the immediately preceding 18 months comprise a lower amount in principal than in interest, fees and charges. The final intervention, which is made at 36 months, may require Capital One (Europe) plc (“COEP”) to suspend customers’ use of the card or in some cases show customers forbearance, which may include reduction or cancellation of interest, fees or charges.

We consider these metrics to be key financial performance measures that management uses in assessing capital adequacy and the level of returns generated. While these non-GAAP measures are widely used by investors, analysts and bank regulatory agencies to assess the capital position of financial services companies, our measures may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. These non-GAAP measures are individually identified and calculations are explained in footnotes below the table.

POLICIESThe CompanyCapital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware Corporation established in 1994 and headquartered in McLean, Virginia, is a diversified financial services holding company with banking and non-banking subsidiaries. Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through branches, the internet and other distribution channels. As of June 30, 2018, our principal subsidiaries included:•Capital One Bank (USA), National Association (“COBNA”), which offers credit and debit card products, other lending products and deposit products; and•Capital One, National Association (“CONA”), which offers a broad spectrum of banking products and financial services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients.The Company is hereafter collectively referred to as “we,” “us” or “our.” COBNA and CONA are collectively referred to as the “Banks.”We also offer products outside of the United States of America (“U.S.”) principally through Capital One (Europe) plc (“COEP”), an indirect subsidiary of COBNA organized and located in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), and through a branch of COBNA in Canada. COEP has authority, among other things, to provide credit card loans. Our branch of COBNA in Canada also has the authority to provide credit card loans.Our principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into three major business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the type of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. We provide details on our business segments, the integration of recent acquisitions, if any, into our business segments and the allocation methodologies and accounting policies used to derive our business segment results in “Note 13—Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers.”Basis of Presentation and Use of EstimatesThe accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and in the related disclosures. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. While management makes its best judgments, actual amounts or results could differ from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included for a fair statement of this interim financial information. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements, and related notes thereto, included in Capital One Financial Corporation’s 2017 Annual Report on Form 10-K (“2017 Form 10-K”).  67Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNewly Adopted Accounting StandardsAccounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs ActIn March 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2018-05, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. This ASU codifies into existing U.S. GAAP the SEC Staff views expressed in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This guidance addresses situations where an entity’s accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act is incomplete upon issuance of the entity’s financial statements for the reporting period in which the Tax Act was enacted. In accordance with this guidance, we included certain provisional amounts for these effects in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017. See “MD&A—Accounting Changes and Developments” in our 2017 Form 10-K for more information. We continue to assess information relating to such provisional amounts including regulatory guidance, repatriation tax impacts to other jurisdictions, and other information. We expect to finalize our assessment and record any required adjustments to provisional amounts by December 2018. We did not have any significant measurement period adjustments in the three or six months ended June 30, 2018.Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive IncomeIn February 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. U.S. GAAP requires the effects of changes in tax rates and laws on deferred tax balances to be recorded in income tax from continuing operations in the period of enactment. This requirement applies even in situations in which the related income tax effects of items in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) were originally recognized in other comprehensive income (rather than in income from continuing operations), which results in certain tax effects being stranded in AOCI. This ASU allows a one-time reclassification from AOCI to retained earnings for stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Act. Additionally, this ASU requires entities to disclose their accounting policy for releasing stranded tax effects from AOCI, for which ours is to release the effects using a portfolio approach. This ASU provides entities the option to apply the guidance retrospectively or in the period of adoption. We early adopted this ASU in the first quarter of 2018, resulting in a decrease to AOCI and an increase to retained earnings of $173 million. Our reclassification included the effects of the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate enacted by the Tax Act and the resulting impacts on the federal benefit of deducting state income taxes.Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging ActivitiesIn August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging Activities. This ASU amends hedge accounting guidance to better align hedge accounting with risk management activities, while reducing the complexity of applying and reporting on hedge accounting. Under this ASU, the concept of separately measuring and reporting hedge ineffectiveness has been eliminated and entities are required to present the earnings effect of the hedging instrument in the same income statement line item in which the earnings effect of the hedged item is reported. In addition, for a closed pool of pre-payable financial assets, entities will be able to hedge an amount that is not expected to be affected by prepayments, defaults and other events under the “last-of-layer” method. The guidance permits a one-time reclassification of debt securities eligible to be hedged under the “last-of-layer” method from held to maturity to available for sale upon adoption.We early adopted this ASU in the first quarter of 2018 under the prescribed modified retrospective transition method. As permitted by this ASU, and in order to optimize the investment portfolio management for capital and risk management considerations, we made a one-time election to transfer $9.0 billion of held to maturity securities eligible to be hedged under the “last-of-layer” method to the available for sale category, resulting in an increase to AOCI of $107 million. See “Note 3—Investment Securities” and “Note 9—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” for additional information on the impacts of the transfer, as well as the disclosures required under the new guidance.Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash PaymentsIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This ASU clarifies certain issues related to classification within the statement of cash flows with the objective of reducing existing diversity in practice. We adopted this ASU in the first quarter of 2018 under the retrospective transition method and our adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  68Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSRecognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. The primary impact of this ASU to us is the requirement to measure equity investments at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through net income, except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that do not have a readily determinable fair value (for which a measurement alternative can be elected). We adopted this ASU in the first quarter of 2018 under the modified retrospective method and our adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.Revenue from Contracts with CustomersIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Topic 606 was amended through subsequent accounting standard updates that resulted in technical corrections, improvements and a one-year deferral of the effective date to January 1, 2018. Topic 606, as amended, is applicable to all entities and replaced significant portions of existing industry and transaction-specific revenue recognition rules with a more principles-based recognition model. Entities were given an option to apply either a full or modified retrospective method of adoption. Most revenue associated with financial instruments, including interest income, loan origination fees and credit card fees, is outside the scope of the guidance. Gains and losses on investment securities, derivatives and sales of financial instruments are similarly excluded from the scope. We determined interchange fees earned on credit and debit card transactions, net of any related customer rewards, are in the scope of the amended guidance. We assessed the impact of the new guidance by evaluating our contracts, identifying our performance obligations, determining when the performance obligations were satisfied to allow us to recognize revenue and determining the amount of revenue to recognize. As a result of this analysis, we determined our recognition, measurement and presentation of interchange fees net of customer rewards costs will not change. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2018 under the modified retrospective transition method and our adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See “Note 13—Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers” for the new disclosures required under this guidance.Recently Issued but Not Yet Adopted Accounting StandardsPremium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt SecuritiesIn March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-08, Receivables—Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities. This ASU shortens the amortization period to the earliest call date for certain purchased callable debt securities held at a premium. There is no change for accounting for securities held at a discount. Under the existing guidance, the premium is generally amortized as an adjustment to interest income over the contractual life of the debt security. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. This guidance is effective for us on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted, using the modified retrospective method of adoption. We plan to adopt the standard on its effective date.Simplifying the Test for Goodwill ImpairmentIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment. The guidance in this ASU is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of testing goodwill for impairment by eliminating the second step from the current goodwill impairment test. Under the existing guidance, the first step compares a reporting unit’s carrying value to its fair value. If the carrying value exceeds fair value, an entity performs the second step, which assigns the reporting unit’s fair value to its assets and liabilities, including unrecognized assets and liabilities, in the same manner as required in purchase accounting. Under the new guidance, any impairment of a reporting unit’s goodwill is determined based on the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. This guidance is effective for us on January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted, using the prospective method of adoption. We are currently evaluating the overall impact of early adopting this ASU.  69Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial InstrumentsIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU requires an impairment model (known as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model) that is based on expected rather than incurred losses, with an anticipated result of more timely loss recognition. The CECL model is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost, net investments in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income and certain off-balance sheet arrangements. The CECL model will replace our current accounting for purchased credit-impaired (“PCI”) and impaired loans. This ASU also amends the available for sale (“AFS”) debt securities other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) model. Credit losses (and subsequent recoveries) on AFS debt securities will be recorded through an allowance approach, rather than the current U.S. GAAP practice of permanent write-downs for credit losses and accreting positive changes through interest income over time.This guidance is effective for us on January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted no earlier than January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective method of adoption. We plan to adopt the standard on its effective date. We have established a company-wide, cross-functional governance structure for our implementation of this standard. We are in the process of determining key accounting interpretations, data requirements and necessary changes to our credit loss estimation methods, processes and systems. We continue to assess the potential impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Due to the significant differences in the revised guidance from existing U.S. GAAP, the implementation of this guidance may result in increases to our reserves for credit losses on financial instruments.LeasesIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This ASU requires lessees to recognize right of use assets and lease liabilities on their consolidated balance sheets and disclose key information about all their leasing arrangements, with certain practical expedients. This guidance is effective for us on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted, using the modified retrospective method of adoption. We plan to adopt the standard on the effective date. We are currently in the process of reviewing lease contracts, reviewing other contracts for potential embedded leases, implementing a new lease accounting and administration software solution, establishing new processes and internal controls and evaluating the impact of various accounting policy elections. Upon adoption, we expect to record a right of use asset and a corresponding lease liability for our operating leases where we are the lessee. The potential impact on our consolidated financial statements is largely based on the present value of future minimum lease payments, the amount of which will depend upon the population of leases in effect at the date of adoption. Future minimum lease payments totaled $2.7 billion as of December 31, 2017, as disclosed in “Note 8—Premises, Equipment and Lease Commitments” of our 2017 Form 10-K. We do not expect material changes to the recognition of operating lease expense in our consolidated statements of income.  70Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE 2—BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONSBusiness DevelopmentsConsumer Home Loan Portfolio SaleIn the second quarter of 2018, we sold the substantial majority of our consumer home loan portfolio and the related servicing. We also transferred the remaining portfolio of $398 million to loans held for sale as of June 30, 2018. These actions resulted in a net gain of $400 million, including a benefit for credit losses of $46 million, which is reflected in the Other category. Restructuring ActivitiesWe periodically initiate restructuring activities to support business strategies and enhance our overall operational efficiency. These restructuring activities have primarily consisted of exiting certain business locations and activities as well as the realignment of resources supporting various businesses, including the decisions within our Consumer Banking business to cease new originations of home loan lending products in the fourth quarter of 2017, to sell our online retail brokerage business in the first quarter of 2018 and to sell the substantial majority of our consumer home loan portfolio in the second quarter of 2018. The charges incurred as a result of these restructuring activities have primarily consisted of severance and related benefits pursuant to our ongoing benefit programs, which are included in salaries and associate benefits within non-interest expense in our consolidated statements of income, as well as impairment of certain assets related to business locations and activities being exited, which are generally included in occupancy and equipment within non-interest expense.For the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, we recognized restructuring charges of $15 million and $34 million, respectively, which are reflected in the Other category of our business segment results. We had a liability of $41 million associated with restructuring activities, which is recorded in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2018. There were no significant restructuring charges incurred for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. As of June 30, 2018, our online retail brokerage business had liabilities held for sale primarily consisting of customer deposits of $1.7 billion. When the transaction closes, we will transfer these customer deposits and an equal cash amount to the third-party purchaser.Discontinued OperationsOur discontinued operations consist of the mortgage origination operations of our wholesale mortgage banking unit, GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, Inc. (“GreenPoint”) and the manufactured housing operations of GreenPoint Credit, LLC, a subsidiary of GreenPoint, both of which were acquired as part of the North Fork Bancorporation, Inc. (“North Fork”) acquisition in December 2006. Although the manufactured housing operations were sold to a third party in 2004 prior to our acquisition of North Fork, we acquired certain retained interests and obligations related to those operations as part of the acquisition. Separately, in the third quarter of 2007 we closed the mortgage origination operations of the wholesale mortgage banking unit. The results of both the wholesale banking unit and the manufactured housing operations have been accounted for as discontinued operations and are reported as income or loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, on the consolidated statements of income. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $11 million for both the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017. As of June 30, 2018, we had no significant continuing involvement in the operations of our wholesale mortgage banking unit.In the fourth quarter of 2017, we entered into an agreement with the third-party servicer under which we assumed the obligation to exercise the remaining clean-up calls as they become due on certain manufactured housing securitization transactions. See “Note 6—Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations” and “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others” for information associated with GreenPoint Credit, LLC manufactured housing operations and our mortgage representation and warranty exposure.  71Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE 3—INVESTMENT SECURITIESOur investment securities portfolio consists primarily of the following: U.S. Treasury securities; U.S. government-sponsored enterprise or agency (“Agency”) and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”); Agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”); other asset-backed securities (“ABS”); and other securities. Agency securities include Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) guaranteed securities, Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) issued securities.

Because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay certain obligations, the expected maturities of our securities are likely to differ from the scheduled contractual maturities presented below. The weighted-average yield below represents the effective yield for the investment securities and is calculated based on the amortized cost of each security.Table 3.5: Contractual Maturities and Weighted-Average Yields of Securities  June 30, 2018(Dollars in millions) Due in 1 Year or Less Due > 1 Yearthrough5 Years Due > 5 Yearsthrough10 Years Due > 10 Years TotalFair value of securities available for sale:U.S. Treasury securities $199 $1,122 $7,303 $0 $8,624RMBS(1):          Agency 3 32 546 33,161 33,742Non-agency 0 0 0 1,940 1,940Total RMBS 3 32 546 35,101 35,682Agency CMBS(1) 17 1,875 1,289 1,582 4,763Other ABS(1) 30 238 0 26 294Other securities 197 594 537 0 1,328Total securities available for sale $446 $3,861 $9,675 $36,709 $50,691Amortized cost of securities available for sale $447 $3,901 $9,660 $37,513 $51,521Weighted-average yield for securities available for sale 1.25% 2.16% 2.26% 2.77% 2.61%Carrying value of securities held to maturity:Agency RMBS(1) $0 $0 $55 $30,322 $30,377Agency CMBS(1) 0 0 288 2,799 3,087Total securities held to maturity $0 $0 $343 $33,121 $33,464Fair value of securities held to maturity $0 $0 $341 $32,756 $33,097Weighted-average yield for securities held to maturity 0.00% 0.00% 3.19% 3.28% 3.28%__________(1) As of June 30, 2018, weighted-average expected maturities of RMBS, CMBS and other ABS are 6.7 years, 5.5 years and 1.1 years, respectively.Other-Than-Temporary ImpairmentWe evaluate all securities in an unrealized loss position at least on a quarterly basis, and more often as market conditions require, to assess whether the impairment is other-than-temporary. Our OTTI assessment is based on a discounted cash flow analysis which requires careful use of judgments and assumptions. A number of qualitative and quantitative criteria may be considered in our assessment as applicable, including the size and the nature of the portfolio; historical and projected performance such as prepayment, default and loss severity for the RMBS portfolio; recent credit events specific to the issuer and/or industry to which the issuer belongs; the payment structure of the security; external credit ratings of the issuer and any failure or delay of the issuer to make scheduled interest or principal payments; the value of underlying collateral; our intent and ability to hold the security; and current and projected market and macro-economic conditions.If we intend to sell a security in an unrealized loss position or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, the entire difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and its fair value is recognized in earnings. As of June 30, 2018, for any securities with unrealized losses recorded in AOCI, we do not intend to sell, nor believe that we will be required to sell, these securities prior to recovery of their amortized cost.  75Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFor those securities that we do not intend to sell nor expect to be required to sell, an analysis is performed to determine if any of the impairment is due to credit-related factors or whether it is due to other factors, such as interest rates. Credit-related impairment is recognized in earnings, with the remaining unrealized non-credit-related impairment recorded in AOCI. We determine the credit component based on the difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected cash flows, discounted based on the effective yield.Realized Gains and Losses on Securities and OTTI Recognized in EarningsThe following table presents the gross realized gains and losses on the sale and redemption of securities available for sale for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.

We also pledge securities to secure trust and public deposits and for other purposes as required or permitted by law. We pledged securities available for sale with a fair value of $2.9 billion and $2.8 billion as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. We also pledged securities held to maturity with a carrying value of $15.1 billion and $5.7 billion as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. We accepted pledges of securities with a fair value of $1 million as of both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, primarily related to our derivative transactions.Purchased Credit-Impaired Debt SecuritiesThe table below presents the outstanding balance and carrying value of the purchased credit-impaired debt securities as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.Table 3.7: Outstanding Balance and Carrying Value of Purchased Credit-Impaired Debt Securities(Dollars in millions) June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017Outstanding balance $1,942 $2,131Carrying value 1,709 1,843  76Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSChanges in Accretable Yield of Purchased Credit-Impaired Debt SecuritiesThe following table presents changes in the accretable yield related to the purchased credit-impaired debt securities for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018.Table 3.8: Changes in the Accretable Yield of Purchased Credit-Impaired Debt Securities(Dollars in millions) Three Months Ended June 30, 2018 Six Months Ended June 30, 2018Accretable yield, beginning of period $794 $826Accretion recognized in earnings (39) (78)Reduction due to payoffs, disposals, transfers and other (2) (3)Net reclassifications from nonaccretable difference 15 23Accretable yield, end of period $768 $768  77Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE 4—LOANSLoan Portfolio CompositionOur loan portfolio consists of loans held for investment, including loans held in our consolidated trusts, and loans held for sale, and is divided into three portfolio segments: credit card, consumer banking and commercial banking. Credit card loans consist of domestic and international credit card loans. Consumer banking loans consist of auto and retail banking loans and in prior periods also consisted of home loans. Commercial banking loans consist of commercial and multifamily real estate, commercial and industrial, and small-ticket commercial real estate loans. In the second quarter of 2018, we sold the substantial majority of our consumer home loan portfolio and the related servicing. We also transferred the remaining portfolio of $398 million to loans held for sale as of June 30, 2018. Credit QualityWe closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to manage and evaluate our exposure to credit risk. Trends in delinquency rates are an indicator, among other considerations, of credit risk within our loan portfolio. The level of nonperforming loans represents another indicator of the potential for future credit losses. Accordingly, key metrics we track and use in evaluating the credit quality of our loan portfolio include delinquency and nonperforming loan rates, as well as net charge-off rates and our internal risk ratings of larger-balance commercial loans. The credit metrics presented in this section exclude loans held for sale, which are carried at lower of cost or fair value.The table below presents the composition and an aging analysis of our loans held for investment portfolio as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The delinquency aging includes all past due loans, both performing and nonperforming.Table 4.1: Loan Portfolio Composition and Aging Analysis  June 30, 2018(Dollars in millions) Current 30-59Days 60-89Days > 90Days TotalDelinquentLoans PCILoans TotalLoansCredit Card:              Domestic credit card $97,373 $1,067 $705 $1,569 $3,341 $0 $100,714International card businesses 8,743 127 69 124 320 0 9,063Total credit card 106,116 1,194 774 1,693 3,661 0 109,777Consumer Banking:              Auto 52,419 2,144 988 230 3,362 0 55,781Retail banking 2,898 25 7 11 43 5 2,946Total consumer banking 55,317 2,169 995 241 3,405 5 58,727Commercial Banking:              Commercial and multifamily real estate 28,259 6 1 3 10 23 28,292Commercial and industrial 38,480 15 0 107 122 346 38,948Total commercial lending 66,739 21 1 110 132 369 67,240Small-ticket commercial real estate 364 2 0 3 5 0 369Total commercial banking 67,103 23 1 113 137 369 67,609Other loans 11 0 0 0 0 0 11Total loans(1) $228,547 $3,386 $1,770 $2,047 $7,203 $374 $236,124% of Total loans 96.79% 1.43% 0.75% 0.87% 3.05% 0.16% 100.00%  78Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  December 31, 2017(Dollars in millions) Current 30-59Days 60-89Days > 90Days TotalDelinquentLoans PCI Loans TotalLoansCredit Card:              Domestic credit card $101,072 $1,211 $915 $2,093 $4,219 $2 $105,293International card businesses 9,110 144 81 134 359 0 9,469Total credit card 110,182 1,355 996 2,227 4,578 2 114,762Consumer Banking:              Auto 50,151 2,483 1,060 297 3,840 0 53,991Home loan 7,235 37 16 70 123 10,275 17,633Retail banking 3,389 24 5 18 47 18 3,454Total consumer banking 60,775 2,544 1,081 385 4,010 10,293 75,078Commercial Banking:              Commercial and multifamily real estate 26,018 41 17 49 107 25 26,150Commercial and industrial 37,412 1 70 87 158 455 38,025Total commercial lending 63,430 42 87 136 265 480 64,175Small-ticket commercial real estate 393 2 1 4 7 0 400Total commercial banking 63,823 44 88 140 272 480 64,575Other loans 54 2 1 1 4 0 58Total loans(1) $234,834 $3,945 $2,166 $2,753 $8,864 $10,775 $254,473% of Total loans 92.29% 1.55% 0.85% 1.08% 3.48% 4.23% 100.00%__________(1) Loans, other than PCI loans, include unamortized premiums and discounts, and unamortized deferred fees and costs totaling $782 million and $773 million as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.We pledged loan collateral of $16.9 billion and $27.3 billion to secure a portion of our FHLB borrowing capacity of $20.9 billion and $21.0 billion as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.The following table presents the outstanding balance of loans 90 days or more past due that continue to accrue interest and loans classified as nonperforming as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.

We therefore generally manage credit risk based on portfolios with common risk characteristics. The risk in our credit card loan portfolio correlates to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates and home values, as well as consumers’ financial condition, all of which can have a material effect on credit performance. The primary indicators we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our credit card portfolio are delinquency and charge-off trends, including an analysis of loan migration between delinquency categories over time.The table below displays the geographic profile of our credit card loan portfolio as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.Table 4.3: Credit Card Risk Profile by Geographic Region  June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017(Dollars in millions) Amount % ofTotal Amount % ofTotalDomestic credit card:        California $10,948 10.0% $11,475 10.0%Texas 7,589 6.9 7,847 6.8New York 6,981 6.4 7,389 6.4Florida 6,518 5.9 6,790 5.9Illinois 4,494 4.1 4,734 4.1Pennsylvania 4,294 3.9 4,550 4.0Ohio 3,706 3.4 3,929 3.4New Jersey 3,427 3.1 3,621 3.2Michigan 3,348 3.0 3,523 3.1Other 49,409 45.0 51,435 44.8Total domestic credit card 100,714 91.7 105,293 91.7International card businesses:        Canada 5,967 5.5 6,286 5.5United Kingdom 3,096 2.8 3,183 2.8Total international card businesses 9,063 8.3 9,469 8.3Total credit card $109,777 100.0% $114,762 100.0%  80Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe table below presents net charge-offs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.Table 4.4: Credit Card Net Charge-Offs  Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,  2018 2017 2018 2017(Dollars in millions) Amount Rate(1) Amount Rate(1) Amount Rate(1) Amount Rate(1)Net charge-offs:(1)                Domestic credit card $1,166 4.72% $1,172 5.11% $2,487 4.99% $2,368 5.12%International card businesses 94 4.14 84 4.08 150 3.32 159 3.88Total credit card $1,260 4.67 $1,256 5.02 $2,637 4.85 $2,527 5.02__________(1) Net charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine to be uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. Net charge-off rate is calculated by dividing annualized net charge-offs by average loans held for investment for the period for each loan category. Net charge-offs and net charge-off rate are impacted periodically by fluctuations in recoveries, including loan sales.Consumer BankingOur consumer banking loan portfolio consists of auto and retail banking loans and in prior periods also consisted of home loans. Similar to our credit card loan portfolio, the risk in our consumer banking loan portfolio correlates to broad economic trends, such as unemployment rates, gross domestic product and home values, as well as consumers’ financial condition, all of which can have a material effect on credit performance. Delinquency, nonperforming loans and charge-off trends are key indicators we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our consumer banking loan portfolio.  81Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe table below displays the geographic profile of our consumer banking loan portfolio as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.Table 4.5: Consumer Banking Risk Profile by Geographic Region   June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017(Dollars in millions) Amount % of Total Amount % ofTotalAuto:        Texas $7,197 12.3% $7,040 9.4%California 6,276 10.7 6,099 8.1Florida 4,599 7.8 4,486 6.0Georgia 2,727 4.6 2,726 3.6Ohio 2,449 4.2 2,318 3.1Louisiana 2,225 3.8 2,236 3.0Illinois 2,182 3.7 2,181 2.9Other 28,126 47.9 26,905 35.8Total auto 55,781 95.0 53,991 71.9Retail banking:        New York 875 1.5 955 1.3Louisiana 807 1.4 953 1.3Texas 655 1.1 717 0.9New Jersey 201 0.3 221 0.3Maryland 163 0.3 187 0.2Virginia 135 0.2 154 0.2Other 110 0.2 267 0.4Total retail banking 2,946 5.0 3,454 4.6Total home loan 0 0.0 17,633 23.5Total consumer banking $58,727 100.0% $75,078 100.0%In the second quarter of 2018, we sold the substantial majority of our consumer home loan portfolio and the related servicing.

We assign internal risk ratings to loans based on relevant information about the ability of the borrowers to repay their debt. In determining the risk rating of a particular loan, some of the factors considered are the borrower’s current financial condition, historical and projected future credit performance, prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors, the estimated realizable value of any collateral and current economic trends. The scale based on our internal risk rating system is as follows:•Noncriticized: Loans that have not been designated as criticized, frequently referred to as “pass” loans.•Criticized performing: Loans in which the financial condition of the obligor is stressed, affecting earnings, cash flows or collateral values. The borrower currently has adequate capacity to meet near-term obligations; however, the stress, left unabated, may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects at some future date.•Criticized nonperforming: Loans that are not adequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as criticized nonperforming have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, which jeopardize the full repayment of the debt. These loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain a credit loss if the deficiencies are not corrected and are generally placed on nonaccrual status.We use our internal risk rating system for regulatory reporting, determining the frequency of credit exposure reviews, and evaluating and determining the allowance for loan and lease losses for commercial loans. Generally, loans that are designated as criticized performing and criticized nonperforming are reviewed quarterly by management to determine if they are appropriately classified/rated and whether any impairment exists. Noncriticized loans are also generally reviewed, at least annually, to determine the appropriate risk rating. In addition, we evaluate the risk rating during the renewal process of any loan or if a loan becomes past due.  83Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe following table presents the geographic concentration and internal risk ratings of our commercial loan portfolio as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.Table 4.7: Commercial Banking Risk Profile by Geographic Region and Internal Risk Rating  June 30, 2018(Dollars in millions) CommercialandMultifamilyReal Estate % ofTotal CommercialandIndustrial % ofTotal Small-TicketCommercialReal Estate % ofTotal TotalCommercial Banking % ofTotalGeographic concentration:(1)                Northeast $16,367 57.8% $7,422 19.1% $229 62.1% $24,018 35.6%Mid-Atlantic 3,003 10.6 4,291 11.0 13 3.5 7,307 10.8South 3,641 12.9 14,544 37.3 21 5.7 18,206 26.9Other 5,281 18.7 12,691 32.6 106 28.7 18,078 26.7Total $28,292 100.0% $38,948 100.0% $369 100.0% $67,609 100.0%Internal risk rating:(2)                Noncriticized $27,707 97.9% $36,852 94.6% $364 98.6% $64,923 96.1%Criticized performing 558 2.0 1,529 3.9 1 0.3 2,088 3.1Criticized nonperforming 4 0.0 221 0.6 4 1.1 229 0.3PCI loans 23 0.1 346 0.9 0 0.0 369 0.5Total $28,292 100.0% $38,948 100.0% $369 100.0% $67,609 100.0%  December 31, 2017(Dollars in millions) CommercialandMultifamilyReal Estate % ofTotal CommercialandIndustrial % ofTotal Small-TicketCommercialReal Estate % ofTotal TotalCommercial Banking % ofTotalGeographic concentration:(1)                Northeast $14,969 57.3% $7,774 20.4% $250 62.4% $22,993 35.7%Mid-Atlantic 2,675 10.2 3,922 10.3 15 3.8 6,612 10.2South 3,719 14.2 14,739 38.8 22 5.5 18,480 28.6Other 4,787 18.3 11,590 30.5 113 28.3 16,490 25.5Total $26,150 100.0% $38,025 100.0% $400 100.0% $64,575 100.0%Internal risk rating:(2)                Noncriticized $25,609 98.0% $35,161 92.5% $392 97.9% $61,162 94.7%Criticized performing 478 1.8 2,170 5.7 1 0.3 2,649 4.1Criticized nonperforming 38 0.1 239 0.6 7 1.8 284 0.4PCI loans 25 0.1 455 1.2 0 0.0 480 0.8Total $26,150 100.0% $38,025 100.0% $400 100.0% $64,575 100.0%__________(1) Geographic concentration is generally determined by the location of the borrower’s business or the location of the collateral associated with the loan.

See “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in our 2017 Form 10-K for further discussion of the methodology and policy for determining our allowance for loan and lease losses for each of our loan portfolio segments, as well as information on our reserve for unfunded lending commitments.Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments ActivityThe table below summarizes changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments by portfolio segment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.Table 5.1: Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments Activity  Three Months Ended June 30, 2018(Dollars in millions) Credit Card ConsumerBanking(1) Commercial Banking Other(1) TotalAllowance for loan and lease losses:          Balance as of March 31, 2018 $5,726 $1,253 $587 $1 $7,567Charge-offs (1,679) (414) (7) (9) (2,109)Recoveries 419 216 14 1 650Net charge-offs (1,260) (198) 7 (8) (1,459)Provision (benefit) for loan and lease losses 1,171 119 30 (47) 1,273Allowance build (release) for loan and lease losses (89) (79) 37 (55) (186)Other changes(1)(2) (13) (54) 0 54 (13)Balance as of June 30, 2018 5,624 1,120 624 0 7,368Reserve for unfunded lending commitments:          Balance as of March 31, 2018 0 6 108 0 114Provision (benefit) for losses on unfunded lending commitments 0 (1) 4 0 3Balance as of June 30, 2018 0 5 112 0 117Combined allowance and reserve as of June 30, 2018 $5,624 $1,125 $736 $0 $7,485  Six Months Ended June 30, 2018(Dollars in millions) Credit Card ConsumerBanking(1) Commercial Banking Other(1) TotalAllowance for loan and lease losses:          Balance as of December 31, 2017 $5,648 $1,242 $611 $1 $7,502Charge-offs (3,504) (845) (28) (8) (4,385)Recoveries 867 424 16 1 1,308Net charge-offs (2,637) (421) (12) (7) (3,077)Provision (benefit) for loan and lease losses 2,627 353 25 (48) 2,957Allowance build (release) for loan and lease losses (10) (68) 13 (55) (120)Other changes(1)(2) (14) (54) 0 54 (14)Balance as of June 30, 2018 5,624 1,120 624 0 7,368Reserve for unfunded lending commitments:          Balance as of December 31, 2017 0 7 117 0 124Benefit for losses on unfunded lending commitments 0 (2) (5) 0 (7)Balance as of June 30, 2018 0 5 112 0 117Combined allowance and reserve as of June 30, 2018 $5,624 $1,125 $736 $0 $7,485  91Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Three Months Ended June 30, 2017(Dollars in millions) Credit Card ConsumerBanking Commercial Banking Other(3) TotalAllowance for loan and lease losses:          Balance as of March 31, 2017 $5,058 $1,163 $761 $2 $6,984Charge-offs (1,572) (390) (140) 0 (2,102)Recoveries 316 158 4 6 484Net charge-offs (1,256) (232) (136) 6 (1,618)Provision (benefit) for loan and lease losses 1,397 268 141 (5) 1,801Allowance build (release) for loan and lease losses 141 36 5 1 183Other changes(2) 11 0 (8) 0 3Balance as of June 30, 2017 5,210 1,199 758 3 7,170Reserve for unfunded lending commitments:          Balance as of March 31, 2017 0 7 133 0 140Provision (benefit) for losses on unfunded lending commitments 0 0 (1) 0 (1)Balance as of June 30, 2017 0 7 132 0 139Combined allowance and reserve as of June 30, 2017 $5,210 $1,206 $890 $3 $7,309  Six Months Ended June 30, 2017(Dollars in millions) Credit Card ConsumerBanking Commercial Banking Other(3) TotalAllowance for loan and lease losses:          Balance as of December 31, 2016 $4,606 $1,102 $793 $2 $6,503Charge-offs (3,173) (754) (166) 0 (4,093)Recoveries 646 304 7 8 965Net charge-offs (2,527) (450) (159) 8 (3,128)Provision (benefit) for loan and lease losses 3,114 547 135 (7) 3,789Allowance build (release) for loan and lease losses 587 97 (24) 1 661Other changes(2) 17 0 (11) 0 6Balance as of June 30, 2017 5,210 1,199 758 3 7,170Reserve for unfunded lending commitments:          Balance as of December 31, 2016 0 7 129 0 136Provision (benefit) for losses on unfunded lending commitments 0 0 3 0 3Balance as of June 30, 2017 0 7 132 0 139Combined allowance and reserve as of June 30, 2017 $5,210 $1,206 $890 $3 $7,309__________(1) In the second quarter of 2018, we sold the substantial majority of our consumer home loan portfolio and the related servicing.

Our primary involvement with VIEs has been related to our securitization transactions in which we transferred assets from our balance sheet to securitization trusts. We have primarily securitized credit card loans, which have provided a source of funding for us and enabled us to transfer a certain portion of the economic risk of the loans or related debt securities to third parties.The entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is referred to as the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE. The majority of the VIEs in which we are involved have been consolidated in our financial statements.Summary of Consolidated and Unconsolidated VIEsThe assets of our consolidated VIEs primarily consist of cash, credit card loan receivables and the related allowance for loan and lease losses, which we report on our consolidated balance sheets under restricted cash for securitization investors, loans held in consolidated trusts and allowance for loan and lease losses, respectively. The assets of a particular VIE are the primary source of funding to settle its obligations. Creditors of these VIEs typically do not have recourse to our general credit. Liabilities primarily consist of debt securities issued by the VIEs, which we report under securitized debt obligations. For unconsolidated VIEs, we present the carrying amount of assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets and our maximum exposure to loss. Our maximum exposure to loss is estimated based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and we are required to meet our maximum remaining funding obligations.The tables below present a summary of certain VIEs in which we had continuing involvement or held a variable interest, aggregated based on VIEs with similar characteristics as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. We separately present information for consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs.Table 6.1: Carrying Amount of Consolidated and Unconsolidated VIEs  June 30, 2018  Consolidated Unconsolidated(Dollars in millions) CarryingAmountof Assets CarryingAmount ofLiabilities CarryingAmountof Assets CarryingAmount ofLiabilities Maximum Exposure toLossSecuritization-Related VIEs:          Credit card loan securitizations(1) $34,898 $20,439 $0 $0 $0Home loan securitizations 0 0 302 212 730Total securitization-related VIEs 34,898 20,439 302 212 730Other VIEs:(2)          Affordable housing entities 231 11 3,941 1,199 3,941Entities that provide capital to low-income and rural communities 1,638 130 0 0 0Other 0 0 304 0 304Total other VIEs 1,869 141 4,245 1,199 4,245Total VIEs $36,767 $20,580 $4,547 $1,411 $4,975  95Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  December 31, 2017  Consolidated Unconsolidated(Dollars in millions) CarryingAmountof Assets CarryingAmount ofLiabilities CarryingAmountof Assets CarryingAmount ofLiabilities MaximumExposure toLossSecuritization-Related VIEs:          Credit card loan securitizations(1) $34,976 $20,651 $0 $0 $0Home loan securitizations 0 0 455 390 1,057Total securitization-related VIEs 34,976 20,651 455 390 1,057Other VIEs:(2)          Affordable housing entities  226 10 4,175 1,284 4,175Entities that provide capital to low-income and rural communities 1,498 129 0 0 0Other 0 0 318 0 318Total other VIEs 1,724 139 4,493 1,284 4,493Total VIEs $36,700 $20,790 $4,948 $1,674 $5,550__________(1) Represents the carrying amount of assets and liabilities owned by the VIE, which includes the seller’s interest and repurchased notes held by other related parties.(2) In certain investment structures, we consolidate a VIE which in turn holds as its primary asset an investment in an unconsolidated VIE. In these instances, we disclose the carrying amount of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets in the unconsolidated VIEs to avoid duplicating our exposure, as the unconsolidated VIEs are generally the operating entities generating the exposure. The carrying amount of assets and liabilities included in the unconsolidated VIE columns above related to these investment structures were $2.2 billion of assets and $858 million of liabilities as of June 30, 2018 and $2.2 billion of assets and $901 million of liabilities as of December 31, 2017.Securitization-Related VIEsIn a securitization transaction, assets are transferred to a trust, which generally meets the definition of a VIE. Our primary securitization activity is in the form of credit card securitizations, conducted through securitization trusts which we consolidate. Our continuing involvement in these securitization transactions mainly consists of acting as the primary servicer and holding certain retained interests.We transfer multifamily commercial loans that we originate to the government-sponsored enterprises (“GSEs”) and retain the right to service the transferred loans pursuant to the guidelines set forth by the GSEs. Subsequent to such transfers, these loans are commonly securitized into CMBS by the GSEs. We also hold RMBS, CMBS and ABS in our investment portfolio, which represent an interest in the respective securitization trusts employed in the transactions under which those securities were issued. We do not consolidate the securitization trusts employed in these transactions as we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these securitization trusts. We may have exposure associated with contractual obligations to repurchase previously transferred loans due to breaches of representations and warranties. See “Note 14—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others” for more information related to our mortgage representation and warranty exposure. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with these VIEs is the carrying value of mortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) and investment securities on our consolidated balance sheets. See “Note 7—Goodwill and Intangible Assets” for information related to our MSRs associated with these multifamily commercial loan securitizations and “Note 3—Investment Securities” for more information on the securities held in our investment securities portfolio. We exclude these VIEs from the tables within this note because we do not consider our continuing involvement with these VIEs to be significant; we either invest in securities issued by the VIE and were not involved in the design of the VIE or no transfers have occurred between the VIE and us. In addition, where we have certain lending arrangements in the normal course of business with entities that could be VIEs, we have also excluded these VIEs from the tables presented in this note. See “Note 4—Loans” for additional information regarding our lending arrangements in the normal course of business.  96Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe table below presents our continuing involvement in certain securitization-related VIEs as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.Table 6.2: Continuing Involvement in Securitization-Related VIEs    Mortgage(Dollars in millions) CreditCard Option-ARM GreenPointHELOCs GreenPointManufacturedHousingJune 30, 2018:        Securities held by third-party investors $19,649 $1,102 $35 $409Receivables in the trust 34,902 1,140 28 412Cash balance of spread or reserve accounts 0 8 N/A 110Retained interests Yes Yes Yes YesServicing retained Yes Yes No NoDecember 31, 2017:        Securities held by third-party investors $20,010 $1,224 $42 $508Receivables in the trust 35,667 1,266 35 511Cash balance of spread or reserve accounts 0 8 N/A 116Retained interests Yes Yes Yes YesServicing retained Yes Yes No NoCredit Card SecuritizationsWe hold certain retained interests in our credit card securitizations and continue to service the receivables in these trusts. As of both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we were deemed to be the primary beneficiary, and accordingly, all of these trusts have been consolidated in our financial statements.Mortgage SecuritizationsOption-ARM LoansWe had previously securitized option adjustable-rate mortgage (“option-ARM”) loans by transferring these loans to securitization trusts that had issued mortgage-backed securities to investors. The outstanding balance of debt securities held by third-party investors related to these mortgage loan securitization trusts was $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.We continue to service a portion of the remaining mortgage loans in these securitizations. We also retain rights to future cash flows arising from these securitizations including interest-only bonds issued by the trusts. We generally estimate the fair value of these retained interests based on the estimated present value of expected future cash flows, using our best estimates of the key assumptions which include credit losses, prepayment speeds and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved. For the mortgage loans that we continue to service, we do not consolidate the related trusts because we do not have the right to receive benefits nor the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts. For the remaining trusts, for which we no longer service the underlying mortgage loans, we do not consolidate these entities since we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts.  97Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSIn connection with the securitization of certain option-ARM loans, a third party is obligated to advance a portion of any “negative amortization” resulting from monthly payments that are less than the interest accrued for that payment period. We have an agreement in place with the third party that mirrors this advance requirement. The amount advanced is tracked through mortgage-backed securities retained as part of the securitization transaction. As advances occur, we record an asset in the form of negative amortization bonds, which are held at fair value in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Our maximum exposure is affected by rate caps and monthly payment change caps, but the funding obligation cannot exceed the difference between the original loan balance multiplied by a preset negative amortization cap and the current unpaid principal balance. For the transactions where the negative amortization funding agreements have been terminated, incremental negative amortization is funded through the available cash flow in each transaction.We have also entered into certain derivative contracts related to the securitization activities. These are classified as free-standing derivatives, with fair value adjustments recorded in non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income. See “Note 9—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” for further details on these derivatives.GreenPoint Mortgage Home Equity Lines of Credit (“HELOCs”)Our discontinued wholesale mortgage banking unit, GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, Inc. (“GreenPoint”), previously sold HELOCs in whole loan sales that were subsequently securitized by third parties. GreenPoint acquired residual interests in certain of those securitization trusts. We do not consolidate these trusts because we either lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts or because we do not have the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts. As the residual interest holder, GreenPoint is required to fund advances on the HELOCs when certain performance triggers are met due to deterioration in asset performance. On behalf of GreenPoint, we have funded cumulative advances of $30 million as of both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. We also have unfunded commitments of $3 million and $4 million related to those interests for our non-consolidated VIEs as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.GreenPoint Credit Manufactured HousingWe previously had certain retained interests and obligations related to the discontinued manufactured housing operations of GreenPoint Credit, LLC, a subsidiary of GreenPoint. Such discontinued operations, including the related recourse obligations, servicing rights and the primary obligation to execute clean-up calls in certain securitization transactions were sold to a third party in 2004. These securitization trusts were not consolidated because we did not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts as we did not service the loans.The unpaid principal receivables balances of these manufactured housing securitization transactions were $412 million and $511 million as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we entered into an agreement with the third-party servicer under which we assumed the obligation to exercise the remaining clean-up calls as they become due on certain securitization transactions, and a forward sale agreement pursuant to which we will sell the underlying loans to a third-party purchaser as the clean-up calls are exercised. Accordingly, we recognized loans held for sale and a corresponding liability on our consolidated balance sheets. We recorded $139 million and $283 million of these loan receivables, with the corresponding liability, which is included as a component of other debt, as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.We were required to fund letters of credit to cover losses on certain manufactured housing securitizations. We have the right to receive any funds remaining in the letters of credit after the securities are released. The fair value of these letters of credit are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets and totaled $71 million and $75 million as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. We also have credit exposure on an agreement that we entered into to absorb a portion of the risk of loss on certain manufactured housing securitizations not subject to the funded letters of credit. Our expected future obligation under this agreement included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets was $4 million and $10 million as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.  98Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSOther VIEsAffordable Housing EntitiesAs part of our community reinvestment initiatives, we invest in private investment funds that make equity investments in multi-family affordable housing properties. We receive affordable housing tax credits for these investments. The activities of these entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. We account for certain of our investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method if certain criteria are met. The proportional amortization method amortizes the cost of the investment over the period in which the investor expects to receive tax credits and other tax benefits, and the resulting amortization is recognized as a component of income tax expense attributable to continuing operations. For the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, we recognized amortization of $250 million and $230 million, respectively, and tax credits of $321 million and $238 million, respectively, associated with these investments within income tax provision. The carrying value of our equity investments in these qualified affordable housing projects was $3.9 billion as of both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. We are periodically required to provide additional financial or other support during the period of the investments. Our liability for these unfunded commitments was $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Predominantly all of this liability is expected to be paid from 2018 to 2020.For those investment funds considered to be VIEs, we are not required to consolidate them if we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of those entities. We record our interests in these unconsolidated VIEs in loans held for investment, other assets and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our maximum exposure to these entities is limited to our variable interests in the entities which consisted of assets of approximately $3.9 billion and $4.2 billion as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit and we do not provide additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it. The total assets of the unconsolidated VIE investment funds were approximately $11.1 billion and $11.5 billion as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.Entities that Provide Capital to Low-Income and Rural CommunitiesWe hold variable interests in entities (“Investor Entities”) that invest in community development entities (“CDEs”) that provide debt financing to businesses and non-profit entities in low-income and rural communities. Variable interests in the CDEs held by the consolidated Investor Entities are also our variable interests. The activities of the Investor Entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. The activities of the CDEs are financed solely with invested equity capital. We receive federal and state tax credits for these investments. We consolidate the VIEs in which we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and where we have the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE. We have also consolidated other investments and CDEs that are not considered to be VIEs, but where we hold a controlling financial interest. The assets of the VIEs that we consolidated, which totaled approximately $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets in cash, loans held for investment and other assets. The liabilities are reflected in other liabilities. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit. We have not provided additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it.OtherOther VIEs include variable interests that we hold in companies that promote renewable energy sources and other equity method investments. We were not required to consolidate these entities because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance. Our maximum exposure to these entities is limited to the investment on our consolidated balance sheets of $304 million and $318 million as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.

Securitized debt obligations are presented separately on our consolidated balance sheets, as they represent obligations of consolidated securitization trusts, while federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, senior and subordinated notes and other borrowings, including FHLB advances, are included in other debt on our consolidated balance sheets.The following tables summarize the components of our deposits, short-term borrowings and long-term debt as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Our total short-term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. Our long-term debt consists of borrowings with an original contractual maturity of greater than one year. The carrying value presented below for these borrowings include unamortized debt premiums and discounts, net of debt issuance costs and fair value hedge accounting adjustments.Table 8.1: Components of Deposits, Short-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt(Dollars in millions) June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017Deposits:    Non-interest-bearing deposits $25,620 $26,404Interest-bearing deposits(1) 222,605 217,298Total deposits(2) $248,225 $243,702Short-term borrowings:    Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase $553 $576Total short-term borrowings $553 $576  June 30, 2018  (Dollars in millions) MaturityDates Stated Interest Rates Weighted-AverageInterest Rate Carrying Value December 31, 2017Long-term debt:          Securitized debt obligations 2018-2025 1.33 - 3.01% 2.15% $19,649 $20,010Senior and subordinated notes:          Fixed unsecured senior debt 2018-2028 1.85 - 4.75 2.98 24,824 22,776Floating unsecured senior debt 2018-2023 2.75 - 3.51 3.15 3,646 3,446Total unsecured senior debt 3.00 28,470 26,222Fixed unsecured subordinated debt 2019-2026 3.38 - 8.80 4.09 4,450 4,533Total senior and subordinated notes 32,920 30,755Other long-term borrowings:          FHLB advances 2018-2023 4.44 - 5.36 4.87 2 8,609Other borrowings 2018-2035 1.00 - 16.75 7.16 186 331Total other long-term borrowings 188 8,940Total long-term debt $52,757 $59,705Total short-term borrowings and long-term debt $53,310 $60,281__________(1) Includes $2.7 billion and $1.3 billion of time deposits in denominations in excess of the $250,000 federal insurance limit as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.(2) Includes approximately $1.7 billion of held for sale deposits as of June 30, 2018 associated with the anticipated sale of our online retail brokerage business.  102Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSNOTE 9—DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIESUse of DerivativesWe manage asset and liability positions and market risk exposure in accordance with market risk management policies that are approved by our Board of Directors. Our primary market risks stem from the impact on our earnings and economic value of equity from changes in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, changes in foreign exchange rates. We employ several techniques to manage our interest rate sensitivity, which include changing the duration and re-pricing characteristics of various assets and liabilities by using interest rate derivatives. Our current policies also include the use of derivatives to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currency which we use to limit our earnings and capital ratio exposures to foreign exchange risk. We execute our derivative contracts in both the over-the-counter (“OTC”) and exchange-traded derivative markets. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to clear eligible derivative transactions through Central Counterparty Clearinghouses (“CCPs”) such as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (“CME”) and London Clearing House (“LCH”), which are often referred to as “central clearinghouses.” The majority of our derivatives are interest rate swaps. In addition, we may use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks. We offer various interest rate, foreign exchange rate and commodity derivatives as an accommodation to our customers within our Commercial Banking business, and offset the majority of our exposure through derivative transactions with other counterparties.Derivatives Counterparty Credit RiskDerivative instruments contain an element of credit risk that arises from the potential failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of the contract. Our exposure to derivative counterparty credit risk, at any point in time, is equal to the amount reported as a derivative asset on our balance sheet, assuming no recoveries of underlying collateral.We clear certain OTC derivatives with central clearinghouses through futures commission merchants (“FCMs”) as part of the regulatory requirement. The use of the CCPs and the FCMs reduces our bilateral counterparty credit exposures while it increases our credit exposures to CCPs and FCMs. We are required by CCPs to post initial and variation margin to mitigate the risk of non-payment through our FCMs. Our FCM agreements governing these derivative transactions generally include provisions that may require us to post more collateral or otherwise change terms in our agreements under certain circumstances. For CME-cleared OTC derivatives, we characterize variation margin cash payments as settlements. Effective January 16, 2018, LCH amended its rulebook to legally characterize variation margin payments as settlements. We adopted this rule change in the first quarter of 2018. As a result, the balances for LCH-cleared derivatives are reduced to reflect the settlement of these positions.We also enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements and collateral agreements, where possible, with certain derivative counterparties to mitigate the risk of default on a bilateral basis. These bilateral agreements typically provide the right to offset exposures and require one counterparty to post collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position to the other counterparty. Certain of these bilateral agreements include provisions requiring that our debt maintain a credit rating of investment grade or above by each of the major credit rating agencies. In the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating below investment grade, some of our counterparties would have the right to terminate the derivative contract and close out the existing positions.We record counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments (“CVAs”) on our derivative contracts to properly reflect the credit quality of the counterparty. We consider collateral and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate our credit exposure to each counterparty in determining the counterparty credit risk valuation adjustment, which may be adjusted in future periods due to changes in the fair value of the derivative contracts, collateral and creditworthiness of the counterparty. We also record debit valuation adjustments (“DVAs”) to adjust the fair value of our derivative liabilities to reflect the impact of our own credit quality. We calculate this adjustment by comparing the spreads on our credit default swaps to the discount benchmark curve.Accounting for DerivativesOur derivatives are designated as either qualifying accounting hedges or free-standing derivatives. Qualifying accounting hedges are designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges. Free-standing derivatives primarily consist of customer accommodation derivatives and economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting.•Fair Value Hedges: We designate derivatives as fair value hedges when they are used to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, which fluctuate in value as a result of movements in interest rates. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded and presented in the same line item as   103Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSthe earnings effect of the hedged item on our consolidated statements of income. Our fair value hedges consist of interest rate swaps that are intended to modify our exposure to interest rate risk on various fixed-rate assets and liabilities.•Cash Flow Hedges: We designate derivatives as cash flow hedges when they are used to manage our exposure to variability in cash flows related to forecasted transactions. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of AOCI. Those amounts are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the forecasted transactions impact earnings and are presented in the same line item on our consolidated statements of income as the earnings effect of the hedged items. Our cash flow hedges use interest rate swaps and floors that are intended to hedge the variability in interest receipts or interest payments on some of our variable-rate assets or liabilities. We also enter into foreign currency forward derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to intercompany borrowings denominated in a foreign currency.•Net Investment Hedges: We use net investment hedges to manage the foreign currency exposure related to our net investments in foreign operations that have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recorded in the translation adjustment component of AOCI, offsetting the translation gain or loss from those foreign operations. We execute net investment hedges using foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the translation exposure of the net investment in our foreign operations under the forward method.•Free-Standing Derivatives: We use free-standing derivatives to economically hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of mortgage loan origination and purchase commitments, as well as other interests held. We also categorize our customer accommodation derivatives and the related offsetting contracts as free-standing derivatives. Changes in the fair value of free-standing derivatives are recorded in earnings as a component of other non-interest income.  104Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSBalance Sheet PresentationThe following table summarizes the notional and fair values of our derivative instruments as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, which are segregated by derivatives that are designated as accounting hedges and those that are not, and are further segregated by type of contract within those two categories. The total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and any associated cash collateral received or pledged. Derivative assets and liabilities are included in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.Table 9.1: Derivative Assets and Liabilities at Fair Value  June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017  Notional orContractualAmount Derivative(1)(4) Notional orContractualAmount Derivative(1)(Dollars in millions) Assets Liabilities Assets LiabilitiesDerivatives designated as accounting hedges:            Interest rate contracts:            Fair value hedges $69,476 $49 $34 $56,604 $102 $164Cash flow hedges 75,850 4 111 77,300 30 125Total interest rate contracts 145,326 53 145 133,904 132 289Foreign exchange contracts:            Cash flow hedges 5,827 148 7 6,086 19 75Net investment hedges 2,649 82 12 3,036 1 164Total foreign exchange contracts 8,476 230 19 9,122 20 239Total derivatives designated as accounting hedges 153,802 283 164 143,026 152 528Derivatives not designated as accounting hedges:            Interest rate contracts covering:            Customer accommodation 59,995 1,105 1,316 48,520 848 727Other interest rate exposures(2) 5,779 27 12 3,857 40 8Total interest rate contracts 65,774 1,132 1,328 52,377 888 735Other contracts 1,327 1 22 1,209 0 5Total derivatives not designated as accounting hedges 67,101 1,133 1,350 53,586 888 740Total derivatives $220,903 $1,416 $1,514 $196,612 $1,040 $1,268Less: netting adjustment(3) (533) (880)   (275) (662)Total derivative assets/liabilities $883 $634   $765 $606__________(1) Derivative assets and liabilities presented above exclude valuation adjustments related to non-performance risk.

Either counterparty can generally request to net settle all contracts through a single payment upon default on, or termination of, any one contract. We elect to offset the derivative assets and liabilities under netting arrangements for balance sheet presentation where a right of setoff exists. For derivative contracts entered into under master netting arrangements for which we have not been able to confirm the enforceability of the setoff rights, or those not subject to master netting arrangements, we do not offset our derivative positions for balance sheet presentation.We also maintain collateral agreements with certain derivative counterparties. For bilateral derivatives, we review our collateral positions on a daily basis and exchange collateral with our counterparties in accordance with standard International Swaps and Derivatives Association documentation and other related agreements. Agreements with certain bilateral counterparties require both parties to maintain collateral in the event the fair values of derivative instruments exceed established exposure thresholds. For centrally cleared derivatives, we are subject to initial margin posting and daily variation margin settlement with the central clearinghouses. Acceptable types of collateral are typically in the form of cash or high quality liquid securities.The exchange of collateral is dependent upon the fair value of the derivative instruments as well as the fair value of the pledged collateral. When valuing collateral, an estimate of the variation in price and liquidity over time is subtracted in the form of a “haircut” to discount the value of the collateral pledged.  106Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe following table presents as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017 the gross and net fair values of our derivative assets and liabilities and repurchase agreements, as well as the related offsetting amounts permitted under U.S. GAAP.

Unrealized gains and losses for securities held to maturity are amortized over the remaining life of the security with no expected impact on future net income as amortization of these gains or losses will be offset by the amortization of premium or discount created from the transfer of securities from available for sale to held to maturity.  110Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe following table includes the AOCI impacts from the adoption of accounting standards and the changes in AOCI by component for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.

The fair value accounting guidance provides a three-level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments. This hierarchy is based on the markets in which the assets or liabilities trade and whether the inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are observable or unobservable. The fair value measurement of a financial asset or liability is assigned a level based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:Level 1: Valuation is based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.Level 2: Valuation is based on observable market-based inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted price for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.Level 3: Valuation is generated from techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. Valuation techniques include pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques.The accounting guidance for fair value measurements requires that we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in determining fair value. The accounting guidance provides for the irrevocable option to elect, on a contract-by-contract basis, to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value at inception of the contract and record any subsequent changes in fair value in earnings. We have not made any material fair value option elections as of or for the periods disclosed herein.The determination and classification of financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy is performed at the end of each reporting period. We consider all available information, including observable market data, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs. For additional information on the valuation techniques used in estimating the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities on a recurring or nonrecurring basis and for estimating the fair value for financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value, see “Note 17—Fair Value Measurement” in our 2017 Form 10-K.Fair Value Governance and ControlWe have a governance framework and a number of key controls that are intended to ensure that our fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable. Our governance framework provides for independent oversight and segregation of duties. Our control processes include review and approval of new transaction types, price verification and review of valuation judgments, methods, models, process controls and results.Groups independent of our trading and investing functions participate in the review and validation process. Tasks performed by these groups include periodic verification of fair value measurements to determine if assigned fair values are reasonable, including comparing prices from vendor pricing services to other available market information.Our Fair Value Committee (“FVC”), which includes representation from business areas, Risk Management and Finance divisions, provides guidance and oversight to ensure an appropriate valuation control environment. The FVC regularly reviews and approves our fair valuations to ensure that our valuation practices are consistent with industry standards and adhere to regulatory and accounting guidance.We have a model policy, established by an independent Model Risk Office, which governs the validation of models and related supporting documentation to ensure the appropriate use of models for pricing and fair value measurements. The Model Risk Office validates all models and provides ongoing monitoring of their performance.The fair value governance process is set up in a manner that allows the Chairperson of the FVC to escalate valuation disputes that cannot be resolved by the FVC to a more senior committee called the Valuations Advisory Committee (“VAC”) for resolution. The VAC is chaired by the Chief Financial Officer and includes other members of senior management. The VAC is only required to convene to review escalated valuation disputes.  115Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisThe following table displays our assets and liabilities measured on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.

When assets and liabilities are transferred between levels, we recognize the transfer as of the end of the period. Generally, transfers into Level 3 were primarily driven by the usage of unobservable assumptions in the pricing of these financial instruments as evidenced by wider pricing variations among pricing vendors and transfers out of Level 3 were primarily driven by the usage of assumptions corroborated by market observable information as evidenced by tighter pricing among multiple pricing sources.Table 12.2: Level 3 Recurring Fair Value Rollforward  Fair Value Measurements Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)  Three Months Ended June 30, 2018    Total Gains (Losses)(Realized/Unrealized)               Net UnrealizedGains (Losses)Included in NetIncome Related to Assets andLiabilities Still Held as ofJune 30, 2018(1)                   (Dollars in millions) Balance,April 1,2018 Includedin NetIncome(1) Included in OCI Purchases Sales Issuances Settlements TransfersIntoLevel 3 TransfersOut ofLevel 3 Balance,June 30,2018 Securities available for sale:                    RMBS $614 $9 $9 $0 $0 $0 $(21) $4 $(173) $442 $7CMBS 13 0 0 0 0 0 (2) 0 0 11 0Other securities 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0Total securities available for sale 632 9 9 0 0 0 (23) 4 (173) 458 7Other assets:                      Retained interests in securitizations 176 (12) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 164 (12)Net derivative assets (liabilities)(2) (9) (2) 0 0 0 6 (1) 0 1 (5) (2)  117Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Fair Value Measurements Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)  Six Months Ended June 30, 2018    Total Gains (Losses)(Realized/Unrealized)               Net UnrealizedGains (Losses)Included in NetIncome Related to Assets andLiabilities Still Held as ofJune 30, 2018(1)                   (Dollars in millions) Balance,January 1,2018 Includedin NetIncome(1) Included in OCI Purchases Sales Issuances Settlements TransfersIntoLevel 3 TransfersOut ofLevel 3 Balance,June 30,2018 Securities available for sale:                    RMBS $614 $18 $7 $0 $0 $0 $(42) $65 $(220) $442 $13CMBS 14 0 0 0 0 0 (3) 0 0 11 0Other securities 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0Total securities available for sale 633 18 7 0 0 0 (45) 65 (220) 458 13Other assets:                      Consumer MSRs 92 3 0 0 (97) 2 0 0 0 0 0Retained interests in securitizations 172 (8) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 164 (8)Net derivative assets (liabilities)(2) 13 (24) 0 0 0 7 (2) 0 1 (5) (24)  Fair Value Measurements Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)  Three Months Ended June 30, 2017    Total Gains (Losses)(Realized/Unrealized)               Net UnrealizedGains (Losses)Included in NetIncome Related to Assets andLiabilities Still Held as ofJune 30, 2017(1)                   (Dollars in millions) Balance,April 1,2017 Includedin NetIncome(1) Included in OCI Purchases Sales Issuances Settlements TransfersIntoLevel 3 TransfersOut ofLevel 3 Balance, June 30, 2017 Securities available for sale:                    RMBS $449 $8 $10 $0 $(5) $0 $(24) $159 $(168) $429 $8CMBS 78 0 0 0 0 0 (1) 0 (60) 17 0Other securities 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0Total securities available for sale 536 8 10 0 (5) 0 (25) 159 (228) 455 8Other assets:                      Consumer MSRs 86 (5) 0 0 0 5 (1) 0 0 85 (5)Retained interests in securitizations 195 (7) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 188 (7)Net derivative assets (liabilities)(2) 22 1 0 0 0 15 (8) 0 (5) 25 1  118Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Fair Value Measurements Using Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)  Six Months Ended June 30, 2017    Total Gains (Losses)(Realized/Unrealized)               Net UnrealizedGains (Losses)Included in NetIncome Related to Assets andLiabilities Still Held as ofJune 30, 2017(1)                   (Dollars in millions) Balance,January 1,2017 Includedin NetIncome(1) Included in OCI Purchases Sales Issuances Settlements TransfersIntoLevel 3 TransfersOut ofLevel 3 Balance, June 30, 2017 Securities available for sale:                    RMBS $518 $17 $18 $0 $(5) $0 $(46) $212 $(285) $429 $17CMBS 51 0 0 60 0 0 (2) 0 (92) 17 0Other securities 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0Total securities available for sale 578 17 18 60 (5) 0 (48) 212 (377) 455 17Other assets:                      Consumer MSRs 80 (4) 0 0 0 12 (3) 0 0 85 (4)Retained interests in securitizations 201 (13) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 188 (13)Net derivative assets (liabilities)(2) 18 1 0 0 0 27 (15) 0 (6) 25 1__________(1) Gains (losses) on securities available for sale, retained interests in securitizations and consumer MSRs are reported as a component of non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income.

Certain of these unobservable inputs will, in isolation, have a directionally consistent impact on the fair value of the instrument for a given change in that input. Alternatively, the fair value of the instrument may move in an opposite direction for a given change in another input. In general, an increase in the discount rate, default rates, loss severity and credit spreads, in isolation, would result in a decrease in the fair value measurement. In addition, an increase in default rates would generally be accompanied by a decrease in recovery rates, slower prepayment rates and an increase in liquidity spreads.Techniques and Inputs for Level 3 Fair Value MeasurementsThe following table presents the significant unobservable inputs used to determine the fair values of our Level 3 financial instruments on a recurring basis. We utilize multiple vendor pricing services to obtain fair value for our securities. Several of our vendor pricing services are only able to provide unobservable input information for a limited number of securities due to software licensing restrictions. Other vendor pricing services are able to provide unobservable input information for all securities for which they provide a valuation. As a result, the unobservable input information for the securities available for sale presented below represents a composite summary of all information we are able to obtain. The unobservable input information for all other Level 3 financial instruments is based on the assumptions used in our internal valuation models.  119Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSTable 12.3: Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements  Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements(Dollars in millions) Fair Value at June 30,2018 SignificantValuationTechniques SignificantUnobservableInputs Range WeightedAverageSecurities available for sale:          RMBS $442 Discounted cash flows (vendor pricing) YieldVoluntary prepayment rateDefault rateLoss severity 2-10%0-28%0-8%0-90% 5%4%3%64%CMBS 11 Discounted cash flows (vendor pricing) Yield 3% 3%Other securities 5 Discounted cash flows Yield 3% 3%Other assets:          Retained interests in securitization(1) 164 Discounted cash flows Life of receivables (months)Voluntary prepayment rateDiscount rateDefault rateLoss severity 1-592-13%4-5%2-6%51-116% N/ANet derivative assets (liabilities) (5) Discounted cash flows Swap rates 3% 3%  Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements(Dollars in millions) Fair Value at December 31,2017 SignificantValuationTechniques SignificantUnobservableInputs Range WeightedAverageSecurities available for sale:          RMBS $614 Discounted cash flows (vendor pricing) YieldVoluntary prepayment rateDefault rateLoss severity 2-9%0-15%0-8%0-90% 5%4%3%62%CMBS 14 Discounted cash flows (vendor pricing) YieldVoluntary prepayment rate 3%0% 3%0%Other securities 5 Discounted cash flows Yield 2% 2%Other assets:          Consumer MSRs 92 Discounted cash flows Total prepayment rateDiscount rateOption-adjusted spread rateServicing cost ($ per loan) 7-30%14%200-1,500 bps$75-$100 16%14%458 bps$76Retained interests in securitization(1) 172 Discounted cash flows Life of receivables (months) Voluntary prepayment rateDiscount rateDefault rateLoss severity 6-792-12%3-10%1-6%3-115% N/ANet derivative assets (liabilities) 13 Discounted cash flows Swap rates 2% 2%__________(1) Due to the nature of the various mortgage securitization structures in which we have retained interests, it is not meaningful to present a consolidated weighted average for the significant unobservable inputs.Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring BasisWe are required to measure and recognize certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on the consolidated balance sheets. These assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, from the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or when we evaluate for impairment).  120Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe following table presents the carrying value of the assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and still held as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, and for which a nonrecurring fair value measurement was recorded during the six and twelve months then ended.Table 12.4: Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements  June 30, 2018  Estimated Fair Value Hierarchy Total(Dollars in millions) Level 2 Level 3 Loans held for investment $0 $82 $82Loans held for sale 348 0 348Other assets(1) 0 99 99Total $348 $181 $529  December 31, 2017  Estimated Fair Value Hierarchy Total(Dollars in millions) Level 2 Level 3 Loans held for investment $0 $182 $182Loans held for sale 177 1 178Other assets(1) 0 35 35Total $177 $218 $395__________(1) As of June 30, 2018, other assets included equity investments accounted for under measurement alternative of $17 million, foreclosed property and repossessed assets of $75 million and long-lived assets held for sale of $7 million. As of December 31, 2017, other assets included foreclosed property and repossessed assets of $17 million and long-lived assets held for sale of $18 million.In the above table, loans held for investment are generally valued based in part on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral and the non-recoverable rate, which is considered to be a significant unobservable input. The non-recoverable rate ranged from 0% to 76%, with a weighted average of 19%, and from 0% to 77%, with a weighted average of 21%, as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The significant unobservable inputs and related quantitative information related to fair value of the other assets are not meaningful to disclose as they vary significantly across properties and collateral.The following table presents total nonrecurring fair value measurements for the period, included in earnings, attributable to the change in fair value relating to assets that are still held at June 30, 2018 and 2017.Table 12.5: Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements Included in Earnings  Total Gains (Losses)  Six Months Ended June 30,(Dollars in millions) 2018 2017Loans held for investment $(65) $(116)Loans held for sale (3) (3)Other assets(1) (47) (6)Total $(115) $(125)__________(1) Other assets include fair value adjustments related to equity investments accounted for under measurement alternative, foreclosed property, repossessed assets and long-lived assets held for sale.  121Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe following table presents the carrying value and estimated fair value, including the level within the fair value hierarchy, of our financial instruments that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis on our consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.Table 12.6: Fair Value of Financial Instruments  June 30, 2018  CarryingValue EstimatedFair Value Estimated Fair Value Hierarchy(Dollars in millions)   Level 1 Level 2 Level 3Financial assets:          Cash and cash equivalents $12,273 $12,273 $4,499 $7,774 $0Restricted cash for securitization investors 1,023 1,023 1,023 0 0Securities held to maturity 33,464 33,097 0 33,056 41Net loans held for investment 228,756 232,276 0 0 232,276Loans held for sale 1,480 1,495 0 1,417 78Interest receivable 1,493 1,493 0 1,493 0Other investments(1) 1,341 1,341 0 1,341 0Financial liabilities:          Deposits with defined maturities 33,761 33,662 0 33,662 0Securitized debt obligations 19,649 19,735 0 19,735 0Senior and subordinated notes 32,920 33,236 0 33,236 0Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase 553 553 0 553 0Other borrowings(2) 141 141 0 141 0Interest payable 450 450 0 450 0  December 31, 2017  CarryingValue EstimatedFair Value Estimated Fair Value Hierarchy(Dollars in millions)   Level 1 Level 2 Level 3Financial assets:          Cash and cash equivalents $14,040 $14,040 $4,458 $9,582 $0Restricted cash for securitization investors 312 312 312 0 0Securities held to maturity 28,984 29,437 200 29,217 20Net loans held for investment 246,971 251,468 0 0 251,468Loans held for sale 971 952 0 949 3Interest receivable 1,536 1,536 0 1,536 0Other investments(1) 1,689 1,689 0 1,680 9Financial liabilities:          Deposits 243,702 243,732 26,404 217,328 0Securitized debt obligations 20,010 20,122 0 20,122 0Senior and subordinated notes 30,755 31,392 0 31,392 0Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase 576 576 0 576 0Other borrowings(2) 8,892 8,892 0 8,892 0Interest payable 413 413 0 413 0__________(1) Other investments as of June 30, 2018 include FHLB and Federal Reserve stock.

The operations of acquired businesses have been integrated into our existing business segments. Certain activities that are not part of a segment, such as management of our corporate investment portfolio, asset/liability management by our centralized Corporate Treasury group and residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate that is not assessed to our primary business segments, are included in the Other category.Basis of PresentationWe report the results of each of our business segments on a continuing operations basis. See “Note 2—Business Developments and Discontinued Operations” for a discussion of our discontinued operations. The results of our individual businesses reflect the manner in which management evaluates performance and makes decisions about funding our operations and allocating resources.Business Segment Reporting MethodologyThe results of our business segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. Our internal management and reporting process used to derive our segment results employs various allocation methodologies, including funds transfer pricing, to assign certain balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related revenue and expenses directly or indirectly attributable to each business segment. Our funds transfer pricing process provides a funds credit for sources of funds, such as deposits generated by our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses, and a funds charge for the use of funds by each segment. Due to the integrated nature of our business segments, estimates and judgments have been made in allocating certain revenue and expense items. Transactions between segments are based on specific criteria or approximate third-party rates. We regularly assess the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, which may result in the implementation of refinements or changes in future periods. We provide additional information on the allocation methodologies used to derive our business segment results in “Note 18—Business Segments” in our 2017 Form 10-K.Segment Results and ReconciliationWe may periodically change our business segments or reclassify business segment results based on modifications to our management reporting methodologies or changes in organizational alignment. In the first quarter of 2018, we made a change in how revenue is measured in our Commercial Banking business to include the tax benefits of losses on certain tax-advantaged investments. These tax benefits are included in revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis within our Commercial Banking business, with an offsetting reduction in the Other category. This change in measurement of our Commercial Banking revenue did not have any impact to the consolidated financial statements.  123Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe following tables present our business segment results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, selected balance sheet data as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, and a reconciliation of our total business segment results to our reported consolidated net income from continuing operations, loans held for investment and deposits.Table 13.1: Segment Results and Reconciliation  Three Months Ended June 30, 2018(Dollars in millions) CreditCard ConsumerBanking CommercialBanking(1)(2) Other(1)(2)(3) ConsolidatedTotalNet interest income $3,396 $1,609 $549 $(3) $5,551Non-interest income 884 175 209 373 1,641Total net revenue 4,280 1,784 758 370 7,192Provision (benefit) for credit losses 1,171 118 34 (47) 1,276Non-interest expense 1,904 963 409 148 3,424Income from continuing operations before income taxes 1,205 703 315 269 2,492Income tax provision 282 164 73 56 575Income from continuing operations, net of tax $923 $539 $242 $213 $1,917Loans held for investment $109,777 $58,727 $67,609 $11 $236,124Deposits 0 194,962 31,078 22,185 248,225  Six Months Ended June 30, 2018(Dollars in millions) CreditCard ConsumerBanking CommercialBanking(1)(2) Other(1)(2)(3) ConsolidatedTotalNet interest income $6,954 $3,224 $1,085 $6 $11,269Non-interest income 1,741 349 396 346 2,832Total net revenue 8,695 3,573 1,481 352 14,101Provision (benefit) for credit losses 2,627 351 20 (48) 2,950Non-interest expense 3,943 1,963 812 279 6,997Income from continuing operations before income taxes 2,125 1,259 649 121 4,154Income tax provision (benefit) 495 294 151 (46) 894Income from continuing operations, net of tax $1,630 $965 $498 $167 $3,260Loans held for investment $109,777 $58,727 $67,609 $11 $236,124Deposits 0 194,962 31,078 22,185 248,225  Three Months Ended June 30, 2017(Dollars in millions) CreditCard ConsumerBanking CommercialBanking(1) Other(1) ConsolidatedTotalNet interest income  $3,294 $1,578 $569 $32 $5,473Non-interest income 875 183 183 (10) 1,231Total net revenue  4,169 1,761 752 22 6,704Provision (benefit) for credit losses 1,397 268 140 (5) 1,800Non-interest expense 1,918 1,059 381 56 3,414Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 854 434 231 (29) 1,490Income tax provision (benefit) 301 158 85 (101) 443Income from continuing operations, net of tax $553 $276 $146 $72 $1,047Loans held for investment $101,590 $74,973 $67,672 $67 $244,302Deposits 0 186,607 33,153 20,003 239,763  124Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Six Months Ended June 30, 2017(Dollars in millions) CreditCard ConsumerBanking CommercialBanking(1) Other(1) ConsolidatedTotalNet interest income $6,640 $3,095 $1,135 $77 $10,947Non-interest income 1,613 378 341 (40) 2,292Total net revenue 8,253 3,473 1,476 37 13,239Provision (benefit) for credit losses 3,114 547 138 (7) 3,792Non-interest expense 3,847 2,101 772 128 6,848Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes 1,292 825 566 (84) 2,599Income tax provision (benefit) 468 301 207 (219) 757Income from continuing operations, net of tax $824 $524 $359 $135 $1,842Loans held for investment $101,590 $74,973 $67,672 $67 $244,302Deposits 0 186,607 33,153 20,003 239,763__________(1) Some of our commercial investments generate tax-exempt income, tax credits or other tax benefits. Accordingly, we present our Commercial Banking revenue and yields on a taxable-equivalent basis, calculated using the federal statutory tax rate (21% and 35% for all periods presented in 2018 and 2017, respectively) and state taxes where applicable, with offsetting reductions to the Other category.(2) In the first quarter of 2018, we made a change in how revenue is measured in our Commercial Banking business to include the tax benefits of losses on certain tax-advantaged investments. These tax benefits are included in revenue on a taxable-equivalent basis within our Commercial Banking business, with an offsetting reduction to the Other category. In addition, all revenue presented on a taxable-equivalent basis in our Commercial Banking business was impacted by the reduction of the federal tax rate set forth in the Tax Act. The net impact of the measurement change and the reduction of the federal tax rate was a decrease of $28 million and $56 million in revenue in our Commercial Banking business in the second quarter and first six months of 2018, respectively, with an offsetting impact to the Other category.(3) In the second quarter of 2018, we sold the substantial majority of our consumer home loan portfolio and the related servicing. We also transferred the remaining portfolio to loans held for sale as of June 30, 2018. These actions resulted in a net gain of $400 million, including a benefit for credit losses of $46 million, which is reflected in the Other category.Revenue from Contracts with CustomersIn the first quarter of 2018, we adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) under the modified retrospective transition method. The majority of our revenue from contracts with customers consists of interchange fees in our Credit Card business and service charges on deposits and other customer-related fees in our Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking businesses. Revenue from contracts with customers is included in non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income.The following table presents revenue from contracts with customers and a reconciliation to non-interest income by business segment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2018.Table 13.2: Revenue from Contracts with Customers and Reconciliation to Segments Results  Three Months Ended June 30, 2018(Dollars in millions) CreditCard ConsumerBanking CommercialBanking(1) Other(1) ConsolidatedTotalContract revenue:          Interchange fees, net(2) $669 $47 $8 $(1) $723Service charges and other customer-related fees 2 123 35 (1) 159Total contract revenue 671 170 43 (2) 882Revenue from other sources 213 5 166 375 759Total non-interest income $884 $175 $209 $373 $1,641  125Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Six Months Ended June 30, 2018(Dollars in millions) CreditCard ConsumerBanking CommercialBanking(1) Other(1) ConsolidatedTotalContract revenue:          Interchange fees, net(2) $1,263 $89 $15 $(1) $1,366Service charges and other customer-related fees 4 250 67 (1) 320Total contract revenue 1,267 339 82 (2) 1,686Revenue from other sources 474 10 314 348 1,146Total non-interest income $1,741 $349 $396 $346 $2,832__________(1) Some of our commercial investments generate tax-exempt income, tax credits or other tax benefits.

These commitments, other than credit card lines, are legally binding conditional agreements that have fixed expirations or termination dates and specified interest rates and purposes. The contractual amount of these commitments represents the maximum possible credit risk to us should the counterparty draw upon the commitment. We generally manage the potential risk of unfunded lending commitments by limiting the total amount of arrangements, monitoring the size and maturity structure of these portfolios and applying the same credit standards for all of our credit activities.For unused credit card lines, we have not experienced and do not anticipate that all of our customers will access their entire available line at any given point in time. Commitments to extend credit other than credit card lines generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards. Collateral requirements and loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios are the same as those for funded transactions and are established based on management’s credit assessment of the customer. These commitments may expire without being drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future funding requirements.We also issue letters of credit, such as financial standby, performance standby and commercial letters of credit, to meet the financing needs of our customers. Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party in a borrowing arrangement. Commercial letters of credit are short-term commitments issued primarily to facilitate trade finance activities for customers and are generally collateralized by the goods being shipped to the client. These collateral requirements are similar to those for funded transactions and are established based on management’s credit assessment of the customer. Management conducts regular reviews of all outstanding letters of credit and the results of these reviews are considered in assessing the adequacy of reserves for unfunded lending commitments.The following table presents contractual amount and carrying value of our unfunded lending commitments as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. The carrying value represents our reserve and deferred revenue on legally binding commitments.Table 14.1: Unfunded Lending Commitments: Contractual Amount and Carrying Value  Contractual Amount Carrying Value(Dollars in millions) June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017 June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017Credit card lines $336,003 $351,481 N/A N/AOther loan commitments(1) 31,983 31,840 $80 $84Standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit(2) 1,909 2,046 40 43Total unfunded lending commitments $369,895 $385,367 $120 $127__________(1) Includes $973 million and $1.0 billion of advised lines of credit as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.(2) These financial guarantees have expiration dates ranging from 2018 to 2025 as of June 30, 2018.Loss Sharing Agreements and Other ObligationsWithin our Commercial Banking business, we originate multifamily commercial real estate loans with the intent to sell them to the GSEs. We enter into loss sharing agreements with the GSEs upon the sale of the loans. At inception, we record a liability representing the fair value of our obligation which is subsequently amortized as we are released from risk of payment under the loss sharing agreement. If payment under the loss sharing agreement becomes probable and estimable, an additional liability may be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and a non-interest expense may be recognized in the consolidated statements of income. The liability recognized on our consolidated balance sheets for our loss sharing agreements was $48 million and $60 million as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.  127Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSIn the fourth quarter of 2017, we entered into an agreement with our third-party servicer under which we assumed the obligation to exercise the remaining clean-up calls as they become due on certain securitization transactions related to our discontinued manufactured housing operations of GreenPoint Credit, LLC, a subsidiary of GreenPoint. We also entered into a forward sale agreement pursuant to which we will sell the underlying loans to a third-party purchaser as the clean-up calls are exercised. Accordingly, we recognized loans held for sale and a corresponding liability on our consolidated balance sheets. Based on the current information and estimates, we expect that we will incur losses associated with this exposure and have recorded a liability of $69 million and $78 million as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. See “Note 6—Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations” for information related to these transactions.U.K. Payment Protection InsuranceIn the U.K., we previously sold payment protection insurance (“PPI”). In response to an elevated level of customer complaints across the industry, heightened media coverage and pressure from consumer advocacy groups, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), formerly the Financial Services Authority, investigated and raised concerns about the way the industry has handled complaints related to the sale of these insurance policies. For the past several years, the U.K.’s Financial Ombudsman Service (“FOS”) has been adjudicating customer complaints relating to PPI, escalated to it by consumers who disagree with the rejection of their complaint by firms, leading to customer remediation payments by us and others within the industry. On March 2, 2017, the FCA issued a statement that sets out final rules and guidance on the PPI complaints deadline, which has been set as August 29, 2019. The statement also provides clarity on how to handle PPI complaints under s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act, including guidance on how redress for such complaints should be calculated. The final rules and guidance came into force on August 29, 2017.In determining our best estimate of incurred losses for future remediation payments, management considers numerous factors, including (i) the number of customer complaints we expect in the future; (ii) our expectation of upholding those complaints; (iii) the expected number of complaints customers escalate to the FOS; (iv) our expectation of the FOS upholding such escalated complaints; (v) the number of complaints that fall under s.140A of the Consumer Credit Act; and (vi) the estimated remediation payout to customers. We monitor these factors each quarter and adjust our reserves to reflect the latest data.Management’s best estimate of incurred losses related to U.K. PPI totaled $157 million and $249 million as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. For the six months ended June 30, 2018, we added $49 million to our reserve in response to sustained higher complaint volume. Other movements were due to a combination of utilization of the reserve through customer refund payments and foreign exchange movements. Our best estimate of reasonably possible future losses beyond our reserve as of June 30, 2018 is approximately $100 million.LitigationIn accordance with the current accounting standards for loss contingencies, we establish reserves for litigation related matters that arise from the ordinary course of our business activities when it is probable that a loss associated with a claim or proceeding has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. None of the amounts we currently have recorded individually or in the aggregate are considered to be material to our financial condition. Litigation claims and proceedings of all types are subject to many uncertain factors that generally cannot be predicted with assurance. Below we provide a description of potentially material legal proceedings and claims.For some of the matters disclosed below, we are able to estimate reasonably possible losses above existing reserves, and for other disclosed matters, such an estimate is not possible at this time. For those matters below where an estimate is possible, management currently estimates the reasonably possible future losses beyond our reserves as of June 30, 2018 is approximately $500 million, which includes estimates related to mortgage representation and warranty exposure. Our reserve and reasonably possible loss estimates involve considerable judgment and reflect that there is still significant uncertainty regarding numerous factors that may impact the ultimate loss levels. Notwithstanding our attempt to estimate a reasonably possible range of loss beyond our current accrual levels for some litigation matters based on current information, it is possible that actual future losses will exceed both the current accrual level and the range of reasonably possible losses disclosed here. Given the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters, especially those involving governmental agencies, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, there is significant uncertainty as to the ultimate liability we may incur from these litigation matters and an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to our results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period.  128Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSInterchangeIn 2005, a number of entities, each purporting to represent a class of retail merchants, filed antitrust lawsuits against MasterCard and Visa and several member banks, including our subsidiaries and us, alleging among other things, that the defendants conspired to fix the level of interchange fees. The complaints seek injunctive relief and civil monetary damages, which could be trebled. Separately, a number of large merchants have asserted similar claims against Visa and MasterCard only (together with the lawsuits described above, “Interchange Lawsuits”). In October 2005, the class and merchant Interchange Lawsuits were consolidated before the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for certain purposes, including discovery. In July 2012, the parties executed and filed with the court a Memorandum of Understanding agreeing to resolve the litigation on certain terms set forth in a settlement agreement attached to the Memorandum. The class settlement provides for, among other things, (i) payments by defendants to the class and individual plaintiffs totaling approximately $6.6 billion; (ii) a distribution to the class merchants of an amount equal to 10 basis points of certain interchange transactions for a period of eight months; and (iii) modifications to certain Visa and MasterCard rules regarding point of sale practices. In December 2013, the district court granted final approval of the proposed class settlement, which was appealed to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in January 2014. On June 30, 2016, the Second Circuit vacated the district court’s certification of the class, reversed approval of the proposed class settlement, and remanded the litigation to the district court for further proceedings, ruling that some of the merchants that were part of the proposed class settlement were not adequately represented. Because the Second Circuit ruling remands the litigation to the district court for further proceedings, the ultimate outcome in this matter is uncertain. Several merchant plaintiffs also opted out of the class settlement before it was overturned, and some of those plaintiffs have sued MasterCard, Visa and various member banks, including Capital One. The opt-out cases are consolidated before the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for certain purposes, including discovery. Visa and MasterCard have settled a number of individual opt-out cases, requiring non-material payments from all banks, including Capital One. Separate settlement and judgment sharing agreements between Capital One, MasterCard and Visa allocate the liabilities of any judgment or settlement arising from the Interchange Lawsuits and associated opt-out cases. Visa created a litigation escrow account following its IPO of stock in 2008, which funds any settlements for its member banks, and any settlements related to MasterCard allocated losses are reflected in Capital One’s reserves.Mortgage Representation and WarrantyWe face residual exposure related to subsidiaries that originated residential mortgage loans and sold these loans to various purchasers, including purchasers who created securitization trusts. In connection with their sales of mortgage loans, these subsidiaries entered into agreements containing varying representations and warranties about, among other things, the ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing the loan, the loan’s compliance with any applicable criteria established by the purchaser, including underwriting guidelines and the existence of mortgage insurance, and the loan’s compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws. Each of these subsidiaries may be required to repurchase mortgage loans, or indemnify certain purchasers and others against losses they incur, in the event of certain breaches of these representations and warranties.The substantial majority of our representation and warranty exposure has been resolved through litigation, and our remaining representation and warranty exposure is almost entirely litigation-related. Accordingly, we establish litigation reserves for representation and warranty losses that we consider to be both probable and reasonably estimable. The reserve process relies heavily on estimates, which are inherently uncertain, and requires the application of judgment. Our reserves and estimates of reasonably possible losses could be impacted by claims which may be brought by securitization trustees and sponsors, bond-insurers, investors, and GSEs, as well as claims brought by governmental agencies under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act (“FIRREA”), the False Claims Act or other federal or state statutes.In May, June and July 2012, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (“FHFA”) (acting as conservator for Freddie Mac) filed three summonses with notice in the New York state court against GreenPoint, on behalf of the trustees for three RMBS trusts backed by loans originated by GreenPoint with an aggregate original principal balance of $3.4 billion. In January 2013, the plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint in the name of the three trusts, acting by the respective trustees, alleging breaches of contractual representations and warranties regarding compliance with GreenPoint underwriting guidelines relating to certain loans (“FHFA Litigation”). Plaintiffs seek specific performance of the repurchase obligations with respect to the loans for which they have provided notice of alleged breaches as well as all other allegedly breaching loans, rescissory damages, indemnification, costs and interest. On March 29, 2017, the trial court granted GreenPoint’s motion for summary judgment and dismissed plaintiff’s claims as untimely. In May 2017, the plaintiff appealed the dismissal to the Second Circuit.  129Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATIONNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSAnti-Money LaunderingCapital One is being investigated by the New York District Attorney’s Office (“NYDA”), the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) of the U.S. Department of Treasury with respect to certain former check casher clients of the Commercial Banking business and Capital One’s anti-money laundering (“AML”) program. Capital One is cooperating with all agencies involved in the investigation.In addition, Capital One is subject to an open consent order with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) dated July 10, 2015 concerning regulatory deficiencies in our AML program.Other Pending and Threatened LitigationIn addition, we are commonly subject to various pending and threatened legal actions relating to the conduct of our normal business activities. In the opinion of management, the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of all such other pending or threatened legal actions, is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial position or our results of operations.  130Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsItem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskFor a discussion of the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see “MD&A—Market Risk Profile.”Item 4. Controls and ProceduresOverviewWe are required under applicable laws and regulations to maintain controls and procedures, which include disclosure controls and procedures as well as internal control over financial reporting, as further described below.(a) Disclosure Controls and ProceduresDisclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our financial reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding our required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we must apply judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures.Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and ProceduresAs required by Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of June 30, 2018, the end of the period covered by this Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2018, at a reasonable level of assurance, in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting information required to be disclosed within the time periods specified by the SEC rules and forms.(b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingWe regularly review our disclosure controls and procedures and make changes intended to ensure the quality of our financial reporting. There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred in the second quarter of 2018 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.  131Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)Table of ContentsPART II—OTHER INFORMATIONItem 1.
