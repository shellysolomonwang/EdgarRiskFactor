The increase in net income in the three months ended September 30, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, reflected a $4 million increase in net interest income and decreases of $13 million in the provision for credit losses and $14 million in noninterest expenses, partially offset by a $4 million decrease in noninterest income and an $8 million increase in the provision for income taxes. Net income per diluted common share was $0.61 for the three months ended September 30, 2012, compared to $0.51 for the same period one year ago.Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 was $391 million, an increase of $94 million from $297 million reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The increase in net income in the nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, reflected a $95 million increase in net interest income, a $63 million decrease in the provision for credit losses and a $4 million increase in noninterest income, partially offset by increases of $38 million in noninterest expenses and $30 million in the provision for income taxes. Net income per diluted common share was $2.00 for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared to $1.61 for the same period one year ago. The impact of operations of the former Sterling Bancshares, Inc. (Sterling) are reflected in all periods presented from the acquisition date of July 28, 2011 through September 30, 2012.Full-Year 2012 Outlook Compared to Full-Year 2011For full-year 2012, management expects the following, compared to full-year 2011, assuming a continuation of the current economic environment.•Average loans increasing 7 percent to 8 percent. •Net interest income increasing 4 percent to 5 percent. •Net credit-related charge-offs and provision for credit losses declining.•Noninterest income increasing 1 percent to 2 percent. •Noninterest expenses increasing or decreasing 1 percent.•Effective tax rate of approximately 26 percent.Net Interest IncomeNet interest income was $427 million for the three months ended September 30, 2012, an increase of $4 million compared to $423 million for the same period in 2011. The increase in net interest income in the third quarter 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, resulted primarily from a $4.6 billion increase in average earning assets, partially offset by a 22 basis point decrease in the net interest margin. Average earning assets increased $4.6 billion, or 9 percent, to $57.8 billion for the third quarter 2012, compared to the third quarter 2011, in part due to the acquisition of Sterling on July 28, 2011 and primarily reflecting increases of $3.5 billion in average loans and $1.6 billion in average investment securities available-for-sale, partially offset by a decrease of $575 million in interest-bearing deposits with banks. The net interest margin (FTE) for the three months ended September 30, 2012 decreased 22 basis points to 2.96 percent, from 3.18 percent for the comparable period in 2011, primarily from decreased yields on loans and mortgage-backed investment securities and a decrease in accretion of the purchase discount on the Sterling acquired loan portfolio, partially offset by lower deposit costs. The lower loan yields reflected a shift in the average loan portfolio mix, largely due to an increase in lower-yielding average commercial loans, the maturity of higher-yielding fixed-rate loans and positive credit quality migration throughout the portfolio. Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio increased the net interest margin by 10 basis points and 20 basis points in the third quarter 2012 and 2011, respectively. At September 30, 2012, $49 million of purchase discounts remained on acquired loans not deemed credit impaired at acquisition. The increase in net interest income in the third quarter 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, reflected the benefit from volume increases in average loans ($27 million) and investment securities ($10 million) and lower deposit rates ($7 million), partially offset by decreased yields on loans ($20 million) and mortgage-backed investment securities ($7 million) and a decrease in accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio ($12 million). The "Quarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent" table of this financial review details the components of the change in net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis for the three months ended September 30, 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest income was $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, an increase of $95 million compared to $1.2 billion for the same period in 2011. The increase in net interest income in the nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, resulted primarily from a $6.0 billion increase in average earning assets, partially offset by an 11 basis point decrease in the net interest margin. Average earning assets increased $6.0 billion, or 12 percent, to $56.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the acquisition of Sterling on July 28, 2011 and reflecting increases of $3.4 billion in average loans, $2.2 billion in average investment securities available-for-sale and $352 million in average interest-bearing deposits with banks. The net interest margin (FTE) for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 decreased 11 basis points to 3.08 percent, from 3.19 percent for the comparable period in 2011, primarily from decreased yields on loans and mortgage-backed investment securities, partially offset by an increase in accretion 43Table of Contentsof the purchase discount on the Sterling acquired loan portfolio and lower deposit costs. The decrease in loan yields was primarily due to the same reasons as noted above as well as the decrease in higher-yielding commercial real estate loans (real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans), partially offset by an increase in interest recognized on nonaccrual loans. The decreased yields on mortgage-backed investment securities reflected lower reinvestment yields. Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio increased the net interest margin by 14 basis points and 7 basis points in the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and excess liquidity reduced the net interest margin by approximately 20 basis points and 22 basis points in the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Excess liquidity was represented by $3.8 billion and $3.5 billion of average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) in the first nine months of 2012 and 2011, respectively, included in “interest-bearing deposits with banks” on the consolidated balance sheets. The increase in net interest income in the nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, reflected the benefit from increases in average loans ($85 million) and investment securities ($43 million), an increase in accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio ($31 million) and lower deposit rates ($19 million), partially offset by decreased yields on loans ($47 million) and mortgage-backed investment securities ($34 million). The "Year-to-Date Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent" table of this financial review details the components of the change in net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year.

The provision for credit losses includes both the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The Corporation performs a detailed credit quality review quarterly to determine the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments and records provisions for each based on the results. For further discussion of both allowances, refer to the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.The provision for loan losses was $23 million for the three months ended September 30, 2012, compared to $38 million for the three months ended September 30, 2011, and was $54 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared to $134 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The decreases of $15 million and $80 million in the provision for loan losses in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2011, resulted primarily from continued improvements in credit quality, in part reflecting improvements in the U.S. economy, partially offset by an increase resulting from allowance methodology enhancements implemented in the first quarter 2012 and an increase in qualitative factors that indicate overall economic uncertainty. For further discussion of the Corporation's view of the U.S. economy and the allowance methodology enhancements, refer to the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review. Improvements in credit quality included a decline of $1.3 billion in the Corporation's internal watch list loans from September 30, 2011 to September 30, 2012. The Corporation's internal watch list is generally consistent with loans in the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful categories defined by regulatory authorities. Reflected in the decline in watch list loans was a decrease in nonaccrual loans of $264 million from September 30, 2011 to September 30, 2012.Net loan charge-offs for the third quarter 2012 were $43 million, or 0.39 percent of average total loans, a decrease of $34 million compared to $77 million, or 0.77 percent, for the third quarter 2011. The $34 million decrease in net loan charge-offs in the third quarter 2012, compared to the third quarter 2011, primarily reflected decreases in Small Business ($19 million) and Commercial Real Estate ($11 million). By geographic market, the decrease in net loan charge-offs in the third quarter 2012, compared to the third quarter 2011, primarily reflected decreases in the Western ($22 million) and Midwest ($21 million) markets.Net loan charge-offs for the first nine months of 2012 decreased $135 million to $133 million, or 0.41 percent of average total loans, compared to $268 million, or 0.90 percent, for the same period in 2011. The $135 million decrease in net loan charge-offs in the first nine months of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, primarily reflected decreases in Middle Market ($84 million), Small Business ($38 million) and Private Banking ($10 million). By geographic market, the decrease in net loan charge-offs in the first nine months of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, primarily reflected decreases in the Midwest ($76 million) and Western ($50 million) markets.The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments increased $2 million to a benefit of $1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2012, compared to a benefit of $3 million for the comparable period in the prior year. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments increased $17 million to a provision of $9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared to a benefit of $8 million for the comparable period in the prior year. The $17 million increase in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments in the nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared 48Table of Contentsto the same period in the prior year, resulted primarily from the establishment of specific reserves in the second quarter 2012 for set aside/bonded stop loss commitments related to residential real estate construction credits in the Western Market and an increase in the probability of draw applied to all remaining unfunded commitments effective September 30, 2012 as a result of an updated analysis of borrower draw behavior. The Corporation establishes this provision to maintain an appropriate allowance to cover probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments, which is discussed under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review. No provision for credit losses was recorded for Sterling lending-related commitments during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 since the remaining purchase discount recorded for lending-related commitments acquired from Sterling exceeded the required allowance. Lending-related commitment charge-offs were insignificant in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 and 2011.An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets is presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.Noninterest IncomeNoninterest income was $197 million for the three months ended September 30, 2012, a decrease of $4 million compared to $201 million for the same period in 2011. Card fees decreased $5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting the impact of regulatory limits on debit card transaction processing fees implemented in the fourth quarter 2011. Net securities gains decreased $12 million, as the third quarter 2011 included increased net securities gains related to the sale of Sterling legacy securities. Other noninterest income increased $13 million in the three months ended September 30, 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting a $9 million increase in deferred compensation asset returns. The increase in deferred compensation asset returns in noninterest income is offset by an increase in deferred compensation plan expense in noninterest expenses.Noninterest income was $614 million for the first nine months of 2012, an increase of $4 million compared to $610 million for the same period in 2011. Service charges on deposit accounts increased $6 million, in part due to the nine-month impact of Sterling in the first nine months of 2012, compared to a two-month impact from Sterling in the first nine months of 2011. Commercial lending fees increased $7 million, primarily due to an increase in syndication agent fees, reflecting a higher volume of activity in the first nine months of 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year. Card fees decreased $12 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting the impact of regulatory limits on debit card transaction processing fees implemented in the fourth quarter 2011. Net securities gains decreased $7 million, primarily due to the same reason cited in the quarterly discussion above. Other noninterest income increased $11 million in the first nine months of 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting a $5 million annual incentive bonus received for the first time in the second quarter 2012 from the Corporation's third party credit card provider, and increases of $6 million in customer derivative income, $4 million in deferred compensation asset returns and $4 million in other customer driven fee income, partially offset by a decrease of $8 million in net income from principal investing and warrants, primarily due to one-time gains recognized in the first nine months of 2011, and an increase of $4 million in amortization of low income housing investments.The following table illustrates certain categories included in "other noninterest income" on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

Income earned on these assets is reported in noninterest income and the offsetting increase in liability is reported in salaries expense.Noninterest ExpensesNoninterest expenses were $449 million for the three months ended September 30, 2012, a decrease of $14 million compared to $463 million for the same period in 2011. Salaries expense of $192 million was unchanged from the same period in the prior year, as an increase in deferred compensation plan expense and the impact of annual merit increases was offset by a decrease in headcount. Employee benefits expense increased $8 million, primarily reflecting increased pension expense. Merger 49Table of Contentsand restructuring charges related to the acquisition of Sterling decreased $8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year. Other noninterest expenses decreased $11 million in the three months ended September 30, 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a $4 million decrease in litigation-related expenses, resulting primarily from developments on certain litigation claims during the three months ended September 30, 2011, and a $6 million increase in net gains recognized on sales of assets.Noninterest expenses were $1.3 billion for the first nine months of 2012, an increase of $38 million compared to $1.3 billion for the comparable period in 2011. Salaries expense increased $17 million, primarily due to the impact of Sterling and the impact of annual merit increases. Employee benefits expense increased $28 million, primarily reflecting increased pension expense and the impact of Sterling. Other real estate expense decreased $13 million in the first nine months of 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting decreased write-downs and losses on sales of foreclosed property. Other noninterest expenses increased $10 million in the first nine months of 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a $14 million increase in litigation-related expenses, resulting primarily from developments in certain litigation claims in the first nine months of 2012, and a $5 million increase in amortization of the core deposit intangible due to the acquisition of Sterling, partially offset by an $8 million increase in net gains recognized on sales of assets.Provision for Income Taxes and Tax-Related ItemsThe provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2012 was $36 million, an increase of $8 million compared to $28 million for the same period in 2011. The increase in the provision for income taxes in the three months ended September 30, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, was due primarily to an increase in income before income taxes during the same period, partially offset by a $4 million benefit related to an interest refund received from the Internal Revenue Service in the third quarter 2012.The provision for income taxes for the first nine months of 2012 was $134 million, compared to $104 million for the same period in 2011. The $30 million increase in the provision for income taxes in the first nine months of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, was due primarily to the same reasons cited in the quarterly discussion above. In addition, the provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 included net after-tax charges of $8 million for various tax items.Net deferred tax assets were $249 million at September 30, 2012, compared to $395 million at December 31, 2011, a decrease of $146 million, resulting primarily from the utilization of tax credits, accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio, a decrease in the allowance for loan losses, reversals of deferred tax assets related to expired stock options and an increase in net unrealized gains recognized in other comprehensive income. Deferred tax assets were evaluated for realization and it was determined that no valuation allowance was needed at both September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011. This conclusion was based on available evidence of loss carryback capacity, projected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and assumptions made regarding future events.Profit Improvement PlanAs part of the 2012 annual planning process, the Corporation identified revenue enhancement and/or expense reduction initiatives (the “profit improvement plan”) in order to offset 2012 financial headwinds, such as higher pension and healthcare expenses, as well as the revenue impact of regulatory changes. Approximately one-third of the initiatives related to revenue opportunities and two-thirds related to expense reduction or increased efficiencies. The primary components of the profit improvement plan included:•Revenue enhancements, such as increasing cross-sell referrals, reviewing credit pricing, reallocation of front-line resources to faster growing businesses, and reviewing all fee-based pricing and rates on deposits.•Expense reduction/efficiency improvements, such as centralizing, standardizing and consolidating similar functions, selective outsourcing of non-core functions, consolidating vendors, reducing discretionary spending and increasing utilization of technology.The Corporation is closely monitoring the execution of these initiatives, which includes monthly progress reporting to executive management. The success of the wide range of initiatives, such as those outlined above, ranging from pricing adjustments and a more aggressive strategy of pursuing qualified referrals to better utilization of resources, can be evaluated based on the degree to which such programs were executed or are on track based on management's expectations. However, the financial impact of many of the components of the profit improvement plan cannot be quantified in isolation from year-to-date events and the operations of the Corporation. The Corporation's year-to-date September 2012 results of operations indicate that the profit improvement plan objective of offsetting higher pension and healthcare expenses and the revenue impact of regulatory changes is being achieved.50Table of ContentsBusiness SegmentsThe Corporation's operations are strategically aligned into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based upon the products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, the Finance Division is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes items not directly associated with these business segments or the Finance Division. The performance of the business segments in not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Note 13 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements presents financial results of these business segments for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011. For a description of the business activities of each business segment and the methodologies which form the basis for these results, refer to Note 13 to these unaudited financial statements and Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation's 2011 Annual Report.The following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.

Net interest income (FTE) of $1.1 billion increased $104 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the benefit provided by an increase of $3.5 billion in average loans, an increase in accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio of $23 million, an increase in net funds transfer pricing (FTP) credits, primarily due to the benefit provided by an increase of $3.7 billion in average deposits, and lower deposit rates, partially offset by lower loan yields. The provision for credit losses of $29 million decreased $7 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting a decrease in Middle Market, partially offset by an increase in Commercial Real Estate. Net credit-related charge-offs of $81 million decreased $85 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in net charge-offs in Middle Market. Noninterest income of $240 million increased $8 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a $7 million increase in commercial lending fees and smaller increases in several other noninterest income categories, partially offset by a $6 million decrease in warrant income.

Net interest income (FTE) of $488 million increased $34 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2012 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in net FTP credits, primarily due to the benefit provided by an increase of $2.2 billion in average deposits, an increase in accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio of $8 million, lower deposit rates and the benefit provided by an increase of $128 million in average loans, partially offset by lower loan yields. The provision for credit losses of $14 million decreased $49 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting decreases in Small Business and Personal Banking, both primarily in the Midwest and Western markets. Net credit-related charge-offs of $34 million decreased $40 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to decreases in Small Business in the Midwest and Western markets. Noninterest income of $131 million decreased $4 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a $15 million decrease in card fees, partially offset by $5 million increase in service charges on deposit accounts and a $5 million annual incentive bonus received in 2012 from Comerica's third party credit card provider. Noninterest expenses of $542 million increased $42 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to increases in salaries and benefit expense ($18 million), processing charges ($13 million) and core deposit intangible amortization ($4 million). The increase in processing charges and salaries and benefit expense was primarily due to the full-year impact of Sterling. The provision for income taxes (FTE) of $21 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 increased $9 million, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in income before income taxes. 51Table of ContentsWealth Management's net income of $50 million increased $13 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2011.

The provision for credit losses of $19 million decreased $10 million and net credit-related charge-offs of $18 million decreased $10 million from the comparable period in the prior year, with both decreases primarily reflecting decreases in the Western and Midwest markets, partially offset by increases in the Florida market. Noninterest income of $193 million increased $9 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase of $6 million in investment banking fees. Noninterest expenses of $236 million increased $4 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a $7 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense, partially offset by a decrease in corporate overhead expense ($4 million).

The Finance Division pays the three major business segments for the long-term value of deposits based on their assumed lives. The three major business segments pay the Finance Division for funding based on the pricing and term characteristics of their loans. The increase in net interest expense (FTE) was primarily due to an increase in average deposits in the three major business segments and a decrease in average loans in Wealth Management. Noninterest income of $44 million decreased $13 million, primarily due to gains from sales of Sterling legacy securities recognized in 2011. Noninterest expenses of $8 million were unchanged from the comparable period in the prior year. The benefit for income taxes (FTE) of $172 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 increased $22 million, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily resulting from an increase in losses before income taxes.The net loss in the Other category of $38 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 increased $15 million from the comparable period in the prior year. The increase in net loss primarily reflected a $25 million increase in noninterest expenses, partially offset by an increase of $9 million in the benefit for income taxes (FTE). The increase in noninterest expenses primarily reflected increases in litigation and legal expenses, partially offset by a decrease in merger and restructuring charges. The increase in the benefit for income taxes was primarily due to an increase in losses before income taxes.Market SegmentsMarket segment results are provided for the Corporation's four primary geographic markets: Midwest, Western, Texas and Florida.

The capital plan provides for up to $375 million in equity repurchases for the five-quarter period ending March 31, 2013. The capital plan further contemplated a 50 percent increase in the quarterly dividend, from 10 cents per share to 15 cents per share, which was approved by the Board of Directors on April 24, 2012. In addition, the capital plan included the authority to redeem the remaining $25 million of trust preferred securities outstanding as of March 31, 2012, which were redeemed effective June 15, 2012.

Assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with specified risk-weighting factors. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items. As shown in the table below, the Corporation's capital ratios decreased from December 31, 2011 to September 30, 2012.

In June 2012, U.S. banking regulators issued proposed rules for the U.S. adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework. The proposed regulatory framework includes a more conservative definition of capital, two new capital buffers - a conservation buffer and a countercyclical buffer, new and more stringent risk weight categories for assets and off-balance sheet items, and a supplemental leverage ratio. Rules are expected to be implemented between 2013 and 2019.According to the proposed rules, the Corporation will be subject to the capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses. However, the rules as proposed would not subject the Corporation to the capital countercyclical buffer of up to 2.5 percent or the supplemental leverage ratio. The Corporation currently estimates that its September 30, 2012 capital ratios would be in compliance with the fully phased-in Basel III capital rules as proposed. Under the proposed rules, the Corporation estimates the September 30, 2012 Tier 1 risk-based ratio would be 90 basis points to 110 basis points lower than the ratio calculated under the existing rules, as presented in the table above. The Basel III liquidity framework, which was not included in the June 2012 proposed rules, includes two minimum liquidity measures. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio requires a financial institution to hold a buffer of high-quality, liquid assets to fully cover net cash outflows under a 30-day systematic liquidity stress scenario. The Net Stable Funding Ratio requires the amount of available longer-term, stable sources of funding to be at least 100 percent of the required amount of longer-term stable funding over a one-year period. The Corporation's liquidity position is strong, but if subject to the Basel III liquidity framework as currently proposed, the Corporation may decide to consider additional liquidity management initiatives. While uncertainty exists in both the final form of the U.S. rules implementing the Basel III liquidity framework and whether or not the Corporation will be subject to the full requirements, the Corporation is closely monitoring the development of the rules. We expect to meet the final requirements adopted by U.S. banking regulators within regulatory timelines.57Table of ContentsRisk ManagementThe following updated information should be read in conjunction with the "Risk Management" section on pages F-23 through F-42 in the Corporation's 2011 Annual Report.Credit RiskAllowance for Credit Losses and Nonperforming AssetsThe allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The allowance for loan losses represents management's assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporation's loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in "accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets, provides for probable losses inherent in lending-related commitments, including unused commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.The Corporation disaggregates the loan portfolio into segments for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses. These segments are based on the level at which the Corporation develops, documents and applies a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The Corporation's portfolio segments are business loans and retail loans. Business loans are defined as those belonging to the commercial, real estate construction, commercial mortgage, lease financing and international loan portfolios. Retail loans consist of traditional residential mortgage, home equity and other consumer loans.The allowance for loan losses includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain loans, and allowances for homogeneous pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. The allowance for business loans not individually evaluated is determined quantitatively by applying standard reserve factors to the pool of business loans within each internal risk rating, including incremental reserves to cover losses in industries and/or portfolios experiencing elevated loss levels. The allowance also may include a qualitative adjustment, which is determined based on an established framework. The determination of the appropriate adjustment is based on management's analysis of observable macroeconomic metrics, including consideration of regional metrics within the Corporation's footprint, internal credit risk movement and a qualitative assessment of the lending environment, including underwriting standards, current economic and political conditions, and other factors affecting credit quality. The framework enables management to develop a view of the uncertainties that exist but are not yet reflected in the standard reserve factors.In the first quarter 2012, the Corporation implemented enhancements to the methodology used for determining standard reserve factors for business loans not individually evaluated. The enhancements, which resulted in an incremental increase to the allowance for loan losses of $25 million in the first quarter 2012, included (a) estimating probability of default and loss given default from a national perspective, in addition to a market-by-market basis, and (b) expanding the time horizon of historical, migration-based probability of default and loss given default experience used to develop the standard reserve factors for each internal risk rating. By expanding the horizon on migration and loss history, the Corporation is better able to capture the inherent losses in the core business loan portfolio, as the improving charge-off rates from recent periods may not be reflective of future trends given the environment of continued economic uncertainty as described below, and the expanded horizon reflects both earlier periods in the cycle that include peak periods of credit losses, as well as the more recent improvement in credit quality trends. Estimating probability of default and loss given default from a national perspective provides a deeper data pool, unites the markets on a single platform, promoting enhanced consistency across the organization, and reflects the Corporation's view that borrower performance is impacted by changes in national economic conditions in addition to changes in the local economy.The U.S. economy slowed through the second quarter 2012 with a low 1.3 percent annual growth rate for real gross domestic product. Data through the third quarter 2012 generally improved, and moderately better conditions are expected to extend into the fourth quarter 2012 as well. Despite the trend toward firmer U.S. data, significant downside risk factors remain in place, at least through mid-2013. Downside risk associated with global macroeconomic conditions, particularly in Europe and in Asia, remains significant. Also, the combination of federal tax increases and spending cuts known as the "Fiscal Cliff" is scheduled to take effect in early 2013 unless the U.S. Congress acts to change current law. According to studies conducted by the Congressional Budget Office, the "Fiscal Cliff" will push the U.S. economy back into recession in 2013 if nothing is done to change its current dimensions. In the Corporation's economic forecast for 2013 we assume that there will be a partial strength "Fiscal Cliff." This will create enough of a drag to keep growth in the U.S. economy weak through early 2013, but not enough to cause a recession. In mid-September 2012, the Federal Reserve announced a new quantitative easing program of agency mortgage-backed securities purchases, known as QE3. In addition to QE3 the Federal Reserve announced its intention to keep the federal funds rate near zero through mid-2015. A key difference between QE3 and the previous two rounds is that QE3 is an open-ended program with no set completion date. QE3 is expected to continue at least through the spring of 2013, and likely longer, until labor market conditions have significantly improved. Two benefits of QE3 are increased equity prices and decreased mortgage interest rates. Both benefits are expected to add to the current moderate pace of consumer spending and to the improving pace of new and existing home purchases for the remainder of 2012 and into 2013. Credit-fueled consumer purchasing, including cars, homes and other big-ticket items, is helping to offset the drag from weaker export markets. The Texas economy continues to be a growth leader. Oil drilling activity remains strong. However, natural gas drilling is declining in response to very low natural gas prices. As of early October 2012, the natural gas rig count was down more than 50 percent from a year ago. The Michigan economy is being supported 58Table of Contentsby gains in U.S. automotive sales. September 2012 U.S. automotive sales increased to a 14.9 million unit annual rate. Ample pent-up demand plus increasing credit availability are expected to support ongoing moderate gains in automotive sales through 2013. California is showing more momentum, boosted by strengthening economic activity in Northern California. The allowance for loan losses was $647 million at September 30, 2012, compared to $726 million at December 31, 2011, a decrease of $79 million, or 11 percent. The decrease resulted primarily from improvements in credit quality, in part reflecting improvements in the U.S. economy as discussed above, partially offset by increased loan volumes and increases in the allowance for loan losses resulting from the methodology enhancements described above and an increase in qualitative factors that indicate overall economic uncertainty. Improvements in credit quality included a decline of $814 million in the Corporation's internal watch list loans from December 31, 2011 to September 30, 2012, a decrease in the inflow to nonaccrual (based on an analysis of nonaccrual loans with balances greater than $2 million) of $278 million and a decrease in net credit-related charge-offs of $135 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2011. The $79 million decrease in the allowance for loan losses primarily reflected decreases in Commercial Real Estate, Middle Market and Small Business. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total period-end loans was 1.46 percent at September 30, 2012, compared to 1.70 percent at December 31, 2011. Nonperforming loans of $692 million at September 30, 2012 decreased $195 million, compared to December 31, 2011. Loan charge-offs are taken as amounts are determined to be uncollectible. A measure of the level of charge-offs already taken on nonaccrual loans is the current book balance as a percentage of the contractual amount owed. At both September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, nonaccrual loans were charged-off to approximately 60 percent of the contractual amount. This level of write-downs is consistent with losses experienced on loan defaults in the first nine months of 2012 and in recent years. The allowance as a percentage of total nonperforming loans was 94 percent at September 30, 2012, compared to 82 percent at December 31, 2011. The Corporation's loan portfolio is primarily composed of business loans, which, in the event of default, are typically carried on the books at fair value as nonperforming assets for a longer period of time than are consumer loans, which are generally fully charged off when they become nonperforming, resulting in a lower nonperforming loan allowance coverage when compared to banking organizations with higher concentrations of consumer loans.Loans acquired from Sterling were initially recorded at fair value, which included an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans, and therefore no corresponding allowance for loan losses was recorded for these loans at acquisition. Methods utilized to estimate the required allowance for loan losses for acquired loans not deemed credit-impaired at acquisition are similar to originated loans; however, the estimate of loss is based on the unpaid principal balance less the remaining purchase discount. At September 30, 2012, the allowance for loan losses on loans acquired from Sterling was $2 million, and $49 million of purchase discount remained, compared to no allowance for loan losses and $96 million of purchase discounts at December 31, 2011. Purchased credit impaired (PCI) loans are not considered nonperforming loans.The total allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb incurred losses inherent in the total loan portfolio. Unanticipated economic events, including political, economic and regulatory instability could cause changes in the credit characteristics of the portfolio and result in an unanticipated increase in the allowance. Inclusion of other industry-specific portfolio exposures in the allowance, as well as significant increases in the current portfolio exposures, could also increase the amount of the allowance. Any of these events, or some combination thereof, may result in the need for additional provision for loan losses in order to maintain an allowance that complies with credit risk and accounting policies. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain letters of credit in a manner consistent with business loans, and allowances based on the pool of the remaining letters of credit and all unused commitments to extend credit within each internal risk rating.The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $35 million at September 30, 2012, an increase of $9 million from $26 million at December 31, 2011. The $9 million increase in the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments resulted primarily from the establishment of specific reserves in the second quarter 2012 for set aside/bonded stop loss commitments related to residential real estate construction credits in the Western Market and an increase in the probability of draw applied to all remaining unfunded commitments effective September 30, 2012 as a result of updated analysis of borrower draw behavior. An allowance for credit losses will be recorded on Sterling lending-related commitments only to the extent that the required allowance exceeds the remaining purchase discount. At September 30, 2012, $2 million of purchase discount for lending-related commitments acquired from Sterling remained and no allowance was recorded, compared to $3 million of remaining purchase discount and no allowance at December 31, 2011.59Table of ContentsNonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, troubled debt restructured loans (TDRs) which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans) and real estate which has been acquired through foreclosure and is awaiting disposition (foreclosed property). Nonperforming TDRs, other than reduced-rate loans, are on nonaccrual status. Nonperforming assets do not include PCI loans. Nonperforming assets decreased $226 million to $755 million at September 30, 2012, from $981 million at December 31, 2011. The table below presents nonperforming asset balances by category.

At September 30, 2012 there were 1,655 borrowers with nonaccrual loan balances, an increase of 564 borrowers compared to December 31, 2011. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of borrowers with nonaccrual loan balances under $2 million which primarily resulted from modification made to the Corporation's residential mortgage and home equity nonaccrual policies as described later in this section.

At the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, interest previously accrued but not collected is charged against current income. Income on such loans is then recognized only to the extent that cash is received and the future collection of principal is probable. Generally, a loan may be returned to accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest have been received and the Corporation expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest, generally based on a period of sustained payment performance, normally at least six months, or when the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation's 2011 Annual Report for further information regarding impaired loans.Business loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when management determines that full collection of principal or interest is unlikely or when principal or interest payments are 90 days past due, unless the loan is fully collateralized and in the process of collection. The primary driver of when the principal amount of a business loan should be fully or partially charged off is based on a qualitative assessment of the recoverability of the principal amount from collateral and other cash flow sources. In the second quarter of 2012, the Corporation modified its residential mortgage and home equity nonaccrual policy. Under the new policy, residential mortgage and home equity loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status once they become 90 days past due (previously no later than 180 days past due) and are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell no later than 180 days past due. In addition, effective second quarter 2012, the Corporation placed on nonaccrual status certain current junior lien home equity loans in which the Corporation holds and services the senior position, when full collection of the senior position is in doubt. In the third quarter 2012, the Corporation applied the same policy to junior lien home equity loans held by the Corporation for which the senior liens are serviced by others. Effective September 30, 2012, substantially all junior lien home equity loans that are current or less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status when full collection of the senior position is in doubt. In the third quarter 2012, in connection with recently issued regulatory guidance, the Corporation further modified its nonaccrual and charge-off policy regarding Chapter 7 bankruptcy residential mortgage and consumer loans for which the court has discharged the borrower's obligation and the borrower has not reaffirmed the debt. Effective September 30, 2012, such loans are placed on nonaccrual status and written down to estimated collateral value, without regard to the actual payment status of the loan, and are classified as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). These modifications resulted in $4 million of write-downs and $8 million of nonaccrual TDRs. Of the $8 million of nonaccrual TDRs, $6 million were previously considered nonaccrual loans, therefore the net increase to nonperforming assets was $2 million. Other consumer loans are generally not placed on nonaccrual status and are charged off at no later than 120 days past due.62Table of Contents At September 30, 2012, TDRs totaled $326 million, of which $207 million were nonperforming ($180 million nonaccrual TDRs and $27 million reduced-rate TDRs) and $119 million were considered performing. Performing TDRs included $65 million of commercial loans (primarily in Middle Market, Corporate and Private Banking) and $54 million of commercial mortgage loans (primarily in Middle Market and Commercial Real Estate) at September 30, 2012. At December 31, 2011, TDRs totaled $331 million, including $206 million nonaccrual TDRs, $27 million reduced-rate TDRs and $98 million TDRs considered performing. The $3 million decrease in total TDRs was the result of payment and payoff activity, as well as loan sales, and primarily reflected a decrease in Middle Market, partially offset by increases in Commercial Real Estate and Personal Banking.Loans past due 30-89 days decreased $118 million to $157 million at September 30, 2012, compared to $275 million at December 31, 2011. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest generally represent loans that are well collateralized and in a continuing process of collection. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing are summarized in the following table. The decrease in residential mortgage and consumer loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest from December 31, 2011 to September 30, 2012 in the table below was primarily due to the change in nonaccrual policy discussed previously.(in millions)September 30, 2012 December 31, 2011Business loans:   Commercial$12 $8Real estate construction2 1Commercial mortgage16 32Total business loans30 41Retail loans:   Residential mortgage— 6Home equity— 6Other consumer6 5Total retail loans6 17Total loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing$36 $58The following table presents a summary of total internal watch list loans.

Of the foreclosed properties with balances greater than $2 million at September 30, 2012, $11 million were from Middle Market and $8 million were from Private Banking. At September 30, 2012, there were no foreclosed properties with a carrying value greater than $10 million, compared to one foreclosed property with a carrying value of $18 million at December 31, 2011.For further information regarding credit quality and the allowance for credit losses, refer to Note 4 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements.Commercial and Residential Real Estate LendingThe following table summarizes the Corporation's commercial real estate loan portfolio by loan category as of September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011.(in millions)September 30, 2012 December 31, 2011Real estate construction loans:   Commercial Real Estate business line (a)$1,003 $1,103Other business lines (b)389 430Total real estate construction loans$1,392 $1,533Commercial mortgage loans:   Commercial Real Estate business line (a)$2,020 $2,507Other business lines (b)7,539 7,757Total commercial mortgage loans$9,559 $10,264(a)Primarily loans to real estate investors and developers.(b)Primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate.The Corporation limits risk inherent in its commercial real estate lending activities by limiting exposure to those borrowers directly involved in the commercial real estate markets and adhering to conservative policies on loan-to-value ratios for such loans. Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $11.0 billion at September 30, 2012, of which $3.0 billion, or 28 percent, were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to real estate investors and developers. The remaining $8.0 billion, or 72 percent, of commercial real estate loans in other business lines consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans. The real estate construction loan portfolio totaled $1.4 billion at September 30, 2012. The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-time customers with satisfactory completion experience. Of the $1.0 billion of real estate construction loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line, $45 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2012. Real estate construction loan charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012. In other business lines, $6 million of real estate construction loans were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2012 and charge-offs totaled $1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012.The commercial mortgage loan portfolio totaled $9.6 billion at September 30, 2012 and included $2.0 billion in the Commercial Real Estate business line and $7.6 billion in other business lines. Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Of the $2.0 billion of commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line, $137 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2012. Commercial mortgage loan charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $41 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012. In other business lines, $219 million of commercial mortgage loans were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2012 and charge-offs totaled $37 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012. 64Table of ContentsThe geographic distribution and project type of commercial real estate loans are important factors in diversifying credit risk within the portfolio.

Residential mortgages totaled $1.5 billion at September 30, 2012, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.5 billion of 65Table of Contentsresidential mortgage loans outstanding, $69 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2012. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.6 billion at September 30, 2012, of which $1.4 billion was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit and $164 million consisted of closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.6 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $28 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2012. A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at September 30, 2012. The Corporation rarely originates residential real estate loans with loan-to-value ratios above 100 percent at origination, has no sub-prime mortgage programs and does not originate payment-option adjustable-rate mortgages or other nontraditional mortgages that allow negative amortization. A significant majority of residential mortgage originations are sold in the secondary market. Since 2008, the Corporation has used a third party to originate, document and underwrite residential mortgage loans on behalf of the Corporation. Under this arrangement, the third party assumes repurchase liability for the loans it originates. The Corporation has repurchase liability exposure for residential mortgage loans originated prior to 2008, however based on historical experience, the Corporation believes such exposure, which could be triggered by underwriting discrepancies, is minimal. The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation's primary geographic markets. The economic recession and significant declines in home values in the Western, Florida and Midwest markets following the financial market turmoil beginning in the fall of 2008 adversely impacted the residential real estate portfolio. At September 30, 2012, all residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more were placed on nonaccrual status, and substantially all junior lien home equity loans that were current or less than 90 days past due were placed on nonaccrual status if full collection of the senior position was in doubt. Such loans are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell no later than 180 days past due. Shared National CreditsShared National Credit (SNC) loans are facilities greater than $20 million shared by three or more federally supervised financial institutions that are reviewed annually by regulatory authorities at the agent bank level. The Corporation generally seeks to obtain ancillary business at the origination of a SNC relationship. Loans classified as SNC loans (approximately 897 borrowers at September 30, 2012) totaled $9.3 billion at September 30, 2012, compared to $8.4 billion at December 31, 2011. SNC net loan charge-offs totaled $2 million and $20 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, respectively, compared to $4 million and $18 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011. SNC loans, diversified by both business line and geographic market, comprised approximately 21 percent and 20 percent of total loans at September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. SNC loans are held to the same credit underwriting and pricing standards as the remainder of the loan portfolio. Energy LendingThe Corporation has a portfolio of energy-related loans that are included primarily in "commercial loans" in the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation has over 30 years of experience in energy lending, with a focus on middle market companies. Average loans in the Middle Market - Energy business line for the three months ended September 30, 2012 were $2.6 billion, or 6 percent of total average loans, compared to $1.9 billion, or 5 percent of total average loans, for the three months ended December 31, 2011. Energy loans are diverse in nature, with outstanding balances by customer market segment distributed approximately as follows: 70 percent Exploration and Production (comprised of approximately 50 percent oil, 30 percent natural gas and 20 percent mixed), 20 percent Midstream and 10 percent Energy Services.Automotive LendingSubstantially all dealer loans are in the National Dealer Services business line. Loans in the National Dealer Services business line include floor plan financing and other loans to automotive dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in “commercial loans” in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $2.3 billion at September 30, 2012, an increase of $454 million compared to $1.8 billion at December 31, 2011, primarily reflecting supply chain restocking related to the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami. At September 30, 2012 other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $2.1 billion, including $1.4 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans, compared to $1.9 billion of other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Services business line, including $1.4 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans, at December 31, 2011. Automotive lending also includes loans to borrowers involved with automotive production, primarily Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers. Loans to borrowers involved with automotive production totaled approximately $1.1 billion at September 30, 2012, compared to $931 million at December 31, 2011.66Table of ContentsState and Local MunicipalitiesIn the normal course of business, the Corporation serves the needs of state and local municipalities in multiple capacities, including traditional banking products such as deposit services, loans and letters of credit, investment banking services such as bond underwriting and private placements, and by investing in municipal securities. The following table summarizes the Corporation's direct exposure to state and local municipalities as of September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011.

Additionally, the Corporation is exposed to Automated Clearing House (ACH) transaction risk for those municipalities utilizing this electronic payment and/or deposit method and similar products in their cash flow management. The Corporation sets limits on ACH activity during the underwriting process.Extensions of credit to state and local municipalities are subjected to the same underwriting standards as other business loans. At September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, all outstanding municipal loans and leases were performing according to contractual terms and none were included in the Corporation's internal watch list. Municipal leases are secured by the underlying equipment, and a substantial majority of the leases are fully defeased with AAA-rated U.S. government securities. Substantially all municipal investment securities available-for sale are auction-rate securities. All auction-rate securities are reviewed quarterly for other-than-temporary impairment. All auction-rate municipal securities were rated investment grade, and all auction-rate preferred securities collateralized by municipal securities were rated AAA or the equivalent and were adequately collateralized at both September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011. Municipal securities are held in the trading account for resale to customers. In addition, Comerica Securities, a broker-dealer subsidiary of Comerica Bank, underwrites bonds issued by municipalities. All bonds underwritten by Comerica Securities are sold to third party investors. 67Table of ContentsEuropean ExposureThe Corporation does not hold any sovereign exposure to Europe.

Interest rate risk arises primarily through the Corporation's core business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by a combination of core deposits and wholesale borrowings. Approximately 85 percent of the Corporation's loans were floating at September 30, 2012, of which approximately 75 percent were based on LIBOR and 25 percent were based on Prime. This creates a natural imbalance between the floating-rate loan portfolio and the more slowly repricing deposit products. The result is that growth and/or contraction in the Corporation's core businesses may lead to sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing investment securities, primarily fixed-rate, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, and hedging the sensitivity with interest rate swaps. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk, with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.68Table of ContentsThe Corporation frequently evaluates net interest income under various balance sheet and interest rate scenarios, looking at a 12-month time horizon, using simulation modeling analysis as its principal risk management evaluation technique. The results of this analysis provides the information needed to assess the balance sheet structure. Changes in economic activity, whether domestic or international, different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis could translate into a materially different interest rate environment than currently expected. Management evaluates a base case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment and what is believed to be the most likely balance sheet structure. This base case net interest income is then evaluated against non-parallel interest rate scenarios that increase and decrease 200 basis points in a linear fashion from the base case over 12 months, resulting in an average change in interest rates of 100 basis points over the period. Due to the current low level of interest rates, the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of a 25 basis point drop, to zero percent. In addition, consistent with each interest rate scenario, adjustments are made to assumptions regarding asset prepayment levels, yield curves, and overall balance sheet mix and growth. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model may not precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income. Additionally, the estimated impact on net interest income over the 12-month time horizon is generally not linear relative to other time horizons. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions and management strategies, among other factors. However, the model can indicate the likely direction of change. Existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes are included in the analysis, but no additional hedging is forecasted. The table below, as of September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above. The sensitivity from December 31, 2011 to September 30, 2012 increased primarily due to growth in core deposits, though risk to declining interest rates is limited by the current low level of rates.

The economic value of equity analysis begins with an estimate of the economic value of the financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments on the Corporation's balance sheet, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period. Next, the estimated impact of rate movements is applied to the economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments. The economic value of equity is then calculated as the difference between the estimated market value of assets and liabilities net of the impact of off-balance sheet instruments. As with net interest income simulation analysis, a variety of alternative scenarios are performed to measure the impact on economic value of equity, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve.The table below, as of September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from a 200 basis point immediate parallel increase or decrease in interest rates. Similar to the simulation analysis above, due to the current low level of interest rates, the economic value of equity analyses below reflect an interest rate scenario of an immediate 25 basis point drop, to zero percent, while the rising interest rate scenario reflects an immediate 200 basis point rise. The change in the sensitivity of the economic value of equity to a 200 basis point parallel increase in rates between December 31, 2011 and September 30, 2012 was primarily driven by changes in market interest rates, increases in noninterest-bearing and lower cost deposits, and forecasted prepayments on the Corporation's mortgage-backed securities portfolio.

Liquid assets, which totaled $11.9 billion at September 30, 2012, compared to $11.2 billion at December 31, 2011, provide a reservoir of liquidity. Liquid assets include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits with banks, other short-term investments and unencumbered investment securities available-for-sale. At September 30, 2012, the Corporation held excess liquidity, represented by $2.9 billion deposited with the FRB, compared to $2.5 billion at December 31, 2011.The Corporation may access the purchased funds market when necessary, which includes foreign office time deposits and short-term borrowings. Capacity for incremental purchased funds at September 30, 2012 included the ability to purchase 69Table of Contentsfederal funds, sell securities under agreements to repurchase, as well as issue deposits to institutional investors and issue certificates of deposit through brokers. Purchased funds totaled $549 million at September 30, 2012, compared to $418 million at December 31, 2011. The Corporation is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, Texas (FHLB), which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. As of September 30, 2012, the Corporation had $2.0 billion of outstanding borrowings from the FHLB with remaining maturities ranging from May 2013 to May 2014. Additionally, the Bank had the ability to issue up to $15.0 billion of debt at September 30, 2012 under an existing $15 billion medium-term senior note program which allows the issuance of debt with maturities between three months and 30 years. The Corporation also maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and/or equity securities. The ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise funds at competitive rates is impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings of the Corporation and the Bank. As of September 30, 2012, the four major rating agencies had assigned the following ratings to long-term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.September 30, 2012Comerica Incorporated Comerica BankStandard and Poor’sA- AMoody’s Investors ServiceA3 A2Fitch Ratings (a)A ADBRSA A (High)(a) In July 2012, Fitch Ratings revised the Corporation's outlook to “Negative” from “Stable.”Other Market RisksMarket risk related to the Corporation's trading instruments is not significant, as trading activities are limited. Certain components of the Corporation's noninterest income, primarily fiduciary income, are at risk to fluctuations in the market values of underlying assets, particularly equity and debt securities. Other components of noninterest income, primarily brokerage fees, are at risk to changes in the volume of market activity. At September 30, 2012 , the Corporation had a $14 million portfolio of investments in indirect private equity and venture capital funds, with commitments of $7 million to fund additional investments in future periods, compared to a portfolio of $15 million, with unfunded commitments of $9 million, at December 31, 2011. The value of these investments is at risk to changes in equity markets, general economic conditions and a variety of other factors. The majority of these investments are not readily marketable and are included in “accrued income and other assets” on the consolidated balance sheets. The investments are individually reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value.For further discussion of market risk, see Note 5 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements and pages F-36 through F-41 in the Corporation's 2011 Annual Report.Critical Accounting PoliciesThe Corporation’s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation’s 2011 Annual Report. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation’s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2011, the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to the allowance for credit losses, valuation methodologies, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages F-43 through F-48 in the Corporation’s 2011 Annual Report.The following is the critical accounting policy for goodwill reflecting the results of the most recent impairment test performed in the third quarter 2012. As of the date of this report, the Corporation does not believe there are any other material changes in the nature or categories of the critical accounting policies or estimates and assumptions from those discussed in the Corporation’s 2011 Annual Report.GoodwillGoodwill is the value attributed to unidentifiable intangible elements in acquired businesses. Goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level, equivalent to a business segment or one level below. The Corporation has three reporting units: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. At September 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $635 million, 70Table of Contentsincluding $380 million allocated to the Business Bank, $194 million allocated to the Retail Bank and $61 million allocated to Wealth Management. The Corporation performs its annual evaluation of goodwill impairment in the third quarter of each year and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests suggest additional testing may be warranted to determine if goodwill might be impaired. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step test. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of identified reporting units with their carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. In performing the annual impairment test, the carrying value of each reporting unit is the greater of economic or regulatory capital. The Corporation assigns economic capital using internal management methodologies on the basis of each reporting unit's credit, operational and interest rate risks, as well as goodwill. To determine regulatory capital, each reporting unit is assigned sufficient capital such that their respective Tier 1 common ratio, based on allocated risk-weighted assets, is the same as that of the Corporation. Using this two-pronged approach, the Corporation's equity is fully allocated to its reporting units except for capital held primarily for the risk associated with the securities portfolio which is assigned to the Finance segment of the Corporation. Determining the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process involving the use of estimates and judgments related to the selection of inputs such as future cash flows, discount rates, comparable public company multiples, applicable control premiums and economic expectations used in determining the interest rate environment. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are determined using a blend of two commonly used valuation techniques: the market approach and the income approach. For the market approach, valuations of reporting units consider a combination of earnings, equity and other multiples from companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit. Since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of noncontrolling interests, the valuations accordingly incorporate a control premium. For the income approach, estimated future cash flows and terminal value are discounted. Estimated future cash flows are derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for each reporting unit which incorporate uncertainty factors inherent to long-term projections. The applicable discount rate is based on the imputed cost of equity capital appropriate for each reporting unit, which incorporates the risk-free rate of return, the level of non-diversified risk associated with companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit (beta), an entity-specific risk premium and a market equity risk premium. In January 2012, the Federal Reserve announced their expectation for the Federal Funds target rate to remain at currently low levels through late 2014. Given the potential for a continued low interest rate environment, the Corporation determined that an interim goodwill impairment test should be performed in the first quarter 2012. As part of the impairment analysis, the Corporation incorporated the Federal Reserve's expectation of the low Federal Fund target rate level through 2014 in its forecasts. In the first quarter 2012, the Corporation engaged an independent valuation specialist to review its valuation models and assumptions. Based on the results of this review and in light of the current rate environment, the Corporation updated its assumptions, discount factors and control premiums. The updated assumptions included maintaining the low Federal funds target rate through the end of 2014. For the years after 2014, the Corporation developed rate assumptions based on the expectation of modest increases in the Federal Funds target rate, eventually reaching a normal interest rate environment. Increases to the fair value of the reporting units were in part a result of the improvement in the stock price of the Corporation as well as the stock prices of the guideline companies used in the market approach. The first step of the interim goodwill impairment test performed in the first quarter 2012 indicated that the estimated fair values of each of the reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values, including goodwill. The fair value of the Retail Bank exceeded the carrying value by 14 percent. The results of the goodwill impairment test for each reporting unit were subjected to stress testing as appropriate. The annual test of goodwill impairment was performed as of the beginning of the third quarter 2012. The Corporation's assumptions included maintaining the low Federal funds target rate through the end of 2014 with modest increases thereafter until eventually reaching a normal interest rate environment. In September 2012, the Federal Reserve updated their expectation for the Federal Funds target rate to remain at currently low levels through mid-2015. This announcement by the Federal Reserve did not significantly impact the results of the annual goodwill impairment test. Increases to the estimated fair value of the Retail Bank were in part a result of lower imputed cost of equity capital, due particularly to improvements to the level of non-diversified risk, and continued improvement in the stock price of the Corporation as well as the stock prices of the guideline companies used in the market approach. At the conclusion of the first step of the interim goodwill impairment tests performed in the third quarter 2012, the estimated fair values of all reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying amounts, including goodwill. The results of the annual of the goodwill impairment test for each reporting unit were subjected to stress testing as appropriate. Economic conditions impact the assumptions related to interest and growth rates, loss rates and imputed cost of equity capital. The fair value estimates for each reporting unit incorporated current economic and market conditions, including the recent Federal Reserve announcements and the impact of legislative and regulatory changes, to the extent known and as described above. However, further weakening in the economic environment, such as adverse changes in interest rates, a decline in the performance 71Table of Contentsof the reporting units or other factors could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below their carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Additionally, new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management's expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Any impairment charge would not affect the Corporation's regulatory capital ratios, tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position.Supplemental Financial DataThe following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this financial review with financial measures defined by GAAP.(dollar amounts in millions)September 30, 2012 December 31, 2011Tier 1 Common Capital Ratio:   Tier 1 capital (a) (b)$6,685 $6,582Less:   Trust preferred securities— 25Tier 1 common capital (b)$6,685 $6,557Risk-weighted assets (a) (b)$64,772 $63,244Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio (b)10.32% 10.41%Tier 1 common capital ratio (b)10.32 10.37Tangible Common Equity Ratio:   Common shareholders' equity$7,084 $6,868Less:   Goodwill635 635Other intangible assets25 32Tangible common equity$6,424 $6,201Total assets$63,314 $61,008Less:   Goodwill635 635Other intangible assets25 32Tangible assets$62,654 $60,341Common equity ratio11.19% 11.26%Tangible common equity ratio10.25 10.27Tangible Common Equity per Share of Common Stock:   Common shareholders' equity$7,084 $6,868Tangible common equity6,424 6,201Shares of common stock outstanding (in millions)191 197Common shareholders' equity per share of common stock$37.01 $34.80Tangible common equity per share of common stock33.56 31.42(a)Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as defined by regulation.(b)September 30, 2012 Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets are estimated.The Tier 1 common capital ratio removes qualifying trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations. The tangible common equity ratio removes the effect of intangible assets from capital and the effect of intangible assets from total assets and tangible common equity per share of common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders' equity per share of common stock. The Corporation believes these measurements are meaningful measures of capital adequacy used by investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and to compare against other companies in the industry.72Table of ContentsITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskQuantitative and qualitative disclosures for the current period can be found in the "Market and Liquidity Risk" section of "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures(a)Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Corporation maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Corporation’s management, including the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management has evaluated, with the participation of the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report (the “Evaluation Date”). Based on the evaluation, the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.(b)Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. During the period to which this report relates, there have not been any changes in the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, such controls.PART II. OTHER INFORMATIONITEM 1. Legal ProceedingsFor information regarding the Corporation’s legal proceedings, see “Part I. Item 1. Note 12 – Contingent Liabilities,” which is incorporated herein by reference.ITEM 1A. Risk FactorsOther than as set forth below, there has been no material change in the Corporation’s risk factors as previously disclosed in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 in response to Part I, Item 1A. of such Form 10-K. Such risk factors are incorporated herein by reference.Below we amend the following risk factor discussed in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011:•Any reduction in our credit rating could adversely affect Comerica and/or the holders of its securities. Rating agencies regularly evaluate Comerica, and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including Comerica's financial strength as well as factors not entirely within its control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. There can be no assurance that Comerica will maintain its current ratings. In March 2012, Moody's Investors Service downgraded Comerica's long-term and short-term senior credit ratings one notch to A3 and P-2, respectively. In July 2012, Fitch Ratings revised Comerica's outlook to “Negative” from “Stable.” While recent credit rating actions have had little to no detrimental impact on Comerica's profitability, borrowing costs, or ability to access the capital markets, future downgrades to Comerica's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings could adversely affect Comerica's profitability, borrowing costs, or ability to access the capital markets or otherwise have a negative effect on Comerica's results of operations or financial condition and, if such reduction placed Comerica's or its subsidiaries' credit ratings below investment grade, could also create obligations or liabilities under the terms of existing arrangements that could increase Comerica's costs under such arrangements. Additionally, a downgrade of the credit rating of any particular security issued by Comerica or its subsidiaries could negatively affect the ability of the holders of that security to sell the securities and the prices at which any such securities may be sold.ITEM 2.
