The Corporation does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect facts, circumstances, assumptions or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made. For any forward-looking statements made in this report or in any documents, the Corporation claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.37Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSNet income for the three months ended September 30, 2015 was $136 million, a decrease of $18 million from $154 million  reported for the three months ended September 30, 2014. The decrease in net income primarily reflected increases in the provision for credit losses and noninterest expenses, partially offset by an increase in net interest income. Net income per diluted common share was $0.74 and $0.82 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and average diluted common shares were 181 million and 185 million for each respective period.Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $405 million, a decrease of $39 million from $444 million  reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The decrease in net income was largely due to the same reasons as described in the quarterly discussion above, partially offset by a benefit from the net release of litigation reserves. Net income per diluted common share was $2.20 and $2.35 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Average diluted common shares were 182 million and 186 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.Full-Year and Fourth Quarter 2015 Outlook Management expectations for full-year 2015 compared to full-year 2014 have not changed from the previously provided outlook:•Average full-year loan growth consistent with 2014.•Net interest income relatively stable, assuming no rise in interest rates.•Provision for credit losses higher.•Noninterest income relatively stable, excluding the impact of a change in accounting presentation for a card program.•Noninterest expenses higher, excluding the impact of a change in accounting presentation for a card program, with continued focus on driving efficiencies for the long term. Technology and regulatory expenses are expected to increase approximately $40 million in total compared to 2014.•Income tax expense to approximate 32 percent of pre-tax income.For fourth quarter 2015 compared to third quarter 2015, management expects the following, assuming a continuation of the current economic and low-rate environment:•Average loans relatively stable, reflecting a seasonal decline in Mortgage Banker Finance, a continued decline in Energy and small increases in other lines of business.•Net interest income relatively stable, with a contribution from earning asset growth approximately offset by continued pressure on yields from the low rate environment.•Provision for credit losses remains low, with fourth quarter provision at a level similar to the third quarter. Continued negative migration of loans related to energy is possible, which may be offset by lower exposure balances.•Noninterest income slightly higher, with growth in card fees, along with fiduciary income and investment banking fees should markets improve. The levels of warrant income, hedge ineffectiveness income and deferred compensation asset losses experienced in the third quarter 2015 are not expected to repeat, but are difficult to predict.•Noninterest expenses moderately higher, reflecting seasonal increases in benefits expense, outside processing, marketing and occupancy expenses. The levels of litigation-related expense, share-based compensation and deferred compensation plan expense experienced in the third quarter 2015 are not expected to repeat, but are difficult to predict. For information about the change in accounting presentation for a card program, refer to Note 1 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements and the "Noninterest Income" subheading later in this section of the financial review.38Table of ContentsNet Interest IncomeThe "Quarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent" table that follows provides an analysis of net interest income (FTE) for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 and details the components of the change in net interest income on a FTE basis for the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year.Quarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent (FTE) Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 September 30, 2014(dollar amounts in millions)AverageBalanceInterestAverageRate AverageBalanceInterestAverageRateCommercial loans$31,900$2443.04% $30,188$2363.11%Real estate construction loans1,833163.47 1,973173.41Commercial mortgage loans8,691743.39 8,698763.45Lease financing78863.16 82342.33International loans1,401133.51 1,417133.59Residential mortgage loans1,882183.79 1,792173.76Consumer loans2,477203.21 2,268193.24Total loans (a)48,9723913.17 47,1593823.22        Mortgage-backed securities (b)9,099502.21 9,020522.29Other investment securities1,13341.26 368—0.43Total investment securities (b)10,232542.11 9,388522.22        Interest-bearing deposits with banks6,86940.25 5,01530.25Other short-term investments118—0.82 110—0.54Total earning assets66,1914492.70 61,6724372.82        Cash and due from banks1,095   963  Allowance for loan losses(628)   (601)  Accrued income and other assets4,675   4,364  Total assets$71,333   $66,398          Money market and interest-bearing checking deposits$24,29870.11 $23,14660.11Savings deposits1,860—0.02 1,759—0.03Customer certificates of deposit4,23240.37 4,82440.36Foreign office time deposits127—0.70 15911.43Total interest-bearing deposits30,517110.14 29,888110.15Short-term borrowings91—0.04 231—0.03Medium- and long-term debt3,175151.85 2,649111.75Total interest-bearing sources33,783260.30 32,768220.28        Noninterest-bearing deposits28,623   25,275  Accrued expenses and other liabilities1,368   944  Total shareholders’ equity7,559   7,411  Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity$71,333   $66,398          Net interest income/rate spread (FTE) $4232.40  $4152.54        FTE adjustment $1   $1         Impact of net noninterest-bearing sources of funds  0.14   0.13Net interest margin (as a percentage of average earning assets) (FTE) (a)  2.54%   2.67%(a)Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio of $2 million and $3 million in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, increased the net interest margin by 1 basis point and 2 basis points in each respective period.(b)Includes investment securities available-for-sale and investment securities held-to-maturity.39Table of ContentsQuarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent (FTE) (continued) Three Months Ended September 30, 2015/September 30, 2014(in millions)Increase(Decrease)Due to RateIncrease(Decrease)Due to Volume (a)NetIncrease(Decrease)Interest Income (FTE):      Loans$(5) $14 $9 Investment securities (b)(1) 3 2 Interest-bearing deposits with banks— 1 1 Total interest income (FTE)(6) 18 12 Interest Expense:      Interest-bearing deposits(1) 1 — Medium- and long-term debt1 3 4 Total interest expense— 4 4 Net interest income (FTE)$(6) $14 $8 (a)Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume.(b)Includes investment securities available-for-sale and investment securities held-to-maturity.Net interest income was $422 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $8 million compared to $414 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014. The increase in net interest income resulted primarily from the benefit provided by an increase in average earning assets, partially offset by the impact of lower yields on loans and investment securities as well as higher funding costs. Average earning assets increased $4.5 billion, or 7 percent, to $66.2 billion, compared to $61.7 billion for the same period in 2014. The increase in average earning assets primarily reflected increases of $1.9 billion in average interest-bearing deposits with banks, $1.8 billion in average loans and $844 million in average investment securities. The net interest margin (FTE) for the three months ended September 30, 2015 decreased 13 basis points to 2.54 percent, from 2.67 percent for the comparable period in 2014, primarily from increased balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB), lower yields on loans and investment securities, and an increase in average medium- and long-term debt. The decrease in loan yields primarily reflected shifts in the average loan portfolio mix and the impact of a competitive low-rate environment, partially offset by a benefit from the increase in 30-day LIBOR. Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio increased the net interest margin by 1 basis point for the three months ended September 30, 2015, compared to 2 basis points for the same period in 2014. Average balances deposited with the FRB were $6.7 billion and $4.9 billion in the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are included in "interest bearing deposits with banks" on the consolidated balance sheets.40Table of ContentsYear-to-Date Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent (FTE) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 September 30, 2014(dollar amounts in millions)AverageBalanceInterestAverageRate AverageBalanceInterestAverageRateCommercial loans$31,596$7213.05% $29,487$6893.12%Real estate construction loans1,859483.44 1,905493.42Commercial mortgage loans8,6482203.40 8,7392463.77Lease financing793193.13 840203.23International loans1,455393.63 1,349373.64Residential mortgage loans1,872533.78 1,763503.81Consumer loans2,432593.23 2,244543.21Total loans (a)48,6551,1593.19 46,3271,1453.30        Mortgage-backed securities (b)9,0761512.23 8,9761592.36Other investment securities95091.18 36910.44Total investment securities (b)10,0261602.13 9,3451602.28        Interest-bearing deposits with banks5,774110.25 4,803100.25Other short-term investments106—0.78 110—0.60Total earning assets64,5611,3302.76 60,5851,3152.90        Cash and due from banks1,054   932  Allowance for loan losses(614)   (602)  Accrued income and other assets4,687   4,420  Total assets$69,688   $65,335          Money market and interest-bearing checking deposits$23,973200.11 $22,571180.11Savings deposits1,827—0.02 1,734—0.03Customer certificates of deposit4,359120.37 4,990130.36Foreign office and other time deposits12311.13 30420.68Total interest-bearing deposits30,282330.14 29,599330.15Short-term borrowings93—0.05 209—0.03Medium- and long-term debt2,843381.80 3,061391.67Total interest-bearing sources33,218710.28 32,869720.29        Noninterest-bearing deposits27,569   24,182  Accrued expenses and other liabilities1,393   960  Total shareholders’ equity7,508   7,324  Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity$69,688   $65,335          Net interest income/rate spread (FTE) $1,2592.48  $1,2432.61        FTE adjustment $3   $3         Impact of net noninterest-bearing sources of funds  0.13   0.13Net interest margin (as a percentage of average earning assets (FTE) (a)  2.61%   2.74%(a)Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio of $6 million and $25 million in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, increased the net interest margin by 1 basis point and 6 basis points in each respective period.(b)Includes investment securities available-for-sale and investment securities held-to-maturity.41Table of ContentsYear-to-Date Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent (FTE) (continued) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015/September 30, 2014(in millions)Increase(Decrease)Due to RateIncrease(Decrease)Due to Volume (a)NetIncrease(Decrease)Interest Income (FTE):      Loans$(41) $55 $14 Investment securities (b)(6) 6 — Interest-bearing deposits with banks— 1 1 Total interest income (FTE)(47) 62 15 Interest Expense:      Interest-bearing deposits1 (1) — Medium- and long-term debt3 (4) (1) Total interest expense4 (5) (1) Net interest income (FTE)$(51) $67 $16 (a)Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume.(b)Includes investment securities available-for-sale and investment securities held-to-maturity.Net interest income was $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $16 million compared to $1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The increase in net interest income resulted primarily from the benefit provided by an increase in average earning assets, partially offset by the impact of lower yields on loans and investment securities. Average earning assets increased $4.0 billion, or 7 percent, to $64.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to $60.6 billion for the same period in 2014. The increase in average earning assets primarily reflected increases of $2.3 billion in average loans, $971 million in average interest-bearing deposits with banks and $681 million in average investment securities. The net interest margin (FTE) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 decreased 13 basis points to 2.61 percent, from 2.74 percent for the comparable period in 2014, lower loan yields and increased balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB). The decrease in loan yields primarily reflected a decrease in accretion on the acquired loan portfolio, shifts in the average loan portfolio mix and the impact of a competitive low-rate environment, partially offset by a benefit from the increase in 30-day LIBOR. Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio increased the net interest margin by 1 basis point for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to 6 basis points for the same period in 2014. Average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) were $5.6 billion and $4.7 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are included in "interest bearing deposits with banks" on the consolidated balance sheets.For further discussion of the effects of market rates on net interest income, refer to the "Market and Liquidity Risk" section of this financial review.Provision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses was $26 million and $5 million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $87 million and $25 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The provision for credit losses includes both the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments.The provision for loan losses is recorded to maintain the allowance for loan losses at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio. The provision for loan losses was $28 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, compared to $4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014. The increase in the provision primarily reflected increased reserves for Technology and Life Sciences as well as energy and energy-related loans. In addition, Corporate Banking and, to a lesser extent, Commercial Real Estate contributed to the increase in the provision. These increases were partially offset by improvements in credit quality in the remainder of the portfolio. The provision for loan losses was $79 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $61 million compared to $18 million for the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting increased reserves for energy and energy-related loans, Corporate Banking and Technology and Life Sciences. Net loan charge-offs in the three months ended September 30, 2015 increased $20 million to $23 million, or 0.19 percent of average total loans, compared to $3 million, or 0.03 percent, for the three months ended September 30, 2014. The increase in net loan charge-offs in the three months ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, primarily reflected increases in general Middle Market (largely due to an increase in charge-offs on energy-related loans), Technology and Life Sciences and Commercial Real Estate partially offset by a decrease in Private Banking.42Table of ContentsNet loan charge-offs in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 increased $25 million to $49 million, or 0.14 percent of average total loans, compared to $24 million, or 0.07 percent, for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The increase in net loan charge-offs in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, primarily reflected increases in general Middle Market and Corporate Banking, partially offset by decreases in Private Banking and Commercial Real Estate.The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments is recorded to maintain the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was a benefit of $2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, compared to a provision of $1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014, and a provision of $8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $7 million for the same period in 2014. The $3 million decrease in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments in the three months ended September 30, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 primarily reflected a decrease in reserves for letters of credit. Lending-related commitment charge-offs were $1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and insignificant for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014.An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets is presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.Noninterest Income Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,(in millions)2015 2014 2015 2014Service charges on deposit accounts$56 $54 $167 $162Fiduciary income47 44 142 133Commercial lending fees22 26 69 69Card fees75 23 214 68Card fees excluding presentation change (a)27 23 78 68Letter of credit fees13 14 39 43Bank-owned life insurance10 11 29 31Foreign exchange income10 9 29 30Brokerage fees5 4 13 13Net securities losses — (1) (2) —Other noninterest income (b)26 31 80 94Total noninterest income$264 $215 $780 $643Total noninterest income excluding presentation change (a)$216 $215 $644 $643(a)Effective January 1, 2015, contractual changes to a card program resulted in a change to the accounting presentation of the related revenues and expenses. The effect of this change was increases of $48 million and $136 million to card fees in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The Corporation believes that this information will assist investors, regulators, management and others in comparing results to prior periods.(b)The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income.Excluding the $48 million impact of the change in accounting presentation on card fees as described in footnote (a) to the above table, noninterest income was stable for the three months ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, with the largest fluctuations including a $4 million increase in card fees, a $4 million decrease in commercial lending fees and a $5 million decrease in other noninterest income. The increase in card fees was primarily driven by a change to the Corporation's strategy for providing merchant payment processing services. The Corporation concluded its participation in a joint venture that provided merchant payment processing services in the second quarter 2015. Income from the exited joint venture, recorded in other noninterest income using the equity method, decreased $4 million. The Corporation now directly enters into agreements with its merchants and uses a third party to process the transactions. Pursuant to the agreements with the merchants and the arrangement with the third-party vendor, merchant payment processing income is recognized in card fees, and related processing expense is recognized in outside processing fees in noninterest expenses. For further discussion about the impact of using a third party to process merchant transactions on outside processing fees, refer to the "Noninterest Expenses" subheading below. For further detail on the changes within other noninterest income, refer to the table below. Excluding the $136 million impact of the above-described accounting presentation change, noninterest income increased $1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, with the largest fluctuations including increases of $10 million in card fees, $9 million in fiduciary income, $5 million  in service charges on deposit accounts, and a decrease of $14 million in other noninterest income. The increase in card fees was largely for the same reasons as described in the quarterly discussion above, and the related income from the exited joint venture decreased $7 million. Refer to the table below for further detail on the changes within other noninterest income. 43Table of ContentsThe following table illustrates certain categories included in "other noninterest income" on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

Income earned on these assets is reported in noninterest income and the offsetting increase in liability is reported in salaries and benefits expense.The increases in all other noninterest income in the above table included $3 million and $7 million of revenue increases from a retirement savings program for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, which were largely offset by corresponding increases in outside processing fees in noninterest expenses.Noninterest Expenses Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,(in millions)2015 2014 2015 2014Salaries and benefits expense$243 $248 $747 $735Net occupancy expense41 46 118 125Equipment expense14 14 40 43Outside processing fee expense86 31 249 89Outside processing fee expense excluding presentation change (a)38 31 113 89Software expense26 25 73 72Litigation-related expense(3) (2) (32) 4FDIC insurance expense9 9 27 25Advertising expense6 5 17 16Gain on debt redemption— (32) — (32)Other noninterest expenses39 53 117 130Total noninterest expenses$461 $397 $1,356 $1,207Total noninterest expenses excluding presentation change (a)$413 $397 $1,220 $1,207(a)Effective January 1, 2015, contractual changes to a card program resulted in a change to the accounting presentation of the related revenues and expenses. The effect of this change was increases of $48 million and $136 million to outside processing fee expense in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The Corporation believes that this information will assist investors, regulators, management and others in comparing results to prior periods.Excluding the $48 million impact of the change in accounting presentation on outside processing fees as described in footnote (a) to the above table, noninterest expenses increased $16 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, largely reflecting higher outside processing expenses and the impact of a net benefit of $8 million in the third quarter 2014 from certain cost-saving actions. Outside processing fee expense increased $7 million, largely due to third-party processing expenses associated with merchant payment processing services, as discussed under the "Noninterest Income" subheading above, including up-front costs incurred for converting customers to the new vendor providing the services, as well as the increase associated with a retirement savings program and smaller increases in other outside processing expenses related to revenue-generating activities. Salaries expense decreased $5 million, primarily reflecting a decrease in severance-related expenses, as an increase in technology-related contract labor expenses and the impact of merit increases were largely offset by a decrease in deferred compensation plan expense and lower share-based compensation expense as a result of forfeitures. Third quarter 2014 cost-saving actions primarily included a $9 million contribution to the Comerica Charitable Foundation (in other noninterest expenses), a $32 million gain on the early redemption of debt, $6 million of severance-related expenses (in salaries and benefits expense) and $5 million of lease termination charges associated with real estate optimization (in net occupancy expense). 44Table of ContentsExcluding the $136 million impact of the above-described accounting presentation change, noninterest expenses increased $13 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily for the same reasons as describe above as well as an increase in salaries and benefits expenses, mostly offset by a $36 million benefit from the net release of litigation reserves. Outside processing fee expense increased $24 million, largely for the same reasons as described in the quarterly discussion above. The increase in salaries and benefits expense primarily reflected an increase in technology-related contract labor expenses and the impact of merit increases, partially offset by a decrease in deferred compensation plan expense and a decrease in severance-related expenses. STRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESSThe Corporation's management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. These methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines. Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report describes the Corporation's segment reporting methodology.In the second quarter 2014, the Corporation enhanced the approach used to determine the standard reserve factors used in estimating the allowance for credit losses, which had the effect of capturing certain elements in the standard reserve component that had formerly been included in the qualitative assessment. The impact of the change was largely neutral to the total allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2014. However, because standard reserves are allocated to the segments at the loan level, while qualitative reserves are allocated at the portfolio level, the impact of the methodology change on the allowance of each segment reflected the characteristics of the individual loans within each segment's portfolio, causing segment reserves to increase or decrease accordingly. As a result, the current year provision for credit losses within each segment is not comparable to prior year amounts.Business SegmentsThe Corporation's operations are strategically aligned into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based upon the products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, Finance is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes items not directly associated with these business segments or the Finance segment. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of these business segments for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015 and 2014.The following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.

Net interest income (FTE) of $1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 increased $3 million compared to the same period in the prior year, as the benefit from a $2.0 billion increase in average loans and the funds transfer pricing (FTP) benefit provided by a $2.9 billion increase in average deposits were offset by a decrease in accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio, lower loan yields and a lower FTP crediting rate. The provision for credit losses increased $67 million to $115 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in the provision primarily reflected the impact of loan growth and increased reserves for loans related to energy, as a result of an increase in criticized loans and the impact of sustained lower energy prices. In addition, Corporate Banking and Technology and Life Sciences contributed to the increase in the provision. These increases were partially offset by improvements in credit quality in the remainder of the portfolio. Net loan charge-offs of $54 million increased $36 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting increases in general Middle Market and Corporate Banking, partially offset by a decrease in Commercial Real Estate.

Excluding the impact of the change in accounting presentation for a card program, noninterest expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 increased $2 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase included a $14 million increase in outside processing expenses, largely due to the third-party processing expenses associated with merchant payment processing services described above; an $11 million increase in corporate overhead; and a $4 million increase in salaries and benefits expense, primarily reflecting the impact of merit increases; and small increases in several other noninterest expense categories; largely offset by a $31 million decrease in litigation-related expense.Net income for the Retail Bank of $49 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 increased $16 million, compared to $33 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014.

The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $14 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $9 million from the $5 million benefit in the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting improvements in credit quality. Net loan charge-offs were $3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 compared to $6 million in the same period for the prior year.

Noninterest expenses of $542 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 increased $9 million from the comparable period in the prior year; primarily due to an increase of $9 million in outside processing expenses, mostly related to the retirement savings program and other revenue-generating activities; and an increase of $3 million in salaries and benefits expense, primarily reflecting the impact of merit increases.Wealth Management's net income of $63 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 increased $1 million, compared to $62 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. Net interest income (FTE) of $133 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 decreased $2 million compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting a decrease in net FTP credits and lower loan yields, partially offset by the benefit from a $147 million increase in average loans and the FTP benefit provided by a $374 million increase in average deposits. The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $12 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to a benefit of $11 million for the same period in the prior year.

An $8 million increase in fiduciary income was offset by small decreases in several other categories of noninterest income. Noninterest expenses of $225 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 decreased $6 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a $3 million decrease in litigation-related expenses and small decreases in several other noninterest expense categories.The net loss in the Finance segment was $273 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to a net loss of $257 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. Net interest expense (FTE) of $470 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 decreased $15 million, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2014, primarily reflecting a decrease in net FTP expense as a result of lower rates paid to the business segments under the Corporation's internal FTP methodology. Noninterest expenses increased $31 million as a result of the third quarter 2014 gain of $32 million on the early redemption of debt.46Table of ContentsMarket SegmentsMarket segment results are provided for the Corporation's three largest geographic markets: Michigan, California and Texas.

These stress tests are a normal part of the Corporation's overall risk management and capital planning process and are part of the forecasting process used by the Corporation to conduct the enterprise-wide stress test that was part of the Federal Reserve's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). For additional information about risk management processes, refer to the "Risk Management" sections of this financial review and the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report.50Table of ContentsThe Federal Reserve completed its 2015 CCAR review in March 2015 and did not object to the Corporation's capital plan and capital distributions contemplated in the plan. The plan provides for up to $393 million in equity repurchases for the five-quarter period ending June 30, 2016. In the third quarter 2015, the Corporation's equity repurchases totaled $59 million. Any material increase in the pace of equity repurchases will be linked to net income performance, which should improve with rising interest rates over time.

Shares withheld in connection with the exercise of warrants are not included in the total number of shares or warrants purchased in the above table. Upon exercise of a warrant, the number of shares with a value equal to the aggregate exercise price is withheld from an exercising warrant holder as payment (known as a "net exercise provision"). During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Corporation withheld the equivalent of approximately 1,291,000 shares to cover an aggregate of $65.7 million in exercise price and issued approximately 934,000 shares to the exercising warrant holders. (d)Includes April 28, 2015 equity repurchase authorization for up to an additional 10.6 million shares and share-equivalents.On April 28, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the Board) approved a 1-cent increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.21 per share. The Board also authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 10.0 million shares of Comerica Incorporated outstanding common stock, in addition to the 2.1 million shares remaining at March 31, 2015 under the Board's prior authorizations for the share repurchase program initially approved in November 2010. Including the April 28, 2015 authorization, a total of 40.3 million shares has been authorized for repurchase under the share repurchase program since its inception in 2010. On April 28, 2015, the Board also authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 2.6 million warrants, in addition to the 10.6 million warrants remaining at March 31, 2015 under an authorization initially approved in November 2010. There is no expiration date for the Corporation's equity repurchase program.In July 2013, U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule for the U.S. adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework (Basel III). Basel III includes a more stringent definition of capital and introduces a new common equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital requirement; sets forth two comprehensive methodologies for calculating risk-weighted assets (RWA), a standardized approach and an advanced approach; introduces two new capital buffers, a conservation buffer and a countercyclical buffer (applicable to advanced approaches entities); establishes a new supplemental leverage ratio (applicable to advanced approaches entities); and sets out minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards. As a banking organization subject to the standardized approach, Basel III became effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2015. Certain deductions and adjustments to regulatory capital phase in starting January 1, 2015 and will be fully implemented on January 1, 2018. The capital conservation buffer phases in beginning January 1, 2016 and will be fully implemented on January 1, 2019.Under Basel III, CET1 capital predominantly includes common shareholders’ equity, less certain deductions for goodwill, intangible assets and deferred tax assets that arise from net operating losses and tax credit carry-forwards. Additionally, the Corporation has elected to permanently exclude capital in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) related to debt and equity securities classified as available-for-sale as well as for defined benefit postretirement plans from CET1, an option available to standardized approach entities under Basel III. Tier 1 capital incrementally includes noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital includes Tier 1 capital as well as subordinated debt qualifying as Tier 2 and qualifying allowance for credit losses. Certain deductions and adjustments to CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital are subject to phase-in through December 31, 2017. Comerica computes RWA using the standardized approach. Under the standardized approach, RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary by counterparty type and asset class. Under the Basel III standardized approach, capital is required for credit risk RWA, to cover the risk of unexpected losses due to failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its 51Table of Contentsfinancial obligations in accordance with contractual terms; and if trading assets and liabilities exceed certain thresholds, capital is also required for market risk RWA, to cover the risk of losses due to adverse market movements or from position-specific factors.The following table presents the minimum ratios required to be considered "adequately capitalized" as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014.

The allowance for loan losses represents management's assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporation's loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in "accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets, provides for probable losses inherent in lending-related commitments, including unused commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.The economy continued to exhibit some mixed trends in the third quarter 2015. Job growth and employment figures continued to slowly improve, but uncertainty remained elevated. The Federal Reserve continues to set expectations for a near-term movement towards interest rate increases and monetary policy normalization. At the same time, lower energy prices have persisted and geopolitical tensions remain.The allowance for loan losses was $622 million at September 30, 2015, compared to $594 million at December 31, 2014, an increase of $28 million, or 5 percent. While the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio remained strong, reserves increased, primarily reflecting increases in reserves for energy and energy-related exposure as well as Technology and Life Sciences, partially offset by improved credit quality in the remainder of the portfolio. The increase in reserves for energy and energy-related exposure reflected an increase in criticized loans and the impact of sustained lower energy prices, partially mitigated by collateral levels. Technology and Life Sciences reserves increased largely as a result of the levels and trends of charge-offs.The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain letters of credit in a manner consistent with business loans, and allowances based on the pool of the remaining letters of credit and all unused commitments to extend credit within each internal risk rating.52Table of ContentsThe allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $48 million at September 30, 2015 compared to $41 million at December 31, 2014. The $7 million increase in the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments primarily reflected the impact of downgrades of energy and energy-related unfunded commitments and issued letters of credit.For additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses, refer to page F-37 in the "Critical Accounting Policies" section and pages F-54 through F-55 in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report.Nonperforming AssetsNonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, troubled debt restructured loans (TDRs) which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans) and foreclosed property. TDRs include performing and nonperforming loans. Nonperforming TDRs are either on nonaccrual or reduced-rate status. Nonperforming assets do not include purchased credit impaired (PCI) loans.The following table presents a summary of nonperforming assets and past due loans.(dollar amounts in millions)September 30, 2015 December 31, 2014Nonaccrual loans:   Business loans:   Commercial$214 $109Real estate construction1 2Commercial mortgage66 95Lease financing8 —International8 —Total nonaccrual business loans297 206Retail loans:   Residential mortgage31 36Consumer:   Home equity28 30Other consumer1 1Total consumer29 31Total nonaccrual retail loans60 67Total nonaccrual loans357 273Reduced-rate loans12 17Total nonperforming loans369 290Foreclosed property12 10Total nonperforming assets$381 $300Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans0.75% 0.60%Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and foreclosed property0.78 0.62Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total nonperforming loans169 205Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing$5 $5Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing as a percentage of total loans0.01% 0.01%Nonperforming assets increased $81 million to $381 million at September 30, 2015, from $300 million at December 31, 2014.

Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest remained unchanged at $5 million at both September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014. Loans past due 30-89 days decreased $6 million to $157 million at September 30, 2015, compared to $163 million at December 31, 2014.The following table presents a summary of total criticized loans. Criticized loans with balances of $2 million or more on nonaccrual status or whose terms have been modified in a TDR are individually subjected to quarterly credit quality reviews, and the Corporation may establish specific allowances for such loans.

Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $10.7 billion at September 30, 2015, of which $3.6 billion, or 33 percent, were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to real estate developers. The remaining $7.1 billion, or 67 percent, of commercial real estate loans in other business lines consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages, which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans. In the Texas market, commercial real estate loans totaled $2.6 billion at September 30, 2015, of which $1.3 billion were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line. The remaining $1.3 billion consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages. Loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line secured by properties located in Texas totaled $1.0 billion at September 30, 2015, none of which were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2015, primarily including $588 million for multifamily properties, $102 million for retail properties and $101 million for commercial properties. The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-time customers with satisfactory completion experience. Credit quality in the real estate construction loan portfolio was strong, with $1 million on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2015 compared to $2 million at December 31, 2014, and real estate construction loan net recoveries of $1 million and $2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Of the $2.0 billion and $1.8 billion of commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line outstanding at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, $17 million and $22 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Commercial mortgage loan net recoveries in the Commercial Real Estate business line were $3 million and $2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In other business lines, $49 million and $73 million of commercial mortgage loans were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Commercial mortgage loan net recoveries in other business lines were $3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, compared to net charge-offs of $10 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014.Residential Real Estate LendingThe following table summarizes the Corporation's residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios by geographic market.

Residential mortgages totaled $1.9 billion at September 30, 2015, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.9 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $31 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2015. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.7 billion at September 30, 2015, of which $1.7 billion was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit and $61 million were closed-end 56Table of Contentshome equity loans. Of the $1.7 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $28 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2015. A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at September 30, 2015. The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation's primary geographic markets. Substantially all residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more are placed on nonaccrual status, and substantially all junior lien home equity loans that are current or less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status if full collection of the senior position is in doubt. At no later than 180 days past due, such loans are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell.Energy LendingThe Corporation has a portfolio of energy and energy-related loans that are included primarily in "commercial loans" in the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation's energy lending team has over 30 years of experience, with a focus on larger middle market companies in the oil and gas business. Customers in the Corporation's Energy business line (approximately 200 relationships) are engaged in three segments of the oil and gas business: exploration and production (E&P), midstream and energy services. E&P generally includes such activities as searching for potential oil and gas fields, drilling exploratory wells and operating active wells. Commitments to E&P borrowers are subject to semi-annual borrowing base re-determinations based on a variety of factors including updated pricing (reflecting market and competitive conditions), energy reserve levels and the impact of hedging. Fall semi-annual borrowing base re-determinations began in September 2015. The midstream sector is generally involved in the transportation, storage and marketing of crude and/or refined oil and gas products. The Corporation's energy services customers provide products and services primarily to the E&P segment. More than 90 percent of the loans in the Energy business line are Shared National Credits (SNC), which are facilities greater than $20 million shared by three or more federally supervised institutions, reflecting the Corporation's focus on larger middle market companies that have financing needs that generally exceed internal individual borrower credit risk limits. The Corporation seeks to develop full relationships with SNC borrowers. In addition to oil and gas loans in the Energy business line, the Corporation is monitoring a portfolio of loans in other lines of business to companies that have a sizable portion of their revenue related to oil and gas or could be otherwise disproportionately negatively impacted by prolonged lower oil and gas prices ("energy-related"), primarily in general Middle Market, Corporate Banking, Small Business, and Technology and Life Sciences. These companies include downstream businesses such as refineries and petrochemical companies, companies that sell products to E&P, midstream and energy services companies, companies involved in developing new technologies for the oil and gas industry, and other similar businesses.The following table summarizes information about the Corporation's portfolio of energy and energy-related loans.

Total exposure, including unused commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, was $6.5 billion and $7.1 billion at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The decrease in total exposure in the Energy business line primarily reflected reduced borrowing bases as a result of the decline in value of oil and gas reserves, while the decrease in outstandings largely reflected energy customers taking actions to adjust their cash flow and reduce their bank debt. As of September 30, 2015, a majority of the Corporation’s E&P customers had at least 50 percent of their oil and/or gas production hedged up to the end of 2015. Approximately 95 percent of the loans outstanding and 90 percent of total exposure in the Energy business line had varying levels and types of collateral at September 30, 2015, including oil and gas reserves and pipelines, equipment, accounts receivable, inventory and other assets, or some combination thereof. Energy-related outstandings were approximately $614 million at September 30, 2015 (approximately 110 relationships), a decrease of $127 million, or 17 percent, compared to December 31, 2014.Internal risk-rating reviews were completed on all borrowers in the Energy business line during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Criticized energy and energy-related loans increased from $197 million, or 5 percent of total energy and energy-related loans, at December 31, 2014 to $1.1 billion or 27 percent at September 30, 2015, in part reflecting the Corporation's weighting of current and expected operating cash flows in the assessment of the probability of default. A majority of the criticized energy and energy-related loans remain well secured and therefore losses are expected to be manageable. While the Corporation expects some continued negative migration, at this point in the cycle, many credits are being satisfactorily resolved through 57Table of Contentspaydowns and payoffs. Nonaccrual energy and energy-related loans increased to $126 million, or 3 percent of total energy and energy-related loans at September 30, 2015, compared to $27 million, or 1 percent at December 31, 2014. Energy and energy-related net loan charge-offs were $9 million and $13 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, respectively, substantially all of which were from the energy-related portfolio. The Corporation's allowance methodology carefully considers the various risk elements within its loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2015 appropriately incorporated the changing dynamics in energy and energy-related loans described above, including the value of collateral considered in determining estimated loss given default, which has resulted in increases in reserves for this portfolio for the past four quarterly periods. The Corporation continued to incorporate a qualitative reserve component for energy and energy-related loans at September 30, 2015 due to the uncertainty associated with continued volatility and the impact of sustained lower oil and gas prices. Refer to the “Allowance for Credit Losses” subheading earlier in this section for a discussion of changes in the allowance for loan losses as a result of the above-described events.Automotive LendingSubstantially all dealer loans are in the National Dealer Services business line. Loans in the National Dealer Services business line include floor plan financing and other loans to automotive dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in “commercial loans” in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $3.5 billion at September 30, 2015, a decrease of $252 million compared to $3.8 billion at December 31, 2014. At both September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $2.4 billion, including $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Automotive lending also includes loans to borrowers involved with automotive production, primarily Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers. Loans to borrowers involved with automotive production totaled approximately $1.2 billion at both September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014.International ExposureInternational assets are subject to general risks inherent in the conduct of business in foreign countries, including economic uncertainties and each foreign government's regulations. Risk management practices minimize the risk inherent in international lending arrangements. These practices include structuring bilateral agreements or participating in bank facilities, which secure repayment from sources external to the borrower's country. Accordingly, such international outstandings are excluded from the cross-border risk of that country.The Corporation does not hold any sovereign exposure to Europe. The Corporation's international strategy as it pertains to Europe is to focus on European companies doing business in North America, with an emphasis on the Corporation's primary geographic markets. The following table summarizes cross-border exposure to entities domiciled in European countries.(in millions) September 30, 2015 December 31, 2014European exposure:    Commercial and industrial $271 $211Banks and other financial institutions 23 52Total outstanding 294 263Unfunded commitments and guarantees 311 382Total European exposure (a) $605 $645(a)Primarily United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The Corporation had no exposure to Greece, Portugal or Ireland at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014.For further discussion of credit risk, see the "Credit Risk" section of pages F-21 through F-29 in the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report.Market and Liquidity RiskMarket risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse movements in market rates or prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and commodity and equity prices. Liquidity risk represents the failure to meet financial obligations coming due resulting from an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding, and the inability to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significant changes in pricing, due to inadequate market depth or market disruptions.The Asset and Liability Policy Committee (ALCO) of the Corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities. ALCO meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies, and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit gathering and risk management. The Treasury Department mitigates market and liquidity risk through the actions it takes to manage the Corporation's market, liquidity and capital positions under the direction of ALCO.58Table of ContentsMarket Risk Analytics, of the Office of Enterprise Risk, supports ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk and coordinating all other market risks. Key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analysis of the Corporation's balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks; (ii) monitoring and reporting of the Corporation's positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines; (iii) developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions; (iv) reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval; (v) monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market risks; and (vi) developing and monitoring the interest rate risk economic capital estimate.Interest Rate RiskNet interest income is the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities, primarily through the Corporation's core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by a combination of core deposits and wholesale borrowings. Approximately 85 percent of the Corporation's loans were floating at September 30, 2015, of which approximately 75 percent were based on LIBOR and 25 percent were based on Prime. This creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the floating-rate loan portfolio and the more slowly repricing deposit products. In addition, growth and/or contraction in the Corporation's loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing investment securities, primarily fixed-rate, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, and hedging the sensitivity with interest rate swaps. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk, with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.Since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives, a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk. These techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve, utilizing multiple simulation analyses. Simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income, as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors, including, but not limited to, the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, regulatory impacts and management strategies.Sensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest RatesThe analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is management's principal risk management technique. Management models a base case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment and what is believed to be the most likely balance sheet structure. Existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes are included in the analysis, but no additional hedging is currently forecasted. These derivative instruments currently comprise interest rate swaps that convert fixed-rate long-term debt to variable rates. This base case net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which rates rise or decline in a linear, non-parallel fashion from the base case over 12 months. In the scenarios presented, short-term interest rates increase 200 basis points, resulting in an average increase in short-term interest rates of 100 basis points over the period (+200 scenario). Due to the current low level of interest rates, the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of a 25 basis point drop in short-term interest rates, to zero percent.Each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth, investment security prepayment levels, depositor behavior, yield curve changes, loan and deposit pricing, and overall balance sheet mix and growth. In the +200 scenario, assumptions related to loan growth are based on historical experience. Because deposit balances have continued to grow significantly in this persistent low rate environment, historical depositor behavior may be less indicative of future trends. As a result, the September 30, 2015 +200 scenario reflects a greater decrease in deposits than we have experienced historically as rates begin to rise. Investment securities modeling includes the replacement of prepayments as well as an estimate of projected growth in High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) needed for compliance with the LCR, and expected funding maturities are included. In addition, the model reflects deposit pricing based on historical price movements with short-term interest rates, and loan spreads are held at current levels. Changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis.59Table of ContentsThe table below, as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above.

The risk to declining interest rates is limited as a result of the inability of the current low level of rates to fall significantly.The table below, as of September 30, 2015, illustrates the estimated sensitivity of the above results to a change in deposit balance assumptions in the +200 scenario, with all other assumptions held constant. In this analysis, average noninterest-bearing deposit run-off in the 12-month period has been increased by $1 billion and $3 billion from the historical run-off experience included in the standard +200 scenario presented above and assumes the deposit run-off reduces excess reserves and increases purchased funds. The analysis is provided as an indicator of the sensitivity of net interest income to the modeled deposit run-off assumption. It is not meant to reflect management's expectation or best estimate. Actual deposit levels may vary from those reflected.  +200 Basis Points(in millions)Estimated Annual ChangeSeptember 30, 2015Amount %Incremental Average Decrease in Noninterest-bearing Deposit Balances:   $1 billion$211 13%$3 billion188 11Sensitivity of Economic Value of Equity to Changes in Interest RatesIn addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income, an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position. The economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the Corporation's financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements. The economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel 200 basis point increase and 25 basis point decrease in interest rates.The table below, as of September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above.

Capacity for incremental purchased funds at September 30, 2015 included the ability to purchase federal funds, sell securities under agreements to repurchase, as well as issue deposits to institutional investors and issue certificates of deposit through brokers. Purchased funds totaled $253 million at September 30, 2015, compared to $251 million at December 31, 2014. At September 30, 2015, the Bank had pledged loans totaling $26 billion which provided for up to $20 billion of available collateralized borrowing with the FRB.60Table of ContentsThe Bank is a member of the FHLB of Dallas, Texas, which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. At September 30, 2015, real estate-related loans pledged to the FHLB as blanket collateral provided for potential future borrowings of approximately $6 billion. As of September 30, 2015, the Corporation did not have any outstanding borrowings from the FHLB. Additionally, as of September 30, 2015 the Bank had the ability to issue up to $14 billion of debt under an existing $15 billion note program which allows the issuance of debt with maturities between three months and 30 years.The Corporation also maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and/or equity securities.The ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise funds at competitive rates is impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings of the Corporation and the Bank. As of September 30, 2015, the four major rating agencies had assigned the following ratings to long-term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Liquid assets, which totaled $15.0 billion at September 30, 2015, compared to $13.3 billion at December 31, 2014, provide a reservoir of liquidity. Liquid assets include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits with banks, other short-term investments and unencumbered investment securities. At September 30, 2015, the Corporation held deposits at the FRB of $5.9 billion, compared to $4.9 billion at December 31, 2014.In September 2014, U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule implementing a quantitative liquidity requirement in the U.S. generally consistent with the LCR minimum liquidity measure established under the Basel III liquidity framework. Under the rule, the Corporation is subject to a modified LCR standard, which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of HQLA to fully cover modified net cash outflows under a 30-day systematic liquidity stress scenario. The rule is effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2016. During the transition year, 2016, the Corporation will be required to maintain a minimum LCR of 90 percent. Beginning January 1, 2017, and thereafter, the minimum required LCR will be 100 percent. In the third quarter, the Bank issued $350 million of 4.00% subordinated notes, swapped to floating at 6-month LIBOR plus 1.478%, maturing in 2025 and $175 million of 2.50% senior notes, swapped to floating at 6-month LIBOR plus 0.6348%, maturing in 2020. In the second quarter 2015, the Bank issued $500 million of 2.50% senior debt maturing in 2020 and swapped it to floating at six-month LIBOR plus 75 basis points. Of the proceeds from these issuances, approximately $575 million was invested in five-year Treasury notes and GNMA RMBS, which helped position the Corporation for full compliance with LCR. Any future funding needs for LCR purposes will depend on loan and deposit trends as well as balance sheet strategy. Should the Corporation need to add HQLA to maintain full compliance with the LCR rule, a variety of wholesale funding sources are available, as previously discussed. The Basel III liquidity framework includes a second minimum liquidity measure, the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), which requires the amount of available longer-term, stable sources of funding to be at least 100 percent of the required amount of longer-term stable funding over a one-year period. On October 31, 2014, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued its final NSFR rule, which was originally introduced in 2010 and revised in January 2014. U.S. banking regulators have announced that they expect to issue proposed rules to implement the NSFR in advance of its scheduled global implementation in 2018. While uncertainty exists in the final form and timing of the U.S. rule implementing the NSFR and whether or not the Corporation will be subject to the full requirements, the Corporation is closely monitoring the development of the rule.The Corporation regularly evaluates its ability to meet funding needs in unanticipated, stressed environments. In conjunction with the quarterly 200 basis point interest rate simulation analyses, discussed in the “Interest Rate Sensitivity” section of this financial review, liquidity ratios and potential funding availability are examined. Each quarter, the Corporation also evaluates its ability to meet liquidity needs under a series of broad events, distinguished in terms of duration and severity. The evaluation as of September 30, 2015 projected that sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe Corporation’s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation’s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2014, the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to the allowance for credit losses, valuation methodologies, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages F-37 through F-40 in the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report. As of the date of this report, there have been no significant changes to the Corporation's critical accounting policies or estimates, except as discussed below.61Table of ContentsGoodwillGoodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level, equivalent to a business segment or one level below. The Corporation has three reporting units: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. At September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, goodwill totaled $635 million, including $380 million allocated to the Business Bank, $194 million allocated to the Retail Bank and $61 million allocated to Wealth Management. The Corporation performs its annual evaluation of goodwill impairment in the third quarter of each year and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests suggest additional testing may be warranted to determine if goodwill might be impaired. The quantitative goodwill impairment test is a two-step test. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of identified reporting units with their carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. In performing the annual impairment test, the carrying value of each reporting unit is the greater of economic or regulatory capital. The Corporation assigns economic capital using internal management methodologies on the basis of each reporting unit's credit, operational and interest rate risks, as well as goodwill. To determine regulatory capital, each reporting unit is assigned sufficient capital such that their respective Tier 1 ratio, based on allocated risk-weighted assets, is the same as that of the Corporation. Using this two-pronged approach, the Corporation's equity is fully allocated to its reporting units except for capital held primarily for the risk associated with the securities portfolio which is assigned to the Finance segment of the Corporation. Determining the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process involving the use of estimates and judgments related to the selection of inputs such as future cash flows, discount rates, comparable public company multiples, applicable control premiums and economic expectations used in determining the interest rate environment. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are determined using a blend of two commonly used valuation techniques: the market approach and the income approach. For the market approach, valuations of reporting units consider a combination of earnings, equity and other multiples from companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit. Since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of noncontrolling interests, the valuations accordingly incorporate a control premium. For the income approach, estimated future cash flows and terminal value are discounted. Estimated future cash flows are derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for each reporting unit which incorporate uncertainty factors inherent to long-term projections. The applicable discount rate is based on the imputed cost of equity capital appropriate for each reporting unit, which incorporates the risk-free rate of return, the level of non-diversified risk associated with companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit, a size risk premium and a market equity risk premium.The annual test of goodwill impairment was performed as of the beginning of the third quarter 2015. The Corporation's assumptions included modest increases to the Federal funds target rate until eventually reaching a normal interest rate environment. At the conclusion of the first step of the annual goodwill impairment tests performed in the third quarter 2015, the estimated fair values of all reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying amounts, including goodwill. The results of the annual test of the goodwill impairment test for each reporting unit were subjected to stress testing as appropriate.Economic conditions impact the assumptions related to interest and growth rates, loss rates and imputed cost of equity capital. The fair value estimates for each reporting unit incorporated current economic and market conditions, including the recent Federal Reserve announcements and the impact of legislative and regulatory changes, to the extent known and as described above. However, further weakening in the economic environment, such as adverse changes in interest rates, a decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below their carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Additionally, new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management's expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Any impairment charge would not affect the Corporation's regulatory capital ratios, tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position.62Table of ContentsSUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATAThe following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this financial review with financial measures defined by GAAP.(dollar amounts in millions)September 30, 2015 December 31, 2014Tier 1 Common Capital Ratio:   Tier 1 and Tier 1 common capital (a)n/a $7,169Risk-weighted assets (a)n/a 68,269Tier 1 and Tier 1 common risk-based capital ration/a 10.50%Tangible Common Equity Ratio:   Common shareholders' equity$7,622 $7,402Less:   Goodwill635 635Other intangible assets14 15Tangible common equity$6,973 $6,752Total assets$71,012 $69,186Less:   Goodwill635 635Other intangible assets14 15Tangible assets$70,363 $68,536Common equity ratio10.73% 10.70%Tangible common equity ratio9.91 9.85Tangible Common Equity per Share of Common Stock:   Common shareholders' equity$7,622 $7,402Tangible common equity6,973 6,752Shares of common stock outstanding (in millions)177 179Common shareholders' equity per share of common stock$43.02 $41.35Tangible common equity per share of common stock39.36 37.72(a)Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as defined by Basel I risk-based capital rules.n/a - not applicable.The Tier 1 common capital ratio removes preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital as defined by and calculated in conformity with Basel I risk-based capital rules in effect through December 31, 2014. Effective January 1, 2015, regulatory capital components and risk-weighted assets are defined by and calculated in conformity with Basel III risk-based capital rules. The tangible common equity ratio removes preferred stock and the effect of intangible assets from capital and the effect of intangible assets from total assets and tangible common equity per share of common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders' equity per share of common stock. The Corporation believes these measurements are meaningful measures of capital adequacy used by investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and to compare against other companies in the industry.63Table of ContentsITEM 3.
