The redemption was funded by the net proceeds from an $880 million common stock offering completed in the first quarter 2010 and from excess liquidity at the parent company. The redemption resulted in a one-time, non-cash redemption charge of $94 million in the first quarter 2010, reflecting the accelerated accretion of the remaining discount, which reduced diluted earnings per common share by $0.57 for the six-month period ended June 30, 2010. The total impact of the preferred stock, including the redemption charge, cash dividends of $24 million and non-cash discount accretion of $5 million, was a reduction to diluted earnings per common share of $0.73 for the six-month period ended June 30, 2010. The only significant non-financial impact of the redemption was the removal of executive compensation rules by the U.S. Treasury. The executive and legislative branches of the federal government, as well as our primary regulators, may continue to request supplementary reporting.   In the second quarter 2010, the U.S. Treasury sold the related 11.5 million warrants, which grant the right to purchase an equal amount of shares of the Corporation’s common stock at $29.40 per share. The sale of the warrants by the U.S. Treasury had no impact on the Corporation’s equity. The warrants remained outstanding at June 30, 2010 and were included in “capital surplus” on the consolidated statements of changes in shareholders’ equity at their original fair value of $124 million.   Results of Operations   Net income for the three months ended June 30, 2010 was $70 million, an increase of $52 million from $18 million reported for the three months ended June 30, 2009. The increase in net income in the second quarter 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, was primarily due to a $182 million decrease in the provision for credit losses ($186 million decrease in the provision for loan losses, partially offset by a $4 million increase in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments), a $29 million decrease in Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance expense, and a $20 million increase in net interest income, partially offset by a $112 decrease in net securities gains. Net income attributable to common stock was $69 million for the second quarter 2010, compared to a net loss attributable to common stock of $16 million for the same period one year ago. There were no preferred stock dividends included in net income attributable to common stock for the three months ended June 30, 2010, compared to $34 million of preferred stock dividends included in the net loss attributable to common stock for the same period one year ago. Diluted net income per common share was $0.39 in the second quarter 2010, compared to a diluted net loss per common share of $0.11 for the same period one year ago.   Net income for the first six months of 2010 was $122 million, an increase of $95 million from $27 million reported for the six months ended June 30, 2009. The increase in net income for the six months ended June 30, 2010 from the comparable 2009 period resulted primarily from a $202 million decrease in the provision for credit losses ($214 million decrease in the provision for loan losses, partially offset by a $12 million increase in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments), a $51 million increase in net interest income, decreases of $27 million in FDIC insurance expense and $19 million in employee benefits expense, and a $17 million after-tax gain recognized in “income from discontinued operations” in the first quarter 2010. These increases were partially offset by a $123 million decrease in net securities gains. The six-month period ended June 30, 2009 included a reduction of tax interest due to anticipated refunds due from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and a $24 million non-taxable gain on the termination of certain leveraged leases which, in addition to the impact of the increase in pre-tax income, resulted in a $78 million increase in the provision for income taxes in the six months ended June 30, 2010, compared to the comparable 2009 period. After preferred dividends of $123 million, the net loss applicable to common stock was $1 million for the first six months of 2010, compared to a net loss attributable to common stock of $40 million in the same period one year ago. The diluted net loss per common share, which included the non-cash redemption charge previously discussed, was $0.01 for the first six months of 2010, compared to a diluted net loss per common share of $0.27 for the comparable 2009 period.   42      Table of Contents   2010 Outlook   For full-year 2010, management expects the following, based on an uncertain pace of economic recovery.   · Management expects loans to be stable from period-end June 30, 2010 to period-end December 31, 2010. Investment securities, excluding auction-rate securities, are expected to remain at a level similar to June 30, 2010. · Based on excess liquidity remaining similar to June 30, 2010 through year-end 2010, management expects an average net interest margin between 3.20 percent and 3.30 percent for full-year 2010, reflecting the benefit, compared to 2009, from improved loan pricing and lower funding costs. No Federal Funds rate increase is assumed. · Management expects net credit-related charge-offs between $600 million and $650 million for full-year 2010. The provision for credit losses is expected to be below net credit-related charge-offs. · Management expects a low to mid single-digit decline in noninterest income compared to 2009, after excluding $243 million of 2009 net securities gains. Included in the outlook is an estimated $5 million negative impact on service charge income in the second half of 2010 from overdraft policy changes consistent with new regulations issued by the Federal Reserve. · Management expects a low single-digit decrease in noninterest expenses compared to 2009. · Management expects income tax expense to approximate 35 percent of income before income taxes less approximately $60 million of permanent differences related to low-income housing and bank-owned life insurance, partially offset by approximately $5 million of state adjustments.   Net Interest Income   Net interest income was $422 million for the three months ended June 30, 2010, an increase of $20 million compared to $402 million for the same period in 2009. The increase in net interest income in the second quarter 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, resulted primarily from changes in the funding mix, including a continued shift in funding sources toward lower-cost funds, maturities of higher-cost medium- and long-term debt and improved loan spreads. The “Quarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume — Fully Taxable Equivalent” table of this financial review details the components of the change in net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis for the three months ended June 30, 2010, compared to the same period in the prior year. On a FTE basis, net interest income increased $20 million to $424 million for the three months ended June 30, 2010, from $404 million for the comparable period in 2009. Average earning assets decreased $7.7 billion, or 13 percent, to $51.8 billion in the second quarter 2010, compared to $59.5 billion in the second quarter 2009, primarily due to a $7.0 billion, or 15 percent, decrease in average loans to $40.7 billion and a $2.5 billion decrease in investment securities available-for-sale, partially offset by an increase of $1.9 billion in average interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB). The net interest margin (FTE) for the three months ended June 30, 2010 increased 55 basis points to 3.28 percent, from 2.73 percent for the comparable period in 2009, primarily due to the reasons cited for the increase in net interest income discussed above. The net interest margin was reduced by approximately 23 basis points and eight basis points in the second quarters of 2010 and 2009, respectively, from excess liquidity. Excess liquidity was represented by $3.7 billion and $1.8 billion of average balances deposited with the FRB in the second quarters of 2010 and 2009, respectively, which resulted from strong core deposit growth and declining loans.   Net interest income was $837 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010, an increase of $51 million compared to $786 million for the same period in 2009. The increase in net interest income in the six months ended 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, was primarily due to the same reasons cited in the quarterly discussion above. The “Year-to-date Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume — Fully Taxable Equivalent” table provides an analysis of net interest income for the first six months of 2010 on a FTE basis, compared to the same period in the prior year. On a FTE basis, net interest income for the six months ended June 30, 2010 was $840 million, compared to $790 million for the same period in 2009, an increase of $50 million. Average earning assets decreased $8.2 billion, or 14 percent, to $52.4 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2010, compared to $60.6 billion for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a $7.6 billion, or 16 percent, decrease in average loans, to $41.0 billion, and a $2.6 billion decrease in investment securities available-for-sale, partially offset by an increase of $2.1 billion in average interest-bearing deposits with the FRB. The net interest margin (FTE) for the six months ended June 30, 2010 increased 60 basis points to 3.23 percent, from 2.63 percent for the same period in 2009, primarily due to the same reasons cited in the quarterly discussion above. The impact of excess liquidity, as defined above, was a reduction of approximately 24 basis points and seven basis points to the net interest margin (FTE) for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Based on excess liquidity remaining similar to June 30, 2010 through year-end 2010, management expects an average net interest margin between 3.20 percent and 3.30 percent for full-year 2010, reflecting the benefit, compared to 2009, from improved loan pricing and lower funding costs.

Provision for Credit Losses   The provision for credit losses includes both the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The provision for loan losses was $126 million for the second quarter 2010, compared to $312 million for the same period in 2009. The provision for loan losses for the first six months of 2010 was $301 million, compared to $515 million for the same period in 2009. The Corporation establishes this provision to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses, which is discussed under the “Credit Risk” subheading in the “Risk Management” section of this financial review. The decreases of $186 million and $214 million in the provision for loan losses in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2009, resulted primarily from broad-based improvements in credit quality metrics. Improvements in credit quality metrics included a decline of $1.1 billion in the Corporation’s watch list loans - generally consistent with regulatory defined special mention, substandard and doubtful (nonaccrual) loans - from December 31, 2009 to June 30, 2010, compared to an increase of $1.7 billion in the same period in 2009. Additional indicators of improved credit quality included decreases in the rate of inflow to nonaccrual (based on an analysis of nonaccrual loans with book balances greater than $2 million) and in net credit-related charge-offs in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010, compared to the same periods in the prior year.   The national economy was recovering moderately from mid 2009 until the middle of the second quarter 2010, when economic indicators began showing signs of weaker but sustained growth. The initial recovery was spurred by the revival of credit and capital markets and massive monetary and budget stimulus. In early 2010, the private sector began to take the lead as reflected in renewed growth in private payrolls and notable strength in the manufacturing sector. The Michigan economy showed signs of recovering somewhat more slowly than the nation with strength concentrated in manufacturing. The average Michigan Business Activity Index for the first five months of 2010 increased 14 percent from the average for full-year 2009. The Michigan Business Activity index represents nine different measures of economic activity compiled by the Corporation. The California economy also appears to be lagging the national recovery. The housing sector showed signs of improvement, but ongoing budget problems continued to affect the recovery. The average California Economic Activity Index compiled by the Corporation for the first five months of 2010 increased three percent from the average for full-year 2009. The California Economic Activity Index equally weights nine, seasonally-adjusted, coincident measures of economic activity. Texas continued to outperform the national economy in 2010, with notable strength in manufacturing and energy exploration. Reflecting the broadening recovery in Texas, nonfarm payrolls increased at a three percent annual rate over the first five months of the year, slightly above one percent faster than nationally. Forward-looking indicators suggest that economic conditions in the Corporation’s primary geographic markets are likely to continue to strengthen gradually against a background of moderate national and global expansions.   47      Table of Contents   Total net credit-related charge-offs include net charge-offs on both loans and lending-related commitments. Net loan charge-offs for the second quarter 2010 decreased $102 million to $146 million, or 1.44 percent of average total loans, compared to $248 million, or 2.08 percent for the second quarter 2009. The $102 million decrease in net loan charge-offs in the second quarter 2010, compared to the second quarter 2009, consisted primarily of decreases in net loan charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate ($72 million) and Specialty Businesses ($29 million) business lines, partially offset by an increase in net loan charge-offs in the Middle Market ($19 million) business line. Middle Market net loan charge-offs totaled $71 million in the second quarter 2010, with $26 million attributed to a national specialty group which manages a $500 million loan portfolio which focuses on highly leveraged relationships. The $72 million decrease in net loan charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line reflected decreases in all markets, with the exception of Texas, which experienced a nominal increase. By geographic market, the decrease in net loan charge-offs in the second quarter 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, consisted primarily of decreases in the Midwest ($48 million), Western ($23 million) and Florida ($16 million) markets.   Net loan charge-offs for the first six months of 2010 were $319 million, compared to $405 million for the same period in 2009. The $86 million decrease in net loan charge-offs for the first six months of 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, consisted primarily of decreases in net loan charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate ($61 million), Specialty Businesses ($33 million) and Global Corporate Banking ($17 million) business lines, partially offset by an increase in the Middle Market ($26 million) business line. By geographic market, net loan charge-offs reflected decreases in net loan charge-offs in the Midwest ($48 million), Western ($34 million) and Florida ($18 million) markets, partially offset by an increase in net loan charge-offs in the Texas market ($14 million).   The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was less than $0.5 million and $7 million for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010, respectively, compared to negative provisions of $4 million and $5 million for the comparable periods in 2009. The Corporation establishes this provision to maintain an adequate allowance to cover probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments, which is discussed under the “Credit Risk” subheading in the “Risk Management” section of this financial review. The increases for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010, when compared to the same periods in 2009, resulted primarily from an increase in specific reserves related to standby letters of credit extended to customers in the Midwest market. There were less than $0.5 million in lending-related commitment charge-offs in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 and 2009.   An analysis of allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets is presented under the “Credit Risk” subheading in the “Risk Management” section of this financial review.   Management expects net credit-related charge-offs between $600 million and $650 million for full-year 2010. The provision for credit losses is expected to be below net credit-related charge-offs.   Noninterest Income   Noninterest income was $194 million for the three months ended June 30, 2010, a decrease of $104 million, or 35 percent, compared to $298 million for the same period in 2009, resulting primarily from a $112 million decline in net securities gains and a $6 million second quarter 2009 gain on the sale of the Corporation’s proprietary defined contribution plan recordkeeping business, partially offset by a $16 million loss on the termination of leveraged leases in the second quarter 2009. Net securities gains in the second quarter 2009 included $109 million of gains on the sale of mortgage-backed government agency securities.   Noninterest income was $388 million for the first six months of 2010, a decrease of $133 million, or 26 percent, compared to the same period in 2009, due primarily to a $123 million decrease in net securities gains and $8 million of net gains from the termination of certain leveraged leases in the first six months of 2009. Net securities gains in the first six months of 2009 included $117 million of gains on the sale of mortgage-backed government agency securities.   48      Table of Contents   In November 2009, the FRB issued a final rule under Regulation E which prohibits financial institutions from charging consumers fees for paying overdrafts on electronic transfers, including automated teller machine and debit card transactions, unless a consumer consents, or opts in, to the overdraft service for those types of transactions, effective in the third quarter 2010.   Management expects a low to mid single-digit decline in noninterest income for full-year 2010 compared to 2009, after excluding $243 million of 2009 net securities gains. Included in the outlook is an estimated $5 million negative impact on service charge income in the second half of 2010 from overdraft policy changes consistent with new regulations issued by the Federal Reserve.   Noninterest Expenses   Noninterest expenses were $397 million for the three months ended June 30, 2010, a decrease of $32 million, or seven percent, from $429 million for the comparable period in 2009. The decrease in noninterest expenses resulted primarily from decreases in FDIC insurance expense ($29 million), due to the 2009 industry-wide special assessment charge, and employee benefits expense ($8 million), resulting primarily from a decline in defined benefit pension expense ($6 million), partially offset by an increase in salaries expense ($8 million) as a result of annual merit increases and increased share-based compensation expense. The number of full-time equivalent employees declined by approximately 400, or four percent, from June 30, 2009 to June 30, 2010.   Noninterest expenses were $801 million for the first six months of 2010, a decrease of $25 million, or three percent, compared to $826 million for the comparable period in 2009. The decrease in noninterest expense resulted primarily from decreases in FDIC insurance expense ($27 million) and employee benefits expense ($19 million), resulting primarily from a decline in defined benefit pension expense ($17 million), partially offset by increases in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments ($12 million) and salaries expense ($6 million).   The following table summarizes the various components of salaries and employee benefits expense.

Provision for Income Taxes   The provision for income taxes for the second quarter 2010 was $23 million, compared to a benefit of $59 million for the same period in 2009. For the six months ended June 30, 2010, the provision for income taxes was $18 million, compared to a benefit of $60 million for the same period in 2009.   In the second quarter 2009, the Corporation elected to change the accounting method used to calculate interim period federal income taxes from an estimated annual effective tax rate method to a method which determines taxes based on each discrete quarter’s pre-tax income. The change in method resulted in an increase of approximately $20 million to the income tax benefit recorded in the second quarter 2009, which represented the adjustment necessary to conform the first quarter 2009 tax provision to the new methodology. The $78 million increase in the provision for income taxes in the six-month period ended June 30, 2010, compared to the same period in the prior year, reflected an increase in income before income taxes, the reduction of tax interest in 2009 due to anticipated refunds due from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and a first quarter 2009 $24 million non-taxable gain on the termination of certain leveraged leases. The $82 million increase in the provision for income taxes in the three-month period ended June 30, 2010, compared to the comparable prior year period, reflected the impact of the change in the method of calculating interim period federal income taxes in addition to the items noted above. For further information on income taxes, refer to Note 11 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements.   49      Table of Contents   Net deferred tax assets were $225 million at June 30, 2010, compared to $158 million at December 31, 2009, an increase of $67 million, primarily due to a reduction in deferred tax liabilities resulting from payments made to the IRS in 2010 for structured leasing transactions, partially offset by increased deferred tax liabilities resulting from unrealized gains recognized in other comprehensive income at June 30, 2010. A valuation allowance is provided when it is “more-likely-than-not” that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The valuation allowance of $1 million for certain state deferred tax assets was unchanged at June 30, 2010, compared to December 31, 2009. The Corporation determined that a valuation allowance was not needed against the federal deferred tax assets. Management’s determination was based on taxable income in the carry-back period, existing taxable temporary differences and anticipated future events.   Management expects income tax expense for full-year 2010 to approximate 35 percent of income before income taxes less approximately $60 million of permanent differences related to low-income housing and bank-owned life insurance, partially offset by approximately $5 million of state adjustments.   Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax   Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $17 million for the first six months of 2010, compared to $1 million for the same period in the prior year. The $16 million increase in the first six months of 2010, when compared to the same period in the prior year, resulted from $17 million after-tax gain in the first quarter 2010 from the cash settlement of a note receivable related to the 2006 sale of an investment advisory subsidiary. For further information on the cash settlement of the note and discontinued operations, refer to Note 14 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements.   Business Segments   The Corporation’s operations are strategically aligned into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth & Institutional Management. These business segments are differentiated based on the products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, the Finance Division is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes discontinued operations and items not directly associated with these business segments or the Finance Division. Note 13 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements presents financial results of these business segments for the six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009. For a description of the business activities of each business segment and the methodologies which form the basis for these results, refer to Note 13 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements and Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report.   The following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.              Six Months Ended June 30,         (dollar amounts in millions)       2010       2009         Business Bank       $   223       97   %   $   62       96   %     Retail Bank       (10   )   (4   )   (26   )   (40   )     Wealth & Institutional Management       16       7       28       44                 229       100   %   64       100   %     Finance       (116   )           (42   )             Other (a)       9               5                 Total       $   122               $   27                   (a) Includes discontinued operations and items not directly associated with the three major business segments or the Finance Division.   The Business Bank’s net income of $223 million increased $161 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2009. Net interest income (FTE) was $692 million, an increase of $52 million from the comparable prior year period. The increase in net interest income (FTE) was primarily due to an increase in loan and deposit spreads and the benefit provided by a $4.0 billion increase in average deposits, partially offset by a $7.0 billion decrease in average loans. The provision for loan losses of $219 million decreased $210 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a reduction in reserves for Commercial Real Estate (with decreases in all markets, except Texas) and Global Corporate Banking (primarily in the Western market) business lines. Net credit-related charge-offs of $251 million decreased $83 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to decreases in charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate, Specialty Businesses and Global Corporate Banking business line, partially offset by an increase in the Middle Market    50      Table of Contents   business line. Noninterest income of $152 million increased $10 million from the comparable prior year period, primarily due to increases in commercial lending fees ($7 million), letter of credit fees ($5 million) and foreign exchange income ($4 million), partially offset by an $8 million 2009 gain on the termination of certain leveraged leases. Noninterest expenses of $319 million increased $6 million from the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increases in allocated corporate overhead expenses ($11 million) and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments ($6 million), partially offset by decreases in FDIC insurance expense ($5 million), due primarily to the 2009 industry-wide special assessment charge, employee benefits expense ($3 million) and nominal decreases in other noninterest expense categories.   The net loss for the Retail Bank was $10 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010, compared to a net loss of $26 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009. Net interest income (FTE) of $265 million increased $12 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in loan and deposit spreads, partially offset by decreases in both average deposits ($704 million) and average loans ($677 million). The provision for loan losses decreased $13 million from the comparable period in the prior year, due to decreases in reserves in the Personal Banking and Small Business Banking business lines. Noninterest income of $86 million decreased $7 million from the comparable prior year period, primarily due to a $4 million decline in service charges on deposits. Noninterest expenses of $314 million decreased $14 million from the same period in the prior year, primarily due to decreases in FDIC insurance expense ($10 million), due primarily to the 2009 industry-wide special assessment charge, and employee benefit expense ($4 million), partially offset by an increase in allocated net corporate overhead expenses ($5 million).   Wealth & Institutional Management’s net income of $16 million decreased $12 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2009. Net interest income (FTE) of $87 million increased $10 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to the benefit provided by an increase in average deposits ($344 million) and increases in loan and deposit spreads. The provision for loan losses increased $8 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in reserves in the Private Banking business line, primarily in the Florida market. Noninterest income of $122 million decreased $21 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to decreases in fiduciary income ($6 million), due primarily to the 2009 sale of the Corporation’s proprietary defined contribution plan recordkeeping business, brokerage fees ($5 million) and a 2009 gain related to the sale of the defined contribution plan recordkeeping business ($6 million).   The net loss for the Finance Division was $116 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010, compared to a net loss of $42 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009. Contributing to the $74 million increase in net loss was a $10 million increase in net interest expense (FTE), primarily due to the Corporation’s internal funds transfer policy. In the current low-rate environment, the Finance Division provided a greater benefit for deposits, particularly noninterest-bearing deposits, to the three major business segments in the first six months of 2010 than was actually realized at the corporate level. Noninterest income decreased $117 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a decline in net securities gains. Noninterest expenses decreased $8 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a decline in FDIC insurance ($7 million), due primarily to the 2009 industry-wide special assessment charge.   The Other category’s net income was $9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010, compared to $5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009. The $4 million increase in net income reflected a $17 million after-tax discontinued operations gain recognized in the first quarter 2010, partially offset by timing differences between when corporate expenses are reflected as a consolidated expense and when the expenses are allocated to the business segments.   Market Segments   The Corporation’s management accounting system also produces market segment results for the Corporation’s four primary geographic markets: Midwest, Western, Texas and Florida. In addition to the four primary geographic markets, Other Markets and International are also reported as market segments.  Note 13 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements contains a description and presents financial results of these market segments for the six months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009.   51      Table of Contents   The following table presents net income (loss) by market segment.

The Midwest market’s net income increased $52 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2009. Net interest income (FTE) of $418 million increased $24 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in loan and deposit spreads, and the benefit provided by a $609 million increase in average deposits, partially offset by a $2.7 billion decrease in average loans. The provision for loan losses decreased $80 million, primarily due to a reduction in reserves for the Middle Market and Specialty Businesses business lines. Net credit-related charge-offs of $105 million decreased $48 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to decreases in charge-offs in the Specialty Businesses and Commercial Real Estate business lines. Noninterest income of $199 million decreased $22 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to an $8 million 2009 gain on the termination of certain leveraged leases, and decreases in fiduciary income ($6 million), service charges on deposit accounts ($4 million) and brokerage fees ($3 million). Noninterest expenses of $368 million decreased $12 million from the same period in the prior year, primarily due to decreases in salaries and employee benefits expense ($11 million), FDIC insurance ($9 million), due primarily to the 2009 industry-wide special assessment charge, and smaller decreases in several other noninterest expense categories, partially offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments ($7 million) and allocated net corporate overhead expenses ($7 million).   The Western market recorded net income of $61 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010, compared to a net loss of $14 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009. Net interest income (FTE) of $325 million increased $24 million from the comparable prior year period, primarily due to an increase in loan and deposit spreads and the benefit provided by a $1.3 billion increase in average deposits, partially offset by a $2.1 billion decline in average loans. The provision for loan losses decreased $92 million, primarily due to a reduction in reserves in the Global Corporate Banking and Commercial Real Estate (primarily residential real estate developers in California) business lines. Net credit-related charge-offs of $112 million decreased $34 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to decreases in charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate and Global Corporate Banking business lines. Noninterest expenses of $215 million decreased $2 million from the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a $5 million decrease in FDIC insurance, due primarily to the 2009 industry-wide special assessment charge, and nominal decreases in other noninterest expense categories, partially offset by a $6 million increase in allocated net corporate overhead expenses.   The Texas market’s net income increased $21 million to $40 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2009. Net interest income (FTE) of $160 million increased $17 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in loan and deposit spreads and the benefit provided by an increase of $789 million in average deposits, partially offset by a $1.1 billion decline in average loans. The provision for loan losses decreased $20 million, largely due to decreases in reserves for the Middle Market and Specialty Businesses business lines, partially offset by an increase in the Commercial Real Estate business line. Net credit-related charge-offs of $33 million increased $14 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line. Noninterest expenses of $125 million increased $6 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in allocated net corporate overhead expenses ($4 million).   The net loss for the Florida market was $8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010, compared to a net loss of $14 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009. Net interest income (FTE) of $21 million was largely unchanged from the comparable period in the prior year. The provision for loan losses decreased $16 million, primarily due to a reduction in reserves in the Commercial Real Estate and Middle Market business lines, partially offset by an increase in reserves in the Private Banking business line.   52      Table of Contents   The Other Markets’ net income decreased $4 million to $24 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2009. Net interest income (FTE) of $83 million increased $4 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to increases in loan and deposit spreads and the benefit provided by a $613 million increase in average deposits, partially offset by a $991 million decrease in average loans. The provision for loan losses increased $9 million, primarily due to an increase in reserves for the Middle Market business line, partially offset by a reduction in reserves for the Commercial Real Estate and Global Corporate Banking business lines.   The International market’s net income increased $15 million to $30 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2009. Net interest income (FTE) of $37 million increased $6 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in loan spreads, partially offset by a $454 million decrease in average loans. The provision for loan losses was a negative provision of $8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010, compared to a charge of $8 million for the same period in 2009.   The net loss for Finance & Other Businesses was $107 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010, compared to a net loss of $37 million for the six months ended June 30, 2009. The $70 million increase in net loss was due to the same reasons noted in the Finance Division and Other category discussions under the “Business Segments” heading above.

Total loans decreased $1.6 billion, or four percent, to $40.6 billion at June 30, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009. On an average basis, total assets decreased $2.1 billion in the second quarter 2010, compared to the fourth quarter 2009, resulting primarily from a decrease in average total loans of $2.1 billion, or five percent, to $40.7 billion and a decrease in average investment securities available-for-sale of $1.3 billion, primarily due to the fourth quarter 2009 sales of mortgage-backed government agency securities, partially offset by an increase in average interest-bearing deposits with the FRB ($1.3 billion). The decline in average total loans reflected subdued demand from customers in an uncertain economic environment.   53      Table of Contents   As shown in the following tables, average loans declined in nearly all business lines and in all geographic markets in the second quarter 2010, compared to the fourth quarter 2009.

N/M - not meaningful   While average loan outstandings declined in the second quarter 2010, the pace of decline continued to slow and the Corporation was encouraged by growth in unfunded loans in the underwriting process.   Management expects loans to be stable from period-end June 30, 2010 to period-end December 31, 2010. Investment securities, excluding auction-rate securities, are expected to remain at a level similar to June 30, 2010 for the remainder of 2010.   Total liabilities decreased $2.1 billion, or four percent, to $50.1 billion at June 30, 2010, compared to $52.2 billion at December 31, 2009. Total deposits increased $115 million, or less than one percent, to $39.8 billion at June 30, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009. Core deposits, which exclude other time deposits and foreign office time deposits, increased $1.1 billion, or three percent, from December 31, 2009 to June 30, 2010. Other time deposits decreased $882 million to $165 million at June 30, 2010, compared to December 31, 2009, primarily due to the maturity of retail brokered certificates of deposit. Medium- and long-term debt decreased $2.0 billion to $9.0 billion at June 30, 2010, compared to December 31, 2009, primarily as a result of the maturity of $1.0 billion of Federal Home Loan Bank advances and $950 million of medium-term notes during the period. On an average basis, deposits increased $886 million in the second quarter 2010, compared to the fourth quarter 2009, resulting primarily from an increase in core deposits of $2.2 billion, or six percent, to $38.9 billion.   In April 2010, the FDIC adopted an interim rule extending the Transaction Account Guarantee Program (TAGP) through December 31, 2010 for financial institutions that desire to continue TAGP participation. The Corporation notified the FDIC of its decision to opt-out of the FDIC’s TAGP extension, effective July 1, 2010. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Financial Reform Act”) reinstated, for all financial institutions, unlimited deposit insurance on noninterest-bearing accounts for the period from December 31, 2010 through December 31, 2012. For further discussion of the Financial Reform Act, refer to “The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act” section of this financial review.   54        Table of Contents   Capital   Total shareholders’ equity decreased $1.2 billion to $5.8 billion at June 30, 2010, compared to December 31, 2009, resulting primarily from the first quarter 2010 full redemption of $2.25 billion of preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury, partially funded by the net proceeds from an $880 million common stock offering completed in the first quarter 2010.   In the second quarter 2010, the U.S. Treasury sold the related 11.5 million warrants, which granted the right to purchase an equal amount of shares of the Corporation’s common stock at $29.40 per share. The sale of the warrants by the U.S. Treasury had no impact on the Corporation’s equity. The warrants remained outstanding at June 30, 2010 and were included in “capital surplus” on the consolidated statements of changes in shareholders’ equity at their original fair value of $124 million.   The following table presents a summary of changes in total shareholders’ equity for the six months ended June 30, 2010.

There is no expiration date for the Corporation’s share repurchase program. As shown in the following table, which summarizes the Corporation’s share repurchase activity, there were no shares purchased as part of the Corporation’s publicly announced repurchase program during the six months ended June 30, 2010.

Assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with specified risk-weighting factors. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items. As shown in the table below, the tangible common equity and Tier 1 common capital ratios increased primarily due to the common stock offering completed in the first quarter 2010. The Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios reflect the full redemption of preferred stock, partially offset by the common stock issuance discussed above.   In July 2010, the Financial Reform Act was signed into law, which prohibits holding companies with more than $15 billion in assets from including trust preferred securities in Tier 1 capital, with a phase-in period of three years, beginning on January 1, 2013. At June 30, 2010, the Corporation had $500 million of trust preferred securities outstanding that added an estimated 82 basis points to the Corporation’s Tier 1 capital ratio. For further discussion of the Financial Reform Act, refer to “The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act” section of this financial review.   The Corporation’s capital ratios exceeded minimum regulatory requirements as follows:              June 30, 2010       December 31, 2009         (dollar amounts in millions)       Capital       Ratio       Capital       Ratio         Tier 1 common (a) (b)       $   5,876       9.79   %   $   5,058       8.18   %     Tier 1 risk-based (4.00% - minimum) (b)       6,371       10.61       7,704       12.46         Total risk-based (8.00% - minimum) (b)       9,003       15.00       10,468       16.93         Leverage (3.00% - minimum) (b)       6,371       11.35       7,704       13.25         Tangible common equity (a)       5,636       10.11       4,720       7.99                            (a)   See Supplemental Financial Data section for reconcilements of non-GAAP financial measures.     (b)   June 30, 2010 capital and ratios are estimated.      At June 30, 2010, the Corporation and its U.S. banking subsidiaries exceeded the ratios required for an institution to be considered “well capitalized” (Tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based capital and leverage ratios greater than six percent, 10 percent and five percent, respectively).    Risk Management   The following updated information should be read in conjunction with the “Risk Management” section on pages 38-59 in the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report.   Credit Risk   Allowance for Credit Losses and Nonperforming Assets   The allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The allowance for loan losses represents management’s assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporation’s loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain loans and loan relationships, and allowances for homogeneous pools of loans with similar risk characteristics for the remaining business, consumer and residential mortgage loans. The Corporation defines business loans as those belonging to the commercial, real estate construction, commercial mortgage, lease financing and international loan portfolios.   A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that interest or principal payments will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the original loan agreement. The Corporation performs a detailed credit quality review quarterly on large impaired business and certain large impaired consumer and residential mortgage loans and establishes a specific allowance for such loans, estimated using one of several methods, including the estimated fair value of underlying collateral, observable market value of similar debt or discounted expected future cash flows.   56      Table of Contents   Independent third-party appraisals are obtained prior to the origination of any first mortgage loan. “As developed” collateral values are used at the time of origination of a construction loan, on the assumption that the construction facility provides sufficient funds to complete the project and carry it until it is leased or sold. Credit reviews are performed at least annually on each collateral-dependent loan and, if necessary, adjustments to the original appraisals are made to reflect the most current risk profile of the project. These adjustments may include a revised rental rate or absorption rate, based on the actual conditions at that time. Updated independent third-party appraisals are generally obtained at the time of a refinance or restructure where additional advances are requested or when there is evidence that the physical aspects of the property have deteriorated.   For collateral-dependent impaired loans, updated appraisals are obtained at least annually unless conditions dictate increased frequency. Appraisals on impaired construction loans are generally based on “as is” collateral values. In certain circumstances, the Corporation may believe that the highest and best use of the collateral, and thus the most advantageous exit strategy, requires completion of the construction project. In these situations, the Corporation uses an “as-developed” appraisal to evaluate alternatives. However, the “as-developed” collateral value is appropriately adjusted to reflect the cost to complete the construction project and to prepare the property for sale. Between appraisals the Corporation may reduce the collateral value based upon the age of the appraisal and adverse developments in market conditions.   Loans which do not meet the criteria to be evaluated individually are evaluated in homogeneous pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. The allowance for all other business loans is determined by applying standard reserve factors to the pool of business loans within each internal risk rating. Internal risk ratings are assigned to each business loan at the time of approval and are subjected to subsequent periodic reviews by the Corporation’s senior management. Standard reserve factors for the loans within each risk rating are updated quarterly and are based on estimated probabilities of default and loss given default, incorporating factors such as recent charge-off experience, current economic conditions and trends, changes in collateral values of properties securing loans, and trends with respect to past due and nonaccrual amounts. The standard reserve factors are supported by underlying analysis, including information on migration and loss given default studies from each of the three largest domestic geographic markets (Midwest, Western and Texas), as well as mapping to publicly available debt ratings. Incremental reserves may be established to cover losses in industries and/or portfolios experiencing elevated loss levels. On a limited basis, the Corporation uses data annually from Standard & Poor’s (S&P) publicly available debt ratings to determine the level of probability of default for loans that are considered to have strong credit quality and are assigned the best internal risk ratings. To ensure the use of probability of default based on S&P debt ratings is appropriate, the Corporation compares the assigned internal risk ratings of borrowers that have public debt outstanding to their publicly available S&P debt rating for consistency. The Corporation has sufficient default experience and is able to generate its own probability of default metrics on the remainder of the loan portfolio. The Corporation uses its own loss given default experience to determine the overall expected loss measure.   The allowance for all other consumer and residential mortgage loans is determined by applying estimated loss rates to various pools of loans within the portfolios with similar risk characteristics. Estimated loss rates for all pools are updated quarterly, incorporating factors such as recent charge-off experience, current economic conditions and trends, changes in collateral values of properties securing loans (using index-based estimates), and trends with respect to past due and nonaccrual amounts.   Actual losses experienced in the future may vary from those estimated. The uncertainty occurs because factors may exist which affect the determination of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and are not necessarily captured by the application of standard reserve factors or identified industry-specific risks. An additional allowance is established to capture these probable losses and reflects management’s view that the allowance should recognize the margin for error inherent in the process of estimating expected loan losses. Factors that were considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the Corporation’s allowance for loan losses included the inherent imprecision in the risk rating system resulting from inaccuracy in assigning risk ratings or stale ratings which may not have been updated for recent negative trends in particular credits. Risk ratings on business loan relationships meeting an internally specified exposure threshold are updated annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of a circumstance that affects the credit risk of the relationship.   The total allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb incurred losses inherent in the total loan portfolio. Unanticipated economic events, including political, economic and regulatory instability in countries where the Corporation has loans, could cause changes in the credit characteristics of the portfolio and result in an unanticipated increase in the allowance. Inclusion of other industry-specific portfolio exposures in the allowance, as well as significant increases in the current portfolio exposures, could also increase the amount of the allowance. Any of these events, or some combination thereof, may result in the need for additional provision for loan losses in order to maintain an allowance that complies with credit risk and accounting policies. The allowance for loan losses was    57      Table of Contents   $967 million at June 30, 2010, compared to $985 million at December 31, 2009, a decrease of $18 million, or two percent. The decrease resulted primarily from broad-based improvements in credit quality metrics including a decline of $1.1 billion in the Corporation’s watch list loans - generally consistent with regulatory defined special mention, substandard and doubtful (nonaccrual) loans - from December 31, 2009 to June 30, 2010. The decreases in the allowance for loan losses consisted of decreases in the Commercial Real Estate (primarily the Western and Texas markets) and Global Corporate Banking business lines, partially offset by an increase in specific and incremental allowances for the Middle Market business line (primarily Other Markets and the Western market). The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total period-end loans was 2.38 percent at June 30, 2010, compared to 2.34 percent at December 31, 2009. Nonperforming loans of $1.1 billion at June 30, 2010 decreased $60 million, or five percent, compared to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2009. As noted above, all large nonperforming loans are individually reviewed each quarter for potential charge-offs and reserves. Charge-offs are taken as amounts are determined to be uncollectible. A measure of the level of charge-offs already taken on nonperforming loans is the current book balance as a percentage of the contractual amount owed. At June 30, 2010, nonperforming loans were charged-off to 55 percent of the contractual amount, compared to 56 percent at December 31, 2009. This level of write-downs is consistent with losses experienced on defaulted loans in the first six months of 2010 and in recent years. The allowance as a percentage of total nonperforming loans, a ratio which results from the actions noted above, was 86 percent at June 30, 2010, compared to 83 percent at December 31, 2009. The Corporation’s loan portfolio is heavily composed of business loans, which, in the event of default, are typically carried on the books at fair value as nonperforming assets for a longer period of time than are consumer loans, which are generally fully charged off when they become nonperforming, resulting in a lower nonperforming loan allowance coverage.   The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in “accrued expenses and other liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets, provides for probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments, including unused commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and financial guarantees. Allowances for lending-related commitments for which it is probable that the commitment will be drawn (or sold) are estimated using the same methods as business loans. In general, the probability of draw for letters of credit is considered certain once the credit is assigned an internal risk rating generally consistent with regulatory defined substandard or doubtful. Other letters of credit, all unfunded commitments and financial guarantees have a lower probability of draw, to which standard loan loss rates are applied.   The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $44 million at June 30, 2010, an increase of $7 million from $37 million at December 31, 2009. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in specific reserves related to standby letters of credit extended to customers in the Midwest market.   58      Table of Contents   Nonperforming assets at June 30, 2010 were $1.2 billion, compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2009, and are summarized in the following table.

Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $13.1 billion at June 30, 2010, of which $4.3 billion, or 33 percent, were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to residential real estate investors and developers. The remaining $8.8 billion, or 67 percent, of commercial real estate loans in other business lines consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans.   The geographic distribution and project type of commercial real estate loans are important factors in diversifying credit risk within the portfolio. The following table reflects real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line by project type and location of property.

Net credit-related charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $121 million for the first six months of 2010, including $52 million in the Western market (residential real estate development business), $26 million in the Midwest market and $24 million in the Texas market.   63      Table of Contents   The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-time customers with satisfactory completion experience. However, the significant and sudden decline in residential real estate activity that began in late 2008 in the Western, Florida and Midwest markets proved extremely difficult for many of the smaller residential real estate developers. Of the $2.3 billion of real estate construction loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line, $385 million were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2010, including single family projects totaling $146 million (primarily in the Western and Florida markets) and residential land development projects totaling $109 million (primarily in the Western and Texas markets). Real estate construction loan net charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $93 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010, including $36 million from single family projects (primarily the Western, Other Markets and Florida markets), $20 million from multi-use projects (primarily the Texas and Western markets) and $18 million from residential land development projects (primarily the Texas market).   The commercial mortgage loan portfolio totaled $10.3 billion at June 30, 2010 and included $8.3 billion of primarily owner-occupied commercial mortgage loans. Commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $2.0 billion and included $135 million of nonaccrual loans at June 30, 2010, which consisted primarily of residential land carry, single family and nonresidential land carry projects ($41 million, $32 million and $30 million, respectively). Commercial mortgage loan net charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $28 million for the six months ended June 30, 2010, primarily from residential land carry and multi-family projects ($10 million and $7 million, respectively).   Residential real estate loans, which consist of traditional residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit, totaled $3.4 billion at June 30, 2010. Residential mortgages totaled $1.6 billion at June 30, 2010, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.6 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $53 million were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2010. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.8 billion at June 30, 2010, of which $1.6 billion was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit and $234 million consisted of closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.8 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $6 million were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2010. A substantial majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens.   The following table summarizes the Corporation’s residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolio by geographic market as of June 30, 2010.

A significant majority of residential mortgage originations are sold in the secondary market. The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation’s primary geographic markets. The economic recession and significant declines in home values in the Western, Florida and Midwest markets following the financial market turmoil beginning in the fall of 2008 adversely impacted the residential real estate portfolio. At June 30, 2010, the Corporation estimated that, of the $17 million total residential mortgage loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest, approximately $2 million exceeded 90 percent of the current value of the underlying collateral, based on S&P/Case-Shiller home price indices. To account for this exposure, the Corporation factors changes in home values into estimated loss ratios for residential real estate loans, using index-based estimates by major metropolitan area, resulting in an increased allowance allocated for residential real estate loans when home values decline. Additionally, to mitigate increasing credit exposure due to depreciating home values, the Corporation periodically reviews home equity lines of credit and makes line reductions or converts outstanding balances at line maturity to closed-end, amortizing loans when necessary.   Shared National Credits   Shared National Credit (SNC) loans are facilities greater than $20 million shared by three or more federally supervised financial institutions that are reviewed by regulatory authorities at the agent bank level. The Corporation generally seeks to obtain ancillary business at the origination of a SNC relationship. Loans classified as SNC loans (approximately 1,000 borrowers at June 30, 2010) totaled $7.7 billion at June 30, 2010, a decline of $1.4 billion from $9.1 billion at December 31, 2009. SNC net loan charge-offs totaled $22 million and $62 million for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010, respectively. Nonaccrual SNC loans decreased $51 million to $243 million during the six months ended June 30, 2010, from $294 million at December 31, 2009. SNC loans, diversified by both business line and geographic market, comprised approximately 19 percent and 20 percent of total loans at June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. SNC loans are held to the same credit underwriting standards as the remainder of the loan portfolio and face similar credit challenges, primarily driven by residential real estate development.   Automotive Lending   Loans to borrowers involved with automotive production totaled approximately $906 million at June 30, 2010, compared to $941 million at December 31, 2009. Loans in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $3.6 billion and $3.3 billion at June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. Of the $3.6 billion of outstanding loans in the National Dealer Services business line at June 30, 2010, approximately $2.3 billion, or 63 percent, were to foreign franchises, $814 million, or 23 percent, were to domestic franchises and $504 million, or 14 percent, were to other. Other dealer loans include obligations where a primary franchise was indeterminable, such as loans to large public dealership consolidators and rental car, leasing, heavy truck and recreation vehicle companies.   For further discussion of credit risk, see the “Credit Risk” section on pages 38-51 in the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report.   65      Table of Contents   Market Risk   Interest Rate Risk   Net interest income is the predominant source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises primarily through the Corporation’s core business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits. The Corporation’s balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating rate commercial loans funded by a combination of core deposits and wholesale borrowings. This creates a natural imbalance between the floating-rate loan portfolio and the more slowly repricing deposit products. The result is that growth and/or contraction in the Corporation’s core businesses will lead to sensitivity to interest rate movements without mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing investment securities, primarily fixed-rate, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, and hedging the sensitivity with interest rate swaps. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk, with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.   The Corporation frequently evaluates net interest income under various balance sheet and interest rate scenarios, looking at both 12 and 24 month time horizons, using simulation modeling analysis as its principal risk management evaluation technique. The results of these analyses provide the information needed to assess the balance sheet structure. Changes in economic activity, whether domestic or international, different from those management included in its simulation analyses could translate into a materially different interest rate environment than currently expected. Management evaluates a base case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment and what is believed to be the most likely balance sheet structure. This base case net interest income is then evaluated against non-parallel interest rate scenarios that gradually increase and decrease rates approximately 200 basis points in a linear fashion from the base case over twelve months (but decrease to no lower than zero percent). Due to the current low level of interest rates, the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of a 25 basis point drop, to zero percent, while the rising interest rate scenario reflects a gradual 200 basis point rise. In addition, consistent with each interest rate scenario, adjustments to asset prepayment levels, yield curves, and overall balance sheet mix and growth assumptions are made. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model may not precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rate, market conditions and management strategies, among other factors. However, the model can indicate the likely direction of change. Existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes are included in these analyses, but no additional hedging is forecasted.   The table below, as of June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above. The sensitivity from December 31, 2009 to June 30, 2010 was essentially unchanged, as changes in funding mix offset the impact from the first quarter 2010 full redemption of $2.25 billion of preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury.

The economic value of equity analysis begins with an estimate of the mark-to-market valuation of the Corporation’s balance sheet and then applies the estimated impact of rate movements to the market value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments. The economic value of equity is then calculated as the difference between the estimated market value of assets and liabilities net of the impact of off-balance sheet instruments. As with net interest income shocks, a variety of alternative scenarios are performed to measure the impact on economic value of equity, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve.   66      Table of Contents   The table below, as of June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from a 200 basis point immediate parallel increase or decrease in interest rates (but decrease to no lower than zero percent). Similar to the simulation analysis above, due to the current low level of interest rates, the economic value of equity analyses below reflect an interest rate scenario of an immediate 25 basis point drop, to zero percent, while the rising interest rate scenario reflects an immediate 200 basis point rise. The change in the sensitivity of the economic value of equity to a 200 basis point parallel increase in rates between December 31, 2009 and June 30, 2010 was primarily driven by changes in the Corporation’s mortgage-backed securities portfolio mix and forecasted prepayments, which modestly reduce balance sheet sensitivity to rising rates.

At June 30, 2010, the Corporation held excess liquidity, represented by $3.3 billion deposited with the FRB. The Corporation may access the purchased funds market when necessary, which includes certificates of deposit issued to institutional investors in denominations in excess of $100,000 and to retail customers in denominations of less than $100,000 through brokers (“other time deposits” on the consolidated balance sheets), foreign office time deposits and short-term borrowings. Purchased funds totaled $849 million at June 30, 2010, compared to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2009. Capacity for incremental purchased funds at June 30, 2010, consisted largely of federal funds purchased, brokered certificates of deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. In addition, the Corporation is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, Texas (FHLB), which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. The actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. As of June 30, 2010, the Corporation had $5.0 billion of outstanding borrowings from the FHLB with remaining maturities ranging from 3 months to 4 years. Another source of funding, if needed, would be liquid assets, which totaled $7.5 billion at June 30, 2010, compared to $7.7 billion at December 31, 2009, including cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell, interest-bearing deposits with the FRB and other banks, other short-term investments and unencumbered investment securities available-for-sale. Additionally, the Corporation could issue up to $13.8 billion of debt at June 30, 2010 under an existing $15 billion medium-term senior note program which allows its principal banking subsidiary to issue debt with maturities between one and 30 years.   Other Market Risks   Certain components of the Corporation’s noninterest income, primarily fiduciary income, are at risk to fluctuations in the market values of underlying assets, particularly equity and debt securities. Other components of noninterest income, primarily brokerage fees, are at risk to changes in the volume of market activity.   At June 30, 2010, the Corporation had a $55 million portfolio of investments in indirect private equity and venture capital funds, with commitments of $23 million to fund additional investments in future periods. The value of these investments is at risk to changes in equity markets, general economic conditions and a variety of other factors. The majority of these investments are not readily marketable and are included in “accrued income and other assets” on the consolidated balance sheets. The investments are individually reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value.   For further discussion of market risk, see Note 5 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements and pages 52-59 in the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report.   67      Table of Contents   The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act   On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Financial Reform Act”) was signed into law. The Financial Reform Act provides for, among other matters, increased regulatory supervision and examination of financial institutions, the imposition of more stringent capital requirements on financial institutions and increased regulation of derivatives and hedging transactions. Provided below is an overview of key elements of the Financial Reform Act relevant to the Corporation. Most of the provisions contained in the Financial Reform Act will be effective immediately upon enactment; however, many have delayed effective dates. Implementation of the Financial Reform Act will require many new mandatory and discretionary rules to be made by federal regulatory agencies over the next several years. The estimates of the impact on the Corporation discussed below are based on the limited information currently available and, given the uncertainty of the timing and scope of the impact, are subject to change until final rulemaking is complete.   · Interest on Demand Deposits: Allows interest on commercial demand deposits, which could lead to increased cost of commercial demand deposits, depending on the interplay of interest, deposit credits and service charges.   · TAG Extension: Provides unlimited deposit insurance on noninterest-bearing accounts from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2012. Assuming the same assessment rate as the current program, applied to first quarter 2010 deposit levels, the estimated annual cost is approximately $14 million.   · Deposit Insurance: Changes the definition of assessment base from domestic deposits to net assets (average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity), increases the deposit insurance fund’s minimum reserve ratio and permanently increases general deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 to $250,000. Assuming no change to the current assessment rate, applied to first quarter 2010 net assets, the estimated increase in annual FDIC fees is approximately $17 million.   · Derivatives: Allows continued trading of foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives. Requires banks to shift energy, uncleared commodities and agriculture derivatives to a separately capitalized subsidiary within their holding company. Directly impacts client-driven energy derivatives business (approximately $1 million in annual revenue, based on full-year 2010 estimates).   · Interchange Fee: Limits debit card transaction processing fees that card issuers can charge to merchants. Current estimated annual revenue, based on full-year 2010 estimates, from debit card PIN and signature-based interchange fees of $7 million and $31 million, respectively, could decrease.   · Trust Preferred Securities: Prohibits holding companies with more than $15 billion in assets from including trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital, and allows for a phase-in period of three years, beginning on January 1, 2013. At June 30, 2010, the Corporation had $500 million of trust preferred securities outstanding that added an estimated 82 basis points to the Corporation’s Tier 1 capital ratio.   Critical Accounting Policies   The Corporation’s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report, as updated in Note 1 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation’s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2009, the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to allowance for credit losses, valuation methodologies, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages 60-65 in the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report.   As discussed above, the Financial Reform Act is expected to impact certain fee categories, including fees in the Corporation’s Retail Bank business segment. The ultimate impact of the Financial Reform Act is subject to interpretation and will remain uncertain until final rulemaking is complete. Given the uncertainty of the timing and scope of the estimated impact, the Corporation has concluded that the accounting policy related to goodwill requires classification as a critical accounting policy, effective July, 2010. There have been no events since the annual test performed in the third quarter 2009 that would indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill had become impaired.   68        Table of Contents   Below is the additional critical accounting policy for goodwill reflecting the results of the most recent annual test performed as of the third quarter 2009. As of the date of this report, the Corporation does not believe there are any other material changes in the nature or categories of the critical accounting policies or estimates and assumptions from those discussed in the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report.   Goodwill   Goodwill is the value attributed to unidentifiable intangible elements in acquired businesses. Goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment. The Corporation conducts its evaluation of goodwill impairment in the third quarter each year and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate the assets might be impaired. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level, equivalent to a business segment or one level below.   The goodwill impairment test is a two-step test. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the Corporation’s identified reporting units with their carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and the amount of goodwill impairment, if any.   Estimating the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process involving the use of estimates and judgments, particularly related to future cash flows of the reporting units, discount rates (including market risk premiums) and market multiples. The fair values of the reporting units were determined using a blend of two commonly used valuation techniques, the market approach and the income approach. The Corporation gives consideration to both valuation techniques, as either technique can be an indicator of value. For the market approach, valuations of reporting units were based on an analysis of relevant price multiples in market trades in industries similar to the reporting unit. Market trades do not consider a control premium associated with an acquisition or a sale transaction. For the income approach, estimated future cash flows and terminal value (value at the end of the cash flow period, based on price multiples) were discounted. The discount rate was based on the imputed cost of equity capital appropriate for each reporting unit. Material assumptions used in the valuation models included the comparable public company price multiples used in the terminal value, future cash flows and the market risk premium component of the discount rate. Due to the general uncertainty and depressed earning capacity in the financial services industry as of the measurement date, the Corporation concluded that the valuation under the income approach more clearly reflected the long-term future earning capacity of the reporting units, rather than the valuation under the market approach, and thus gave greater weight to the income approach.   Four reporting units of the Corporation contain goodwill: one reporting unit in the Business Bank, the Retail Bank (a single reporting unit), and two reporting units in Wealth and Institutional Management. At the conclusion of the first step of the goodwill impairment test performed in the third quarter 2009, the estimated fair values of all reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying amounts, including goodwill, with the exception of the Retail Bank, which had a fair value that exceeded carrying value by five percent.   As of June 30, 2010, approximately $47 million of the Corporation’s consolidated goodwill of $150 million was associated with the Retail Bank. Given the result of the goodwill impairment test performed as of the third quarter 2009, the goodwill of the Retail Bank may be particularly sensitive to further deterioration in economic conditions, such as unemployment rates and home prices, which could impact assumptions associated with credit losses, loan growth and deposit gathering. In addition, potential legislative and regulatory changes could affect fee-based revenue. Economic conditions impact our assumptions related to imputed cost of equity capital, loss rates, interest and growth rates. Therefore, deterioration in economic conditions may cause the fair value of the Retail Bank to fall below the carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Any such charge would not affect the Corporation’s regulatory capital ratios, tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position.   69      Table of Contents   Supplemental Financial Data   The following tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this financial review with financial measures defined by GAAP.

The Corporation believes this measurement provides meaningful information to investors, regulators, management and others of the impact on net interest income and net interest margin resulting from the Corporation’s short-term investment in low yielding instruments.   70      Table of Contents   The Tier 1 common capital ratio removes preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations. The tangible common equity ratio removes preferred stock and the effect of intangible assets from capital and the effect of intangible assets from total assets. The Corporation believes these measurements are meaningful measures of capital adequacy used by investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and to compare against other companies in the industry.   ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   Quantitative and qualitative disclosures for the current period can be found in the “Market Risk” section of “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”   ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures   (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Corporation maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Corporation’s management, including the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management has evaluated, with the participation of the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report (the “Evaluation Date”). Based on the evaluation, the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.   (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. During the period to which this report relates, there have not been any changes in the Corporation’s internal controls over financial reporting procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, such controls.   PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings   For information regarding the Corporation’s legal proceedings, see “Part I. Item 1. Note 12 — Contingent Liabilities,” which is incorporated herein by reference.   ITEM 1A. Risk Factors   Other than as set forth below, there has been no material change in the Corporation’s risk factors as previously disclosed in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 in response to Part I, Item 1A. of such Form 10-K, other than as amended in our Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2010 in response to Part II, Item 1A. of such Form 10-Q. Such risk factors are incorporated herein by reference.   Below we amend the following risk factor discussed in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, as updated by Part II, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2010:   Recently enacted legislation, actions recently taken by or proposed by the United States Department of Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Bank or other governmental entities, and legislation enacted in the future subject or may subject the Corporation to increased regulation, and the impact and expiration of such legislation and regulatory actions may adversely affect the Corporation.   On October 3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the “EESA”) was signed into law. Pursuant to the EESA, the U.S. Treasury was granted the authority to take a range of actions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial markets and has proposed several programs, including the purchase by the U.S. Treasury of certain troubled assets from financial institutions and the direct purchase by the    71      Table of Contents   U.S. Treasury of equity of financial institutions. Pursuant to the EESA, the U.S. Treasury has the authority to, among other things, purchase up to $700 billion of mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial markets. In connection therewith, the U.S. Treasury introduced the Capital Purchase Program, under which it has purchased approximately $196 billion of preferred stock in eligible institutions, including the Corporation, to increase the flow of financing to U.S. businesses and consumers and to support the U.S. economy. On March 17, 2010, the Corporation fully redeemed the preferred stock previously issued to the U.S. Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program. The EESA also temporarily raised the limit on federal deposit insurance coverage provided by the FDIC from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor.   On May 20, 2009, the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009, which extended the temporary increase in the standard maximum deposit insurance amount provided by the FDIC to $250,000 per depositor through December 31, 2013, was signed into law. This extension of the temporary $250,000 coverage limit (pursuant to the EESA) became effective immediately upon the President’s signature.   On October 14, 2008, the FDIC announced the development of a guarantee program under the systemic risk exception to the Federal Deposit Act. As a result of this regulatory initiative, the FDIC implemented the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (“TLGP”) to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system. The TLGP is comprised of the Debt Guarantee Program (“DGP”) and the Transaction Account Guarantee Program (“TAGP”). The DGP guaranteed all newly issued senior unsecured debt (e.g., promissory notes, unsubordinated unsecured notes and commercial paper) up to prescribed limits issued by participating entities beginning on October 14, 2008 and continued through October 31, 2009. For eligible debt issued by that date, the FDIC will provide the guarantee coverage until the earlier of the maturity date of the debt or December 31, 2012 (or June 30, 2012 for debt issued prior to April 1, 2009). As of June 30, 2010, the Corporation had no senior unsecured debt outstanding under the DGP. The TAGP offers full guarantee for noninterest-bearing transaction accounts held at FDIC-insured depository institutions. The unlimited deposit coverage was voluntary for eligible institutions and was in addition to the $250,000 FDIC deposit insurance per account that was included as part of the EESA and the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act, respectively. The limits are presently scheduled to return to $100,000 on January 1, 2014. The TAGP coverage became effective on October 14, 2008 and continued for the Corporation until June 30, 2010. In April 2010, the FDIC adopted an interim rule extending the TAGP through December 31, 2010 for financial institutions that desire to continue TAGP participation. The Corporation notified the FDIC of its decision to opt-out of the FDIC’s TAGP extension, effective July 1, 2010. The impact of such decision on the Corporation’s deposit levels cannot be reliably determined at this time.   During the second quarter of 2009, the FDIC levied an industry-wide special assessment charge on insured financial institutions as part of the agency’s efforts to rebuild DIF. In November 2009, the FDIC amended regulations that required insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly risk-based assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010-2012. The prepaid assessments will be applied against future quarterly assessments (as they may be so revised) until the prepaid assessment is exhausted or the balance of the prepayment is returned, whichever occurs first. The FDIC is not precluded from changing assessment rates or from further revising the risk-based assessment system during the prepayment period or thereafter. Thus, we may also be required to pay significantly higher FDIC insurance assessments premiums in the future because market developments significantly depleted DIF and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits.   The programs and regulations established or to be established under the EESA and Capital Purchase Program may have adverse effects upon the Corporation. It may face increased regulation of the financial services industry. Compliance with such regulation may increase the Corporation’s costs and limit its ability to pursue business opportunities. Also, participation in specific programs may subject the Corporation to additional restrictions. For example, due to the Corporation’s participation in the Capital Purchase Program, the Corporation issued a warrant to purchase 11,479,592 million of its common shares at an exercise price of $29.40 per share. The potential dilutive impact of the warrant may have an adverse effect on the market price of its common stock. On March 17, 2010, the Corporation fully redeemed the preferred stock previously issued to the U.S. Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program; however, the Corporation elected to not repurchase the warrant. On May 12, 2010, the U.S. Treasury sold the warrants for $16.00 per warrant. The sale by the U.S. Treasury had no impact on the Corporation’s equity and the warrants remain outstanding and are included in paid in capital. The Corporation’s participation in the TAGP required the payment of additional insurance premiums to the FDIC through June 30, 2010, in addition to the FDIC’s regular and special assessments. The effects of such recently enacted legislation and regulatory actions on the Corporation cannot reliably be determined at this time. Moreover, as some of the legislation and regulatory actions previously implemented in response to the recent financial crisis expire, the impact of the conclusion of these programs on the financial sector and on the economic recovery is unknown. Any delay in    72      Table of Contents   the economic recovery or a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could adversely affect the Corporation.   Recently, the Federal Reserve adopted amendments to its Regulation E that were effective on July 1, 2010. The changes affect the circumstances when the Corporation will be able to charge its clients overdraft fees.   On January 14, 2010, the current administration announced a proposal to impose a fee (the “Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee”) on those financial institutions that benefited from recent actions taken by the U.S. government to stabilize the financial system. If implemented as initially proposed, the Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee will be applied to firms with over $50 billion in consolidated assets, and, therefore, by its terms would apply to the Corporation.   On July 21, 2010, the Financial Reform Act was signed into law. The Financial Reform Act provides for, among other matters, increased regulatory supervision and examination of financial institutions, the imposition of more stringent capital requirements on financial institutions and increased regulation of derivatives and hedging transactions. As portions of the Financial Reform Act are implemented, the Corporation will continue to monitor and evaluate its impact on the operations of the Corporation and its subsidiaries.   We can neither predict when or whether future regulatory or legislative reforms will be enacted nor what their contents will be. The impact of any future legislation or regulatory actions on the Corporation’s businesses or operations cannot be reliably determined at this time, and such impact may adversely affect the Corporation.
