The Corporation does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect facts, circumstances, assumptions or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made. For any forward-looking statements made in this report or in any documents, the Corporation claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.34Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSNet income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 was $281 million, an increase of $79 million from $202 million reported for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net income per diluted common share was $1.59 for the first quarter 2018 compared to $1.11 for the first quarter 2017. Prudent management of loan and deposit pricing as rates increased, successful execution of GEAR Up initiatives and a decrease in the federal statutory tax rate resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the first quarter of 2018 contributed to the increase in net income. Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2018 included the impact of tax benefits from employee stock transactions of $19 million (11 cents per share), the after-tax impact of restructuring charges of $12 million (7 cents per share) and a deferred tax benefit of $3 million (1 cent per share). Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 included the impact of tax benefits from employee stock transactions of $24 million (13 cents per share) and the after-tax impact of restructuring charges of $7 million (4 cents per share).Growth in Efficiency and Revenue InitiativeSince the GEAR Up initiative was launched in 2016, the Corporation has consolidated 38 banking centers, implemented a new retirement program resulting in a significant reduction in retirement plan expense and reduced the number of full-time equivalent employees by over 800, among other initiatives. The impact of increases in short-term rates and the execution of certain GEAR Up initiatives helped lower the efficiency ratio to 56.3 percent and increase return on equity to 14.4 percent for the first quarter 2018. The Corporation anticipates cumulative benefits to pre-tax income from GEAR Up initiatives of approximately $270 million and $305 million for full-year 2018 and 2019, respectively, from when the initiative was announced. For further details on anticipated additional benefits, refer to page F-5 of the Corporation's 2017 Annual Report.Total pre-tax restructuring charges for 2018 are expected to range from $47 million to $57 million with no restructuring charges anticipated beyond 2018. Cumulative restructuring charges from inception of GEAR Up through 2018 are expected to range from $185 million to $195 million. For additional information regarding restructuring charges, refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.Full-Year 2018 Outlook Compared to Full-Year 2017For full-year 2018 compared to full-year 2017, management expects the following, assuming a continuation of the current economic and rate environment as well as approximately $270 million of benefits from the GEAR Up initiative:•Growth in average loans in line with real Gross Domestic Product (GDP), reflecting increases in most lines of business, led by general Middle Market, Technology and Life Sciences, National Dealer Services and Mortgage Banker Finance, while remaining stable in Energy and Corporate Banking. •Net interest income higher, reflecting rate increases and loan growth.◦Full-year benefits from the 2017 and first quarter rate increases of $205 million to $215 million.◦Elevated interest recoveries of $28 million in 2017 not expected to repeat in 2018.•Provision for credit losses of 15 to 25 basis points of average loans and net charge-offs to remain low, with continued solid performance of the overall portfolio.•Noninterest income higher by 4 percent (compared to full-year 2017 excluding the impact of accounting changes of $120 million and deferred compensation of $8 million) benefiting from the continued execution of GEAR Up opportunities helping to drive growth in treasury management income, card fees, brokerage fees and fiduciary income.•Noninterest expenses higher by 1 percent (compared to full-year 2017 excluding the impact of accounting changes of $120 million and restructuring of $45 million) reflecting an additional $50 million benefit from the GEAR Up initiative. ◦Restructuring charges of $47 million to $57 million. ◦Continued higher technology expenditures and typical inflationary pressures.◦Efficiency ratio to continue to improve.•Income tax expense to be approximately 23 percent of pre-tax income, excluding any further tax impact from employee stock transactions.35Table of ContentsNet Interest IncomeThe "Quarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume" table that follows provides an analysis of net interest income for the three months

(a)Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume.(b)Includes investment securities available-for-sale and investment securities held-to-maturity.Net interest income was $549 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, an increase of $79 million compared to $470 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in net interest income primarily reflected the net benefit from higher rates. The impact of a $1.9 billion decrease in interest-bearing deposits with banks, primarily Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) deposits, was largely offset by a $521 million increase in average loans. The net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2018 increased 56 basis points to 3.41 percent, from 2.85 percent for the comparable period in 2017, reflecting the net benefit from higher rates and the decrease in lower-yielding average balances deposited with the FRB.For further discussion of the effects of market rates on net interest income, refer to the "Market and Liquidity Risk" section of this financial review.Provision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses was $12 million and $16 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The provision for credit losses includes both the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The provision for loan losses is recorded to maintain the allowance for loan losses at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio. The provision for loan losses was $14 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $11 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The $3 million increase in the provision primarily reflected higher loan balances as of March 31, 2018 compared to March 31, 2017, mostly offset by improved credit quality. Gross charge-offs decreased $7 million to $37 million, and recoveries decreased $2 million to $9 million, resulting in net loan charge-offs of $28 million, or 0.23 percent of average total loans, for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to $33 million, or 0.28 percent, for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in net charge-offs was driven by decreases in Energy and Technology and Life Sciences, partially offset by an increase in general Middle Market.The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments is recorded to maintain the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was a benefit of $2 million and a provision of $5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The $7 million decrease in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments in the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 reflected decreases in commercial commitments, primarily due to Energy. There were no lending-related commitment charge-offs for three months ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets is presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.37Table of ContentsPresentation Changes from Adoption of Topic 606Noninterest income and noninterest expense for the first quarter 2018 reflect certain presentation changes ("proforma effect") resulting from the adoption of Topic 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." Refer to note 1 for further details. These changes impacted card fees and service charges on deposit accounts, included in noninterest income, fully offset by the impact to outside processing fee expense within noninterest expense.

The effect of this change was to reduce card fees by $34 million and service charges on deposit accounts by $1 million in the first quarter 2018.(b)The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income.Noninterest income decreased $27 million to $244 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $271 million for the same period in 2017. Excluding the $26 million proforma effect of the new revenue recognition accounting standard to the three months ended March 31, 2017, noninterest income decreased $1 million, primarily due to a $3 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts and smaller decreases in various other categories, partially offset by increases of $7 million in card fees and $3 million in fiduciary income.The following table illustrates certain categories included in other noninterest income on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

Income earned on these assets is reported in noninterest income and the resulting change in deferred compensation plan liabilities is reported in salaries and benefits expense. Changes in income earned on deferred compensation assets are substantially offset by changes in deferred compensation plan expense.38Table of ContentsNoninterest Expenses Three Months Ended March 31,(in millions)2018 2017Salaries and benefits expense$255 $245Outside processing fee expense (a)61 87Net occupancy expense38 38Equipment expense11 11Restructuring charges16 11Software expense31 29FDIC insurance expense13 13Advertising expense6 4Litigation-related expense— (2)Other noninterest expenses15 21Total noninterest expenses$446 $457(a)Adoption of new accounting standard for revenue recognition, effective January 1, 2018, resulted in a change in presentation which records certain costs in the same category as the associated revenues. The effect of this change was to reduce outside processing fee expense by $35 million in the first quarter 2018.Noninterest expenses decreased $11 million to $446 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $457 million for the same period in 2017. Excluding the $26 million proforma effect of the new revenue recognition accounting standard to the three months ended March 31, 2017, noninterest expenses increased $15 million, reflecting increases of $10 million in salaries and benefits expense, $5 million in restructuring charges and smaller increases in several other categories, partially offset by a $5 million business tax refund included in other noninterest expenses. The increase in salaries and benefits expense was primarily driven by a $6 million increase in stock compensation. For further information about restructuring charges associated with the GEAR Up initiative, see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.Provision for Income TaxesThe provision for income taxes decreased $12 million to $54 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to $66 million for the same period in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the statutory tax rate in the first quarter of 2018 resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, partially offset by an increase in pretax income and a $5 million decrease in tax benefits from employee stock transactions.STRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESSThe Corporation has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, the Finance division is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes items not directly associated with these business segments or the Finance segment. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Market segment results are also provided for the Corporation's three primary geographic markets: Michigan, California and Texas. In addition to the three primary geographic markets, Other Markets is also reported as a market segment. Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of these business and market segments for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.The Corporation's management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. These methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines. Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation's 2017 Annual Report describes the Corporation's segment reporting methodology.Net interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities plus the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing (FTP). The FTP methodology allocates each business segment credits for deposits and other funds provided and charges each business segment for loans and other assets being funded. FTP crediting rates for deposits and other funds provided reflect the long-term value of deposits and other funding sources, based on their implied maturities. FTP charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost of funds based on the pricing and duration characteristics of the assets. Therefore, net interest income for each segment primarily reflects the volume and associated FTP impacts of loan and deposit levels. FTP crediting rates on deposits were generally higher in the three months ended March 31, 2018 than in the same period in the prior year, and, as a result, net interest income for deposit-39Table of Contentsproviding business segments has been positively impacted during the current year. As overall market rates increased, FTP charges for funding loans increased for asset-generating business segments in the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period in the prior year.The following sections present a summary of the performance of each of the Corporation's business and market segments for the three months ended March 31, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year. The proforma effect of the new revenue recognition standard to the three months ended March 31, 2017, reducing both noninterest income and noninterest expenses by $26 million, primarily impacted the Business Bank and Other Markets segments.Business SegmentsThe following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.

Average loans increased $614 million and average deposits decreased $2.3 billion. Net interest income decreased $2 million to $330 million. An increase in loan income of $75 million was more than offset by a $4 million increase in deposit costs and allocation of a net FTP charge of $74 million. The FTP allocation reflected an increase in funding charges as well as increases in crediting rates on deposits as a result of higher short-term rates. The decline in deposit balances resulted in a decrease in FTP deposit credits. The provision for credit losses was unchanged at $10 million, reflecting an increase in general Middle Market, offset by a decrease in Technology and Life Sciences. Net credit-related charge-offs decreased $12 million to $18 million, primarily reflecting decreases in Energy and Technology and Life Sciences, partially offset by an increase in general Middle Market. Excluding the $23 million proforma effect to the prior year of adopting the new revenue recognition accounting standard, noninterest income was unchanged, and noninterest expenses increased $10 million. Noninterest income was primarily impacted by a $6 million increase in card fees, offset by decreases of $2 million each in customer derivative income, letter of credit fees and commercial lending fees. The increase in noninterest expenses primarily reflected a $3 million increase in restructuring charges, the impact of a $2 million favorable litigation-related settlement recognized in the first quarter 2017 and smaller increases in several other categories of noninterest expenses, partially offset by a $3 million decrease in FDIC insurance expense.The Retail Bank's net income increased $9 million to $20 million. Average deposits increased $269 million. Net interest income increased $5 million to $165 million. An increase in loan income of $9 million was partially offset by the allocation of a net FTP charge of $2 million. The FTP allocation reflected an increase in funding charges as well as increases in crediting rates on deposits as a result of higher short-term rates. Higher deposit balances resulted in an increase in FTP deposit credits. The provision for credit losses decreased $8 million, primarily reflecting a decrease in Small Business. Net credit-related charge-offs increased $7 million to $12 million, primarily due to an increase in Small Business. Noninterest income decreased $6 million to $42 million, primarily due to a $2 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts, partially due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, and smaller decreases in several other noninterest income categories. Noninterest expenses decreased $2 million to $177 million, primarily reflecting a $5 million decrease in outside processing fee expense, partially due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, and smaller decreases in other categories, partially offset by a $2 million increase in salaries and benefits expense.Wealth Management's net income increased $8 million to $31 million. Net interest income was unchanged at $41 million. The provision for credit losses decreased $3 million to a benefit of $4 million. Net credit-related recoveries were unchanged at $2 million.

Noninterest expenses increased $2 million to $72 million, primarily reflecting a $2 million increase in salaries and benefits expense. Net income in the Finance segment was $12 million compared to a net loss of $35 million. Net interest income increased $72 million to $1 million, primarily reflecting a decrease in net FTP expense as a result of higher rates charged to the business segments under the Corporation's internal FTP methodology.40Table of ContentsMarket SegmentsThe following table presents net income (loss) by market segment.

The increase in medium - and long-term debt was due to an increase in FHLB advances. The decrease in total deposits primarily reflected a seasonal decrease of $1.1 billion in noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by an increase of $842 million interest-bearing deposits. On an average basis, total liabilities decreased $1 billion in the first quarter 2018, compared to the fourth quarter 2017, primarily due to a decrease of $1.6 billion in total deposits, partially offset by an increase of $561 million in medium- and long-term debt. The decrease in average total deposits primarily reflected seasonal decreases in general Middle Market, Corporate Banking and Commercial Real Estate.CapitalTotal shareholders' equity increased $37 million to $8 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to December 31, 2017.

These stress tests are a normal part of the Corporation's overall risk management and capital planning process and are part of the forecasting process used by the Corporation to conduct the enterprise-wide stress test that was part of the FRB's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). For additional information about risk management processes, refer to the "Risk Management" sections of this financial review and the Corporation's 2017 Annual Report.The FRB completed its 2017 CCAR review in June 2017 and did not object to the Corporation's 2017 capital plan and capital distributions contemplated in the plan for the period ending June 30, 2018. The plan includes equity repurchases of up to $605 million for the four quarters commencing in the third quarter 2017 and ending in the second quarter 2018. In the first quarter 2018, the Corporation's repurchases under the equity repurchase program totaled $149 million. The Corporation expects to repurchase the remaining $169 million available under the plan during the second quarter of 2018. The 2018 capital plan was submitted to the FRB for review in April 2018 and a response is expected in June 2018.In April 2018, the FRB issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (“NPR”) that would integrate the FRB’s regulatory capital rule and CCAR stress tests rules. Under the proposal, the FRB's supervisory stress test would be used to establish the size of a stress capital buffer (“SCB”) requirement. The SCB would take the place of the current static 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer. The SCB would be equivalent to the difference between the Corporation’s starting and lowest projected CET1 ratio under the severely adverse scenario of the supervisory stress test plus the capital impact of the Corporation’s planned common stock dividends for four quarters and with a floor of 2.5%. The NPR also includes some adjustments to the assumptions and methodologies used in the stress tests. The impact of this rule will depend on the final rulemaking and interpretations.Additionally, in November 2017, U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule that suspended the full transition for certain deductions and adjustments effective January 1, 2018 to remain at current levels and issued a NPR intended to simplify certain aspects of the Basel III regulatory capital framework. The Corporation does not expect the proposed rule to have a significant impact on its capital ratios. On April 24, 2018 the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the Board) approved a 4-cent increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.34 per share, payable on July 1, 2018.The following table summarizes the Corporation's repurchase activity during the three months ended March 31, 2018.(shares in thousands)Total Number of Shares and Warrants Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Repurchase Plans or Programs (a) RemainingRepurchaseAuthorization (b)Total Numberof Shares and WarrantsPurchased (c) Average PricePaid Per ShareJanuary 2018529 9,858 631 $92.58February 2018769 9,033 771 95.82March 2018267 8,714 272 99.25Total first quarter 20181,565 8,714 1,674 $95.16(a)The Corporation made no repurchases of warrants under the repurchase program during the three months ended March 31, 2018.

The allowance for loan losses represents management's assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporation's loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, provides for probable losses inherent in lending-related commitments, including unused commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.The allowance for loan losses was $698 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $712 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $14 million, or 2 percent. As a percentage of total loans, the allowance for loan losses was 1.42 percent at March 31, 2018, compared to 1.45 percent at December 31, 2017. The decrease in the allowance for loan losses reflected improvements in credit quality of the portfolio. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain letters of credit in a manner consistent with business loans, and allowances based on the pool of the remaining letters of credit and all unused commitments to extend credit within each internal risk rating. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $40 million and $42 million at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. For additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses, refer to page F-34 in the "Critical Accounting Policies" section and pages F-50 and F-52 in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation's 2017 Annual Report.Nonperforming AssetsNonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, troubled debt restructured loans (TDRs) which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans) and foreclosed property. TDRs include performing and nonperforming loans. Nonperforming TDRs are either on nonaccrual or reduced-rate status.44Table of ContentsThe following table presents a summary of nonperforming assets and past due loans.(dollar amounts in millions)March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017Nonaccrual loans:   Business loans:   Commercial$242 $309Commercial mortgage29 31Lease financing3 4International4 6Total nonaccrual business loans278 350Retail loans:   Residential mortgage29 31Consumer:   Home equity19 21Total nonaccrual retail loans48 52Total nonaccrual loans326 402Reduced-rate loans8 8Total nonperforming loans334 410Foreclosed property5 5Total nonperforming assets$339 $415Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans0.68% 0.83%Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and foreclosed property0.69 0.84Ratio of allowance for loan losses to total nonperforming loans2.1x 1.7xLoans past due 90 days or more and still accruing$36 $35Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing as a percentage of total loans0.07% 0.07%Nonperforming assets decreased $76 million to $339 million at March 31, 2018, from $415 million at December 31, 2017.

Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $12.4 billion at March 31, 2018, of which $4.7 billion, or 38 percent, were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to real estate developers, an increase of $203 million compared to December 31, 2017. The remaining $7.7 billion, or 62 percent, of commercial real estate loans in other business lines consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages, which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans. The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-tenured customers with satisfactory completion experience. Credit quality in the real estate construction loan portfolio was strong, with criticized loans of $4 million at both March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 and no real estate construction loan charge-offs in both the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line on nonaccrual status totaled $9 million at both March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. In other business lines, $20 million and $22 million of commercial mortgage loans were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. There were no commercial mortgage loan net charge-offs for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 and net recoveries of $1 million for the same period of the prior year.Residential Real Estate LendingThe following table summarizes the Corporation's residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios by geographic market.

The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation's primary geographic markets. Substantially all residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more are placed on nonaccrual status, and substantially all junior lien home equity loans that are current or less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status if full collection of the senior position is in doubt. At no later than 180 days past due, such loans are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell.Residential mortgages totaled $2 billion at March 31, 2018 and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $2 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $29 million were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2018. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.8 billion at March 31, 2018, of which $1.6 billion was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit, $129 million were on amortizing status and $42 million were closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.8 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $19 million were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2018. A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at March 31, 2018. 47Table of ContentsEnergy LendingThe Corporation has a portfolio of Energy loans that are included primarily in commercial loans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Customers in the Corporation's Energy business line (approximately 160 relationships) are engaged in three segments of the oil and gas business: exploration and production (E&P) (76 percent), midstream (16 percent) and energy services (8 percent). E&P generally includes such activities as searching for potential oil and gas fields, drilling exploratory wells and operating active wells. Commitments to E&P borrowers are generally subject to semi-annual borrowing base re-determinations based on a variety of factors including updated pricing (reflecting market and competitive conditions), energy reserve levels and the impact of hedging. The midstream sector is generally involved in the transportation, storage and marketing of crude and/or refined oil and gas products. The Corporation's energy services customers provide products and services primarily to the E&P segment.The following table summarizes information about the Corporation's portfolio of Energy loans.

The Corporation continued to incorporate a qualitative reserve component for Energy loans at March 31, 2018. There were no Energy net credit-related charge-offs for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018 compared to $13 million for the same period in 2017.Automotive LendingSubstantially all dealer loans are in the National Dealer Services business line. Loans in the National Dealer Services business line primarily include floor plan financing and other loans to automotive dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in commercial loans, totaled $4.3 billion at March 31, 2018, a decrease of $57 million compared to $4.4 billion at December 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, including $2 billion and $1.9 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Automotive lending also includes loans to borrowers involved with automotive production, primarily Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers. Loans to borrowers involved with automotive production totaled approximately $1.3 billion at both March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.For further discussion of credit risk, see the "Credit Risk" section of pages F-20 through F-28 in the Corporation's 2017 Annual Report.Market and Liquidity RiskMarket risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse movements in market rates or prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. Liquidity risk represents the failure to meet financial obligations coming due, resulting from an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding, and the inability to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significant changes in pricing, due to inadequate market depth or market disruptions.The Asset and Liability Policy Committee (ALCO) of the Corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities. ALCO meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies, and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit gathering and risk management. The Corporate Treasury department mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of ALCO through the actions it takes to manage the Corporation's market, liquidity and capital positions.Corporate Treasury supports ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing market (e.g., interest rate risk, etc.) and liquidity risks. The Enterprise Risk Division provides various second line risk management functions including oversight and challenge of the first line responsibilities. Key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analysis of the Corporation's balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks; (ii) monitoring and reporting of the Corporation's positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines; (iii) developing and presenting analy48Table of Contentsses and strategies to adjust risk positions; (iv) reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval; (v) monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks; and (vi) developing and monitoring the interest rate risk economic capital estimate.Interest Rate RiskNet interest income is the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities, primarily through the Corporation's core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by core deposits. The Corporation's loan composition at March 31, 2018 was approximately 60 percent 30-day LIBOR, 15 percent 60-day LIBOR, 15 percent Prime and 10 percent fixed rate. This creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the floating-rate loan portfolio, noninterest-bearing deposits and the more slowly repricing deposit products. In addition, the growth and/or contraction in the Corporation's loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing investment securities, primarily fixed-rate, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, and hedging the sensitivity with interest rate swaps. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk, with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.Since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives, a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk. These techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve, utilizing multiple simulation analyses. Simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income, as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors, including, but not limited to, the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, regulatory impacts and management strategies.Sensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest RatesThe analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is management's principal risk management technique. Management models a base case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment. Existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes are included in the analysis, but no additional hedging is currently forecasted. These derivative instruments currently comprise interest rate swaps that convert fixed-rate long-term debt to variable rates. This base case net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which rates rise or decline in a linear, non-parallel fashion from the base case over 12 months. In the scenarios presented, short-term interest rates increase 200 basis points, resulting in an average increase in short-term interest rates of 100 basis points over the period (+200 scenario). Due to the current level of interest rates, the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario drop in short-term interest rates to zero.Each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth, investment security prepayment levels, depositor behavior, yield curve changes, loan and deposit pricing, and overall balance sheet mix and growth. In this rate environment, depositors have maintained a higher level of liquidity and their historical behavior may be less indicative of future trends. As a result, the +200 scenario reflects a greater decrease in deposits than we have experienced historically as rates begin to rise. Changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis.The table below, as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above. Estimated Annual Change March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017(in millions)Amount % Amount %Change in Interest Rates:       Rising 200 basis points$186 8 % $197 9 %Declining to zero percent(313) (13) (283) (13)Sensitivity to rising rates decreased modestly from December 31, 2017 to March 31, 2018, reflecting changes to the Corporation's balance sheet. The risk to declining interest rates is impacted by an assumed floor on interest rates of zero percent. Because deposit costs remain close to the floor while asset yields have risen with market rates, sensitivity to falling rates has increased during the same period.49Table of ContentsSensitivity of Economic Value of Equity to Changes in Interest RatesIn addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income, an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position. The economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the Corporation's financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements. The economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel 200 basis point increase. The declining interest rate scenarios are based on decreases of 175 basis points and 150 basis points in interest rates at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.The table below, as of March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above. March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017(in millions)Amount % Amount %Change in Interest Rates:       Rising 200 basis points$1,198 9 % $1,188 9 %Declining to zero percent(2,781) (20) (2,635) (20)The sensitivity of the economic value of equity to a 200 basis point parallel increase in rates was mostly stable between December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018. The change in sensitivity of the economic value of equity to a parallel decrease in rates to zero during the same period was primarily driven by the increase in short-term rates between the periods, allowing for an additional 25 basis point decrease from December 31, 2017 to the March 31, 2018 scenario.Wholesale FundingThe Corporation may access the purchased funds market when necessary, which includes a variety of funding sources. Capacity for incremental purchased funds at March 31, 2018 included FHLB advances, the ability to purchase federal funds, sell securities under agreements to repurchase, as well as issue deposits through brokers. Purchased funds increased to $63 million at March 31, 2018, compared to $25 million at December 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, the Bank had pledged loans totaling $21.8 billion which provided for up to $17.7 billion of available collateralized borrowing with the FRB.The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Dallas, Texas, which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. At March 31, 2018, $15.8 billion of real estate-related loans were pledged to the FHLB as blanket collateral for current and potential future borrowings. The Corporation had $3.8 billion of outstanding borrowings, including $1 billion borrowed in February 2018, maturing between 2026 and 2028 and capacity for potential future borrowings of approximately $4.4 billion.Additionally, as of March 31, 2018 the Bank had the ability to issue up to $14 billion of debt under an existing $15 billion note program which allows the issuance of debt with maturities between three months and 30 years. The Corporation also maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and/or equity securities.The ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise funds at competitive rates is impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings of the Corporation and the Bank. As of March 31, 2018, the three major rating agencies had assigned the following ratings to long-term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Liquid assets totaled $18.3 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $17.4 billion at December 31, 2017. Liquid assets include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits with banks, other short-term investments and unencumbered investment securities. Under the Basel III liquidity framework, the Corporation is subject to a modified LCR standard, which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of high-quality liquid assets to fully cover modified net cash outflows under a 30-day systematic liquidity stress scenario. The Corporation is in compliance with the fully phased-in LCR requirement, plus a buffer.50Table of ContentsIn 2016, U.S. banking regulators issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (the proposed rule) implementing a second quantitative liquidity requirement in the U.S. generally consistent with the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) minimum liquidity measure established under the Basel III liquidity framework. Under the proposed rule, the Corporation will be subject to a modified NSFR standard, which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of available longer-term, stable sources of funding to fully cover a modified amount of required longer-term stable funding, over a one-year period. However, a final NSFR rule has not been published by the U.S. regulatory agencies so the effective date of compliance remains unknown. The Corporation does not currently expect the proposed rule to have a material impact on its liquidity needs.The Corporation performs monthly liquidity stress testing to evaluate its ability to meet funding needs in hypothetical stressed environments. Such environments cover a series of broad events, distinguished in terms of duration and severity. The evaluation as of March 31, 2018 projected sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe Corporation’s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation's 2017 Annual Report. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation’s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2017, the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to the allowance for credit losses, fair value measurement, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages F-34 through F-37 in the Corporation's 2017 Annual Report. As of the date of this report, there have been no significant changes to the Corporation's critical accounting policies or estimates.SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATAThe following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this financial review with financial measures defined by GAAP.(dollar amounts in millions)March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017Tangible Common Equity Ratio:   Common shareholders' equity$8,000 $7,963Less:   Goodwill635 635Other intangible assets7 8Tangible common equity$7,358 $7,320Total assets$72,335 $71,567Less:   Goodwill635 635Other intangible assets7 8Tangible assets$71,693 $70,924Common equity ratio11.06% 11.13%Tangible common equity ratio10.26 10.32Tangible Common Equity per Share of Common Stock:   Common shareholders' equity$8,000 $7,963Tangible common equity7,358 7,320Shares of common stock outstanding (in millions)172 173Common shareholders' equity per share of common stock$46.38 $46.07Tangible common equity per share of common stock42.66 42.34The tangible common equity ratio removes the effect of intangible assets from capital and total assets. Tangible common equity per share of common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders' equity per share of common stock. The Corporation believes these are meaningful measures because they reflect the adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators, and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of common equity. Tangible common equity is used by the Corporation to measure the quality of capital and the return relative to balance sheet risks.51Table of ContentsITEM 3.
