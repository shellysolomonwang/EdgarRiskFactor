Item 1A. Risk Factors” beginning on page 12 of Comerica's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. The Corporation does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect facts, circumstances, assumptions or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made. For any forward-looking statements made in this report or in any documents, the Corporation claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.38Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSNet income for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was $135 million, a decrease of $16 million from $151 million  reported for the three months ended June 30, 2014. The decrease in net income primarily reflected a $36 million increase in the provision for credit losses and increases in revenue-generating noninterest expenses and technology-related contract labor expense, partially offset by a $33 million decrease in litigation-related expense as well as increases in net interest income and several fee-based noninterest income categories. Net income per diluted common share was $0.73 and $0.80 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Average diluted common shares were 182 million and 186 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was $269 million, a decrease of $21 million from $290 million  reported for the six months ended June 30, 2014. The decrease in net income was largely due to the same reasons as described in the quarterly discussion above. Net income per diluted common share was $1.46 and $1.54 for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Average diluted common shares were 182 million and 186 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.Full-Year 2015 Outlook Compared to Full-Year 2014Management expectations for full-year 2015 compared to full-year 2014, assuming a continuation of the current economic and low-rate environment, are as follows:•Average full-year loan growth consistent with 2014, reflecting seasonal declines in Mortgage Banker Finance and National Dealer Services in the second half of the year, a continued decline in Energy, and a sustained focus on pricing and structure discipline.•Net interest income relatively stable, assuming no rise in interest rates, reflecting a decrease of about $30 million in purchase accounting accretion, to about $6 million, and the impact of a continuing low rate environment on asset yields, offset by earning asset growth.•Provision for credit losses higher, with third and fourth quarter net charge-offs each at levels similar to the second quarter. If energy prices remain low, continued negative migration is possible, which may be offset by lower exposure balances.•Noninterest income relatively stable, excluding the impact of a change in accounting presentation for a card program. Stable noninterest income reflects growth in fee income, particularly card fees and fiduciary income, mostly offset by a decline in warrant income and regulatory impacts on letter of credit and derivative income.•Noninterest expenses higher, excluding the impact of a change in accounting presentation for a card program, with continued focus on driving efficiencies for the long term. Expenses for the second half of 2015 are expected to be higher than the first half, reflecting three more days in the second half, the impact of merit increases, a ramp-up in the second half of technology and regulatory expenses, as well as higher pension, outside processing and occupancy expenses. Technology and regulatory expenses are expected to increase approximately $40 million in total compared to 2014.•Income tax expense to approximate 32 percent of pre-tax income.For information about the change in accounting presentation for a card program, refer to Note 1 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements and under the "Noninterest Income" subheading later in this section of the financial review.39Table of ContentsNet Interest IncomeThe "Quarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent" table that follows provides an analysis of net interest income (FTE) for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 and details the components of the change in net interest income on a FTE basis for the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year.Quarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent (FTE) Three Months Ended June 30, 2015 June 30, 2014(dollar amounts in millions)AverageBalanceInterestAverageRate AverageBalanceInterestAverageRateCommercial loans$31,788$2443.07% $29,890$2313.10%Real estate construction loans1,807163.51 1,913163.44Commercial mortgage loans8,672733.38 8,749853.88Lease financing79563.19 85073.26International loans1,453133.68 1,328123.64Residential mortgage loans1,877183.78 1,773173.82Consumer loans2,441203.25 2,222183.22Total loans (a)48,8333903.20 46,7253863.31        Mortgage-backed securities (b)9,057492.23 8,996532.35Other investment securities87931.16 368—0.46Total investment securities (b)9,936522.13 9,364532.28        Interest-bearing deposits with banks5,11030.25 3,94930.25Other short-term investments102—0.42 110—0.61Total earning assets63,9814452.79 60,1484422.95        Cash and due from banks1,041   921  Allowance for loan losses(613)   (602)  Accrued income and other assets4,554   4,411  Total assets$68,963   $64,878          Money market and interest-bearing checking deposits$23,65960.11 $22,29660.10Savings deposits1,834—0.02 1,742—0.03Customer certificates of deposit4,42240.37 5,04150.36Foreign office time deposits11811.26 294—0.68Total interest-bearing deposits30,033110.14 29,373110.15Short-term borrowings78—0.04 210—0.03Medium- and long-term debt2,661121.83 2,998141.77Total interest-bearing sources32,772230.28 32,581250.30        Noninterest-bearing deposits27,365   24,011  Accrued expenses and other liabilities1,314   955  Total shareholders’ equity7,512   7,331  Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity$68,963   $64,878          Net interest income/rate spread (FTE) $4222.51  $4172.65        FTE adjustment $1   $1         Impact of net noninterest-bearing sources of funds  0.14   0.13Net interest margin (as a percentage of average earning assets) (FTE) (a)  2.65%   2.78%(a)Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio of $2 million and $10 million in the three-month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, increased the net interest margin by 1 basis point and 7 basis points in each respective period.(b)Includes investment securities available-for-sale and investment securities held-to-maturity.40Table of ContentsQuarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent (FTE) (continued) Three Months Ended June 30, 2015/June 30, 2014(in millions)Increase(Decrease)Due to RateIncrease(Decrease)Due to Volume (a)NetIncrease(Decrease)Interest Income (FTE):      Loans$(14) $18 $4 Investment securities (b)(2) 1 (1) Total interest income (FTE)(16) 19 3        Interest Expense:      Medium- and long-term debt— (2) (2) Total interest expense— (2) (2)        Net interest income (FTE)$(16) $21 $5 (a)Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume.(b)Includes investment securities available-for-sale and investment securities held-to-maturity.Net interest income was $421 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015, an increase of $5 million compared to $416 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014. The increase in net interest income resulted primarily from the benefit provided by an increase in average earning assets and a decrease in average medium- and long-term debt, partially offset by the impact of lower yields on loans and investment securities. Average earning assets increased $3.8 billion, or 6 percent, compared to $60.1 billion for the same period in 2014. The increase in average earning assets primarily reflected increases of $2.1 billion in average loans, $1.2 billion in average interest-bearing deposits with banks and $572 million in average investment securities. The net interest margin (FTE) for the three months ended June 30, 2015 decreased 13 basis points to 2.65 percent, from 2.78 percent for the comparable period in 2014, primarily from an increase in balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) as well as lower yields on loans and investment securities. The decrease in loan yields primarily reflected a decrease in accretion on the acquired loan portfolio, shifts in the average loan portfolio mix and the impact of a competitive low-rate environment, partially offset by a benefit from the increase in 30-day LIBOR. Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio increased the net interest margin by 1 basis point for the three months ended June 30, 2015, compared to 7 basis points for the same period in 2014. Average balances deposited with the FRB were $5.0 billion and $3.8 billion in the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are included in "interest bearing deposits with banks" on the consolidated balance sheets.41Table of ContentsYear-to-Date Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent (FTE) Six Months Ended June 30, 2015 June 30, 2014(dollar amounts in millions)AverageBalanceInterestAverageRate AverageBalanceInterestAverageRateCommercial loans$31,442$4783.06% $29,130$4533.13%Real estate construction loans1,872323.43 1,871323.42Commercial mortgage loans8,6271463.41 8,7591703.92Lease financing796123.12 849163.66International loans1,482273.69 1,315243.66Residential mortgage loans1,866353.77 1,749333.84Consumer loans2,409393.23 2,232353.19Total loans (a)48,4947693.19 45,9057633.35        Mortgage-backed securities (b)9,0641002.24 8,9541072.39Other investment securities85851.13 36910.44Total investment securities (b)9,9221052.15 9,3231082.31        Interest-bearing deposits with banks5,21670.25 4,69570.26Other short-term investments100—0.75 110—0.63Total earning assets63,7328812.79 60,0338782.94        Cash and due from banks1,034   917  Allowance for loan losses(607)   (602)  Accrued income and other assets4,693   4,446  Total assets$68,852   $64,794          Money market and interest-bearing checking deposits$23,809130.11 $22,279120.11Savings deposits1,810—0.02 1,721—0.03Customer certificates of deposit4,42380.37 5,07590.36Foreign office and other time deposits12111.36 37810.52Total interest-bearing deposits30,163220.14 29,453220.15Short-term borrowings94—0.05 198—0.03Medium- and long-term debt2,675231.78 3,270281.64Total interest-bearing sources32,932450.28 32,921500.30        Noninterest-bearing deposits27,033   23,626  Accrued expenses and other liabilities1,405   967  Total shareholders’ equity7,482   7,280  Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity$68,852   $64,794          Net interest income/rate spread (FTE) $8362.51  $8282.64        FTE adjustment $2   $2         Impact of net noninterest-bearing sources of funds  0.14   0.14Net interest margin (as a percentage of average earning assets (FTE) (a)  2.65%   2.78%(a)Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio of $4 million and $22 million in the six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, increased the net interest margin by 1 basis point and 7 basis points in each respective period.(b)Includes investment securities available-for-sale and investment securities held-to-maturity.42Table of ContentsYear-to-Date Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent (FTE) (continued) Six Months Ended June 30, 2015/June 30, 2014(in millions)Increase(Decrease)Due to RateIncrease(Decrease)Due to Volume (a)NetIncrease(Decrease)Interest Income (FTE):      Loans$(34) $40 $6 Investment securities (b)(6) 3 (3) Total interest income (FTE)(40) 43 3        Interest Expense:      Interest-bearing deposits2 (2) — Medium- and long-term debt1 (6) (5) Total interest expense3 (8) (5) Net interest income (FTE)$(43) $51 $8 (a)Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume.(b)Includes investment securities available-for-sale and investment securities held-to-maturity.Net interest income was $834 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, an increase of $8 million compared to $826 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014. The increase in net interest income resulted primarily from the benefit provided by an increase in average earning assets and a decrease in average medium- and long-term debt, partially offset by the impact of lower yields on loans and investment securities. Average earning assets increased $3.7 billion, or 6 percent, to $63.7 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2015, compared to $60.0 billion for the same period in 2014. The increase in average earning assets primarily reflected increases of $2.6 billion in average loans, $599 million in average investment securities and $521 million in average interest-bearing deposits with banks. The net interest margin (FTE) for the six months ended June 30, 2015 decreased 13 basis points to 2.65 percent, from 2.78 percent for the comparable period in 2014, largely for the same reasons as discussed previously in the quarterly analysis. The decrease in loan yields reflected a decrease in accretion on the acquired loan portfolio, shifts in the average loan portfolio mix and the impact of a competitive low-rate environment, partially offset by a benefit from the increase in 30-day LIBOR. Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio increased the net interest margin by 1 basis point for the six months ended June 30, 2015, compared to 7 basis points for the same period in 2014. Average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) were 5.1 billion and $4.6 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and are included in "interest bearing deposits with banks" on the consolidated balance sheets.For further discussion of the effects of market rates on net interest income, refer to the "Market and Liquidity Risk" section of this financial review.Provision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses was $47 million and $11 million for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $61 million and $20 million for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The provision for credit losses includes both the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments.The provision for loan losses is recorded to maintain the allowance for loan losses at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio. The provision for loan losses was $35 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015, compared to $6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014. The increase in the provision primarily reflected the impact of loan growth and increased reserves for energy and energy-related loans, as a result of an increase in criticized loans and the impact of continued volatility and sustained lower energy prices. In addition, Corporate Banking and, to a lesser extent, Technology and Life Sciences contributed to the increase in the provision, largely as a result of charge-offs and variability. These increases were partially offset by improvements in credit quality in the remainder of the portfolio. The provision for loan losses was $51 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, an increase of $37 million compared to $14 million for the same period in the prior year, largely for the same reasons as the quarterly increase discussed above, with the exception of Technology and Life Sciences, which did not contribute to the year-to-date provision increase. Net loan charge-offs in the three months ended June 30, 2015 increased $9 million to $18 million, or 0.15 percent of average total loans, compared to $9 million, or 0.08 percent, for the three months ended June 30, 2014. The increase in net loan charge-offs in the three months ended June 30, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, primarily reflected increases in Corporate Banking and Technology and Life Sciences, partially offset by a decrease in Commercial Real Estate.Net loan charge-offs in the six months ended June 30, 2015 increased $5 million to $26 million, or 0.11 percent of average total loans, compared to $21 million, or 0.09 percent, for the six months ended June 30, 2014. The increase in net loan charge-offs 43Table of Contentsin the six months ended June 30, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, primarily reflected increases in general Middle Market and Corporate Banking, partially offset by decreases in most other business lines, with the largest decreases in Commercial Real Estate as well as Technology and Life Sciences.The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments is recorded to maintain the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $12 million in the three months ended June 30, 2015, compared to $5 million in the three months ended June 30, 2014, and $10 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $6 million for the same period in 2014. The $7 million increase in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments in the three months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, as well as the $4 million increase in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments in the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, primarily reflected additional reserves for energy and energy-related commitments. Lending-related commitment charge-offs were $1 million for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 and insignificant for the same periods in 2014.An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets is presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.Noninterest Income Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,(in millions)2015 2014 2015 2014Service charges on deposit accounts$56 $54 $111 $108Fiduciary income48 45 95 89Commercial lending fees22 23 47 43Card fees (a)72 22 139 45Letter of credit fees13 15 26 29Bank-owned life insurance10 11 19 20Foreign exchange income9 12 19 21Brokerage fees5 4 9 9Net securities (losses) gains — — (2) 1Other noninterest income (b)26 34 53 63Total noninterest income$261 $220 $516 $428(a)Effective January 1, 2015, contractual changes to a card program resulted in a change to the accounting presentation of the related revenues and expenses. The effect of this change was increases of $44 million and $88 million to card fees in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015, respectively.(b)The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income.Noninterest income was $261 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015, an increase of $41 million compared to $220 million for the same period in 2014. Excluding the $44 million impact of the change in accounting presentation on card fees as described in footnote (a) to the above table, noninterest income decreased $3 million, primarily reflecting increases in card fees, fiduciary income and service charges on deposit accounts, which were more than offset by declines in foreign exchange income and several non-fee categories. Card fees increased $6 million, primarily driven by a change to the Corporation's strategy for providing merchant payment processing services. The Corporation concluded its participation in a joint venture that provided merchant payment processing services in the second quarter 2015. Income from the joint venture was recorded in other noninterest income using the equity method. The Corporation now directly enters into agreements with its merchants and uses a third party to process the transactions. Pursuant to the agreements with the merchants and the arrangement with the third-party vendor, merchant payment processing income is recognized in card fees, and related processing expense is recognized in outside processing fees in noninterest expenses. For further discussion about the impact of using a third party to process merchant transactions on outside processing fees, refer to the "Noninterest Expenses" subheading below. Fiduciary income increased $3 million and service charges on deposit accounts increased $2 million. These increases were more than offset by decreases of $3 million each in foreign exchange income and income from principal investing and warrants, along with small decreases in several other non-fee categories.Noninterest income was $516 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, an increase of $88 million compared to $428 million for the same period in 2014. Excluding the $88 million impact of the above-described accounting presentation change, noninterest income was unchanged. Within noninterest income, fiduciary income and card fees each increased $6 million, commercial lending fees increased $4 million and service charges on deposit accounts increased $3 million. Offsetting the increases in noninterest income were decreases of $5 million in income from principal investing and warrants, $3 million each in net securities gains and letter of credit fee income, and $2 million in foreign exchange income, as well as small decreases in several other non-fee categories. 44Table of ContentsThe following table illustrates certain categories included in "other noninterest income" on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

The effect of this change was increases of $44 million and $88 million to outside processing fee expense in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015, respectively.Noninterest expenses were $436 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015, an increase of $32 million compared to $404 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014. Excluding the $44 million impact of the change in accounting presentation on outside processing fees as described in footnote (a) to the above table, noninterest expenses decreased $12 million in the three months ended June 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, largely reflecting a $33 million reduction in litigation-related expenses, partially offset by higher outside processing expenses related to revenue generating activities and an increase in salaries and benefits expense. See to Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for information related to litigation expense. Salaries and benefits expense increased $11 million, primarily reflecting an increase in technology-related contract labor expense and the impact of merit increases. Excluding the impact of the accounting presentation change described above, outside processing fee expense increased $11 million, largely due to third-party processing expenses associated with merchant payment processing services, as discussed under the "Noninterest Income" subheading above, including up-front costs incurred for converting customers to the new vendor providing the services, as well as smaller increases in other outside processing expenses related to revenue-generating activities.Noninterest expenses were $895 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, an increase of $85 million compared to $810 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014. Excluding the $88 million impact of the above-described accounting presentation change, noninterest expenses decreased $3 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, for substantially the same reasons as described in the quarterly discussion above. STRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESSThe Corporation's management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. These methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines. Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report describes the Corporation's segment reporting methodology.45Table of ContentsIn the second quarter 2014, the Corporation enhanced the approach used to determine the standard reserve factors used in estimating the allowance for credit losses, which had the effect of capturing certain elements in the standard reserve component that had formerly been included in the qualitative assessment. The impact of the change was largely neutral to the total allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2014. However, because standard reserves are allocated to the segments at the loan level, while qualitative reserves are allocated at the portfolio level, the impact of the methodology change on the allowance of each segment reflected the characteristics of the individual loans within each segment's portfolio, causing segment reserves to increase or decrease accordingly. As a result, the current year provision for credit losses within each segment is not comparable to prior year amounts.Business SegmentsThe Corporation's operations are strategically aligned into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based upon the products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, Finance is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes items not directly associated with these business segments or the Finance segment. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of these business segments for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014.The following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.  Six Months Ended June 30,(dollar amounts in millions)2015 2014Business Bank$371 83% $395 84%Retail Bank35 8 26 6Wealth Management42 9 49 10 448 100% 470 100%Finance(179)   (183)  Other (a)—   3  Total$269   $290  (a) Includes items not directly associated with the three major business segments or the Finance Division.The Business Bank's net income of $371 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 decreased $24 million compared to the six months ended June 30, 2014. Net interest income (FTE) of $744 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was unchanged compared to the same period in the prior year, as the benefit from a $2.3 billion increase in average loans and the funds transfer pricing (FTP) benefit provided by a $3.0 billion increase in average deposits were offset by a decrease in accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio, lower loan yields and a lower FTP crediting rate.The provision for credit losses increased $34 million to $86 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in the provision primarily reflected the impact of loan growth and increased reserves for loans related to energy, as a result of an increase in criticized loans and the impact of continued volatility and sustained lower energy prices. In addition, Corporate Banking contributed to the increase in the provision. These increases were partially offset by improvements in credit quality in Commercial Real Estate. Net loan charge-offs of $31 million increased $11 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting increases in general Middle Market and Corporate Banking, partially offset by decreases in Commercial Real Estate and Technology and Life Sciences. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting presentation for a card program, noninterest income for the six months ended June 30, 2015 increased $3 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting increases of $5 million each in card fees and commercial lending fees, partially offset by a $4 million decrease in warrant income. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting presentation for a card program, noninterest expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2015 decreased $1 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease primarily reflected a $31 million decrease in litigation-related expense, mostly offset by a $15 million increase in corporate overhead; a $10 million increase in outside processing expenses, largely due to the third-party processing expenses associated with merchant payment processing services resulting from a change to the Corporation's strategy for providing merchant services; and a $5 million increase in salaries and benefits expense, primarily reflecting the impact of merit increases.Net income for the Retail Bank of $35 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 increased $9 million, compared to $26 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014. Net interest income (FTE) of $307 million increased $6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2015, primarily due to the benefit provided by a $177 million increase in average loans, the FTP benefit provided by an $818 million increase in average deposits and lower deposit rates, partially offset by a lower FTP crediting rate and a decrease in accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio. The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $16 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, a decrease of $11 million from the comparable period in the prior year, 46Table of Contentsreflecting decreases in the consumer loan portfolio and Small Business. Net loan charge-offs were $2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to $6 million in the same period for the prior year. Noninterest income of $88 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 increased $6 million compared to the comparable period in the prior year, due to small increases in several fee categories. Noninterest expenses of $357 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 increased $9 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase of $4 million in salaries and benefits expense, primarily reflecting the impact of merit increases, and an increase of $5 million in outside processing expenses related to revenue-generating activities.Wealth Management's net income of $42 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 decreased $7 million, compared to $49 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014. Net interest income (FTE) of $88 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 decreased $1 million compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting a decrease in net FTP credits and lower loan yields, partially offset by the benefit from a $111 million increase in average loans and the FTP benefit provided by a $429 million increase in average deposits. The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $10 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, compared to a benefit of $18 million for the same period in the prior year. Net loan recoveries were $7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, compared to net recoveries of $5 million for the comparable prior year period. Noninterest income of $118 million decreased $4 million, primarily reflecting a $3 million decrease from securities losses of $2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 compared to a $1 million gain for the same period in 2014. Noninterest expenses of $151 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 decreased $1 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a $4 million decrease in litigation-related expenses, partially offset by small increases in several noninterest expense categories.The net loss in the Finance segment was $179 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, compared to a net loss of $183 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014. Net interest expense (FTE) of $308 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015 decreased $10 million, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2014, primarily reflecting a decrease in net FTP expense as a result of lower rates paid to the business segments under the Corporation's internal FTP methodology.Market SegmentsMarket segment results are provided for the Corporation's three largest geographic markets: Michigan, California and Texas.

These stress tests are a normal part of the Corporation's overall risk management and capital planning process and are part of the forecasting process used by the Corporation to conduct the enterprise-wide stress test that was part of the Federal Reserve's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). For additional information about risk management processes, refer to the "Risk Management" sections of this financial review and the Corporations 2014 Annual Report.50Table of ContentsThe Federal Reserve completed its 2015 CCAR review in March 2015 and did not object to the Corporation's capital plan and capital distributions contemplated in the plan. The plan provides for up to $393 million in equity repurchases for the five-quarter period ending June 30, 2016. In the second quarter 2015, the Corporation's equity repurchases totaled $59 million, including $49 million of share repurchases and $10 million of warrant repurchases. The pace of equity repurchases is expected to be in line with the Corporation's performance and a rise in interest rates.

Shares withheld in connection with the exercise of warrants are not included in the total number of shares or warrants purchased in the above table. Upon exercise of a warrant, the number of shares with a value equal to the aggregate exercise price is withheld from an exercising warrant holder as payment (known as a "net exercise provision"). During the six months ended June 30, 2015, the Corporation withheld the equivalent of approximately 1,261,000 shares to cover an aggregate of $64.8 million in exercise price and issued approximately 934,000 shares to the exercising warrant holders. (d)Includes April 28, 2015 equity repurchase authorization for up to an additional 10.6 million shares and share-equivalents.On April 28, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the Board) approved a 1-cent increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.21 per share. The Board also authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 10.0 million shares of Comerica Incorporated outstanding common stock, in addition to the 2.1 million shares remaining at March 31, 2015 under the Board's prior authorizations for the share repurchase program initially approved in November 2010. Including the April 28, 2015 authorization, a total of 40.3 million shares has been authorized for repurchase under the share repurchase program since its inception in 2010. On April 28, 2015, the Board also authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 2.6 million warrants, in addition to the 10.6 million warrants remaining at March 31, 2015 under an authorization initially approved in November 2010. There is no expiration date for the Corporation's equity repurchase program.In July 2013, U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule for the U.S. adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework (Basel III). Basel III includes a more stringent definition of capital and introduces a new common equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital requirement; sets forth two comprehensive methodologies for calculating risk-weighted assets (RWA), a standardized approach and an advanced approach; introduces two new capital buffers, a conservation buffer and a countercyclical buffer (applicable to advanced approaches entities); establishes a new supplemental leverage ratio (applicable to advanced approaches entities); and sets out minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards. As a banking organization subject to the standardized approach, Basel III became effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2015. Certain deductions and adjustments to regulatory capital phase in starting January 1, 2015 and will be fully implemented on January 1, 2018. The capital conservation buffer phases in beginning January 1, 2016 and will be fully implemented on January 1, 2019.Under Basel III, CET1 capital predominantly includes common shareholders’ equity, less certain deductions for goodwill, intangible assets and deferred tax assets that arise from net operating losses and tax credit carry-forwards. Additionally, the Corporation has elected to permanently exclude capital in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) related to debt and equity securities classified as available-for-sale as well as for defined benefit postretirement plans from CET1, an option available to standardized approach entities under Basel III. Tier 1 capital incrementally includes noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital includes Tier 1 capital as well as subordinated debt qualifying as Tier 2 and qualifying allowance for credit losses. Certain deductions and adjustments to CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital are subject to phase-in through December 31, 2017. Comerica computes RWA using the standardized approach. Under the standardized approach, RWA is generally based on supervisory risk-weightings which vary by counterparty type and asset class. Under the Basel III standardized approach, capital is required for credit risk RWA, to cover the risk of unexpected losses due to failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its 51Table of Contentsfinancial obligations in accordance with contractual terms; and if trading assets and liabilities exceed certain thresholds, capital is also required for market risk RWA, to cover the risk of losses due to adverse market movements or from position-specific factors.The following table presents the minimum ratios required to be considered "adequately capitalized" as of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014.

The allowance for loan losses represents management's assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporation's loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in "accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets, provides for probable losses inherent in lending-related commitments, including unused commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.While U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was relatively flat in the first quarter of 2015, it has shown some positive trends in the second quarter of 2015. Job growth and employment figures continue to slowly improve while manufacturing output is higher and inflation remains low. The Federal Reserve continues to set expectations for a near-term movement towards interest rate increases and monetary policy normalization. At the same time, lower energy prices have persisted and geopolitical tensions remain.While the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio remained strong in the second quarter of 2015, reserves increased, primarily reflecting an increase in criticized energy and energy-related exposure, as well as uncertainty due to continued volatility and the impact of sustained lower oil and gas prices.The allowance for loan losses was $618 million at June 30, 2015, compared to $594 million at December 31, 2014, an increase of $24 million, or 4 percent. The increase in the allowance primarily reflected increased reserves for loans related to energy and, to a lesser extent, Technology and Life Sciences, partially offset by credit quality improvements in the remainder of the portfolio.Energy and energy-related loans at June 30, 2015 included approximately $3.3 billion of outstanding loans in the Energy business line as well as approximately $725 million of loans in other lines of business to companies that have a sizable portion of 52Table of Contentstheir revenue related to energy or could be otherwise disproportionately negatively impacted by prolonged lower oil and gas prices ("energy-related"). The Corporation generally reviews commitments to energy exploration and production (EP) customers semi-annually, in conjunction with scheduled borrowing base re-determinations. Internal risk ratings for all loans are reviewed at least annually, or more frequently upon the occurrence of a circumstance that affects the credit risk of the loan. During the six months ended June 30, 2015, approximately 85 percent of the internal risk ratings for borrowers in the Energy business line were reviewed, including approximately 95 percent of EP customers, 70 percent of energy services customers and 55 percent of midstream customers. The reviews resulted in some internal risk rating downgrades, which were incorporated into the quantitative component of the allowance. More than 90 percent of the loans in the Energy business line are Shared National Credits (SNC), and the above results include the results of the SNC exam completed in the second quarter 2015. In addition, the Corporation continued to incorporate a qualitative reserve component for energy and energy-related loans due to the uncertainty associated with continued volatility and the impact of sustained lower oil and gas prices. Refer to the "Energy Lending" subheading later in this section for further discussion of the Corporation's portfolio of energy and energy-related loans.The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain letters of credit in a manner consistent with business loans, and allowances based on the pool of the remaining letters of credit and all unused commitments to extend credit within each internal risk rating.The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $50 million at June 30, 2015 compared to $41 million at December 31, 2014. The $9 million increase in the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments primarily reflected the impact of downgrades of energy and energy-related unfunded commitments and issued letters of credit.For additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses, refer to page F-37 in the "Critical Accounting Policies" section and pages F-54 through F-55 in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report.Nonperforming AssetsNonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, troubled debt restructured loans (TDRs) which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans) and foreclosed property. TDRs include performing and nonperforming loans. Nonperforming TDRs are either on nonaccrual or reduced-rate status. Nonperforming assets do not include purchased credit impaired (PCI) loans.53Table of ContentsThe following table presents a summary of nonperforming assets and past due loans.(dollar amounts in millions)June 30, 2015 December 31, 2014Nonaccrual loans:   Business loans:   Commercial$186 $109Real estate construction1 2Commercial mortgage77 95Lease financing11 —International9 —Total nonaccrual business loans284 206Retail loans:   Residential mortgage35 36Consumer:   Home equity29 30Other consumer1 1Total consumer30 31Total nonaccrual retail loans65 67Total nonaccrual loans349 273Reduced-rate loans12 17Total nonperforming loans361 290Foreclosed property9 10Total nonperforming assets$370 $300Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans0.72% 0.60%Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and foreclosed property0.74 0.62Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total nonperforming loans171 205Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing$18 $5Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing as a percentage of total loans0.04% 0.01%Nonperforming assets increased $70 million to $370 million at June 30, 2015, from $300 million at December 31, 2014.

Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $10.5 billion at June 30, 2015, of which $3.4 billion, or 33 percent, were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to real estate developers. The remaining $7.1 billion, or 67 percent, of commercial real estate loans in other business lines consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages, which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans. In the Texas market, commercial real estate loans totaled $2.5 billion at June 30, 2015, of which $1.3 billion were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line. The remaining $1.2 billion consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages. Loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line secured by properties located in Texas totaled $957 million at June 30, 2015, primarily including $525 million for multifamily properties, $130 million for retail properties and $101 million for commercial properties. The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-time customers with satisfactory completion experience. Credit quality in the real estate construction loan portfolio was strong, with $1 million on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2015 compared to $2 million at December 31, 2014 and no real estate construction loan charge-offs in either of the six-month periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014.Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Of the $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion of commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line outstanding at June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, $18 million and $22 million were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Commercial mortgage loan net recoveries in the Commercial Real Estate business line were $3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, compared to net charge-offs of $5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014. In other business lines, $59 million and $73 million of commercial mortgage loans were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. Commercial mortgage loan net recoveries in other business lines were $3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015, compared to net charge-offs of $2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014.Residential Real Estate LendingThe following table summarizes the Corporation's residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios by geographic market.

Residential mortgages totaled $1.9 billion at June 30, 2015, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.9 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $35 million were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2015. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.7 billion at June 30, 2015, of which $1.6 billion was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit and $66 million were closed-end 57Table of Contentshome equity loans. Of the $1.7 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $29 million were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2015. A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at June 30, 2015. The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation's primary geographic markets. Substantially all residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more are placed on nonaccrual status, and substantially all junior lien home equity loans that are current or less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status if full collection of the senior position is in doubt. At no later than 180 days past due, such loans are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell.Energy Lending The Corporation has a portfolio of energy and energy-related loans that are included primarily in "commercial loans" in the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation's energy lending team has over 30 years of experience, with a focus on larger middle market companies. Loans in the Energy business line (approximately 200 relationships) were $3.3 billion, or approximately 7 percent of total loans, at both June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, and total exposure, including unused commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, was $6.6 billion and $7.1 billion at June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. More than 90 percent of the loans in the Energy business line are Shared National Credits (SNC), reflecting the Corporation's focus on larger middle market companies that have financing needs that generally exceed internal individual borrower credit risk limits. The Corporation seeks to develop full relationships with SNC borrowers. SNCs are facilities greater than $20 million shared by three or more federally supervised institutions. In addition to energy loans in the Energy business line, the Corporation is monitoring a portfolio of approximately 165 relationships with approximately $725 million outstanding and total exposure of about $1.5 billion at June 30, 2015 of energy-related loans to companies primarily in general Middle Market, Corporate Banking, Small Business, and Technology and Life Sciences.The following table summarizes information about the Corporation's portfolio of energy and energy-related loans.June 30, 2015OutstandingsUpdated Risk Rating (a)Inflows to Nonaccrual (b)NonaccrualCriticizedNet Charge-Offs (b)(dollar amounts in millions)       Exploration and production (EP)$2,31670%97%$58$58$341$0.3Midstream4631455——8—Services5301671232399—Total Energy business line3,309100%8481814480.3Energy-related722  19381301.8Total energy and energy-related$4,031  $100$119$578$2.1        As a percentage of total energy and energy-related loans 3%14% (a)Internal risk rating reviewed during the six-month period ended June 30, 2015.(b)During the three-month period ended June 30, 2015.EP generally includes such activities as searching for potential oil and gas fields, drilling exploratory wells and operating active wells. The midstream sector is generally involved in the transportation, storage and marketing of crude and/or refined energy products. The Corporation's energy services customers provide services primarily to the EP sector. As of June 30, 2015, a majority of the Corporation’s EP customers had at least 50 percent of their oil and/or gas production hedged up to the end of 2015. Approximately 95 percent of the amount of loans outstanding in the Energy business line had varying levels and types of collateral at June 30, 2015, including oil and gas reserves and pipelines, equipment, accounts receivable, inventory and other assets, or some combination thereof. Commitments to EP borrowers are generally subject to semi-annual borrowing base re-determinations based on a variety of factors including updated pricing (reflecting market and competitive conditions), energy reserve levels and the impact of hedging. As of the end of June 2015, about 95 percent of semi-annual borrowing base re-determinations for EP borrowers in the Energy line of business were complete, resulting in internal risk rating downgrades for about one-third of those reviewed. The Corporation's allowance methodology carefully considers the various risk elements within its loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2015 appropriately considered the changing dynamics in energy and energy-related loans described above, which has resulted in increases in the qualitative and quantitative reserve components for this portfolio for the past three quarterly periods.Refer to the “Allowance for Credit Losses” subheading earlier in this section for a discussion of changes in the allowance for loan losses as a result of the above-described events.Automotive LendingSubstantially all dealer loans are in the National Dealer Services business line. Loans in the National Dealer Services business line include floor plan financing and other loans to automotive dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in “commercial loans” in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $3.8 billion at June 30, 2015, an increase of $50 million compared to December 31, 58Table of Contents2014. At both June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $2.4 billion, including $1.6 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans. Automotive lending also includes loans to borrowers involved with automotive production, primarily Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers. Loans to borrowers involved with automotive production totaled approximately $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion at June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.International ExposureInternational assets are subject to general risks inherent in the conduct of business in foreign countries, including economic uncertainties and each foreign government's regulations. Risk management practices minimize the risk inherent in international lending arrangements. These practices include structuring bilateral agreements or participating in bank facilities, which secure repayment from sources external to the borrower's country. Accordingly, such international outstandings are excluded from the cross-border risk of that country. The Corporation does not hold any sovereign exposure to Europe. The Corporation's international strategy as it pertains to Europe is to focus on European companies doing business in North America, with an emphasis on the Corporation's primary geographic markets. The following table summarizes cross-border exposure to entities domiciled in European countries.(in millions) June 30, 2015 December 31, 2014European exposure:    Commercial and industrial $263 $211Banks and other financial institutions 24 52Total outstanding 287 263Unfunded commitments and guarantees 335 382Total European exposure (a) $622 $645(a)Primarily United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The Corporation had no exposure to Greece, Portugal or Ireland at June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014.For further discussion of credit risk, see the "Credit Risk" section of pages F-21 through F-29 in the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report.Market and Liquidity RiskMarket risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse movements in market rates or prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and commodity and equity prices. Liquidity risk represents the failure to meet financial obligations coming due resulting from an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding, and the inability to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significant changes in pricing, due to inadequate market depth or market disruptions.The Asset and Liability Policy Committee (ALCO) of the Corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities. ALCO meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies, and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit gathering and risk management. The Treasury Department mitigates market and liquidity risk through the actions it takes to manage the Corporation's market, liquidity and capital positions under the direction of ALCO.Market Risk Analytics, of the Office of Enterprise Risk, supports ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate and liquidity risks and coordinating all other market risks. Key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analysis of the Corporation's balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate, liquidity and all other market risks; (ii) monitoring and reporting of the Corporation's positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines; (iii) developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions; (iv) reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval; (v) monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate, liquidity and all other market risks; and (vi) developing and monitoring the interest rate risk economic capital estimate.Interest Rate RiskNet interest income is the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities, primarily through the Corporation's core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by a combination of core deposits and wholesale borrowings. Approximately 85 percent of the Corporation's loans were floating at June 30, 2015, of which approximately 75 percent were based on LIBOR and 25 percent were based on Prime. This creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the floating-rate loan portfolio and the more slowly repricing deposit products. In addition, growth and/or contraction in the Corporation's loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are 59Table of Contentspurchasing investment securities, primarily fixed-rate, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, and hedging the sensitivity with interest rate swaps. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk, with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.Since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives, a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk. These techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve, utilizing multiple simulation analyses. Simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income, as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors, including, but not limited to, the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, regulatory impacts and management strategies.Sensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest RatesThe analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is management's principal risk management technique. Management models a base case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment and what is believed to be the most likely balance sheet structure. Existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes are included in the analysis, but no additional hedging is currently forecasted. These derivative instruments currently comprise interest rate swaps that convert fixed-rate long-term debt to variable rates. This base case net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which rates rise or decline in a linear, non-parallel fashion from the base case over 12 months. In the scenarios presented, short-term interest rates increase 200 basis points, resulting in an average increase in short-term interest rates of 100 basis points over the period (+200 scenario). Due to the current low level of interest rates, the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of a 25 basis point drop in short-term interest rates, to zero percent.Each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth, investment security prepayment levels, depositor behavior, yield curve changes, loan and deposit pricing, and overall balance sheet mix and growth. In the +200 scenario, assumptions related to loan growth are based on historical experience. Because deposit balances have continued to grow significantly in this persistent low rate environment, historical depositor behavior may be less indicative of future trends. As a result, the June 30, 2015 +200 scenario now reflects a greater decrease in deposits than we have experienced historically as rates begin to rise. Investment securities modeling includes the replacement of prepayments as well as an estimate of projected growth in High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) needed for compliance with the LCR, and expected funding maturities are included. In addition, the model reflects deposit pricing based on historical price movements with short-term interest rates, and loan spreads are held at current levels. Changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis.The table below, as of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above. Estimated Annual Change June 30, 2015 December 31, 2014(in millions)Amount % Amount %Change in Interest Rates:       +200 basis points$222 13 % $224 13 %-25 basis points (to zero percent)(37) (2) (32) (2)Sensitivity decreased slightly from December 31, 2014 to June 30, 2015 primarily due to changes in the current balance sheet mix driving a revised forecast, offset by the impact from the addition of HQLA for the LCR and the modeled reduction in deposit growth in the +200 scenario discussed above. The risk to declining interest rates is limited as a result of the inability of the current low level of rates to fall significantly.60Table of ContentsThe table below, as of June 30, 2015, illustrates the estimated sensitivity of the above results to a change in deposit balance assumptions in the +200 scenario, with all other assumptions held constant. In this analysis, average noninterest-bearing deposit run-off in the 12-month period has been increased by $1 billion and $3 billion from the historical run-off experience included in the standard +200 scenario presented above and assumes the deposit run-off reduces excess reserves and increases purchased funds. The analysis is provided as an indicator of the sensitivity of net interest income to the modeled deposit run-off assumption. It is not meant to reflect management's expectation or best estimate. Actual deposit levels may vary from those reflected.  +200 Basis Points(in millions)Estimated Annual ChangeJune 30, 2015Amount %Incremental Average Decrease in Noninterest-bearing Deposit Balances:   $1 billion$211 13%$3 billion188 11Sensitivity of Economic Value of Equity to Changes in Interest RatesIn addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income, an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position. The economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the Corporation's financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements. The economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel 200 basis point increase and 25 basis point decrease in interest rates.The table below, as of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above.

Capacity for incremental purchased funds at June 30, 2015 included the ability to purchase federal funds, sell securities under agreements to repurchase, as well as issue deposits to institutional investors and issue certificates of deposit through brokers. Purchased funds totaled $155 million at June 30, 2015, compared to $251 million at December 31, 2014. At June 30, 2015, the Bank had pledged loans totaling $26 billion which provided for up to $20 billion of available collateralized borrowing with the FRB.The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Dallas, Texas, which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. At June 30, 2015, real estate-related loans pledged to the FHLB as blanket collateral provided for potential future borrowings of approximately $6 billion. As of June 30, 2015, the Corporation did not have any outstanding borrowings from the FHLB. Additionally, as of June 30, 2015 the Bank had the ability to issue up to $14.5 billion of debt under an existing $15 billion note program which allows the issuance of debt with maturities between three months and 30 years.The Corporation also maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and/or equity securities. 61Table of ContentsThe ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise funds at competitive rates is impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings of the Corporation and the Bank. As of June 30, 2015, the four major rating agencies had assigned the following ratings to long-term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

While the outlook for both Comerica Incorporated and Comerica Bank continue to be "Stable", Moody’s released a preliminary indication of an “A3” rating for Comerica Bank long-term senior unsecured debt.The Corporation satisfies liquidity requirements with either liquid assets or various funding sources. Liquid assets, which totaled $13.5 billion at June 30, 2015, compared to $13.3 billion at December 31, 2014, provide a reservoir of liquidity. Liquid assets include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits with banks, other short-term investments and unencumbered investment securities. At June 30, 2015, the Corporation held deposits at the FRB of $4.6 billion, compared to $4.9 billion at December 31, 2014.In September 2014, U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule implementing a quantitative liquidity requirement in the U.S. generally consistent with the LCR minimum liquidity measure established under the Basel III liquidity framework. Under the rule, the Corporation is subject to a modified LCR standard, which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of HQLA to fully cover modified net cash outflows under a 30-day systematic liquidity stress scenario. The rule is effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2016. During the transition year, 2016, the Corporation will be required to maintain a minimum LCR of 90 percent. Beginning January 1, 2017, and thereafter, the minimum required LCR will be 100 percent. In the second quarter 2015, the Bank issued $500 million of senior debt maturing in 2020 and swapped it to floating at six-month LIBOR plus 75 basis points. Of the proceeds, $200 million was invested in five-year Treasury notes. To reach full compliance with the LCR rule and provide a buffer for normal volatility in balance sheet dynamics, the Corporation expects to add up to $3 billion of additional HQLA over the next 18 months, which may be funded with additional wholesale funds in manageable increments, tapping a variety of sources. On July 22, 2015, the Bank issued $350 million of 4.00% subordinated notes, swapped to floating at 6-month LIBOR plus 1.478%, due July 27, 2025 and $175 million of 2.50% senior notes, swapped to floating at 6-month LIBOR plus 0.6348%, due June 2, 2020. The proceeds of both issuances will assist the Corporation in meeting its LCR target.The Basel III liquidity framework includes a second minimum liquidity measure, the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), which requires the amount of available longer-term, stable sources of funding to be at least 100 percent of the required amount of longer-term stable funding over a one-year period. On October 31, 2014, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued its final NSFR rule, which was originally introduced in 2010 and revised in January 2014. U.S. banking regulators have announced that they expect to issue proposed rules to implement the NSFR in advance of its scheduled global implementation in 2018. While uncertainty exists in the final form and timing of the U.S. rule implementing the NSFR and whether or not the Corporation will be subject to the full requirements, the Corporation is closely monitoring the development of the rule.The Corporation regularly evaluates its ability to meet funding needs in unanticipated, stressed environments. In conjunction with the quarterly 200 basis point interest rate simulation analyses, discussed in the “Interest Rate Sensitivity” section of this financial review, liquidity ratios and potential funding availability are examined. Each quarter, the Corporation also evaluates its ability to meet liquidity needs under a series of broad events, distinguished in terms of duration and severity. The evaluation as of June 30, 2015 projected that sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe Corporation’s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation’s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2014, the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to the allowance for credit losses, valuation methodologies, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors and are discussed more 62Table of Contentsfully on pages F-37 through F-40 in the Corporation's 2014 Annual Report. As of the date of this report, there have been no significant changes to the Corporation's critical accounting policies or estimates.63Table of ContentsSUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATAThe following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this financial review with financial measures defined by GAAP.(dollar amounts in millions)June 30, 2015 December 31, 2014Tier 1 Common Capital Ratio:   Tier 1 and Tier 1 common capital (a)n/a $7,169Risk-weighted assets (a)n/a 68,269Tier 1 and Tier 1 common risk-based capital ration/a 10.50%Tangible Common Equity Ratio:   Common shareholders' equity$7,523 $7,402Less:   Goodwill635 635Other intangible assets15 15Tangible common equity$6,873 $6,752Total assets$69,945 $69,186Less:   Goodwill635 635Other intangible assets15 15Tangible assets$69,295 $68,536Common equity ratio10.76% 10.70%Tangible common equity ratio9.92 9.85Tangible Common Equity per Share of Common Stock:   Common shareholders' equity$7,523 $7,402Tangible common equity6,873 6,752Shares of common stock outstanding (in millions)178 179Common shareholders' equity per share of common stock$42.18 $41.35Tangible common equity per share of common stock38.53 37.72(a)Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as defined by Basel I risk-based capital rules.n/a - not applicable.The Tier 1 common capital ratio removes preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital as defined by and calculated in conformity with Basel I risk-based capital rules in effect through December 31, 2014. Effective January 1, 2015, regulatory capital components and risk-weighted assets are defined by and calculated in conformity with Basel III risk-based capital rules. The tangible common equity ratio removes preferred stock and the effect of intangible assets from capital and the effect of intangible assets from total assets and tangible common equity per share of common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders' equity per share of common stock. The Corporation believes these measurements are meaningful measures of capital adequacy used by investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and to compare against other companies in the industry.64Table of ContentsITEM 3.
