The Corporation does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect facts, circumstances, assumptions or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made. For any forward-looking statements made in this report or in any documents, the Corporation claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.37Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSNet income for the three months ended September 30, 2014 was $154 million, an increase of $7 million from $147 million  reported for the three months ended September 30, 2013. This increase was primarily the result of a $20 million decrease in noninterest expenses, a $2 million increase in net interest income and a $3 million decrease in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a $13 million decrease in noninterest income. Net income per diluted common share was $0.82 for the three months ended September 30, 2014, compared to $0.78 for the same period one year ago. Third quarter results reflected a net benefit of $5 million, after tax, or $0.03 per share, from certain actions including a $32 million gain on the early redemption of debt, a $9 million contribution to the Comerica Charitable Foundation and other charges totaling $15 million intended to assist in partially offsetting headwinds from rising regulatory and technology demands. Average diluted common shares were 185 million and 187 million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 was $444 million, an increase of $20 million from $424 million reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2013. The increase in net income was primarily the result of decreases of $42 million in noninterest expenses and $12 million in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by decreases of $20 million in noninterest income and $2 million in net interest income. Net income per diluted common share was $2.35 for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, compared to $2.23 for the same period one year ago. Average diluted common shares were 186 million and 187 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.Full-Year and Fourth Quarter 2014 OutlookManagement expectations for full-year 2014 compared to full-year 2013 have not changed from the previously provided outlook, with the exception of the following:•Average loans - previous outlook was for growth in average loans of 4 percent to 6 percent and now growth is expected to be in the middle of the range, or about 5 percent.•Net interest income - previous outlook for purchase accounting accretion was $25 million to $30 million and now accretion is expected to be at the upper end of the range, or about $30 million.For fourth quarter 2014 compared to third quarter 2014, management expects the following, assuming a continuation of the current economic and low-rate environment:•Slight growth in average loans, reflecting a seasonal decline in Mortgage Banker Finance, a seasonal increase in National Dealer Services, and slight growth in our remaining business lines similar to the third quarter, with continued focus on pricing and structure discipline.•Slight growth in net interest income, reflecting fourth quarter purchase accounting accretion of about $5 million. Loan growth approximately offsets continued pressure from low rate environment.•Provision for credit losses to remain low, similar to the provisions in the first half of 2014.•Noninterest income relatively stable, with stable customer-driven income and lower noncustomer-driven income.•Noninterest expenses higher, reflecting higher technology and consulting expenses, a seasonal increase in benefits expense and certain fourth quarter actions expected to result in additional charges of about $5 million to $7 million. Third quarter included a net benefit of $8 million from actions taken.The Corporation early adopted an amendment to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles in the first quarter 2014 related to the accounting for affordable housing projects that qualify for the low-income housing tax credit. Amortization of the initial investment cost of qualifying projects is now recorded in the provision for income taxes together with the tax credits and benefits received. Previously, the amortization was recorded as a reduction to other noninterest income. All prior period amounts in this financial review have been restated to reflect the adoption of the amendment, which resulted in offsetting increases to other noninterest income and the provision for income taxes of $14 million and $41 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, respectively ($56 million for full-year 2013). The adoption had no impact on net income for any period presented.38Table of ContentsNet Interest IncomeThe "Quarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent" table that follows provides an analysis of net interest income (FTE) for the three months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 and details the components of the change in net interest income on a FTE basis for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year.Quarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent (FTE) Three Months Ended September 30, 2014 September 30, 2013(dollar amounts in millions)AverageBalanceInterestAverageRate AverageBalanceInterestAverageRateCommercial loans$30,188$2363.11% $27,759$2263.25%Real estate construction loans1,973173.41 1,522153.78Commercial mortgage loans8,698763.45 8,943883.90Lease financing82342.33 83973.21International loans1,417133.59 1,252123.76Residential mortgage loans1,792173.76 1,642173.98Consumer loans2,268193.24 2,137173.27Total loans (a)47,1593823.22 44,0943823.44        Mortgage-backed securities available-for-sale9,020522.29 8,989542.41Other investment securities available-for-sale368—0.43 391—0.43Total investment securities available-for-sale9,388522.22 9,380542.32        Interest-bearing deposits with banks (b)5,01530.25 5,30840.26Other short-term investments110—0.54 110—0.77Total earning assets61,6724372.82 58,8924402.97        Cash and due from banks963   1,027  Allowance for loan losses(601)   (622)  Accrued income and other assets4,367   4,360  Total assets$66,401   $63,657          Money market and interest-bearing checking deposits$23,14660.11 $21,89470.13Savings deposits1,759—0.03 1,680—0.04Customer certificates of deposit4,82440.36 5,38460.41Foreign office time deposits15911.43 528—0.48Total interest-bearing deposits29,888110.15 29,486130.18Short-term borrowings231—0.03 249—0.06Medium- and long-term debt2,652111.75 3,590141.54Total interest-bearing sources32,771220.28 33,325270.32        Noninterest-bearing deposits25,275   22,379  Accrued expenses and other liabilities944   1,033  Total shareholders’ equity7,411   6,920  Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity$66,401   $63,657          Net interest income/rate spread (FTE) $4152.54  $4132.65        FTE adjustment $1   $1         Impact of net noninterest-bearing sources of funds  0.13   0.14Net interest margin (as a percentage of average earning assets) (FTE) (a) (b)  2.67%   2.79%(a)Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio of $3 million and $8 million in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, increased the net interest margin by 2 basis points and 5 basis points in each respective period.(b)Average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank reduced the net interest margin by 21 basis points and 24 basis points in the three months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.39Table of ContentsQuarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent (FTE) (continued) Three Months Ended September 30, 2014/September 30, 2013(in millions)Increase(Decrease)Due to RateIncrease(Decrease)Due to Volume (a)NetIncrease(Decrease)Interest Income (FTE):      Loans$(25) $25 $— Investment securities available-for-sale(2) — (2) Interest-bearing deposits with banks(1) — (1) Total interest income (FTE)(28) 25 (3)        Interest Expense:      Interest-bearing deposits(1) (1) (2) Medium- and long-term debt2 (5) (3) Total interest expense1 (6) (5) Net interest income (FTE)$(29) $31 $2 (a)Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume.Net interest income was $414 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014, an increase of $2 million compared to $412 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013. The increase in net interest income resulted primarily from the benefit provided by an increase in average earning assets and a decrease in funding costs, partially offset by a decrease in loan yields. Average earning assets increased $2.8 billion, or 5 percent, to $61.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2014, compared to $58.9 billion for the same period in 2013. The increase in average earning assets primarily reflected an increase of $3.1 billion in average loans, partially offset by a decrease of $293 million in average interest-bearing deposits with banks. The net interest margin (FTE) for the three months ended September 30, 2014 decreased 12 basis points to 2.67 percent, from 2.79 percent for the comparable period in 2013, primarily from decreased yields on loans and mortgage-backed investment securities, partially offset by the benefit from lower funding costs. The decrease in loan yields reflected shifts in the average loan portfolio mix, a decrease in accretion on the acquired loan portfolio, the impact of a competitive rate environment, the decline in LIBOR and positive credit quality migration throughout the portfolio, as well as the impact of a negative residual value adjustment to assets in the leasing portfolio. Yields on mortgage-backed investment securities decreased primarily due to the benefit of a cumulative retrospective premium adjustment to third quarter 2013 yields, with no similar adjustment in the third quarter 2014, partially offset by decreased premium amortization resulting from slower actual prepayments in third quarter 2014, compared to third quarter 2013. Average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) of $4.9 billion and $5.2 billion in the three months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, included in "interest bearing deposits with banks" on the consolidated balance sheets, reduced the net interest margin by approximately 21 basis points and 24 basis points in each respective period. 40Table of Contents The "Year-to-Date Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent" table that follows provides an analysis of net interest income (FTE) for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013 and details the components of the change in net interest income on a FTE basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year.Year-to-Date Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent (FTE) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014 September 30, 2013(dollar amounts in millions)AverageBalanceInterestAverageRate AverageBalanceInterestAverageRateCommercial loans$29,487$6893.12% $28,069$6883.28%Real estate construction loans1,905493.42 1,430433.98Commercial mortgage loans8,7392463.77 9,1772713.95Lease financing840203.23 850213.22International loans1,349373.64 1,265353.73Residential mortgage loans1,763503.81 1,600504.13Consumer loans2,244543.21 2,142533.32Total loans (a)46,3271,1453.30 44,5331,1613.49        Mortgage-backed securities available-for-sale8,9761592.36 9,3391582.29Other investment securities available-for-sale36910.44 39010.48Total investment securities available-for-sale9,3451602.28 9,7291592.21        Interest-bearing deposits with banks (b)4,80390.25 4,43390.26Other short-term investments110—0.60 11511.38Total earning assets60,5851,3142.90 58,8101,3303.03        Cash and due from banks932   993  Allowance for loan losses(602)   (627)  Accrued income and other assets4,421   4,531  Total assets$65,336   $63,707          Money market and interest-bearing checking deposits$22,571180.11 $21,594220.13Savings deposits1,734—0.03 1,654—0.03Customer certificates of deposit4,990130.36 5,603190.44Foreign office time deposits30420.68 51320.54Total interest-bearing deposits29,599330.15 29,364430.19Short-term borrowings209—0.03 189—0.07Medium- and long-term debt3,062381.67 4,109431.42Total interest-bearing sources32,870710.29 33,662860.34        Noninterest-bearing deposits24,182   21,991  Accrued expenses and other liabilities960   1,104  Total shareholders’ equity7,324   6,950  Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity$65,336   $63,707          Net interest income/rate spread (FTE) $1,2432.61  $1,2442.69        FTE adjustment $3   $2         Impact of net noninterest-bearing sources of funds  0.13   0.14Net interest margin (as a percentage of average earning assets) (FTE) (a) (b)  2.74%   2.83%(a)Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio of $25 million and $26 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, increased the net interest margin by 6 basis points in each period.(b)Average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank reduced the net interest margin by 20 basis points in both the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013. 41Table of ContentsYear-to-Date Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent (FTE) (continued) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014/September 30, 2013(in millions)Increase(Decrease)Due to RateIncrease(Decrease)Due to Volume (a)NetIncrease(Decrease)Interest Income (FTE):      Loans$(58) $42 $(16) Investment securities available-for-sale4 (3) 1 Other short-term investments(1) — (1) Total interest income (FTE)(55) 39 (16)        Interest Expense:      Interest-bearing deposits(8) (2) (10) Medium- and long-term debt8 (13) (5) Total interest expense— (15) (15) Net interest income (FTE)$(55) $54 $(1) (a)Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume.Net interest income was $1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, a decrease of $2 million compared to the same period in 2013. The decrease in net interest income resulted primarily from a decrease in loan yields, partially offset by the benefit provided by an increase in average loans and a decrease in funding costs. Average earning assets increased $1.8 billion, or 3 percent, to $60.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, compared to $58.8 billion for the same period in 2013. The increase in average earning assets primarily reflected increases of $1.8 billion in average loans and $370 million in average interest-bearing deposits with banks, partially offset by a decrease of $384 million in average investment securities available-for-sale. The net interest margin (FTE) for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 decreased 9 basis points to 2.74 percent, from 2.83 percent for the comparable period in 2013, due to decreased yields on loans, partially offset by improved yields on mortgage-backed investment securities and the benefit from lower funding costs. The decrease in loan yields was primarily the result of the same reasons discussed in the quarterly analysis above, with the exception of the impact of accretion on the acquired portfolio, which was largely neutral to the change in loan yields for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013. The increase in mortgage-backed investment securities yields was primarily due to decreased premium amortization resulting from slower prepayment speeds. Average balances deposited with the FRB of $4.7 billion and $4.3 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, included in "interest bearing deposits with banks" on the consolidated balance sheets, reduced the net interest margin by approximately 20 basis points in each respective period. For further discussion of the effects of market rates on net interest income, refer to the "Market and Liquidity Risk" section of this financial review.Provision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses was $5 million and $8 million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $25 million and $37 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The provision for credit losses includes both the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The provision for loan losses is recorded to maintain the allowance for loan losses at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio. For a discussion of the allowance for loan losses and the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for loan losses, refer to the "Credit Risk" and "Critical Accounting Policies" sections of this financial review. The provision for loan losses was $4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014, compared to $10 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013, and was $18 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $35 million for the same period in the prior year. Credit quality in the loan portfolio continued to improve in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, compared to the same periods in the prior year. Improvements in credit quality included a decline of $367 million in the Corporation's criticized loan list from September 30, 2013 to September 30, 2014. Reflected in the decline in criticized loans was a decrease in nonaccrual loans of $108 million. The Corporation's criticized loan list is consistent with loans in the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful categories defined by regulatory authorities.Net loan charge-offs in the three months ended September 30, 2014 decreased $16 million to $3 million, or 0.03 percent of average total loans, compared to $19 million, or 0.18 percent, for the three months ended September 30, 2013. The $16 million decrease in net loan charge-offs in the three months ended September 30, 2014, compared to the same period in 2013, primarily reflected decreases in Commercial Real Estate, Retail Banking and Small Business, partially offset by increases in Technology and Life Sciences, Private Banking and general Middle Market.42Table of ContentsNet loan charge-offs in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 decreased $36 million to $24 million, or 0.07 percent of average total loans, compared to $60 million, or 0.18 percent, for the nine months ended September 30, 2013. The $36 million decrease in net loan charge-offs in the nine months ended September 30, 2014, compared to the same period in 2013, reflected decreases in most business lines, with the largest decreases in general Middle Market, Commercial Real Estate, Small Business and Corporate Banking, partially offset by an increase in Technology and Life Sciences.The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments is recorded to maintain the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014, compared to a benefit of $2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2013 and was $7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $2 million for the same period in 2013. The $3 million increase in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments in the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013, primarily reflected an increase in the provision for letters of credit. The $5 million increase in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 primarily reflected the impact of a second quarter 2013 reduction of specific reserves on unfunded lending commitments. Lending-related commitment charge-offs were insignificant for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014.An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets is presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.Noninterest Income Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,(in millions)2014 2013 2014 2013Customer-driven income:       Service charges on deposit accounts$54 $53 $162 $161Fiduciary income44 41 133 128Commercial lending fees26 28 69 71Card fees20 20 59 55Letter of credit fees14 17 43 49Foreign exchange income9 9 30 27Brokerage fees4 4 13 14Other customer-driven income (a)19 23 59 67Total customer-driven noninterest income190 195 568 572Noncustomer-driven income:       Bank-owned life insurance11 12 31 31Net securities (losses) gains (1) 1 — (1)Other noncustomer-driven income (a)15 20 44 61Total noninterest income$215 $228 $643 $663(a)The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income.Noninterest income was $215 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014, a decrease of $13 million compared to $228 million for the same period in 2013. The decrease reflected a $5 million decrease in customer-driven income and an $8 million decrease in noncustomer-driven income. The $5 million decrease in customer-driven income primarily reflected a $4 million decrease in customer derivative income, a $3 million decrease in letter of credit fees and small decreases in several other categories, partially offset by a $3 million increase in fiduciary income. The $8 million decrease in noncustomer-driven income primarily reflected a $5 million decrease in warrant income and small decreases in most other categories, partially offset by a $3 million increase in deferred compensation asset returns. Noninterest income was $643 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, a decrease of $20 million compared to $663 million for the same period in 2013, reflecting a $4 million decrease in customer-driven income and a $16 million decrease in noncustomer-driven income. The decrease in customer-driven income primarily reflected decreases of $7 million in customer derivative income and $6 million in letter of credit fees, partially offset by increases of $5 million in fiduciary income and $4 million in card fees. The $16 million decrease in noncustomer-driven income primarily reflected decreases of $7 million in income from the Corporation's third-party credit card provider, $4 million in securities trading income, $3 million in income from principal investing and warrants and small decreases in most other categories. The decrease in income from the Corporation's third-party credit card provider in part reflects a change in the timing of the recognition of incentives from annually to quarterly in the third quarter of 2013.The following table illustrates certain categories included in "other noninterest income" on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.43Table of Contents Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,(in millions)2014 2013 2014 2013Other noninterest income:       Other customer-driven income:       Investment banking fees$4 $5 $14 $15Customer derivative income4 8 12 19All other customer-driven income11 10 33 33Total other customer-driven income19 23 59 67Other noncustomer-driven income:       Securities trading income3 3 7 11Deferred compensation asset returns (a)3 — 6 7Income from principal investing and warrants3 8 9 12All other noncustomer-driven income6 9 22 31Total other noncustomer-driven income15 20 44 61Total other noninterest income$34 $43 $103 $128(a)Compensation deferred by the Corporation's officers is invested based on investment selections of the officers.

Third quarter 2014 included certain actions that resulted in a net benefit to noninterest expenses of $8 million. These actions primarily included a $9 million contribution to the Comerica Charitable Foundation (in other noninterest expenses), a $32 million gain on the early redemption of debt, $6 million of severance-related expenses (in salaries and benefits expense) and $5 million of lease termination charges associated with real estate optimization (in net occupancy expense). Excluding these actions, noninterest expenses decreased $12 million, primarily due to a decrease in salaries and benefits expense, largely the result of decreases in pension and incentive expense, partially offset by the impact of merit increases.Noninterest expenses were $1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, a decrease of $42 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Excluding the impact of the third quarter 2014 actions described above, noninterest expenses decreased $34 million, primarily reflecting a decrease in salaries and benefits expense, decreased expenses related to foreclosed properties (in other noninterest expenses) and small decreases in several other categories, partially offset by increases in software and litigation-related expenses. The decrease in salaries and benefits expense was primarily for the same reasons noted in the quarterly discussion above, as well as an increase in payroll tax expenses.Provision for Income TaxesThe provision for income taxes was $73 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $68 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013, and $207 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $195 million for the same period in the prior year. The increases in the provision for income taxes in both comparative periods were primarily due to increases in pretax income.44Table of ContentsSTRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESSThe Corporation's management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. These methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines.In the second quarter 2014, the Corporation enhanced the approach used to determine the standard reserve factors used in estimating the allowance for credit losses, which had the effect of capturing certain elements in the standard reserve component that had formerly been included in the qualitative assessment. The impact of the change was largely neutral to the total allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2014. However, because standard reserves are allocated to the segments at the loan level, while qualitative reserves are allocated at the portfolio level, the impact of the methodology change on the allowance of each segment reflected the characteristics of the individual loans within each segment's portfolio, causing segment reserves to increase or decrease accordingly. As a result, the current year provision for credit losses within each segment is not comparable to prior year amounts.Business SegmentsThe Corporation's operations are strategically aligned into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based upon the products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, Finance is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes items not directly associated with these business segments or the Finance segment. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of these business segments for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013.The following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.

Net interest income (FTE) of $1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased $9 million compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily the result of the benefit from an increase in average loans of $1.5 billion, an increase in accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio and lower deposit costs, partially offset by lower loan yields. Average deposits increased $1.8 billion. The provision for credit losses increased $16 million to $45 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, compared to the same period in the prior year. Net credit-related charge-offs of $16 million decreased $21 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2013, primarily reflecting decreases in general Middle Market, Commercial Real Estate, Corporate Banking and Environmental Services, partially offset by an increase in Technology and Life Sciences. Noninterest income of $275 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 decreased $12 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting a decrease of $6 million in letter of credit fees and small decreases in most other categories of noninterest income, partially offset by a $5 million increase in card fees. Noninterest expenses of $441 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 decreased $5 million compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a $9 million decrease in salaries and benefits expense and a $7 million decrease in expenses related to foreclosed properties, partially offset by a $9 million increase in corporate overhead expense. The increase in overhead expenses was primarily related to certain actions taken in the third quarter 2014 including a contribution to the Comerica Charitable Foundation, charges associated with real estate optimization and several other efficiency-related actions.Net income for the Retail Bank of $31 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased $4 million, compared to $27 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013. Net interest income (FTE) of $446 million decreased $14 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014, primarily due to lower loan yields, a decrease in accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio and a decrease in net funds transfer pricing (FTP) credits, partially offset by the benefit provided by a $128 million increase in average loans and lower deposit rates. Average deposits increased $417 million. 45Table of ContentsThe provision for credit losses was a benefit of $2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, a decrease of $23 million from the comparable period in the prior year. Net credit-related charge-offs of $7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 decreased $11 million from the comparable period in the prior year, reflecting decreases in both Small Business and Retail Banking. Noninterest income of $123 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 decreased $9 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2013, primarily due to a $7 million decrease in income from the Corporation's third-party credit card provider, largely reflecting a change in the timing of the recognition of incentives from annually to quarterly in the third quarter of 2013. Noninterest expenses of $524 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 decreased $6 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a $4 million decrease in salaries and benefits expense and small decreases in several other noninterest expense categories, partially offset by a $5 million increase in corporate overhead expense, for the same reasons as described above in the Business Bank discussion.Wealth Management's net income of $68 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased $4 million, compared to $64 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013. Net interest income (FTE) of $139 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 remained relatively stable compared to $138 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, as the benefit provided by a $168 million increase in average loans was largely offset by a decline in loan yields. Average deposits increased $212 million. The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $11 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, compared to a benefit of $8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013. Net credit-related charge-offs were $1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, compared to $5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013. Noninterest income of $195 million increased $4 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting an $6 million increase in fiduciary income, partially offset by a $2 million decrease in securities trading income. Noninterest expenses of $239 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased $1 million primarily due to a $3 million increase in corporate overhead expense, partially offset by small decreases in several other noninterest expense categories. See the Business Bank discussion, above, for an explanation of the increase in corporate overhead expense.The net loss in the Finance segment was $257 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, compared to a net loss of $284 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013. Net interest expense (FTE) of $485 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 decreased $7 million, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2013, primarily reflecting a decrease in net FTP expense as a result of lower net rates paid to the business segments under the Corporation's internal FTP methodology. A $31 million decrease in noninterest expenses was primarily the result of the third quarter 2014 gain of $32 million on the early redemption of debt.Market SegmentsMarket segment results are provided for the Corporation's three largest geographic markets: Michigan, California and Texas. In addition to the three largest geographic markets, Other Markets is also reported as a market segment.

The $2.5 billion increase in average commercial loans primarily reflected an increase in Middle Market ($1.6 billion), Mortgage Banker Finance ($486 million) and Corporate Banking ($240 million). The increase in Middle Market primarily reflected increases in Energy ($543 million), Technology and Life Sciences ($479 million) and general Middle Market ($400 million). In general, Middle Market serves customers with annual revenue between $20 million and $500 million; while Corporate serves customers with revenue over $500 million. Changes in average total loans by geographic market is provided in the table above.Investment securities available-for-sale increased $161 million to $9.5 billion at September 30, 2014, from $9.3 billion at December 31, 2013, primarily reflecting purchases slightly out-pacing paydowns on residential mortgage-backed investment securities (RMBS) as well as an $84 million decrease in net unrealized losses, to a net unrealized loss of $23 million at September 30, 2014, compared to a net unrealized loss of $107 million at December 31, 2013. On an average basis, investment securities available-for-sale increased $23 million in the third quarter 2014, compared to the fourth quarter 2013. 49Table of Contents The Corporation has been purchasing Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) RMBS to replace paydowns on RMBS issued by government-sponsored enterprises, as GNMA securities receive more favorable treatment under the liquidity rules recently issued by U.S. banking regulators. Further information about the rule is provided later in this section under the "Capital" subheading. The following table provides a summary of the composition of the Corporation's RMBS portfolio.

On an average basis, total liabilities increased $1.4 billion in the third quarter 2014, compared to the fourth quarter 2013, primarily due to increases of $1.7 billion in noninterest-bearing deposits and $651 million in interest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a decrease of $911 million in medium- and long-term debt. The decrease in average medium- and long-term debt resulted primarily from the maturities of $1 billion of floating-rate FHLB advances and $250 million of subordinated notes, as well as the early redemption of $150 million of subordinated notes, partially offset by issuances of $350 million of medium-term senior notes and $250 million of subordinated notes, during the second and third quarters of 2014. The increase in average total deposits of $2.4 billion primarily reflected increases in general Middle Market ($1.4 billion), Technology and Life Sciences ($701 million), Retail Banking ($305 million) and Private Banking ($248 million), partially offset by a decrease in Corporate Banking ($123 million). Average total deposits increased in all geographic markets.CapitalTotal shareholders' equity increased $283 million to $7.4 billion at September 30, 2014, compared to December 31, 2013.

These stress tests are a regular part of the Corporation's overall risk management and capital planning process. The same forecasting process is also used by the Corporation to conduct the stress test that was part of the Federal Reserve's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). For additional information about risk management processes, refer to the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.The Federal Reserve completed its 2014 CCAR review in March 2014 and did not object to the Corporation's capital plan and capital distributions contemplated in the plan. The plan provides for up to $236 million in share repurchases for the four-quarter period ending March 31, 2015. At September 30, 2014, up to $118 million remained available for share repurchases under the plan. The plan also provided the authority to fully redeem $150 million par value of 8.375% subordinated notes due 2024. The notes were called at par on July 15, 2014, resulting in a gain of approximately $32 million.On April 22, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the Board) approved a 1-cent increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.20 per common share. The Board also authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 2.0 million shares of Comerica Incorporated outstanding common stock, in addition to the 5.1 million shares remaining at March 31, 2014 under the Board's prior authorizations for the share repurchase program initially approved in November 2010. Including the April 22, 2014 authorization, a total of 30.3 million shares has been authorized for repurchase under the share repurchase program since its inception in 2010. In November 2010, the Board authorized the purchase of up to all 11.5 million of the Corporation's original outstanding warrants. There is no expiration date for the Corporation's share repurchase program. 50Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes the Corporation's repurchase activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2014.(shares in thousands)Total Number of Shares and Warrants Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Repurchase Plans or Programs RemainingRepurchaseAuthorization (a) Total Numberof SharesPurchased (b) Average PricePaid Per Share Average Price Paid Per Warrant (c)Total first quarter 20141,523 16,591 1,703 $47.21 $—Total second quarter 20141,236 16,697(d)1,273 $47.73 —July 2014502 16,145 505 50.14 —August 2014566 15,579 566 49.42 —September 2014115 15,334 115 50.48 —Total third quarter 20141,183 15,334 1,186 49.83 —Total 20143,942 15,334 4,162 $48.11 $—(a)Maximum number of shares and warrants that may yet be purchased under the publicly announced plans or programs.(b)Includes approximately 220,000 shares purchased pursuant to deferred compensation plans and shares purchased from employees to pay for taxes related to restricted stock vesting under the terms of an employee share-based compensation plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2014. These transactions are not considered part of the Corporation's repurchase program.(c)The Corporation made no repurchases of warrants under the repurchase program during the nine months ended September 30, 2014. Upon exercise of a warrant, the number of shares with a value equal to the aggregate exercise price is withheld from an exercising warrant holder as payment (known as a "net exercise provision"). During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, the Corporation withheld the equivalent of approximately 492,000 shares to cover an aggregate of $14.4 million in exercise price and issued approximately 361,000 shares to the exercising warrant holders. Shares withheld in connection with the net exercise provision are not included in the total number of shares or warrants purchased in the above table.(d)Includes April 22, 2014 share repurchase authorization for up to an additional 2.0 million shares.Risk-based regulatory capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in credit risk profiles among banking institutions and to account for off-balance sheet exposure. Assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with specified risk-weighting factors. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items.The Corporation's capital ratios exceeded minimum regulatory requirements as follows: September 30, 2014 December 31, 2013(dollar amounts in millions)Capital Ratio Capital RatioTier 1 common (a) (b)$7,105 10.69% $6,895 10.64%Tier 1 risk-based (4.00% - minimum) (b)7,105 10.69 6,895 10.64Total risk-based (8.00% - minimum) (b)8,608 12.95 8,491 13.10Leverage (3.00% - minimum) (b)7,105 10.80 6,895 10.77Tangible common equity (a)6,783 9.94 6,498 10.07(a)See Supplemental Financial Data section for reconcilements of non-GAAP financial measures.(b)September 30, 2014 capital and ratios are estimated.In July 2013, U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule for the U.S. adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework. The regulatory framework includes a more conservative definition of capital, two new capital buffers - a conservation buffer and a countercyclical buffer, new and more stringent risk weight categories for assets and off-balance sheet items, and a supplemental leverage ratio. As a banking organization subject to the standardized approach, the rules will be effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2015, with certain transition provisions fully phased in on January 1, 2018.According to the rule, the Corporation will be subject to the capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent, when fully phased in, to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses. However, the rules do not subject the Corporation to the capital countercyclical buffer of up to 2.5 percent or the supplemental leverage ratio. The Corporation estimates the September 30, 2014 common equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 risk-based ratio would be 10.4 percent if calculated under the final rule, excluding most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income from regulatory capital. The Corporation's September 30, 2014 estimated common equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 capital ratios exceed the minimum required by the final rule (7 percent and 8.5 percent, respectively, including the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer). For a reconcilement of these non-GAAP financial measures, refer to the "Supplemental Financial Data" section of this financial review.The Corporation expects that U.S. banking regulators will establish an additional capital buffer for banking organizations deemed systemically important to the U.S. financial system (Domestic Systemically Important Banks, or "D-SIB"). If designated as a D-SIB by the U.S. banking regulators, the Corporation would be subject to the additional buffer. While the level and timing of a D-SIB buffer is not currently known, the Corporation expects to exceed all required capital levels within regulatory timelines.51Table of ContentsIn September 2014, U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule implementing a quantitative liquidity requirement in the U.S. generally consistent with the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) minimum liquidity measure established under the Basel III liquidity framework. Under the rule, the Corporation is subject to a modified LCR standard, which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of high-quality, liquid assets (HQLA) to fully cover modified net cash outflows under a 30-day systematic liquidity stress scenario. The rule is effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2016. During the transition year, 2016, the Corporation will be required to maintain a minimum LCR of 90 percent. Beginning January 1, 2017, and thereafter, the minimum required LCR will be 100 percent. The Corporation continues to evaluate the impact of the rule; however, we expect to meet the final requirements adopted by U.S. banking regulators within the required timetable. To reach full compliance and provide a buffer for normal volatility in balance sheet dynamics, the Corporation expects to add additional HQLA, funded with additional debt, in the future. The Corporation does not expect compliance with the LCR rule will have a significant impact on net interest income.The Basel III liquidity framework includes a second minimum liquidity measure, the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), which requires the amount of available longer-term, stable sources of funding to be at least 100 percent of the required amount of longer-term stable funding over a one-year period. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is in the process of reviewing the proposed NSFR standard and evaluating its impact on the banking system. U.S. banking regulators have announced that they expect to issue proposed rulemaking to implement the NSFR in advance of its scheduled global implementation in 2018. While uncertainty exists in the final form and timing of the U.S. rule implementing the NSFR and whether or not the Corporation will be subject to the full requirements, the Corporation is closely monitoring the development of the rule. RISK MANAGEMENTThe following updated information should be read in conjunction with the "Risk Management" section on pages F-23 through F-40 in the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report.Credit RiskAllowance for Credit LossesThe allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The allowance for loan losses represents management's assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporation's loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in "accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets, provides for probable losses inherent in lending-related commitments, including unused commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.The Corporation disaggregates the loan portfolio into segments for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses. These segments are based on the level at which the Corporation develops, documents and applies a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The Corporation's portfolio segments are business loans and retail loans. Business loans are defined as those belonging to the commercial, real estate construction, commercial mortgage, lease financing and international loan portfolios. Retail loans consist of traditional residential mortgage, home equity and other consumer loans. The allowance for loan losses includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain loans, and allowances for homogeneous pools of loans with similar risk characteristics.The Corporation regularly reviews and refines its methodology for determining the allowance for credit losses. In the second quarter 2014, the approach used to determine standard reserve factors was enhanced, which had the effect of capturing certain elements in the standard reserve component that had formerly been included in the qualitative assessment. The impact of the change was largely neutral to the total allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2014. However, because standard reserves are allocated to the business segments at the loan level, while qualitative reserves are allocated at the portfolio level, the impact of the methodology change on the allowance of each business segment reflected the characteristics of the individual loans within each segment's portfolio, causing segment reserves to increase or decrease accordingly.The U.S. economy rebounded from a first quarter 2014 in which real Gross Domestic Product declined at a 2.9% annual rate. The second quarter 2014 saw real GDP growth of 4.6% and third quarter growth was about 2.1%. Unemployment claims have fallen in recent reporting periods while housing related metrics have started to moderate. While the U.S economy continues to show moderate growth overall, European and Asian economies appear to be slowing, with heightened risk of Europe falling into recession. Improvement in overall credit portfolio metrics has abated, as the Corporation believes it has reached near cycle-low levels of criticized loans and loan charge-offs. This is balanced by continued loan growth at the Corporation and industry-wide. While the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio remained strong in the third quarter of 2014, economic complexity and uncertainty continued to be a consideration when determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses.The allowance for loan losses was $592 million at September 30, 2014, compared to $598 million at December 31, 2013, a decrease of $6 million, or 1 percent. The decrease resulted primarily from improved credit quality in the loan portfolio, partially offset by higher loan balances.52Table of ContentsThe total allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb incurred losses inherent in the total loan portfolio. Unanticipated economic events, including political, economic and regulatory instability could cause changes in the credit characteristics of the portfolio and result in a currently unanticipated increase in the allowance. Loss emergence periods, which are used to determine the most appropriate default horizon associated with the calculation of probabilities of default, tend to lengthen during benign economic periods and shorten during periods of economic distress. Considered in isolation, lengthening the loss emergence period assumption would result in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. In addition, inclusion of other industry-specific portfolio exposures in the allowance, as well as significant increases in the current portfolio exposures, could also increase the amount of the allowance. Any of these events, or some combination thereof, may result in a future need for additional provision for loan losses in order to maintain an allowance that complies with credit risk and accounting policies. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain letters of credit in a manner consistent with business loans, and allowances based on the pool of the remaining letters of credit and all unused commitments to extend credit within each internal risk rating.The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $43 million at September 30, 2014 compared to $36 million at December 31, 2013. The $7 million increase in the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments resulted primarily from an increase of $7 million in reserves for standby letters of credit, primarily as a result of an increase in criticized standby letters of credit. Nonperforming AssetsNonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, troubled debt restructured loans (TDRs) which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans) and foreclosed property. TDRs include performing and nonperforming loans. Nonperforming TDRs are either on nonaccrual or reduced-rate status. Nonperforming assets do not include purchased credit impaired (PCI) loans.The following table presents a summary of nonperforming assets and past due loans.(dollar amounts in millions)September 30, 2014 December 31, 2013Nonaccrual loans:   Business loans:   Commercial$93 $81Real estate construction18 21Commercial mortgage144 156International— 4Total nonaccrual business loans255 262Retail loans:   Residential mortgage42 53Consumer:   Home equity31 33Other consumer1 2Total consumer32 35Total nonaccrual retail loans74 88Total nonaccrual loans329 350Reduced-rate loans17 24Total nonperforming loans346 374Foreclosed property11 9Total nonperforming assets$357 $383Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans0.73% 0.82%Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and foreclosed property0.75 0.84Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total nonperforming loans171 160Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing$13 $16Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing as a percentage of total loans0.03% 0.03%  Nonperforming assets decreased $26 million to $357 million at September 30, 2014, from $383 million at December 31, 2013.

Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $10.6 billion at September 30, 2014, of which $3.4 billion, or 32 percent, were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to real estate developers. The remaining $7.2 billion, or 68 percent, of commercial real estate loans in other business lines consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages, which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans. The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-time customers with satisfactory completion experience. Real estate construction loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $1.7 billion with $17 million on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2014, compared to $1.4 billion with $20 million on nonaccrual status at December 31, 2013. In other business lines, $1 million of real estate construction loans were on nonaccrual status at both September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013.Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Of the $1.7 billion of commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line outstanding at both September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, $49 million and $51 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. Commercial mortgage loan net recoveries in the Commercial Real Estate business line were $2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014, compared to net charge-offs of $7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013. In other business lines, $95 million and $105 million of commercial mortgage loans were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. Net charge-offs were $4 million and $9 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.56Table of ContentsThe geographic distribution and project type of commercial real estate loans are important factors in diversifying credit risk within the portfolio.

Residential mortgages totaled $1.8 billion at September 30, 2014, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.8 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $42 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2014. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.6 billion at September 30, 2014, of which $1.5 billion was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit and $83 million were closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.6 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $31 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2014. A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at September 30, 2014. The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation's primary geographic markets. Substantially all residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more are placed on nonaccrual status. Even if current or less than 90 days past due, substantially all junior lien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status if full collection of the senior position is in doubt. Such loans are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell no later than 180 days past due.Shared National CreditsShared National Credits (SNCs) are defined by banking regulators as facilities of more than $20 million shared by three or more federally supervised financial institutions that are selectively reviewed on an annual basis by regulatory authorities at the agent bank level. The Corporation generally seeks to obtain ancillary business at the origination of a SNC relationship. Loans classified as SNC loans totaled $10.4 billion at September 30, 2014 (approximately 865 borrowers), compared to $9.4 billion (approximately 860 borrowers) at December 31, 2013. SNC loans are held to the same credit underwriting and pricing standards as the remainder of the loan portfolio. The Bank was the agent for $1.9 billion and $1.5 billion of the SNC loans outstanding at 57Table of ContentsSeptember 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. Nonaccrual SNC loans increased $5 million to $16 million at September 30, 2014, compared to $11 million at December 31, 2013. SNC net loan charge-offs totaled $2 million for both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, respectively, compared to zero and $8 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, respectively.Energy LendingThe Corporation has a portfolio of energy-related loans that are included primarily in "commercial loans" in the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation has over 30 years of experience in energy lending, with a focus on middle market companies. Loans in the Middle Market - Energy business line were $3.4 billion, or approximately 7 percent of total loans, at September 30, 2014, compared to $2.8 billion, or approximately 6 percent of total loans, at December 31, 2013. Nonaccrual Middle Market - Energy loans were zero at September 30, 2014, compared to $1 million at December 31, 2013. There were no Middle Market - Energy net loan charge-offs for both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014, compared to net loan charge-offs of zero and $2 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, respectively. Energy loans are diverse in nature, with outstanding balances by customer market segment distributed approximately as follows at September 30, 2014: 70 percent exploration and production (EP) (comprised of approximately 59 percent oil, 23 percent mixed and 18 percent natural gas), 17 percent energy services and 13 percent midstream. Approximately 95 percent of the outstanding loans in the EP and midstream market segments were secured at September 30, 2014.State and Local MunicipalitiesIn the normal course of business, the Corporation serves the needs of state and local municipalities in multiple capacities, including traditional banking products such as deposit services, loans and letters of credit, investment banking services such as bond underwriting and private placements, and by investing in municipal securities.The following table summarizes the Corporation's direct exposure to state and local municipalities as of September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013.(in millions)September 30, 2014 December 31, 2013Loans outstanding$35 $39Lease financing309 330Investment securities available-for-sale23 22Trading account securities1 3Standby letters of credit96 97Unused commitments to extend credit19 20Total direct exposure to state and local municipalities$483 $511Indirect exposure comprised $98 million in auction-rate preferred securities collateralized by municipal securities at September 30, 2014, compared to $109 million at December 31, 2013. Additionally, the Corporation is exposed to Automated Clearing House (ACH) transaction risk for those municipalities utilizing this electronic payment and/or deposit method and similar products in their cash flow management. The Corporation sets limits on ACH activity during the underwriting process.Extensions of credit to state and local municipalities are subjected to the same underwriting standards as other business loans. At both September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, all outstanding municipal loans and leases were performing according to contractual terms, and one municipal lease was included in the Corporation's criticized loan list. Municipal leases are secured by the underlying equipment, and a substantial majority of the leases are fully defeased with AAA-rated U.S. government securities. Substantially all municipal investment securities available-for sale are auction-rate securities. All auction-rate securities are reviewed quarterly for other-than-temporary impairment. All auction-rate municipal securities were rated investment grade, and all auction-rate preferred securities collateralized by municipal securities were rated investment grade and were adequately collateralized at both September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013. Municipal securities are held in the trading account for resale to customers. In addition, Comerica Securities, a broker-dealer subsidiary of the Bank, underwrites bonds issued by municipalities. All bonds underwritten by Comerica Securities are sold to third party investors. On July 18, 2013, the city of Detroit filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection in federal court. The Corporation's direct exposure to the city of Detroit is insignificant.Automotive LendingSubstantially all dealer loans are in the National Dealer Services business line. Loans in the National Dealer Services business line include floor plan financing and other loans to automotive dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in “commercial loans” in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $3.2 billion at September 30, 2014, a decrease of $321 million compared to $3.5 billion at December 31, 2013. At September 30, 2014, other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $2.3 billion, including $1.5 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans, compared to $2.1 billion of other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Service line, including $1.4 billion of owner-occupied commercial real 58Table of Contentsestate mortgage loans, at December 31, 2013. Automotive lending also includes loans to borrowers involved with automotive production, primarily Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers. Loans to borrowers involved with automotive production totaled approximately $1.2 billion at both September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013.International ExposureInternational assets are subject to general risks inherent in the conduct of business in foreign countries, including economic uncertainties and each foreign government's regulations. Risk management practices minimize the risk inherent in international lending arrangements. These practices include structuring bilateral agreements or participating in bank facilities, which secure repayment from sources external to the borrower's country. Accordingly, such international outstandings are excluded from the cross-border risk of that country. The Corporation does not hold any sovereign exposure to Europe. The Corporation's international strategy as it pertains to Europe is to focus on European companies doing business in North America, with an emphasis on the Corporation's primary geographic markets. The following table summarizes cross-border exposure to entities domiciled in European countries.

Liquidity risk represents the failure to meet financial obligations coming due resulting from an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding, and the inability to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significant changes in pricing, due to inadequate market depth or market disruptions.The Asset and Liability Policy Committee (ALCO) of the Corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities. ALCO meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies, and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit gathering and risk management. The Corporation's Market Risk Department in the Office of Enterprise Risk supports ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate and liquidity risks and coordinating all other market risks. Key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analysis of the Corporation's balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate, liquidity and all other market risks; (ii) monitoring and reporting of the Corporation's positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines; (iii) developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions; (iv) reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval; (v) monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate, liquidity and all other market risks; and (vi) developing and monitoring the interest rate risk economic capital estimate.Interest Rate RiskNet interest income is the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities, primarily through the Corporation's core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by a combination of core deposits and wholesale borrowings. Approximately 85 percent of the Corporation's loans were floating at September 30, 2014, of which approximately 75 percent were based on LIBOR and 25 percent were based on Prime. This creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the floating-rate loan 59Table of Contentsportfolio and the more slowly repricing deposit products. In addition, growth and/or contraction in the Corporation's loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing investment securities, primarily fixed-rate, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, and hedging the sensitivity with interest rate swaps. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk, with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.Since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives, a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk. These techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve, utilizing multiple simulation analyses. Simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income, as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors, including, but not limited to, the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, regulatory impacts and management strategies.Sensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest RatesThe analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is management's principal risk management technique. Management models a base case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment and what is believed to be the most likely balance sheet structure. Existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes are included in the analysis, but no additional hedging is currently forecasted. These derivative instruments currently comprise interest rate swaps that convert fixed-rate long-term debt to variable rates. This base case net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which rates rise or decline in a linear, non-parallel fashion from the base case over 12 months. In the scenarios presented, short-term interest rates increase 200 basis points, resulting in an average increase in short-term interest rates of 100 basis points over the period (+200 scenario). Due to the current low level of interest rates, the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of a 25 basis point drop in short-term interest rates, to zero percent.Each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth, investment security prepayment levels, depositor behavior, yield curve changes, loan and deposit pricing, and overall balance sheet mix and growth. In the +200 scenario, assumptions related to loan growth and deposit run-off are based on historical experience, resulting in a modest increase in loans and a modest decrease in deposits from the base case. No changes are modeled to investment securities beyond the replacement of prepayments, and expected funding maturities are included. As a result of the modeled balance sheet movement, excess reserves diminish. In addition, the model reflects deposit pricing based on historical price movements with short-term interest rates and loan spreads held at current levels. The analysis also does not capture possible regulatory impacts, including impacts of the recently finalized LCR requirements, which could impact balance sheet structure, product offerings and pricing as well as how interest rate risk is managed. How the Corporation chooses to make additional investments in HQLA and fund such investments may have an impact on sensitivity. Changes in economic activity may result in a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis and may translate into a materially different interest rate environment than those presented. For example, deposit balances have grown significantly over the past several years, creating uncertainty regarding future deposit balance levels. A decline in deposit balances beyond historical experience would reduce the estimated increase in net interest income in the +200 scenario.The table below, as of September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above.

The risk to declining interest rates is limited as a result of the inability of the current low level of rates to fall significantly.The table below, as of September 30, 2014, illustrates the estimated sensitivity of the above results to a change in deposit balance assumptions in the +200 scenario, with all other assumptions held constant. In this analysis, average noninterest-bearing deposit run-off in the 12-month period has been increased by $1 billion and $3 billion from the historical run-off experience included in the standard +200 scenario presented above and assumes the deposit run-off reduces excess reserves and increases purchased funds. The analysis is provided as an indicator of the sensitivity of net interest income to the modeled deposit run-off assumption. It is not meant to reflect management's expectation or best estimate. Actual run-off results may vary from those reflected. 60Table of Contents +200 Basis Points(in millions)Estimated Annual ChangeJune 30, 2014Amount %Incremental Average Decrease in Noninterest-bearing Deposit Balances:   $1 billion$216 13%$3 billion194 12Sensitivity of Economic Value of Equity to Changes in Interest RatesIn addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income, an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position. The economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the Corporation's financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements. The economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel 200 basis point increase and 25 basis point decrease in interest rates.The table below, as of September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above.

Capacity for incremental purchased funds at September 30, 2014 included the ability to purchase federal funds, sell securities under agreements to repurchase, as well as issue deposits to institutional investors and issue certificates of deposit through brokers. Purchased funds totaled $319 million at September 30, 2014, compared to $602 million at December 31, 2013. At September 30, 2014, the Bank had pledged loans totaling $25 billion which provided for up to $19 billion of available collateralized borrowing with the FRB.The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Dallas, Texas, which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. At September 30, 2014, real estate-related loans pledged to the FHLB as blanket collateral provided for potential future borrowings of approximately $6 billion. Additionally, the Bank had the ability to issue up to $15.0 billion of debt at September 30, 2014 under an existing $15 billion medium-term senior note program which allows the issuance of debt with maturities between three months and 30 years.The Corporation maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and/or equity securities. Under the shelf registration, on May 23, 2014, the Corporation issued $350 million of 2.125% medium-term senior notes due in 2019 and on July 22, 2014 issued $250 million of 3.80% subordinated notes due in 2026. Both issuances were swapped to floating rates based on 6-month LIBOR indices.The FRB completed its 2014 CCAR review in March 2014 and did not object to Comerica's capital plan and capital distributions contemplated in the plan. Comerica's capital plan includes the authority to fully redeem $150 million par value of 8.375% subordinated notes due 2024. The notes were called at par on July 15, 2014, resulting in a pretax gain of approximately $32 million. Further information regarding the Corporation's medium- and long-term debt is provided in Note 7 to these unaudited financial statements.61Table of ContentsThe ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise funds at competitive rates is impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings of the Corporation and the Bank. As of September 30, 2014, the four major rating agencies had assigned the following ratings to long-term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Liquid assets, which totaled $14.3 billion at September 30, 2014, compared to $12.6 billion at December 31, 2013, before any applicable regulatory haircuts, provide a reservoir of liquidity. Liquid assets include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits with banks, other short-term investments and unencumbered investment securities available-for-sale. At September 30, 2014, the Corporation held deposits at the FRB of $6.6 billion, compared to $5.2 billion at December 31, 2013.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe Corporation’s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation’s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2013, the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to the allowance for credit losses, valuation methodologies, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages F-41 through F-46 in the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report. As of the date of this report, there have been no significant changes to the Corporation's critical accounting policies or estimates, except as discussed below.Allowance for Credit LossesIn the second quarter 2014, the Corporation enhanced the approach used to determine the standard reserve factors used in estimating the allowance for credit losses, which had the effect of capturing certain elements in the standard reserve component that had formerly been included in the qualitative assessment. The impact of the change was largely neutral to the total allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2014. However, because standard reserves are allocated to the segments at the loan level, while qualitative reserves are allocated at the portfolio level, the impact of the methodology change on the allowance of each segment reflected the characteristics of the individual loans within each segment's portfolio, causing segment reserves to increase or decrease accordingly.For further discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses, refer to the "Allowance for Credit Losses" section in this financial review and Note 1 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.GoodwillGoodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level, equivalent to a business segment or one level below. The Corporation has three reporting units: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. At September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, goodwill totaled $635 million, including $380 million allocated to the Business Bank, $194 million allocated to the Retail Bank and $61 million allocated to Wealth Management. The Corporation performs its annual evaluation of goodwill impairment in the third quarter of each year and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests suggest additional testing may be warranted to determine if goodwill might be impaired. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step test. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of identified reporting units with their carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. In performing the annual impairment test, the carrying value of each reporting unit is the greater of economic or regulatory capital. The Corporation assigns economic capital using internal management methodologies on the basis of each reporting unit's 62Table of Contentscredit, operational and interest rate risks, as well as goodwill. To determine regulatory capital, each reporting unit is assigned sufficient capital such that their respective Tier 1 ratio, based on allocated risk-weighted assets, is the same as that of the Corporation. Using this two-pronged approach, the Corporation's equity is fully allocated to its reporting units except for capital held primarily for the risk associated with the securities portfolio which is assigned to the Finance segment of the Corporation. Determining the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process involving the use of estimates and judgments related to the selection of inputs such as future cash flows, discount rates, comparable public company multiples, applicable control premiums and economic expectations used in determining the interest rate environment. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are determined using a blend of two commonly used valuation techniques: the market approach and the income approach. For the market approach, valuations of reporting units consider a combination of earnings, equity and other multiples from companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit. Since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of noncontrolling interests, the valuations accordingly incorporate a control premium. For the income approach, estimated future cash flows and terminal value are discounted. Estimated future cash flows are derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for each reporting unit which incorporate uncertainty factors inherent to long-term projections. The applicable discount rate is based on the imputed cost of equity capital appropriate for each reporting unit, which incorporates the risk-free rate of return, the level of non-diversified risk associated with companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit, a size risk premium and a market equity risk premium.The annual test of goodwill impairment was performed as of the beginning of the third quarter 2014. The Corporation's assumptions included maintaining the low Federal funds target rate through mid-2015 with modest increases thereafter until eventually reaching a normal interest rate environment. At the conclusion of the first step of the annual goodwill impairment tests performed in the third quarter 2014, the estimated fair values of all reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying amounts, including goodwill. The results of the annual test of the goodwill impairment test for each reporting unit were subjected to stress testing as appropriate.Economic conditions impact the assumptions related to interest and growth rates, loss rates and imputed cost of equity capital. The fair value estimates for each reporting unit incorporated current economic and market conditions, including the recent Federal Reserve announcements and the impact of legislative and regulatory changes, to the extent known and as described above. However, further weakening in the economic environment, such as adverse changes in interest rates, a decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below their carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Additionally, new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management's expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Any impairment charge would not affect the Corporation's regulatory capital ratios, tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position.63Table of ContentsSUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATAThe following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this financial review with financial measures defined by GAAP.(dollar amounts in millions)September 30, 2014 December 31, 2013Tier 1 Common Capital Ratio:   Tier 1 and Tier 1 common capital (a) (b)$7,105 $6,895Risk-weighted assets (a) (b)66,481 64,825Tier 1 and Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio (b)10.69% 10.64%Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio:   Tier 1 common capital (b)$7,105 $6,895Basel III adjustments (c)(1) (6)Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital (c)$7,104 $6,889Risk-weighted assets (a) (b)$66,481 $64,825Basel III adjustments (c)1,627 1,754Basel III risk-weighted assets (c)$68,108 $66,579Tier 1 common capital ratio (b)10.7% 10.6%Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio (c)10.4 10.3Tangible Common Equity Ratio:   Common shareholders' equity$7,433 $7,150Less:   Goodwill635 635Other intangible assets15 17Tangible common equity$6,783 $6,498Total assets$68,887 $65,224Less:   Goodwill635 635Other intangible assets15 17Tangible assets$68,237 $64,572Common equity ratio10.79% 10.97%Tangible common equity ratio9.94 10.07Tangible Common Equity per Share of Common Stock:   Common shareholders' equity$7,433 $7,150Tangible common equity6,783 6,498Shares of common stock outstanding (in millions)180 182Common shareholders' equity per share of common stock$41.26 $39.22Tangible common equity per share of common stock37.65 35.64(a)Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as defined by regulation.(b)September 30, 2014 Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted-assets are estimated.(c)Estimated ratios based on the standardized approach in the final rule for the U.S. adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework, excluding most elements of AOCI.The Tier 1 common capital ratio removes preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations. The Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio further adjusts Tier 1 common capital and risk-weighted assets to account for the final rule approved by U.S. banking regulators in July 2013 for the U.S. adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework. The final Basel III capital rules are effective January 1, 2015 for banking organizations subject to the standardized approach. The tangible common equity ratio removes preferred stock and the effect of intangible assets from capital and the effect of intangible assets from total assets and tangible common equity per share of common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders' equity per share of common stock. The Corporation believes these measurements are meaningful measures of capital adequacy used by investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and to compare against other companies in the industry.64Table of ContentsITEM 3.
