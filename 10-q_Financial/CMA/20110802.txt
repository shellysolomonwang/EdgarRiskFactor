On July 28, 2011 (the “acquisition date”), the Corporation acquired all the outstanding common stock of Sterling Bancshares, Inc. (“Sterling”), a bank holding company headquartered in Houston, Texas, in a stock-for-stock transaction. Sterling common shareholders and holders of outstanding Sterling phantom stock units received 0.2365 shares of the Corporation’s common stock in exchange for each share of Sterling common stock or phantom stock unit. As a result, the Corporation issued approximately 24 million common shares, subject to payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares, with an acquisition date fair value of $793 million, based on the Corporation’s closing stock price of $32.67 on July 27, 2011. Based on the merger agreement, outstanding and unexercised options to purchase Sterling common stock were converted into fully vested options to purchase common stock of the Corporation. In addition, outstanding warrants to purchase Sterling common stock were converted into warrants to purchase common stock of the Corporation. The fair value of total consideration paid to acquire Sterling was approximately $803 million. The Corporation incurred $5 million of pre-integration and transaction costs prior to the acquisition closing date that are included in “merger and restructuring charges” in the consolidated statements of income. However, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Sterling, the consideration paid to acquire Sterling, and the results of Sterling’s operations are not reflected in consolidated financial statements as of and for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011. The acquisition of Sterling significantly expands the Corporation’s presence in Texas, particularly in the Houston and San Antonio areas, and gives the Corporation the ability to leverage additional marketing capacity to offer a wide array of products through a larger distribution network, particularly to middle market and small business companies.  Results of Operations  Net income for the three months ended June 30, 2011 was $96 million, an increase of $26 million from $70 million reported for the three months ended June 30, 2010. The increase in net income in the second quarter 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, was primarily due to an $81 million decrease in the provision for credit losses ($79 million decrease in the provision for loan losses and a $2 million decrease in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments), partially offset by an increase of $18 million in the provision for income taxes and a $31 million decrease in net interest income. Net income per diluted common share was $0.53 in the second quarter 2011, compared to $0.39 for the same period one year ago.  Net income for the first six months of 2011 was $199 million, an increase of $77 million from $122 million reported for the six months ended June 30, 2010. The increase in net income for the six months ended June 30, 2011 from the comparable 2010 period was primarily due to a $217 million decrease in the provision for credit losses ($205 million decrease in the provision for loan losses and a $12 million decrease in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments), partially offset by an increase of $58 million in the provision for income taxes and a decrease of $51 million in net interest income. Net income attributable to common shares was $197 million for the first six months of 2011, compared to a net loss attributable to common shares of $1 million for the same period one year ago. There were no preferred stock dividends included in net income attributable to common shares for the six months ended June 30, 2011, compared to $123 million of preferred stock dividends, including a $94 million one-time redemption charge reflected in the net loss attributable to common shares, for the same period one year ago. The decrease in preferred stock dividends was due to the first quarter 2010 full redemption of $2.25 billion of preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury. Diluted net income per common share was $1.10 for the first six months of 2011, compared to a diluted net loss per common share of $0.01 for the comparable 2010 period.    46    Table of Contents Second-Half 2011 Outlook (Combined Comerica and Sterling Results) Compared to First-Half 2011 (Comerica Only Results)  For the second half of 2011, management expects the following combined results, based on the incorporation of the projected results of Sterling operations from the acquisition closing date of July 28, 2011 through year-end 2011, compared to Comerica-only results for the first half of 2011, assuming a continuation of modest growth in the economy. The estimated purchase accounting impacts incorporated in this outlook are preliminary and may not be indicative of actual amounts that will be recorded as additional information becomes available and as additional analyses are performed.        •    A mid-single digit increase in average loans, primarily due to the acquisition of Sterling loans at fair value. The pace of decline of loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line is expected to decrease in the second half of 2011. Average loans in the National Dealer Services business line are expected to be lower in the third quarter and rebound in the fourth quarter of 2011.        •    Average earning assets of approximately $52.5 billion, reflecting increases, primarily related to Sterling, in average loans and average investment securities available-for-sale, partially offset by a decrease in excess liquidity.        •    An average net interest margin of 3.35 percent to 3.40 percent, reflecting the benefit from the accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio ($35 million to $45 million; 13 basis points to 17 basis points), a reduction in excess liquidity, no increase in the Federal Funds rate, and LIBOR consistent with second quarter 2011 levels.        •    Net credit-related charge-offs between $165 million and $185 million for the second half of 2011. The provision for credit losses is expected to be between $65 million and $85 million for the second half of 2011.        •    A mid-single digit decline in noninterest income in the second half of 2011 compared to the first half of 2011, primarily due to the impact of regulatory changes and a reduction of net income from principal investing and warrants, partially offset by the inclusion of Sterling.        •    Excluding merger and restructuring charges, a high single-digit increase in noninterest expenses in the second half of 2011 compared to the first half of 2011, primarily due to the addition of Sterling.        •    Total merger and restructuring charges of approximately $80 million, after-tax ($125 million pre-tax), with about $25 million, after-tax, recognized in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2011, and the remainder recognized in 2012.        •    Total acquisition synergies of approximately 35 percent of Sterling expenses, or about $56 million, with the majority realized in 2012.        •    For the second half of 2011, income tax expense to approximate 36 percent of income before income taxes less approximately $33 million in tax benefits.        •    Continue share repurchase program that, combined with dividend payments, results in a payout up to 50 percent of full-year earnings.    47    Table of Contents Net Interest Income  Net interest income was $391 million for the three months ended June 30, 2011, a decrease of $31 million compared to $422 million for the same period in 2010. The decrease in net interest income in the second quarter 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, resulted primarily from a decline in average earning assets, the maturity of interest rate swaps at positive spreads, maturities of higher-yield fixed-rate loans and decreases in LIBOR rates, partially offset by a continued shift in funding sources toward lower-cost funds, along with maturities and redemptions of higher-cost medium- and long-term debt. The “Quarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume – Fully Taxable Equivalent” table of this financial review details the components of the change in net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis for the three months ended June 30, 2011, compared to the same period in the prior year. Average earning assets decreased $1.7 billion, or three percent, to $50.1 billion in the second quarter 2011, compared to $51.8 billion in the second quarter 2010, primarily due to a $1.5 billion, or four percent, decrease in average loans, to $39.2 billion. The net interest margin (FTE) for the three months ended June 30, 2011 decreased 14 basis points to 3.14 percent, from 3.28 percent for the comparable period in 2010, primarily due to LIBOR-based loan rates declining faster than deposit rates, a decrease in loan spreads and the maturity of interest rate swaps at positive spreads.  Net interest income was $786 million for the six months ended June 30, 2011, a decrease of $51 million compared to $837 million for the same period in 2010. The decrease in net interest income in the six months ended 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, was primarily due to the same reasons cited in the quarterly discussion above. The “Year-to-date Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume – Fully Taxable Equivalent” table provides an analysis of net interest income for the first six months of 2011 on a FTE basis, compared to the same period in the prior year. Average earning assets decreased $2.7 billion, or five percent, to $49.7 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2011, compared to $52.4 billion for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a $1.6 billion, or four percent, decrease in average loans, to $39.4 billion and a $1.0 billion, or 27 percent, decrease in average interest-bearing deposits with banks. The net interest margin (FTE) for the six months ended June 30, 2011 decreased four basis points to 3.19 percent, from 3.23 percent for the same period in 2010, primarily due to the same reasons cited in the quarterly discussion above, partially offset by a reduction in excess liquidity. The net interest margin was reduced by approximately 18 basis points and 24 basis points in the first six months of 2011 and 2010, respectively, from excess liquidity. Excess liquidity was represented by $2.8 billion and $3.9 billion of average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) in the first six months of 2011 and 2010, respectively, included in “interest-bearing deposits with banks” in the consolidated balance sheets.

For further discussion of the effects of market rates on net interest income, refer to the “Market Risk” section of this financial review.  For full-year 2011, management expects an average net interest margin of 3.35 percent to 3.40 percent, reflecting the benefit from the accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio ($35 million to $45 million; 13 basis points to 17 basis points), a reduction in excess liquidity, no increase in the Federal Funds rate, and LIBOR consistent with second quarter 2011 levels.    48    Table of Contents Quarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume – Fully Taxable Equivalent (FTE)                                     Three Months Ended         June 30, 2011     June 30, 2010     (dollar amounts in millions)   AverageBalance     Interest     AverageRate     AverageBalance     Interest     AverageRate     Commercial loans   $ 21,677     $ 196       3.65 %    $ 20,910     $ 206       3.95 %    Real estate construction loans     1,881       17       3.75       2,987       23       3.13     Commercial mortgage loans     9,636       96       3.98       10,372       109       4.20     Residential mortgage loans     1,525       21       5.50       1,607       22       5.44     Consumer loans     2,243       20       3.42       2,448       22       3.56     Lease financing     958       8       3.50       1,108       10       3.72     International loans     1,254       12       3.80       1,240       13       4.07     Business loan swap income     —        —        —        —        9       —                                                        Total loans     39,174       370       3.79       40,672       414       4.07     Auction-rate securities available-for-sale     500       1       0.71       816       3       1.19     Other investment securities available-for-sale     6,907       58       3.40       6,446       58       3.71                                                       Total investment securities available-for-sale     7,407       59       3.20       7,262       61       3.41     Federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell     2       —        0.33       1       —        1.35     Interest-bearing deposits with banks (a)     3,433       3       0.25       3,768       3       0.25     Other short-term investments     120       —        1.39       132       —        1.65                                                       Total earning assets     50,136       432       3.46       51,835       478       3.70     Cash and due from banks     872                 795               Allowance for loan losses     (859 )                (1,037 )              Accrued income and other assets     4,368                 4,665                                                     Total assets   $ 54,517               $ 56,258                                                             Money market and NOW deposits   $ 18,207       11       0.26     $ 16,354       13       0.32     Savings deposits     1,465       1       0.09       1,429       —        0.07     Customer certificates of deposit     5,609       10       0.70       5,927       15       0.92                                                       Total interest-bearing core deposits     25,281       22       0.35       23,710       28       0.45     Other time deposits     —        —        —        295       1       2.14     Foreign office time deposits     413       1       0.52       448       —        0.23                                                       Total interest-bearing deposits     25,694       23       0.35       24,453       29       0.47     Short-term borrowings     112       —        0.14       248       —        0.27     Medium- and long-term debt     5,821       17       1.20       9,571       25       1.04                                                       Total interest-bearing sources     31,627       40       0.51       34,272       54       0.63     Noninterest-bearing deposits     15,786                 15,218               Accrued expenses and other liabilities     1,132                 1,060               Total shareholders’ equity     5,972                 5,708                                                     Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity   $ 54,517               $ 56,258                                                     Net interest income/rate spread (FTE)        $ 392       2.95          $ 424       3.07                                           FTE adjustment        $ 1               $ 2                                                Impact of net noninterest-bearing sources of funds               0.19                 0.21                                           Net interest margin (as a percentageof average earning assets) (FTE) (a)               3.14 %                3.28 %                                         (a) Excess liquidity, represented by average balances deposited with the FRB, reduced the net interest margin by 21 basis points and 23 basis points in the second quarter of 2011 and 2010, respectively. Excluding excess liquidity, the net interest margin would have been 3.35% and 3.51% in each respective period.

represented by average balances deposited with the FRB, reduced the net interest margin by 18 basis points and 24 basis points year-to-date in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Excluding excess liquidity, the net interest margin would have been 3.37% and 3.47% in each respective period.

Provision for Credit Losses   The provision for credit losses includes both the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The provision for loan losses was $47 million for the second quarter 2011, compared to $126 million for the same period in 2010. The provision for loan losses for the first six months of 2011 was $96 million, compared to $301 million for the same period in 2010. The Corporation establishes this provision to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses, which is discussed under the “Credit Risk” subheading in the “Risk Management” section of this financial review. The decreases of $79 million and $205 million in the provision for loan losses in the three- and six month periods ended June 30, 2011, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2010, resulted primarily from improvements in credit quality. Improvements in credit quality included a decline of $715 million, to $4.8 billion, in the Corporation’s watch list loans from December 31, 2010 to June 30, 2011. The Corporation’s internal watch list is generally consistent with loans in the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful (nonaccrual) categories defined by regulatory authorities. Additional indicators of improved credit quality included a decrease in the inflow to nonaccrual (based on an analysis of nonaccrual loans with book balances greater than $2 million) of $115 million and a decrease in net credit-related charge-offs of $128 million in the six month period ended June 30, 2011, compared to the same period in the prior year.  Moderate U.S. economic growth through the second half of 2010 gave way to a slow growth “soft patch” in the first half of 2011. Real gross domestic product growth for the first quarter of 2011 registered just 1.9 percent annualized and second quarter growth is expected be about the same. U.S. job growth dwindled in May and June, totaling just 43,000 net new jobs for the two months. Three sets of factors converged to pull the economy into a soft patch. These factors are characterized by their expected duration: transitory, medium term and long term. Transitory factors include bad winter and spring weather, high crude oil and gasoline prices early in the year, and the Japan disaster at the end of March which resulted in supply-chain bottlenecks for U.S. manufacturers. Medium term factors that will weigh on economic growth through the remainder of 2011 include still-weak housing markets, constrained consumer spending, and the state and local government budget crisis. Long term factors dragging on economic growth into 2012 and beyond include a lower rate of population growth, an unwind of various federal government efforts to stimulate the economy, and eventual caps and cuts in federal spending, expected to come as a result of current negotiations on the federal debt ceiling. The Texas economy has maintained some forward momentum through the soft patch, while California and Michigan have experienced mildly deteriorating labor market conditions in the second quarter of 2011. Fortunately, the transitory factors are proving to be transitory. Automobile production is expected to increase through the second half of 2011, stabilizing durable goods manufacturing in the second half of the year. This and other forward-looking indicators point to moderately improving economic conditions in the Corporation’s primary geographic markets in late 2011.  Total net credit-related charge-offs include net charge-offs on both loans and lending-related commitments. Net loan charge-offs for the second quarter 2011 decreased $56 million to $90 million, or 0.92 percent of average total loans, compared to $146 million, or 1.44 percent for the second quarter 2010. The decrease in net loan charge-offs in the second quarter 2011, compared to the second quarter 2010, consisted primarily of decreases in net loan charge-offs in the Middle Market ($34 million) and Commercial Real Estate ($23 million) business lines. By geographic market, net loan charge-offs decreased in all markets, with the exception of Florida, in the second quarter 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, with the largest decreases noted in the Other Markets ($29 million) and Western ($21 million) markets. In the Florida market, net loan charge-offs increased $8 million, primarily due to increases in the Private Banking and Middle Market business lines.    52    Table of Contents Net loan charge-offs for the first six months of 2011 were $191 million, compared to $319 million for the same period in 2010. The $128 million decrease in net loan charge-offs for the first six months of 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, consisted primarily of decreases in net loan charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate ($98 million), Specialty Businesses ($17 million), and Middle Market ($14 million) business lines, partially offset by an increase in the Global Corporate Banking Business Line ($7 million). By geographic market, net loan charge-offs decreased in all markets, with the exception of Florida, for the six-month period ended June 30, 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, with the largest decreases noted in the Western ($60 million), Other Markets ($33 million) and Texas ($22 million) markets. In the Florida market, net loan charge-offs increased $6 million, primarily due to increases in the Middle Market and Private Banking business lines.  The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was a benefit of $2 million and $5 million for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011, compared to provisions of zero and $7 million for the comparable periods in 2010. The decreases of $2 million and $12 million for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011, when compared to the same periods in 2010, respectively, resulted primarily from improved credit quality in unfunded commitments in the Midwest, Western and Texas markets. The Corporation establishes this provision to maintain an adequate allowance to cover probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments, which is discussed under the “Credit Risk” subheading in the “Risk Management” section of this financial review. Lending-related commitment charge-offs were insignificant in both the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010.  An analysis of allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets is presented under the “Credit Risk” subheading in the “Risk Management” section of this financial review.  Management expects net credit-related charge-offs between $165 million and $185 million for the second half of 2011. The provision for credit losses is expected to be between $65 million and $85 million for the second half of 2011.  Noninterest Income  Noninterest income was $202 million for the three months ended June 30, 2011, an increase of $8 million, or four percent, compared to $194 million for the same period in 2010, resulting primarily from increases of $5 million in net income from principal investing and warrants and $3 million in net securities gains.  Noninterest income was $409 million for the first six months of 2011, an increase of $21 million, or five percent, compared to the same period in 2010, resulting primarily from increases in net income from principal investing and warrants ($10 million), risk management hedge gains ($7 million), deferred compensation asset returns ($6 million) and net securities gains ($3 million), partially offset by a decrease in service charges on deposit accounts ($5 million).  Management expects a mid-single digit decline in noninterest income for the second half of 2011, compared to the first half of 2011, primarily due to the impact of regulatory changes and a reduction of net income from principal investing and warrants, partially offset by the inclusion of Sterling.  Noninterest Expenses  Noninterest expenses were $409 million for the three months ended June 30, 2011, an increase of $12 million, or three percent, from $397 million for the comparable period in 2010, resulting primarily from increases in salaries expense ($6 million), employee benefits expense ($5 million) and merger and restructuring charges ($5 million), partially offset by a decrease in FDIC insurance expense ($4 million).  Noninterest expenses were $824 million for the first six months of 2011, an increase of $23 million, or three percent, compared to $801 million for the comparable period in 2010. The increase in noninterest expense resulted primarily from increases in salaries expense ($25 million), employee benefits expense ($11 million), merger and restructuring charges ($5 million) and litigation and operational losses ($5 million), partially offset by decreases in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments ($12 million) and FDIC insurance expense ($6 million). The increase in salaries expense reflected increases in incentive compensation ($12 million), share-based compensation ($11 million) and deferred compensation asset returns ($6 million) (offset by an increase in deferred compensation asset returns in noninterest income), partially offset by a decrease in regular salaries ($4 million).    53    Table of Contents Excluding merger and restructuring charges related to the acquisition of Sterling, management expects a high single-digit increase in noninterest expenses in the second half of 2011 compared to the first half of 2011, primarily due to the addition of Sterling. Management expects total merger and restructuring charges of approximately $80 million, after-tax ($125 million pre-tax), with about $25 million, after-tax, recognized in each of the third and fourth quarters of 2011, and the remainder recognized in 2012.  Provision for Income Taxes  The provision for income taxes for the second quarter 2011 was $41 million, compared to $23 million for the same period in 2010. The $18 million increase in the provision for income taxes in the three-month period ended June 30, 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, was primarily due to an increase in income before taxes in the second quarter 2011, compared to the same quarter in the prior year, and a $19 million charge related to a final settlement agreement with the Internal Revenue Service involving the repatriation of foreign earnings on a structured investment transaction, partially offset by a release of tax reserves of $9 million due to the Corporation’s planned participation in a recently enacted State of California voluntary compliance initiative. The Corporation has no other investment structures with uncertain tax positions.  For the first six months of 2011, the provision for income taxes was $76 million, an increase of $58 million compared to the same period in 2010. The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to the same reasons cited in the quarterly discussion above.  Net deferred tax assets were $310 million at June 30, 2011, compared to $383 million at December 31, 2010, a decrease of $73 million, resulting primarily from a reduction in deferred tax assets due to decreases in the allowance for loan losses and unrealized gains recognized in other comprehensive income. Deferred tax assets were evaluated for realization and it was determined that no valuation allowance was needed at both June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010. This conclusion was based on available evidence of loss carryback capacity, projected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and assumptions made regarding future events. For further information on income taxes, refer to Note 12 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements.  For the second half of 2011, management expects income tax expense to approximate 36 percent of income before income taxes less approximately $33 million in tax benefits.  Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax  In the first six months of 2011, there was no income from discontinued operations, net of tax. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, for the first six months of 2010 was $17 million, reflecting a first quarter after-tax gain from the cash settlement of a note receivable related to the 2006 sale of an investment advisory subsidiary. For further information on the cash settlement of the note and discontinued operations, refer to Note 15 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements.  Business Segments  The Corporation’s operations are strategically aligned into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based on the products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, the Finance Division is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes discontinued operations and items not directly associated with these business segments or the Finance Division. Note 14 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements presents financial results of these business segments for the six months ended June 30, 2011 and 2010. For a description of the business activities of each business segment and the methodologies which form the basis for these results, refer to Note 14 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements and Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation’s 2010 Annual Report.    54    Table of Contents The following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.

The Business Bank’s net income of $343 million increased $120 million in the six months ended June 30, 2011, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2010. Net interest income (FTE) of $682 million decreased $10 million in the six months ended June 30, 2011 compared to the same period in the prior year, as the benefit provided by a $1.8 billion increase in average deposits and an increase in loan spreads was offset by a $1.1 billion decrease in average loans. The provision for loan losses of $24 million decreased $195 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting decreases in the Commercial Real Estate (in all markets) and Middle Market (primarily in the Other Markets and Midwest markets) business lines. Net credit-related charge-offs of $126 million decreased $125 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line. Noninterest income of $156 million increased $4 million from the comparable prior year period, primarily due to increases in warrant income ($5 million) and customer derivative income ($3 million), partially offset by a decrease in investment banking fees ($3 million). Noninterest expenses of $316 million decreased $3 million from the same period in the prior year, primarily due to decreases in the provision for credit losses on lending commitments ($12 million), other real estate expense ($3 million) and nominal decreases in other noninterest expense categories, partially offset by increases in allocated corporate overhead expenses ($13 million) and salaries expense ($4 million). The provision for income taxes (FTE) of $155 million for the six month period ended June 30, 2011 increased $72 million, compared to $83 million for the comparable period the prior year, primarily resulting from an increase in income before income taxes.  The net loss for the Retail Bank was $5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2011, compared to a net loss of $10 million in the six months ended June 30, 2010. Net interest income (FTE) of $282 million increased $17 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in loan and deposit spreads and the benefit provided by a $724 million increase in average deposits, partially offset by a $469 million decrease in average loans. The provision for loan losses decreased $5 million from the comparable period in the prior year, reflecting a decrease in the Small Business business line (primarily the Midwest market), partially offset by an increase in the Personal Banking business line (primarily the Midwest Market). Net credit-related charge-offs of $46 million decreased $1 million from the comparable period in the prior year. Noninterest income of $87 million increased $1 million from the comparable prior year period, primarily due to nominal increases in other noninterest income categories, partially offset by a $4 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts. Noninterest expenses of $325 million increased $11 million from the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in allocated corporate overhead expenses ($7 million).  Wealth Management’s net income of $26 million increased $10 million in the six months ended June 30, 2011, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2010. Net interest income (FTE) of $92 million increased $5 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to increases in loan and deposit spreads. The provision for loan losses decreased $8 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting a decrease in the Midwest market. Net credit-related charge-offs of $19 million decreased $2 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in the Western market, partially offset by an increase in the Florida market. Noninterest income of $128 million increased $6 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a $3 million increase in investment banking fees and nominal increases in other noninterest income categories. Noninterest expenses of $155 million increased $2 million, primarily due to an increase in allocated corporate overhead expenses ($4 million).  The net loss for the Finance Division was $164 million in the six months ended June 30, 2011, compared to a net loss of $116 million in the six months ended June 30, 2010. Net interest expense (FTE) increased $74 million in the six months ended June 30, 2011, compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest expense (FTE) in the Finance Division is primarily impacted by the Corporation’s internal funds transfer methodology. The methodology is designed to centralize interest rate risk in the Finance Division and to measure profitability across all interest rate environments. To that end, the Finance Division pays the three major business segments for the long-   55    Table of Contents  term value of deposits based on their assumed lives. The three major business segments pay the Finance Division for funding based on the repricing and term characteristics of their loans. Noninterest income increased $1 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a $7 million increase in risk management hedge income, partially offset by a $2 million gain on the repurchase of subordinated debt in the first quarter 2010 and nominal decreases in other noninterest income categories. Noninterest expenses increased $2 million from the same period in the prior year primarily due to a $2 million increase in salaries expense.  The Other category’s net income decreased $10 million to a net loss of $1 million in the six months ended June 30, 2011, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2010. The decrease in net income primarily reflected a $5 million increase in principal investing and warrant income, more than offset by the $17 million after-tax discontinued operations gain recorded in the first quarter 2010.  Market Segments  The Corporation’s management accounting system also produces market segment results for the Corporation’s four primary geographic markets: Midwest, Western, Texas and Florida. In addition to the four primary geographic markets, Other Markets and International are also reported as market segments.

On an average basis, total assets increased $761 million in the second quarter 2011, compared to the fourth quarter 2010, resulting primarily from an increase in average interest-bearing deposits with banks of $1.6 billion, partially offset by a decrease in average total loans of $825 million to $39.2 billion.  The following tables show the change in average loans by business line and geographic market in the second quarter 2011, compared to the fourth quarter 2010.

These increases were more than offset by decreases in the Commercial Real Estate ($717 million), Mortgage Banker Finance ($487 million) (included in Specialty Businesses), National Dealer Services ($160 million) and Personal Financial Services ($109 million) business lines. Mortgage Banker Finance provides short-term financing to borrowers in the mortgage banking industry who originate and refinance residential mortgage loans which they subsequently sell in the secondary market (mortgage warehousing loans). Average loans in Mortgage Banker Finance, included in “Commercial Loans” on the consolidated balance sheets, declined 44 percent to $614 million at June 30, 2011, compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2010, primarily due to a decline in consumer refinance volumes during the three months ended June 30, 2011 compared to the fourth quarter 2010. The decrease in average loans in the National Dealer Services business line primarily reflected the impact of supply-chain disruptions related to the earthquake and tsunami in Japan in March 2011. Average loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line continued to decline, as the Corporation continued to work through the nonperforming portfolio and customers accessed external sources of long-term refinancing. By market, increases in average loans in the Texas ($436 million) and International ($145 million) markets were more than offset by decreases in Other Markets ($828 million), which included Mortgage Banker Finance, Western ($376 million) and Midwest ($168 million) markets.  Management expects average earning assets of approximately $52.5 billion for the second half of 2011, reflecting increases, primarily related to Sterling, in average loans and average investment securities available-for-sale, partially offset by a decrease in excess liquidity. The pace of decline of loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line is expected to decrease in the second half of 2011. Average loans in the National Dealer Services business line are expected to be lower in the third quarter and rebound in the fourth quarter of 2011.  Total liabilities increased $229 million to $48.1 billion at June 30, 2011, compared to December 31, 2010, primarily due to a $1.3 billion increase in total deposits, partially offset by a $932 million decrease in medium- and long-term debt. On an average basis, total liabilities increased $659 million in the second quarter 2011, compared to the fourth quarter 2010. Average core deposits, which exclude other time deposits and foreign office time deposits, were $41.1 billion for the second quarter 2011, compared to $39.9 billion for the fourth quarter 2010, primarily reflecting increases of $905 million in money market and NOW deposits and $179 million in noninterest-bearing deposits. Within average core deposits, increases from the fourth quarter 2010 to the second quarter 2011 were noted in the Global Corporate Banking ($550 million), Specialty Businesses ($550 million), Personal Banking ($420 million, and Private Banking ($248 million) business lines, partially offset by a decrease in the Middle Market business line ($552 million). By geographic market, average core deposits increased in all major markets in the second quarter 2011, compared to the fourth quarter 2010.  Capital  Total shareholders’ equity increased $245 million to $6.0 billion at June 30, 2011, compared to December 31, 2010.

(b) The Corporation made no repurchases of warrants under the repurchase program during the six months ended June 30, 2011.    (c) Maximum number of shares and warrants that may yet be purchased under the publicly announced plans or programs.  Management expects to continue the share repurchase program that, combined with dividend payments, results in a payout up to 50 percent of earnings for full-year 2011.  Risk-based regulatory capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in credit risk profiles among banking institutions and to account for off-balance sheet exposure. Assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with specified risk-weighting factors. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items. As shown in the table below, the Tier 1 common capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, Total risk-based capital and leverage ratios increased from December 31, 2010 to June 30, 2011. These increases were primarily due to a decrease in risk-weighted assets resulting from a decrease in loans, partially offset by an increase in interest-bearing deposits with banks, which carry a lower risk weight. The tangible common equity ratio increased 36 basis points primarily due to an increase in tangible common equity, reflecting an increase in retained earnings, partially offset by an increase in tangible assets.  In December 2009, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee) released proposed Basel III guidance on bank capital and liquidity. In September 2010, the Basel Committee proposed higher global minimum capital standards, including a minimum Tier 1 common capital ratio and additional capital and liquidity requirements, with rules expected to be implemented between 2013 and 2019. Adoption in the U.S. is expected to occur over a similar timeframe, but the final form of the U.S. rules is not yet certain. The Corporation believes that the expected impacts from changes in the components of capital and the calculation of risk-weighted assets would not be material. A higher degree of uncertainty exists regarding the implementation and interpretation of the liquidity rules. If subject to these rules, the Corporation expects the liquidity requirements to be manageable. While uncertainty exists in both the final form of the Basel III guidance and whether or not the Corporation will be required to adopt the guidelines, the Corporation is closely monitoring the development of the guidance.  The Corporation’s capital ratios exceeded minimum regulatory requirements as follows:                             June 30, 2011     December 31, 2010     (dollar amounts in millions)   Capital     Ratio     Capital     Ratio     Tier 1 common (a) (b)   $ 6,193       10.53 %    $ 6,027       10.13 %    Tier 1 risk-based (4.00% – minimum) (b)     6,193       10.53       6,027       10.13     Total risk-based (8.00% – minimum) (b)     8,705       14.81       8,651       14.54     Leverage (3.00% – minimum) (b)     6,193       11.39       6,027       11.26     Tangible common equity (a)     5,883       10.90       5,637       10.54                                                  (a) See Supplemental Financial Data section for reconcilements of non-GAAP financial measures.    (b) June 30, 2011 capital and ratios are estimated.    60    Table of Contents At June 30, 2011, the Corporation and its U.S. banking subsidiaries exceeded the ratios required for an institution to be considered “well capitalized” (Tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based capital and leverage ratios greater than six percent, 10 percent and five percent, respectively).  Risk Management  The following updated information should be read in conjunction with the “Risk Management” section on pages 38-60 in the Corporation’s 2010 Annual Report.  Credit Risk  Allowance for Credit Losses and Nonperforming Assets  The allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The allowance for loan losses represents management’s assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporation’s loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain loans and loan relationships, and allowances for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics for the remaining business and retail loans. The Corporation defines business loans as those belonging to the commercial, real estate construction, commercial mortgage, lease financing and international loan portfolios. Retail loans consist of traditional residential mortgage, home equity and other consumer loans.  The total allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb incurred losses inherent in the total loan portfolio. Unanticipated economic events, including political, economic and regulatory instability could cause changes in the credit characteristics of the portfolio and result in an unanticipated increase in the allowance. Inclusion of other industry-specific portfolio exposures in the allowance, as well as significant increases in the current portfolio exposures, could also increase the amount of the allowance. Any of these events, or some combination thereof, may result in the need for additional provision for loan losses in order to maintain an allowance that complies with credit risk and accounting policies. The allowance for loan losses was $806 million at June 30, 2011, compared to $901 million at December 31, 2010, a decrease of $95 million, or 11 percent. The decrease resulted primarily from improvements in credit quality, including a decline of $715 million in the Corporation’s watch list loans from December 31, 2010 to June 30, 2011, and a $1.0 billion decrease in loan balances from December 31, 2010 to June 30, 2011. The decrease in the allowance for loan losses primarily reflected decreases in the Commercial Real Estate (all markets) and Middle Market (primarily the Midwest and Other markets) business lines, partially offset by an increase in the Middle Market business line in the Western market. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total period-end loans was 2.06 percent at June 30, 2011, compared to 2.24 percent at December 31, 2010. Nonperforming loans of $974 million at June 30, 2011 decreased $149 million, compared to December 31, 2010. All large nonperforming loans are individually reviewed each quarter for potential charge-offs and reserves. Charge-offs are taken as amounts are determined to be uncollectible based on a qualitative assessment of the recoverability of the principal amount from collateral and other cash flow sources. A measure of the level of charge-offs already taken on nonperforming loans is the current book balance as a percentage of the contractual amount owed. At June 30, 2011, nonperforming loans were charged-off to 53 percent of the contractual amount, compared to 54 percent at December 31, 2010. This level of write-downs is consistent with losses experienced on loan defaults in the first six months of 2011 and in recent years. The allowance as a percentage of total nonperforming loans, a ratio which results from the actions noted above, was 83 percent at June 30, 2011, compared to 80 percent at December 31, 2010. The Corporation’s loan portfolio is primarily composed of business loans, which, in the event of default, are typically carried on the books at fair value as nonperforming assets for a longer period of time than are consumer loans, resulting in a lower nonperforming loan allowance coverage when compared to banking organizations with higher concentrations of consumer loans.  The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in “accrued expenses and other liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets, includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain letters of credit in a manner consistent with business loans, and allowances based on the pools of the remaining letters of credit and all unused commitments to extend credit within each internal risk rating. A probability of draw estimate is applied to the commitment amount, and the result is multiplied by standard reserve factors consistent with business loans. In general, the probability of draw for letters of credit is considered certain for all letters of credit supporting loans and for letters of credit assigned an internal risk rating generally consistent with regulatory defined substandard or doubtful. Other letters of credit and all unfunded commitments have a lower probability of draw.    61    Table of Contents The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $30 million at June 30, 2011, a decrease of $5 million from $35 million at December 31, 2010.  Nonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, loans which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans) and real estate which has been acquired through foreclosure and is awaiting disposition (foreclosed property). Nonperforming assets decreased $191 million to $1.0 billion at June 30, 2011, from $1.2 billion at December 31, 2010, and are summarized in the following table.

There were 27 loan relationships with balances greater than $2 million, totaling $163 million, transferred to nonaccrual status in the second quarter 2011, a decrease of $3 million from $166 million in the first quarter 2011. Of the transfers to nonaccrual in the second quarter 2011, $76 million were from the Middle Market business line, primarily in the Midwest and Western markets, and $29 million were from Commercial Real Estate business line, primarily in the Florida, Western and Other markets. There were four loan relationships greater than $10 million, totaling $57 million, transferred to nonaccrual in the second quarter 2011, including $45 million and $12 million to companies in the Middle Market and Specialty Businesses business lines, respectively.

(b) Consumer, excluding residential mortgage and certain personal purpose nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs, are included in the “Other” category.  Business loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when management determines that full collection of principal or interest is unlikely or when principal or interest payments are 90 days past due, unless the loan is fully collateralized and in the process of collection. The primary driver of when the principal amount of a business loan should be fully or partially charged off is based on a qualitative assessment of the recoverability of the principal amount from collateral and other cash flow sources. Residential mortgage and home equity loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status and charged off to current appraised values, less costs to sell, during the foreclosure process, normally no later than 180 days past due. Other consumer loans are generally not placed on nonaccrual status and are charged off at no later than 120 days past due, earlier if deemed uncollectible. Loan amounts in excess of probable future cash collections are charged off to an amount that management ultimately expects to collect. At the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, interest previously accrued but not collected is charged against current income. Income on such loans is then recognized only to the extent that cash is received and the future collection of principal is probable. Generally, a loan may be returned to accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest have been received and the Corporation expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest, or when the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. For a further discussion of impaired loans refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation’s 2010 Annual Report.  At June 30, 2011, troubled debt restructurings totaled $212 million, of which $141 million were included in nonperforming loans ($108 million nonaccrual loans and $33 million reduced-rate loans) and $71 million were included in performing loans. Performing restructured loans included $51 million of commercial loans (primarily in the Middle Market and Specialty Businesses business lines) and $20 million of commercial mortgage loans (primarily in the Middle Market business line) at June 30, 2011. At December 31, 2010, troubled debt restructurings totaled $165 million, including $44 million performing restructured loans, $78 million nonaccrual loans and $43 million reduced-rate loans. The $47 million increase in troubled debt restructurings was primarily due to increases in the Specialty Businesses and Middle Market business lines.  Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest generally represent loans that are well collateralized and in a continuing process that is expected to result in repayment or restoration to current status. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing increased $2 million, to $64 million at June 30, 2011, compared to $62 million at December 31, 2010 and are summarized in the following table. Loans past due 30-89 days increased $62 million to $343 million at June 30, 2011, compared to $281 million at December 31, 2010.    64    Table of Contents Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing are summarized in the following table.

(b) Primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate.  The Corporation limits risk inherent in its commercial real estate lending activities by limiting exposure to those borrowers directly involved in the commercial real estate markets and adhering to conservative policies on loan-to-value ratios for such loans. Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $11.3 billion at June 30, 2011, of which $3.3 billion, or 29 percent, were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to residential real estate investors and developers. The remaining $8.0 billion, or 71 percent, of commercial real estate loans in other business lines consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans.  The real estate construction portfolio totaled $1.7 billion at June 30, 2011. The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-time customers with satisfactory completion experience. However, the significant and sudden decline in residential real estate activity that began in late 2008 in the Western, Florida and Midwest markets proved extremely difficult for many of the smaller residential real estate developers. Of the $1.3 billion of real estate construction loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line, $137 million were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2011, including single family projects totaling $37 million (primarily in the Western and Florida markets), retail projects totaling $35 million (primarily in the Western and Florida markets), residential land development projects totaling $30 million (primarily in the Western market) and multi-use projects totaling $27 million (primarily in the Western market). Real estate construction loan net charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $14 million for the six months ended June 30, 2011, including $7 million from residential land development projects (primarily in the Western market) and $4 million from multi-use projects (primarily in the Western market).  The commercial mortgage loan portfolio totaled $9.6 billion at June 30, 2011 and included $1.9 billion in the Commercial Real Estate business line and $7.7 billion in other business lines. Of the $1.9 billion of commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line, $186 million were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2011, including retail projects totaling $55 million (primarily in the Midwest market), multi-family projects totaling $24 million (primarily in the Florida market), multi-use projects totaling $24 million (primarily in the Other market), single family projects totaling $21 million (primarily in the Other market) and medical office projects totaling $20 million in the Midwest market. Commercial mortgage loan net charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2011, primarily including net charge-offs of $4 million from multi-family projects (primarily in the Florida market) and $3 million from retail projects in the Midwest market.    66    Table of Contents The geographic distribution and project type of commercial real estate loans are important factors in diversifying credit risk within the portfolio.

The following table summarizes the Corporation’s residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolio by geographic market as of June 30, 2011.

Residential mortgages totaled $1.5 billion at June 30, 2011, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.5 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $60 million were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2011. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.6 billion at June 30, 2011, of which $1.4 billion was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit and $185 million consisted of closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.6 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $4 million were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2011. A substantial majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens.  The Corporation rarely originates residential real estate loans with a loan-to-value ratio above 100 percent at origination, has no sub-prime mortgage programs and does not originate payment-option adjustable-rate mortgages or other nontraditional mortgages that allow negative amortization. A significant majority of residential mortgage originations are sold in the secondary market. Since 2008, the Corporation has used a third party to originate, document and underwrite residential mortgage loans on behalf of the Corporation. Under this arrangement, the third party assumes any repurchase liability for the loans it originates. The Corporation has repurchase liability exposure for residential mortgage loans originated prior to 2008, however based on historical experience, the Corporation believes such exposure, which could be triggered by early payment defaults by borrowers or by underwriting discrepancies, is minimal. The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation’s primary geographic markets. The economic recession and significant declines in home values in the Western, Florida and Midwest markets following the financial market turmoil beginning in the fall of 2008 adversely impacted the residential real estate portfolio. At June 30, 2011, the Corporation estimated that, of the $15 million total residential mortgage loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest, approximately $2 million exceeded 90 percent of the current value of the underlying collateral, based on S&P/Case-Shiller home price indices. To account for this exposure, the Corporation factors changes in home values into estimated loss ratios for residential real estate loans, using index-based estimates by major metropolitan area, resulting in an increased allowance allocated for residential real estate loans when home values decline. Additionally, to mitigate increasing credit exposure due to depreciating home values, the Corporation periodically reviews home equity lines of credit and makes line reductions or converts outstanding balances at line maturity to closed-end, amortizing loans when necessary.  Shared National Credits  Shared National Credit (SNC) loans are facilities greater than $20 million shared by three or more federally supervised financial institutions that are reviewed annually by regulatory authorities at the agent bank level. The results of the 2011 SNC Exam were reflected in the second quarter 2011 credit metrics. The Corporation generally seeks to obtain ancillary business at the origination of a SNC relationship. Loans classified as SNC loans (approximately 900 borrowers at June 30, 2011) totaled $7.5 billion at June 30, 2011, compared to $7.3 billion at December 31, 2010. SNC net loan charge-offs totaled $13 million and $14 million for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011, respectively. SNC loans, diversified by both business line and geographic market, comprised approximately 19 percent and 18 percent of total loans at June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. SNC loans are held to the same credit underwriting standards as the remainder of the loan portfolio and face similar credit challenges.  Automotive Lending  Loans in the National Dealer Services business line include floor plan financing and other loans to automotive dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in “commercial loans” in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $1.5 billion at June 30, 2011, a decrease of $539 million compared to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2010, primarily reflecting the impact of supply chain disruptions caused by the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami in Japan in March 2011, as the significant majority of the decrease in floor plan loans was concentrated in automotive franchises selling Japanese-made vehicles. Other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $1.9 billion, including $1.4 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans, at both June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010. Automotive lending also includes loans to borrowers involved with automotive production, primarily Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers. Loans to borrowers involved with automotive production totaled approximately $1.0 billion at June 30, 2011, compared to $831 million at December 31, 2010.    68    Table of Contents State and Local Municipalities  In the normal course of business, the Corporation serves the needs of state and local municipalities in multiple capacities, including traditional banking products such as deposit services, loans and letters of credit, investment banking services such as bond underwriting and private placements, and by investing in municipal securities.  The following table summarizes the Corporation’s direct exposure to state and local municipalities as of June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010.

Additionally, the Corporation is exposed to Automated Clearing House (ACH) transaction risk for those municipalities utilizing this electronic payment and/or deposit method and similar products in their cash flow management. The Corporation sets limits on ACH activity during the underwriting process.  Extensions of credit to state and local municipalities are subjected to the same underwriting standards as other business loans. At June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, all outstanding municipal loans and leases were performing according to contractual terms and none were included in the Corporation’s internal watch list. Municipal leases are secured by the underlying equipment, and a substantial majority of the leases are fully defeased with AAA-rated U.S. government securities. Substantially all municipal investment securities available-for sale are auction-rate securities. All auction-rate securities are reviewed quarterly for other-than-temporary impairment. All auction-rate municipal securities were rated investment grade, and all auction-rate preferred securities collateralized by municipal securities were rated AAA or the equivalent and were adequately collateralized at both June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010. Municipal securities are held in the trading account for resale to customers. In addition, Comerica Securities, a broker-dealer subsidiary of Comerica Bank, underwrites bonds issued by municipalities. All bonds underwritten by Comerica Securities are sold to third party investors.  European Exposure  The Corporation does not hold any sovereign exposure to Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece or Spain. The Corporation’s international strategy as it pertains to Europe is to focus on European corporations doing business in North America, with an emphasis on the major geographic markets. Credit limits to banks domiciled in the aforementioned countries totaled less than $15 million at June 30, 2011. In addition, exposure to corporations in the aforementioned European countries was less than $125 million at June 30, 2011.  For further discussion of credit risk, see the “Credit Risk” section on pages 38-52 in the Corporation’s 2010 Annual Report.    69    Table of Contents Market and Liquidity Risk  Interest Rate Risk  Net interest income is the predominant source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises primarily through the Corporation’s core business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits. The Corporation’s balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by a combination of core deposits and wholesale borrowings. Approximately 80 percent of the Corporation’s loans were floating at June 30, 2011, of which approximately 70 percent were based on LIBOR and 30 percent were based on Prime. This creates a natural imbalance between the floating-rate loan portfolio and the more slowly repricing deposit products. The result is that growth and/or contraction in the Corporation’s core businesses will lead to sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing investment securities, primarily fixed-rate, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, and hedging the sensitivity with interest rate swaps. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk, with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.  The Corporation frequently evaluates net interest income under various balance sheet and interest rate scenarios, looking at both 12 and 24 month time horizons, using simulation modeling analysis as its principal risk management evaluation technique. The results of these analyses provide the information needed to assess the balance sheet structure. Changes in economic activity, whether domestic or international, different from those management included in its simulation analyses could translate into a materially different interest rate environment than currently expected. Management evaluates a base case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment and what is believed to be the most likely balance sheet structure. This base case net interest income is then evaluated against non-parallel interest rate scenarios that increase and decrease 200 basis points in a linear fashion from the base case over twelve months, resulting in an average change in interest rates of 100 basis points over the period. Due to the current low level of interest rates, the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of a 25 basis point drop, to zero percent. In addition, consistent with each interest rate scenario, adjustments to asset prepayment levels, yield curves, and overall balance sheet mix and growth assumptions are made. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model may not precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions and management strategies, among other factors. However, the model can indicate the likely direction of change. Existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes are included in these analyses, but no additional hedging is forecasted.  The table below, as of June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above. These results do not reflect the impact of the acquisition of Sterling. The Corporation expects the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates will not be materially different with the addition of Sterling.

The economic value of equity analysis begins with an estimate of the economic value of the financial assets and liabilities on the Corporation’s balance sheet, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period, and then applies the estimated impact of rate movements to the economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments. The economic value of equity is then calculated as the difference between the estimated market value of assets and liabilities net of the impact of off-balance sheet instruments. As with net interest income shocks, a variety of alternative scenarios are performed to measure the impact on economic value of equity, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve.    70    Table of Contents The table below, as of June 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from a 200 basis point immediate parallel increase or decrease in interest rates. Similar to the simulation analysis above, due to the current low level of interest rates, the economic value of equity analyses below reflect an interest rate scenario of an immediate 25 basis point drop, to zero percent, while the rising interest rate scenario reflects an immediate 200 basis point rise. The change in the sensitivity of the economic value of equity to a 200 basis point parallel increase in rates between December 31, 2010 and June 30, 2011 was primarily driven by changes in market interest rates, deposit mix, and the Corporation’s mortgage-backed securities portfolio’s forecasted prepayments.

Liquid assets, which totaled $8.8 billion at June 30, 2011, compared to $7.8 billion at December 31, 2010, provide a reservoir of liquidity. Liquid assets include cash and due from bank, federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell, interest-bearing deposits with banks, other short-term investments and unencumbered investment securities available-for-sale. At June 30, 2011, the Corporation held excess liquidity, represented by $2.4 billion deposited with the FRB, compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2010.  The Corporation may access the purchased funds market when necessary, which includes certificates of deposit issued to institutional investors in denominations in excess of $100,000 and to retail customers in denominations of less than $100,000 through brokers (“other time deposits” on the consolidated balance sheets), foreign office time deposits and short-term borrowings. Purchased funds totaled $435 million at June 30, 2011, compared to $562 million at December 31, 2010. Capacity for incremental purchased funds at June 30, 2011, consisted largely of federal funds purchased, brokered certificates of deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. In addition, the Corporation is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, Texas (FHLB), which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. The actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. As of June 30, 2011, the Corporation had $2.0 billion of outstanding borrowings from the FHLB with remaining maturities ranging from May 2013 to May 2014. The Corporation also maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and/or equity securities. Additionally, the Bank had the ability to issue up to $14 billion of debt at June 30, 2011 under an existing $15 billion medium-term senior note program which allows the issuance of debt with maturities between three months and 30 years.  Other Market Risks  Certain components of the Corporation’s noninterest income, primarily fiduciary income, are at risk to fluctuations in the market values of underlying assets, particularly equity and debt securities. Other components of noninterest income, primarily brokerage fees, are at risk to changes in the volume of market activity.  At June 30, 2011, the Corporation had a $16 million portfolio of investments in indirect private equity and venture capital funds, with commitments of $6 million to fund additional investments in future periods, compared to a portfolio of $47 million at December 31, 2010. During the six months ended June 30, 2011, the Corporation sold 49 funds for a total of $33 million and recognized a net gain of $2 million. The value of these investments is at risk to changes in equity markets, general economic conditions and a variety of other factors. The majority of these investments are not readily marketable and are included in “accrued income and other assets” on the consolidated balance sheets. The investments are individually reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value.  For further discussion of market risk, see Note 6 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements and pages 52-59 in the Corporation’s 2010 Annual Report.    71    Table of Contents The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act  On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Financial Reform Act”) was signed into law. The Financial Reform Act provides for, among other matters, increased regulatory supervision and examination of financial institutions, the imposition of more stringent capital requirements on financial institutions and increased regulation of derivatives and hedging transactions. Provided below is an overview of key elements of the Financial Reform Act relevant to the Corporation. Most of the provisions contained in the Financial Reform Act will be effective immediately upon enactment; however, many have delayed effective dates. Implementation of the Financial Reform Act will require many new mandatory and discretionary rules to be made by federal regulatory agencies over the next several years. The estimates of the impact on the Corporation discussed below are based on the limited information currently available and, given the uncertainty of the timing and scope of the impact, are subject to change until final rulemaking is complete.        •    Interest on Demand Deposits: Allows interest on commercial demand deposits, which could lead to increased cost of commercial demand deposits, depending on the interplay of interest, deposit credits and service charges.        •    Unlimited Deposit Insurance Extension: Provides unlimited deposit insurance on noninterest-bearing accounts from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2012. There will not be a separate assessment for unlimited deposit insurance coverage for this period.        •    Deposit Insurance: Changes the definition of assessment base from domestic deposits to net assets (average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity), increases the deposit insurance fund’s minimum reserve ratio and permanently increases general deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 to $250,000. The Corporation expects 2011 FDIC insurance expense to be lower than the 2010 expense.        •    Derivatives: Allows continued trading of foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives. Requires banks to shift energy, uncleared commodities and agriculture derivatives to a separately capitalized subsidiary within their holding company. Directly impacts client-driven energy derivatives business (approximately $1 million in annual revenue, based on full-year 2010).        •    Interchange Fee: Limits debit card transaction processing fees that card issuers can charge to merchants. Based on the final Federal Reserve Board rules, estimated annual revenue from debit card PIN and signature-based interchange fees in 2011 is expected to decrease by approximately $4 million, compared to full-year 2010.        •    Trust Preferred Securities: Prohibits holding companies with more than $15 billion in assets from including trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital, and allows for a phase-in period of three years, beginning January 1, 2013. As of June 30, 2011, the Corporation had no outstanding trust preferred securities.  Critical Accounting Policies  The Corporation’s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation’s 2010 Annual Report. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation’s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2010, the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to allowance for credit losses, valuation methodologies, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages 60-68 in the Corporation’s 2010 Annual Report. As of the date of this report, the Corporation does not believe that there has been a material change in the nature or categories of the critical accounting policies or estimates and assumptions from those discussed in the Corporation’s 2010 Annual Report.    72    Table of Contents Supplemental Financial Data  The following tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this financial review with financial measures defined by GAAP.

(b) Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as defined by regulation.    (c) June 30, 2011 Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets are estimated.  The net interest margin (FTE), excluding excess liquidity, removes interest earned on balances deposited with the FRB from net interest income (FTE) and average balances deposited with the FRB from average earning assets from the numerator and denominator of the net interest margin (FTE) ratio, respectively. The Corporation believes this measurement provides meaningful information to investors, regulators, management and others of the impact on net interest income and net interest margin resulting from the Corporation’s short-term investment in low yielding instruments.  The Tier 1 common capital ratio removes preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations. The tangible common equity ratio removes preferred stock and the effect of intangible assets from capital and the effect of intangible assets from total assets. The Corporation believes these measurements are meaningful measures of capital adequacy used by investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and to compare against other companies in the industry.    73    Table of Contents   ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  Quantitative and qualitative disclosures for the current period can be found in the “Market and Liquidity Risk” section of “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”      ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures       (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Corporation maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Corporation’s management, including the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management has evaluated, with the participation of the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report (the “Evaluation Date”). Based on the evaluation, the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.      (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. During the period to which this report relates, there have not been any changes in the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, such controls.  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION      ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings  For information regarding the Corporation’s legal proceedings, see “Part I. Item 1. Note 13 – Contingent Liabilities,” which is incorporated herein by reference.      ITEM 1A. Risk Factors  Other than as set forth below, there has been no material change in the Corporation’s risk factors as previously disclosed in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2010 in response to Part I, Item 1A. of such Form 10-K. Such risk factors are incorporated herein by reference.  Below we amend the following risk factor discussed in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010:  General political, economic or industry conditions, either domestically or internationally, may be less favorable than expected.  Local, domestic, and international economic, political and industry specific conditions affect the financial services industry, directly and indirectly. Conditions such as or related to inflation, recession, unemployment, volatile interest rates, international conflicts and other factors, such as real estate values, energy costs, fuel prices, state and local municipal budget deficits and government spending and the U.S. national debt, outside of our control may, directly and indirectly, adversely affect Comerica. As has been the case with the impact of recent economic conditions, economic downturns could result in the delinquency of outstanding loans, which could have a material adverse impact on Comerica’s earnings.
