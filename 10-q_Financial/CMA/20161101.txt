Excluding the after-tax impact of the third quarter 2016 restructuring charges associated with the Corporation's efficiency and revenue initiative ("GEAR Up") of $13 million, or $0.08 per share, net income increased $26 million, primarily reflecting an increase in net interest income and a lower provision for credit losses. Net income per diluted common share was $0.84 and $0.74 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and average diluted common shares were 176 million and 181 million for each respective period. More information regarding GEAR Up is provided under the "Growth in Efficiency and Revenue Initiative" subheading below.Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $313 million, a decrease of $92 million from $405 million reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding the after-tax impact of 2016 GEAR Up restructuring charges of $46 million, or $0.27 per share, net income decreased $46 million, primarily reflecting an increase in the provision for credit losses and a benefit to the prior year from a net release of litigation reserves, partially offset by an increase in net interest income. Net income per diluted common share was $1.76 and $2.20 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Average diluted common shares were 176 million and 182 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.Growth in Efficiency and Revenue InitiativeThe Corporation recently announced additional GEAR Up actions that are expected to add approximately $40 million of additional savings to the target. The GEAR Up initiative now includes expected pre-tax benefits, before restructuring charges, of approximately $180 million in full-year 2017 and $270 million in full-year 2018. Additional initiatives include a new retirement program for most employees that will replace the current pension plan and retirement account plan, effective January 1, 2017. Active pension plan participants age 60 or older as of December 31, 2016 and current retirees will not be impacted. Based on current actuarial assumptions, this initiative is expected to reduce full-year 2016 pension expense from $14 million to $7 million, resulting in a $4 million benefit in the fourth quarter 2016, and generate annual savings of approximately $35 million in full-year 2017, relative to 2016 expected retirement expense prior to the change. For further information concerning the Corporation's retirement benefit plans, refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.•Expense reductions are expected to save approximately $25 million in the fourth quarter 2016, approximately $150 million in full-year 2017, and approximately $200 million in full-year 2018. This is to be achieved through a reduction in workforce, the new retirement program discussed above, streamlining operational processes, real estate optimization including consolidating banking centers as well as reducing office and operations space, selective outsourcing of technology functions and reduction of technology system applications.◦As a result of GEAR Up, the Corporation announced the consolidation of 38 banking centers, of which 19 will be consolidated by the end of 2016 and the remainder before the end of the second quarter 2017. Approximately 30 percent of managerial positions have been removed and nearly 700 employees have been notified that their positions are being eliminated. •Revenue enhancements are expected to gradually ramp-up to approximately $30 million in full-year 2017, gradually increasing to approximately $70 million in full-year 2018, through expanded product offerings, enhanced sales tools and training and improved customer analytics to drive opportunities.•Pre-tax restructuring charges of $140 million to $160 million in total are expected to be incurred through 2018, including an estimated $103 million to $108 million by year-end 2016. Restructuring charges totaling $73 million were incurred through September 30, 2016. For additional information regarding restructuring charges, refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.Fourth Quarter 2016 Outlook Compared to Third Quarter 2016Management expectations for fourth quarter 2016 compared to third quarter 2016, assuming a continuation of the current economic and low-rate environment, are as follows:•Average loans stable, reflecting growth in National Dealer Services, Technology and Life Sciences and small increases in several other lines of business, offset by seasonality in Mortgage Banker and a continued decline in Energy.•Net interest income slightly higher, reflecting benefits from a decline in wholesale funding costs and an increase in LIBOR.•Provision for credit losses expected to remain low, with net charge-offs below historical norms. Provision and net charge-offs expected to be between second quarter 2016 and third quarter 2016 levels.•Noninterest income relatively stable, excluding income from bank-owned life insurance and deferred compensation asset returns, with fee income expected to remain strong at third quarter 2016 levels.•Noninterest expenses lower, excluding an estimated $30 million to $35 million in restructuring expense, with GEAR Up expense savings of approximately $25 million, primarily salaries and benefits (including pension); seasonal increases in 37Table of Contentsoutside processing, marketing and occupancy expected to be partially offset by third quarter 2016 level of deferred compensation expense not expected to repeat.•Income tax expense to approximate 30 percent of pre-tax income.Net Interest IncomeThe "Quarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume" table that follows provides an analysis of net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and details the components of the change in net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year.Quarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 September 30, 2015(dollar amounts in millions)AverageBalanceInterestAverageRate (a) AverageBalanceInterestAverageRate (a)Commercial loans$31,132$2533.25% $31,900$2433.04%Real estate construction loans2,646243.57 1,833163.47Commercial mortgage loans9,012783.43 8,691743.39Lease financing66253.30 78863.16International loans1,349123.56 1,401133.51Residential mortgage loans1,883183.74 1,882183.79Consumer loans2,522213.31 2,477203.21Total loans49,2064113.33 48,9723903.17        Mortgage-backed securities (b)9,359502.17 9,099502.21Other investment securities3,014111.51 1,13341.26Total investment securities (b)12,373612.01 10,232542.11        Interest-bearing deposits with banks5,96780.51 6,86940.25Other short-term investments102—0.43 118—0.82Total earning assets67,6484802.84 66,1914482.70        Cash and due from banks1,152   1,095  Allowance for loan losses(749)   (628)  Accrued income and other assets4,858   4,675  Total assets$72,909   $71,333          Money market and interest-bearing checking deposits$22,41570.12 $24,29870.11Savings deposits2,042—0.03 1,860—0.02Customer certificates of deposit3,12930.40 4,23240.37Foreign office time deposits25—0.37 127—0.70Total interest-bearing deposits27,611100.14 30,517110.14Short-term borrowings17—0.47 91—0.04Medium- and long-term debt5,907201.36 3,175151.85Total interest-bearing sources33,535300.36 33,783260.30        Noninterest-bearing deposits30,454   28,623  Accrued expenses and other liabilities1,243   1,368  Total shareholders’ equity7,677   7,559  Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity$72,909   $71,333          Net interest income/rate spread $4502.48  $4222.40        Impact of net noninterest-bearing sources of funds  0.18   0.14Net interest margin (as a percentage of average earning assets)  2.66%   2.54%(a)Fully taxable equivalent.(b)Includes investment securities available-for-sale and investment securities held-to-maturity.38Table of ContentsQuarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume (continued) Three Months Ended September 30, 2016/September 30, 2015(in millions)Increase(Decrease)Due to RateIncrease(Decrease)Due to Volume (a)NetIncrease(Decrease)Interest Income:      Loans$18 $3 $21 Investment securities (b)— 7 7 Interest-bearing deposits with banks5 (1) 4 Total interest income23 9 32 Interest Expense:      Interest-bearing deposits1 (2) (1) Medium- and long-term debt3 2 5 Total interest expense4 — 4 Net interest income$19 $9 $28 (a)Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume.(b)Includes investment securities available-for-sale and investment securities held-to-maturity.Net interest income was $450 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $28 million compared to $422 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net interest income resulted primarily from the impact of higher yields on loans and Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) deposits, reflecting the benefit from the December 2015 short-term rate increase and increases in LIBOR rates, a larger investment securities portfolio and loan growth, partially offset by higher funding costs, primarily the result of higher costs on variable-rate debt tied to LIBOR rates and new Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings in the second quarter 2016. Average earning assets increased $1.4 billion, or 2 percent, to $67.6 billion, compared to $66.2 billion for the same period in 2015. The increase in average earning assets primarily reflected increases of $2.1 billion in average investment securities and $234 million in average loans, partially offset by a decrease of $902 million in average FRB deposits, included in "interest-bearing deposits with banks" on the consolidated balance sheets. The net interest margin (FTE) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased 12 basis points to 2.66 percent, from 2.54 percent for the comparable period in 2015, primarily from higher yields on loans and the reinvestment of FRB deposits into higher yielding Treasury securities, partially offset by the impact of higher funding costs. The increase in loan yields primarily reflected the benefit from the increase in short-term rates, partially offset by the impact of a higher level of nonaccrual loans in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in the prior year.39Table of ContentsYear-to-Date Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 September 30, 2015(dollar amounts in millions)AverageBalanceInterestAverageRate (a) AverageBalanceInterestAverageRate (a)Commercial loans$31,152$7533.24% $31,596$7183.05%Real estate construction loans2,397653.61 1,859483.44Commercial mortgage loans9,0022363.50 8,6482203.40Lease financing706152.86 793193.13International loans1,388383.61 1,455393.63Residential mortgage loans1,885543.81 1,872533.78Consumer loans2,493623.34 2,432593.23Total loans49,0231,2233.34 48,6551,1563.19        Mortgage-backed securities (b)9,3471522.20 9,0761512.23Other investment securities3,008331.50 95091.18Total investment securities (b)12,3551852.03 10,0261602.13        Interest-bearing deposits with banks4,313160.50 5,774110.25Other short-term investments10510.65 106—0.78Total earning assets65,7961,4252.90 64,5611,3272.76        Cash and due from banks1,098   1,054  Allowance for loan losses(726)   (614)  Accrued income and other assets4,774   4,687  Total assets$70,942   $69,688          Money market and interest-bearing checking deposits$22,797200.11 $23,973200.11Savings deposits1,996—0.02 1,827—0.02Customer certificates of deposit3,308100.40 4,359120.37Foreign office and other time deposits35—0.34 12311.13Total interest-bearing deposits28,136300.14 30,282330.14Short-term borrowings180—0.45 93—0.05Medium- and long-term debt4,695531.51 2,843381.80Total interest-bearing sources33,011830.33 33,218710.28        Noninterest-bearing deposits28,966   27,569  Accrued expenses and other liabilities1,311   1,393  Total shareholders’ equity7,654   7,508  Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity$70,942   $69,688          Net interest income/rate spread $1,3422.57  $1,2562.48        Impact of net noninterest-bearing sources of funds  0.17   0.13Net interest margin (as a percentage of average earning assets  2.74%   2.61%(a)Fully taxable equivalent.(b)Includes investment securities available-for-sale and investment securities held-to-maturity.40Table of ContentsYear-to-Date Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016/September 30, 2015(in millions)Increase(Decrease)Due to RateIncrease(Decrease)Due to Volume (a)NetIncrease(Decrease)Interest Income:      Loans$55 $12 $67 Investment securities (b)— 25 25 Interest-bearing deposits with banks11 (5) 6 Total interest income66 32 98 Interest Expense:      Interest-bearing deposits1 (4) (3) Medium- and long-term debt6 9 15 Total interest expense7 5 12 Net interest income$59 $27 $86 (a)Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume.(b)Includes investment securities available-for-sale and investment securities held-to-maturity.Net interest income was $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $86 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net interest income resulted primarily from the same reasons as described in the quarterly discussion above, as well as the benefit of one additional day in 2016. Average earning assets increased $1.2 billion, or 2 percent, to $65.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $64.6 billion for the same period in 2015. The increase in average earning assets primarily reflected increases of $2.3 billion in average investment securities and $368 million in average loans, partially offset by a decrease of $1.5 billion in average FRB deposits. The net interest margin (FTE) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased 13 basis points to 2.74 percent, from 2.61 percent for the comparable period in 2015, primarily the result of the same reasons as described in the quarterly discussion aboveFor further discussion of the effects of market rates on net interest income, refer to the "Market and Liquidity Risk" section of this financial review.Provision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses was $16 million and $26 million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $213 million and $87 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The provision for credit losses includes both the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments.The provision for loan losses is recorded to maintain the allowance for loan losses at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio. The provision for loan losses was $14 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $28 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in the provision primarily reflected decreases in Technology and Life Sciences and, to a lesser extent, Energy. The provision for loan losses was $202 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $123 million compared to $79 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in the provision was primarily driven by Energy and, to a lesser extent, general Middle Market and Small Business, partially offset by a lower provision for Technology and Life Sciences.Net loan charge-offs in the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $7 million to $16 million, or 0.13 percent of average total loans, compared to $23 million, or 0.19 percent, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in net loan charge-offs primarily reflected decreases in Technology and Life Sciences and general Middle Market, partially offset by increases in Energy and Corporate Banking. Net loan charge-offs in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $61 million to $110 million, or 0.30 percent of average total loans, compared to $49 million, or 0.14 percent, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding Energy, net loan charge-offs in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $35 million, or 0.15 percent of average total loans. The increase in net loan charge-offs primarily reflected increases in Energy and Private Banking, partially offset by decreases in general Middle Market and Technology and Life Sciences. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments is recorded to maintain the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a benefit of $2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2015. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $11 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $8 million for the same period in 2015. There were no lending-related commitment charge-offs for both the three-month periods 41Table of Contentsended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and charge-offs of $11 million and $1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The lending-related commitment charge-offs of $11 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were the result of sales of Corporate Banking and Energy unfunded commitments.For further information regarding energy and energy-related loans, refer to the "Energy Lending" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review. An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets is presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.Noninterest Income Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,(in millions)2016 2015 2016 2015Card fees76 71 224 203Service charges on deposit accounts$55 $57 $165 $168Fiduciary income47 47 142 142Commercial lending fees26 22 68 69Letter of credit fees12 13 38 39Bank-owned life insurance12 10 30 29Foreign exchange income10 10 31 29Brokerage fees5 5 14 13Net securities losses — — (3) (2)Other noninterest income (a)29 25 75 79Total noninterest income$272 $260 $784 $769(a)The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income.Noninterest income increased $12 million to $272 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $260 million for the same period in 2015, primarily reflecting increases in card fees, due to volume-driven increases from merchant payment processing services and government card programs, and commercial lending fees, largely due to an increase in syndication agent fees. The increase in other noninterest income (refer to the table below) was primarily the result of an increase in deferred compensation asset returns (which offsets an increase in deferred compensation plan expense included in noninterest expenses).Noninterest income increased $15 million to $784 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $769 million for the same period in 2015, primarily due to an increase in card fees, partially offset by decreases in other noninterest income and service charges on deposit accounts. The increase in card fees was largely for the same reasons as described in the quarterly discussion above. The decrease in other noninterest income (refer to table below) primarily reflected decreases in investment banking fees and income from unconsolidated subsidiaries, partially offset by an increase in deferred compensation asset returns. The decrease in income from unconsolidated subsidiaries primarily reflected the termination of a joint venture with a payment processor in the second quarter 2015 and was more than offset by the increase in merchant payment processing services revenue included in card fees.The following table illustrates certain categories included in "other noninterest income" on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

Changes in income earned on deferred compensation assets are substantially offset by changes in deferred compensation plan expense.42Table of ContentsNoninterest Expenses Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,(in millions)2016 2015 2016 2015Salaries and benefits expense$247 $243 $742 $747Outside processing fee expense86 83 247 239Net occupancy expense40 41 117 118Equipment expense13 13 40 39Restructuring charges20 — 73 —Software expense31 26 90 73FDIC insurance expense14 9 39 27Advertising expense5 6 15 17Litigation-related expense— (3) — (32)Other noninterest expenses37 39 106 117Total noninterest expenses$493 $457 $1,469 $1,345Noninterest expenses increased $36 million to $493 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $457 million for the same period in 2015. Noninterest expenses increased $16 million excluding the third quarter 2016 restructuring charges of $20 million. The remaining increase primarily reflected increases in technology-related software expense, FDIC insurance premiums and salaries and benefits expense. The increase in salaries and benefits expense of $4 million primarily reflected an increase in deferred compensation plan expense (offset by an increase in deferred compensation asset returns included in noninterest income).Noninterest expenses increased $124 million to $1.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1.3 billion for the same period in 2015. Noninterest expenses increased $51 million excluding 2016 restructuring charges of $73 million. The remaining increase primarily reflected the benefit to 2015 from a $32 million net release of litigation reserves, increases in technology-related software expense, FDIC insurance premiums, and higher outside processing fee expense related to revenue generating activities, partially offset by a $6 million increase in benefit from the sales of leased assets included in other noninterest expenses and a decrease in salaries and benefits expense. The $5 million decrease in salaries and benefits expense primarily reflected a decrease in pension expense, partially offset by an increase in regular salaries, mostly due to the impact of merit increases and one more day in 2016, and an increase in deferred compensation plan expense.For further information about restructuring charges associated with the GEAR Up initiative, see Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Provision for Income TaxesThe provision for income taxes was $64 million and $63 million for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $131 million and $188 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The provision for income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2016 included a benefit of $4 million from the early termination of certain leveraged lease transactions. The provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included a benefit of $9 million from the early termination of certain leveraged lease transactions as well as a $4 million charge related to certain tax reserves. STRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESSThe Corporation's management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. These methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines. Restructuring charges associated with the GEAR Up initiative were assigned to the segments based on the Corporation's segment reporting methodology, which is described in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report.Effective January 1, 2016, in conjunction with the effective date for regulatory Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) requirements, the Corporation prospectively implemented an additional funds transfer pricing (FTP) charge, primarily for the cost of maintaining liquid assets to support potential draws on unfunded loan commitments and for the long-term economic cost of holding collateral for secured deposits. Business SegmentsThe Corporation's operations are strategically aligned into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based upon the products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, Finance is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes items not directly associated with these business segments or the Finance segment. The performance of the business segments is not comparable 43Table of Contentswith the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of these business segments for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.The following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.

Net interest income of $1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $40 million compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting an increase in net funds transfer pricing (FTP) charges, partially offset by an increase in loan yields, the benefit provided by a $176 million increase in average loans and one additional day in 2016. The increase in net FTP charges primarily reflected an increase in the cost of funds due to the increase in short-term market rates, lower funding credits due to a $1.4 billion decrease in average deposits, and the new 2016 FTP charges for LCR as described above. The provision for credit losses increased $84 million to $200 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in the provision primarily reflected the increased reserves for energy and energy-related loans. To a lesser extent, general Middle Market and Corporate Banking contributed to the increase in the provision. These increases were partially offset by improvements in credit quality in the remainder of the portfolio. Net credit-related charge-offs of $113 million increased $58 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting increases in Energy, partially offset by decreases in in general Middle Market and Technology and Life Sciences. Noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was unchanged from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting decreases of $5 million in investment banking fees, $5 million in income from unconsolidated subsidiaries (largely related to the exit in the second quarter 2015 from a joint venture that provided merchant payment processing services), and small decreases in several other categories of noninterest income, offset by a $15 million increase in card fees. Noninterest expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $72 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Excluding restructuring charges of $36 million and the impact of a $30 million net release of litigation reserves in second quarter 2015, noninterest expenses remained stable, primarily reflecting a $15 million increase in allocated corporate expenses, largely due to increased technology expenses, and higher FDIC insurance expense, partially offset by the benefit from a $6 million increase in gains from the sales of leased assets, lower salaries and benefits expense and smaller decreases in several other categories of noninterest expense.

The FTP benefit provided by a $55 million increase in average deposits was more than offset by a lower deposit crediting rate. The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a benefit of $13 million for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the benefit to the prior year from net loan recoveries in Private Banking. Net credit-related charge-offs were $2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to net loan recoveries of $8 million in the same period for the prior year.

These stress tests are a normal part of the Corporation's overall risk management and capital planning process and are part of the forecasting process used by the Corporation to conduct the enterprise-wide stress test that was part of the Federal Reserve's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). For additional information about risk management processes, refer to the "Risk Management" sections of this financial review and the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report.The Federal Reserve completed its 2016 CCAR review in June 2016 and did not object to the Corporation's 2016/2017 capital plan and capital distributions contemplated in the plan for the period ending June 30, 2017. The plan includes equity repurchases of up to $440 million for the four-quarter period commencing in the third quarter 2016 and ending in the second quarter 2017. In the third quarter 2016, the Corporation's repurchases under the equity repurchase program totaled $97 million. The timing and ultimate amount of future equity repurchases will be subject to various factors, including the Corporation's overall capital position, financial performance and market conditions, including interest rates. Restructuring charges associated with the GEAR Up initiative are not expected to impact the pace of repurchases.  On April 26, 2016 the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the Board) approved a 1-cent increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.22 per share, and on July 26, 2016, the Board further increased the quarterly dividend to $0.23 per share. Also on July 26, 2016 the Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 10.0 million shares of Comerica Incorporated outstanding common stock, in addition to the 5.7 million shares remaining at June 30, 2016 under the Board's prior authorizations for the equity repurchase program initially approved in November 2010. Including the July 26, 2016 authorization, a total of 50.3 million shares and 14.1 million warrants (12.1 million share-equivalents) have been authorized for repurchase under the equity repurchase program since its inception in 2010.

The allowance for loan losses represents management's assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporation's loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in "accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets, provides for probable losses inherent in lending-related commitments, including unused commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.50Table of ContentsU.S. economic data for the third quarter of 2016 was consistent with an ongoing moderate expansion, following weaker Gross Domestic Product growth through the first half of the year. Job growth and employment rates continued to improve. Energy price levels remained stable. Looking ahead, the Corporation expects the U.S economy to continue to expand at a moderate pace through the end of 2016 and into 2017. The allowance for loan losses was $727 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $634 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $93 million, or 15 percent. The increase in the allowance for loan losses resulted primarily from a significant increase in reserves for energy and energy-related loans, partially offset by improved credit quality in the remainder of the portfolio. The increase in reserves for energy and energy-related loans reflected additional negative migration into criticized loans, primarily in the first quarter 2016, due to the deteriorating financial condition and increasing leverage of these borrowers, as well as an increased loss estimate in the event of default. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain letters of credit in a manner consistent with business loans, and allowances based on the pool of the remaining letters of credit and all unused commitments to extend credit within each internal risk rating. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $45 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.For additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses, refer to page F-40 in the "Critical Accounting Policies" section and pages F-56 through F-58 in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report. For additional information regarding energy and energy-related exposures, refer to "Energy Lending" subheading later in this section.Nonperforming AssetsNonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, troubled debt restructured loans (TDRs) which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans) and foreclosed property. TDRs include performing and nonperforming loans. Nonperforming TDRs are either on nonaccrual or reduced-rate status.

Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $11.8 billion at September 30, 2016, of which $4.6 billion, or 39 percent, were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to real estate developers, an increase of $782 million compared to December 31, 2015. The growth in Commercial Real Estate primarily reflected construction draws and term financing, mainly with existing customers who are proven developers, on projects with favorable risk characteristics (predominantly multifamily projects located in California and Texas). The remaining $7.2 billion, or 61 percent, of commercial real estate loans in other business lines consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages, which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans. In the Texas market, commercial real estate loans totaled $3.1 billion at September 30, 2016, of which $1.7 billion were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line. Substantially all of the remaining $1.4 billion were owner-occupied commercial mortgages. Loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line secured by properties located in Texas totaled $1.4 billion at September 30, 2016, primarily including $899 million for multifamily properties and $225 million for retail properties. No loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line that were secured by properties located in Texas were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2016.The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-tenured customers with satisfactory completion experience. Credit quality in the real estate construction loan portfolio remained strong, with no loans on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2016 compared to $1 million at December 31, 2015, and no real estate construction loan charge-offs in either of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Of the $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion of commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line outstanding at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, $8 million and $16 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Commercial mortgage loan net recoveries in the Commercial Real Estate business line were $10 million and $3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In other business lines, $36 million and $44 million of commercial mortgage loans were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Commercial mortgage loan net recoveries in other business lines were $5 million and $3 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.Residential Real Estate LendingThe following table summarizes the Corporation's residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios by geographic market.

Residential mortgages totaled $1.9 billion at September 30, 2016, and were primarily larger, 54Table of Contentsvariable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.9 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $23 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2016. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.8 billion at September 30, 2016, of which $1.7 billion was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit, $132 million were on amortizing status and $44 million were closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.8 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $27 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2016. A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at September 30, 2016. The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation's primary geographic markets. Substantially all residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more are placed on nonaccrual status, and substantially all junior lien home equity loans that are current or less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status if full collection of the senior position is in doubt. At no later than 180 days past due, such loans are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell.Energy LendingThe Corporation has a portfolio of energy and energy-related loans that are included primarily in "commercial loans" in the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation has over 30 years of experience in energy lending, with a focus on middle market companies in the oil and gas business. Customers in the Corporation's Energy business line (approximately 200 relationships) are engaged in three segments of the oil and gas business: exploration and production (E&P) (72 percent), midstream (14 percent) and energy services (14 percent). E&P generally includes such activities as searching for potential oil and gas fields, drilling exploratory wells and operating active wells. Commitments to E&P borrowers are subject to semi-annual borrowing base re-determinations based on a variety of factors including updated pricing (reflecting market and competitive conditions), energy reserve levels and the impact of hedging. The midstream sector is generally involved in the transportation, storage and marketing of crude and/or refined oil and gas products. The Corporation's energy services customers provide products and services primarily to the E&P segment. About 95 percent of the loans in the Energy business line are Shared National Credits (SNC), which are facilities greater than $20 million shared by three or more federally supervised institutions, reflecting the Corporation's focus on larger middle market companies that have financing needs that generally exceed internal individual borrower credit risk limits. The Corporation seeks to develop full relationships with SNC borrowers. In addition to oil and gas loans in the Energy business line, the Corporation is monitoring a portfolio of loans in other lines of business to companies that have a sizable portion of their revenue related to oil and gas or could be otherwise disproportionately negatively impacted by prolonged lower oil and gas prices ("energy-related"), primarily in general Middle Market, Corporate Banking, Small Business, and Technology and Life Sciences. These companies include downstream businesses such as refineries and petrochemical companies, companies that sell products to E&P, midstream and energy services companies, companies involved in developing new technologies for the oil and gas industry, and other similar businesses.The following table summarizes information about the Corporation's portfolio of energy and energy-related loans.

Total exposure, including unused commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, was $5.0 billion and $6.1 billion at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The decrease in total exposure in the Energy business line primarily reflected reduced borrowing bases as a result of the spring re-determinations for E&P borrowers, resulting in about a 22 percent average reduction in total commitment for the portion reviewed, while the decrease in outstandings largely reflected energy customers taking actions to adjust their cash flow and reduce their bank debt. Energy-related outstandings were approximately $420 million at September 30, 2016 (approximately 90 relationships), a decrease of $204 million, or 33 percent, compared to December 31, 2015.Criticized energy and energy-related loans increased $259 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase in criticized loans largely reflected additional negative migration due to the deteriorating financial condition and increasing leverage of these borrowers. Energy and energy-related loans on nonaccrual status increased $274 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, to $435 million at September 30, 2016. These metrics reflect results of the SNC exam issued in early October 2016. Energy and energy-related net credit-related charge-offs totaled $13 million and $91 million for the three- and nine-55Table of Contentsmonth periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to net charge-offs of $9 million and $13 million for the same periods in 2015. Net credit-related charge-offs of $91 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included $20 million from E&P, $9 million from midstream, $51 million from energy services and $11 million from the energy-related portfolio. Substantially all of the net charge-offs during the same period 2015 were from the energy-related portfolio.The Corporation's allowance methodology carefully considers the various risk elements within the loan portfolio. At September 30, 2016, the reserve allocation for energy and energy-related loans exceeded 8 percent of total energy and energy-related loans. The reserve allocation for energy and energy-related loans appropriately incorporated the changing dynamics in energy and energy-related loans described above, including, but not limited to, migration in the portfolio and the value of collateral considered in determining estimated loss given default. The Corporation continued to incorporate a qualitative reserve component for energy and energy-related loans at September 30, 2016. Refer to the “Allowance for Credit Losses” subheading earlier in this section for a discussion of changes in the allowance for loan losses as a result of the above-described events.Automotive LendingSubstantially all dealer loans are in the National Dealer Services business line. Loans in the National Dealer Services business line include floor plan financing and other loans to automotive dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in “commercial loans” in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $3.8 billion at September 30, 2016, a decrease of $124 million compared to $3.9 billion at December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, including $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Automotive lending also includes loans to borrowers involved with automotive production, primarily Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers. Loans to borrowers involved with automotive production totaled approximately $1.3 billion at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.International ExposureInternational assets are subject to general risks inherent in the conduct of business in foreign countries, including economic uncertainties and each foreign government's regulations. Risk management practices minimize the risk inherent in international lending arrangements. These practices include structuring bilateral agreements or participating in bank facilities, which secure repayment from sources external to the borrower's country. Accordingly, such international outstandings are excluded from the cross-border risk of that country.The Corporation's international strategy is to focus on international companies doing business in North America, with an emphasis on the Corporation's primary geographic markets. The following table summarizes cross-border exposure to entities domiciled in European countries at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.(in millions) September 30, 2016 December 31, 2015European exposure:    Commercial and industrial $276 $285Banks and other financial institutions 5 35Total outstanding 281 320Unfunded commitments and guarantees 371 456Total European exposure (a) $652 $776(a)Primarily United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The Corporation had no exposure to Greece, Portugal or Ireland at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.For further discussion of credit risk, see the "Credit Risk" section of pages F-24 through F-33 in the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report.Market and Liquidity RiskMarket risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse movements in market rates or prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and commodity and equity prices. Liquidity risk represents the failure to meet financial obligations coming due resulting from an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding, and the inability to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significant changes in pricing, due to inadequate market depth or market disruptions.The Asset and Liability Policy Committee (ALCO) of the Corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities. ALCO meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies, and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit gathering and risk management. The Treasury Department 56Table of Contentsmitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of ALCO through the actions it takes to manage the Corporation's market, liquidity and capital positions.Market Risk Analytics, within the Office of Enterprise Risk, supports ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk and coordinating all other market risks. Key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analysis of the Corporation's balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks; (ii) monitoring and reporting of the Corporation's positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines; (iii) developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions; (iv) reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval; (v) monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market risks; and (vi) developing and monitoring the interest rate risk economic capital estimate.Interest Rate RiskNet interest income is the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities, primarily through the Corporation's core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by a combination of core deposits and wholesale borrowings. Approximately 90 percent of the Corporation's loans were floating at September 30, 2016, of which approximately 80 percent were based on LIBOR and 20 percent were based on Prime. This creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the floating-rate loan portfolio and the more slowly repricing deposit products. In addition, growth and/or contraction in the Corporation's loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing investment securities, primarily fixed-rate, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, and hedging the sensitivity with interest rate swaps. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk, with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.Since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives, a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk. These techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve, utilizing multiple simulation analyses. Simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income, as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors, including, but not limited to, the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, regulatory impacts and management strategies.Sensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest RatesThe analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is management's principal risk management technique. Management models a base case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment and what is believed to be the most likely balance sheet structure. Existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes are included in the analysis, but no additional hedging is currently forecasted. These derivative instruments currently comprise interest rate swaps that convert fixed-rate long-term debt to variable rates. This base case net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which rates rise or decline in a linear, non-parallel fashion from the base case over 12 months. In the scenarios presented, short-term interest rates increase 200 basis points, resulting in an average increase in short-term interest rates of 100 basis points over the period (+200 scenario). Due to the current low level of interest rates, the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of a 50 basis point drop in short-term interest rates, to zero percent.Each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth, investment security prepayment levels, depositor behavior, yield curve changes, loan and deposit pricing, and overall balance sheet mix and growth. In the +200 scenario, assumptions related to loan growth are based on historical experience. Because deposit balances have continued to grow significantly in this persistent low rate environment, historical depositor behavior may be less indicative of future trends. As a result, the +200 scenario reflects a greater decrease in deposits than we have experienced historically as rates begin to rise. Investment securities modeling includes the replacement of prepayments and expected funding maturities. In addition, the model reflects deposit pricing based on historical price movements with short-term interest rates, and loan spreads are held at current levels. Changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis.57Table of ContentsThe table below, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above.

The risk to declining interest rates is limited by an assumed floor on interest rates of zero percent.Sensitivity of Economic Value of Equity to Changes in Interest RatesIn addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income, an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position. The economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the Corporation's financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements. The economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel 200 basis point increase and 50 basis point decrease in interest rates.The table below, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above.

Additionally, changes in actual deposit mix over the period impacted the results modestly.Wholesale FundingThe Corporation may access the purchased funds market when necessary, which includes foreign office time deposits and short-term borrowings. Capacity for incremental purchased funds at September 30, 2016 included short-term FHLB advances, the ability to purchase federal funds, sell securities under agreements to repurchase, as well as issue deposits to institutional investors and issue certificates of deposit through brokers. Purchased funds totaled $42 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $55 million at December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016, the Bank had pledged loans totaling $23.3 billion which provided for up to $18.7 billion of available collateralized borrowing with the FRB.The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Dallas, Texas, which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. At September 30, 2016, $15.3 billion of real estate-related loans were pledged to the FHLB as blanket collateral for current and potential future borrowings. As of September 30, 2016, the Corporation had $2.8 billion of outstanding borrowings from the FHLB maturing in 2026, and capacity for potential future borrowings of approximately $3.8 billion. In the second quarter 2016, the Bank borrowed $2.8 billion of 10-year, floating-rate FHLB advances due 2026. The interest rate on each of eight notes resets every four weeks, based on the FHLB auction rate, with the reset date of each note scheduled at one-week intervals. Each note may be prepaid in full, without penalty, at each scheduled reset date. Proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including to provide cost-effective funding for upcoming debt maturities.Additionally, as of September 30, 2016 the Bank had the ability to issue up to $14 billion of debt under an existing $15 billion note program which allows the issuance of debt with maturities between three months and 30 years.The Corporation also maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and/or equity securities.58Table of ContentsThe ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise funds at competitive rates is impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings of the Corporation and the Bank. As of September 30, 2016, the four major rating agencies had assigned the following ratings to long-term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Liquid assets totaled $19.1 billion at September 30, 2016, compared to $16.4 billion at December 31, 2015. Liquid assets include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits with banks, other short-term investments and unencumbered investment securities. In September 2014, U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule implementing a quantitative liquidity requirement in the U.S. generally consistent with the LCR minimum liquidity measure established under the Basel III liquidity framework. Under the rule, the Corporation is subject to a modified LCR standard, which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of high-quality liquid assets to fully cover modified net cash outflows under a 30-day systematic liquidity stress scenario. The rule was effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2016. During the transition year, 2016, the Corporation is required to maintain a minimum LCR of 90 percent. Beginning January 1, 2017, and thereafter, the minimum required LCR will be 100 percent. At September 30, 2016, the Corporation was in compliance with the fully phased-in LCR requirement, plus a buffer.In the second quarter 2016, U.S. banking regulators issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (the proposed rule) implementing a second quantitative liquidity requirement in the U.S. generally consistent with the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) minimum liquidity measure established under the Basel III liquidity framework. Under the proposed rule, the Corporation will be subject to a modified NSFR standard effective January 1, 2018, which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of available longer-term, stable sources of funding to fully cover a modified amount of required longer-term stable funding, over a one-year period. The Corporation does not currently expect the proposed rule to have a material impact on its liquidity needs.The Corporation regularly evaluates its ability to meet funding needs in unanticipated, stressed environments. In conjunction with the quarterly 200 basis point interest rate simulation analyses, discussed in the “Interest Rate Sensitivity” section of this financial review, liquidity ratios and potential funding availability are examined. Each quarter, the Corporation also evaluates its ability to meet liquidity needs under a series of broad events, distinguished in terms of duration and severity. The evaluation as of September 30, 2016 projected that sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events.59Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe Corporation’s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation’s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2015, the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to the allowance for credit losses, fair value measurement, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages F-40 through F-43 in the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report. As of the date of this report, there have been no significant changes to the Corporation's critical accounting policies or estimates, except as discussed below.GoodwillGoodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level, equivalent to a business segment or one level below. The Corporation has three reporting units: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, goodwill totaled $635 million, including $380 million allocated to the Business Bank, $194 million allocated to the Retail Bank and $61 million allocated to Wealth Management. The Corporation performs its annual evaluation of goodwill impairment in the third quarter of each year and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests suggest additional testing may be warranted to determine if goodwill might be impaired. The quantitative goodwill impairment test is a two-step test. The first step compares the estimated fair value of identified reporting units with their carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. In performing the annual impairment test, the carrying value of each reporting unit is the greater of economic or regulatory capital. The Corporation assigns economic capital using internal management methodologies on the basis of each reporting unit's credit, operational and interest rate risks, as well as goodwill. To determine regulatory capital, each reporting unit is assigned sufficient capital such that its respective Tier 1 ratio, based on allocated risk-weighted assets, is the same as that of the Corporation. Using this two-pronged approach, the Corporation's equity is fully allocated to its reporting units except for capital held primarily for the risk associated with the securities portfolio, which is assigned to the Finance segment of the Corporation. Determining the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process involving the use of estimates and judgments related to the selection of inputs such as future cash flows, discount rates, comparable public company multiples, applicable control premiums and economic expectations used in determining the interest rate environment. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are determined using a blend of two commonly used valuation techniques: the market approach and the income approach. For the market approach, valuations of reporting units consider a combination of earnings, equity and other multiples from companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit. Since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of noncontrolling interests, the valuations accordingly incorporate a control premium. For the income approach, estimated future cash flows and terminal value are discounted. Estimated future cash flows are derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for each reporting unit which incorporate uncertainty factors inherent to long-term projections. The applicable discount rate is based on the imputed cost of equity capital appropriate for each reporting unit, which incorporates the risk-free rate of return, the level of non-diversified risk associated with companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit, a size risk premium and a market equity risk premium.The annual test of goodwill impairment was performed as of the beginning of the third quarter 2016. The Corporation's assumptions included modest increases to the Federal funds target rate until eventually reaching a normal interest rate environment, as well as credit costs, reflective of the impact of energy prices, and the impact of the Corporation’s GEAR Up initiative. At the conclusion of the first step of the annual goodwill impairment tests performed in the third quarter 2016, the estimated fair values of the Business Bank and Wealth Management substantially exceeded their carrying amounts, including goodwill. The fair value of the Retail Bank exceeded the carrying value by 12 percent and 22 percent as of the 2016 and 2015 annual test of goodwill impairment, respectively. The decline in the excess value for the Retail Bank was due to the combination of an increase in the amount of regulatory capital allocated to the reporting unit due to higher risk weighted assets and depressed market multiples at the time of the valuation. The results of the annual test of the goodwill impairment test for each reporting unit were subjected to stress testing as appropriate.60Table of ContentsEconomic conditions impact the assumptions related to interest and growth rates, loss rates and imputed cost of equity capital. The fair value estimates for each reporting unit incorporated current economic and market conditions, including the recent Federal Reserve announcements and the impact of legislative and regulatory changes, to the extent known and as described above. However, further weakening in the economic environment, such as adverse changes in interest rates, a decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below their carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Additionally, new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management's expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Any impairment charge would not affect the Corporation's regulatory capital ratios, tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position.SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATAThe following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this financial review with financial measures defined by GAAP.(dollar amounts in millions)September 30, 2016 December 31, 2015Tangible Common Equity Ratio:   Common shareholders' equity$7,727 $7,560Less:   Goodwill635 635Other intangible assets11 14Tangible common equity$7,081 $6,911Total assets$74,124 $71,877Less:   Goodwill635 635Other intangible assets11 14Tangible assets$73,478 $71,228Common equity ratio10.42% 10.52%Tangible common equity ratio9.64 9.70Tangible Common Equity per Share of Common Stock:   Common shareholders' equity$7,727 $7,560Tangible common equity7,081 6,911Shares of common stock outstanding (in millions)172 176Common shareholders' equity per share of common stock$44.91 $43.03Tangible common equity per share of common stock41.15 39.33The tangible common equity ratio removes preferred stock and the effect of intangible assets from capital and the effect of intangible assets from total assets. Tangible common equity per share of common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders' equity per share of common stock. The Corporation believes these measurements are meaningful measures of capital adequacy used by investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and to compare against other companies in the industry.61Table of ContentsITEM 3.
