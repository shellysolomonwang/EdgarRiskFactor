The increase in net income primarily reflected the impact from increased interest rates, GEAR Up initiatives and improved credit quality. Net income per diluted common share was $1.13 and $0.58 for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and average diluted common shares were 179 million and 177 million for each respective period. Net income for the three months ended June 30, 2017 included $5 million of tax benefits from employee stock transactions (3 cents per share). Additionally, net income included the after-tax impact of restructuring charges associated with the GEAR Up initiative of $9 million (5 cents per share) and $34 million (19 cents per share) for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $405 million, an increase of $241 million from $164 million reported for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The increase in net income is primarily due to the same reasons described above. Net income per diluted common share was $2.24 and $0.92 for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and average diluted common shares were 180 million and 177 million for each respective period. Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2017 included $29 million of tax benefits from employee stock transactions (16 cents per share). Additionally, net income included the after-tax impact of GEAR Up restructuring charges of $16 million (9 cents per share) and $34 million (19 cents per share) for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Growth in Efficiency and Revenue InitiativeThe Corporation launched the GEAR Up initiative in 2016 in order to meaningfully enhance profitability. Actions identified under this initiative are expected to drive additional annual pre-tax income, before restructuring charges, of approximately $180 million in full-year 2017 and $270 million in full-year 2018, relative to when the initiative began in June 2016. Additional financial targets expected from GEAR Up include a consistent double-digit return on equity and an efficiency ratio at or below 60 percent by year-end 2018.•Expense reductions are expected to save approximately $150 million in full-year 2017, and approximately $200 million in full-year 2018. This is being achieved from a reduction in workforce, a new retirement program, streamlining operational processes, real estate optimization including consolidating banking centers as well as reducing office and operations space, selective outsourcing of technology functions and reduction of technology system applications. •Revenue enhancements are expected to gradually ramp-up to approximately $30 million in full-year 2017, increasing to approximately $70 million in full-year 2018, through expanded product offerings, enhanced sales tools and training and improved customer analytics to drive opportunities.•Pre-tax restructuring charges of $140 million to $160 million in total are expected to be incurred from inception through 2018, including $40 to $50 million in 2017. Pre-tax restructuring charges of $118 million were incurred through June 30, 2017. For additional information regarding restructuring charges, refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.The impact of the increase in short-term rates and the execution of certain GEAR Up initiatives helped lower the efficiency ratio to 58.6 percent for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared to 72.4 percent for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The GEAR Up impact was primarily driven by savings from the 2016 reduction in workforce, changes to the retirement program, consolidation of banking centers, completed in the second quarter 2017, and other real estate optimization. These actions, along with the decrease in the provision for credit losses, also contributed to an increase in return on equity to 10.3 percent for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to 5.5 percent for the three months ended June 30, 2016.Full-Year 2017 Outlook Compared to Full-Year 2016Management expectations for 2017, compared to 2016, assuming a continuation of the current economic and low rate environment as well as contributions from the GEAR Up initiative of $30 million in revenue and $125 million in expense savings, are as follows:•Growth in average loans of 1 percent. Excluding Mortgage Banker Finance and Energy, loan growth of 3 percent, reflecting increases in the remaining lines of business.•Net interest income higher, reflecting the benefits from the rate increases in December 2016 ($85 million; no deposit beta), March 2017 ($65 million; no deposit beta) and June 2017 (more than $30 million for the remainder of 2017; 25 percent deposit beta), as well as loan growth and debt maturities.•Provision for credit losses lower, with continued solid performance of the overall portfolio.◦Provision of 20-25 basis points and net charge-offs to remain low (full-year 2017).•Noninterest income higher, with the execution of GEAR Up opportunities of $30 million, modest growth in treasury management and card fees, as well as wealth management products such as fiduciary and brokerage services.◦Increase of 4-6 percent.36Table of Contents•Noninterest expenses lower, reflecting lower restructuring charges and an additional $125 million in GEAR Up savings, relative to 2016 GEAR Up savings of more than $25 million. The gains of $13 million in 2016 from early terminations of certain leveraged lease transactions are not expected to repeat. Noninterest expenses in the second half of 2017 will be impacted by items tied to revenue growth, such as advertising, incentive compensation and outside processing expenses; three additional days; seasonal and inflationary pressure leading to higher occupancy and benefits expenses; and, as expected, higher technology expenditures in cybersecurity, product innovation and to upgrade infrastructure to drive efficiencies.◦Restructuring charges of $40 to $50 million, compared to $93 million in 2016.◦Excluding restructuring charges, noninterest expenses to decline about 1 percent.◦Decrease of about 4 percent including restructuring charges.•Income tax expense to approximate 31 percent of pre-tax income, reflecting 33 percent for the remaining quarters assuming no further tax impact from employee stock transactions.37Table of ContentsNet Interest IncomeThe "Quarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume" table that follows provides an analysis of net interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 and details the components of the change in net interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in the prior year.Quarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 June 30, 2016(dollar amounts in millions)AverageBalanceInterestAverageRate (a) AverageBalanceInterestAverageRate (a)Commercial loans$30,632$2833.72% $31,511$2513.23%Real estate construction loans2,910294.08 2,429223.62Commercial mortgage loans9,012873.88 9,033783.47Lease financing52610.61 73041.98International loans1,139123.99 1,396133.63Residential mortgage loans1,975183.61 1,880173.76Consumer loans2,529233.62 2,490213.37Total loans48,7234533.74 49,4694063.31        Mortgage-backed securities (b)9,336502.17 9,326512.21Other investment securities2,896121.69 3,008111.50Total investment securities (b)12,232622.06 12,334622.03        Interest-bearing deposits with banks5,263141.03 3,69050.50Other short-term investments92—0.58 104—0.58Total earning assets66,3105293.21 65,5974732.91        Cash and due from banks1,148   1,074  Allowance for loan losses(726)   (749)  Accrued income and other assets4,586   4,746  Total assets$71,318   $70,668          Money market and interest-bearing checking deposits$21,66170.13 $22,78560.11Savings deposits2,142—0.02 2,010—0.02Customer certificates of deposit2,52720.36 3,32040.40Foreign office time deposits57—0.60 30—0.35Total interest-bearing deposits26,38790.15 28,145100.14        Short-term borrowings147—1.12 159—0.45Medium- and long-term debt5,161201.48 5,072181.42Total interest-bearing sources31,695290.37 33,376280.33        Noninterest-bearing deposits30,741   28,376  Accrued expenses and other liabilities949   1,262  Total shareholders’ equity7,933   7,654  Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity$71,318   $70,668          Net interest income/rate spread $5002.84  $4452.58        Impact of net noninterest-bearing sources of funds  0.19   0.16Net interest margin (as a percentage of average earning assets)  3.03%   2.74%(a)Average rate is calculated on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis using a federal tax rate of 35%.

The increase in net interest income reflected the benefit from higher short-term rates and higher average earning assets. The increase in short-term rates resulted in higher yields on loans and Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) deposits, partially offset by higher debt costs on variable rate debt tied to LIBOR. Average earning assets increased $713 million, or 1 percent, to $66.3 billion, compared to $65.6 billion for the same period in 2016. The increase in average earning assets primarily reflected increases of $1.6 billion in average FRB deposits (included in "interest-bearing deposits with banks" on the consolidated balance sheets) reflecting the increase in noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a decrease of $746 million in average loans. The net interest margin (FTE) for the three months ended June 30, 2017 increased 29 basis points to 3.03 percent, from 2.74 percent for the comparable period in 2016, primarily from higher yields on loans and FRB deposits (+34 basis points), reflecting the benefit from higher short-term rates, partially offset by the impact of the increase in average balances deposited with the FRB (-4 basis points).39Table of ContentsYear-to-Date Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 June 30, 2016(dollar amounts in millions)AverageBalanceInterestAverageRate (a) AverageBalanceInterestAverageRate (a)Commercial loans$30,166$5393.62% $31,162$5003.24%Real estate construction loans2,934573.95 2,272413.64Commercial mortgage loans8,9941703.81 8,9971583.53Lease financing54862.01 728102.66International loans1,174233.88 1,408263.64Residential mortgage loans1,969353.59 1,886363.85Consumer loans2,528443.52 2,478413.35Total loans48,3138743.65 48,9318123.34        Mortgage-backed securities (b)9,3211002.16 9,3411022.21Other investment securities2,894241.64 3,004221.50Total investment securities (b)12,2151242.04 12,3451242.04        Interest-bearing deposits with banks5,857270.92 3,47890.50Other short-term investments92—0.63 106—0.76Total earning assets66,4771,0253.11 64,8609452.94        Cash and due from banks1,164   1,071  Allowance for loan losses(733)   (714)  Accrued income and other assets4,659   4,731  Total assets$71,567   $69,948          Money market and interest-bearing checking deposits$22,066140.13 $22,989130.11Savings deposits2,114—0.02 1,973—0.02Customer certificates of deposit2,62140.37 3,39970.40Foreign office time deposits50—0.55 40—0.34Total interest-bearing deposits26,851180.14 28,401200.14        Short-term borrowings85—1.07 262—0.45Medium- and long-term debt5,159371.39 4,083331.62Total interest-bearing sources32,095550.34 32,746530.32        Noninterest-bearing deposits30,601   28,214  Accrued expenses and other liabilities972   1,345  Total shareholders’ equity7,899   7,643  Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity$71,567   $69,948          Net interest income/rate spread $9702.77  $8922.62        Impact of net noninterest-bearing sources of funds  0.18   0.16Net interest margin (as a percentage of average earning assets)  2.95%   2.78%(a)Average rate is calculated on an FTE basis using a federal tax rate of 35%.

The increase in net interest income resulted primarily from the same reasons as described in the quarterly discussion above, as well as the impact of one fewer day in 2017. Average earning assets increased $1.6 billion, or 2 percent, to $66.5 billion, compared to $64.9 billion for the same period in 2016. The increase in average earning assets primarily reflected increases of $2.4 billion in average FRB deposits, partially offset by a decrease of $618 million in average loans. The net interest margin (FTE) for the six months ended June 30, 2017 increased 17 basis points to 2.95 percent, from 2.78 percent for the comparable period in 2016, primarily from higher yields on loans and FRB deposits, reflecting the benefit from the increase in short-term rates, partially offset by the impact of the increase in average balances deposited with the FRB. Additionally, increases in lower-rate FHLB borrowings were partially offset by the maturity of higher-rate debt. For further discussion of the effects of market rates on net interest income, refer to the "Market and Liquidity Risk" section of this financial review.Provision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses was $17 million and $49 million for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $33 million and $197 million for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The provision for credit losses includes both the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments.The provision for loan losses is recorded to maintain the allowance for loan losses at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio. The provision for loan losses was $15 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $47 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The $32 million decrease in the provision primarily reflected the impact of the changes in reserves allocated to Energy and energy-related loans, due to a decrease in criticized loans and lower net loan charge-offs. The provision for loan losses was $26 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $188 million for the same period in the prior year. The $162 million decrease in the provision primarily reflected the improvement in the credit quality of the Energy and energy-related portfolio as indicated above.Net loan charge-offs in the three months ended June 30, 2017 decreased $24 million to $18 million, or 0.15 percent of average total loans, compared to $42 million, or 0.34 percent, for the three months ended June 30, 2016. Net loan charge-offs in the six months ended June 30, 2017 decreased $43 million to $51 million, or 0.21 percent of average total loans, compared to $94 million, or 0.39 percent, for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in net loan charge-offs in both periods primarily reflected lower Energy charge-offs.The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments is recorded to maintain the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $2 million for both the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to $9 million for the same period in 2016. There were no lending-related commitment charge-offs for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and $5 million for the same period in 2016. There were no lending-related commitment charge-offs for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and $11 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The 41Table of Contentscharge-offs in the prior period were the result of credit deterioration in certain Corporate Banking and Energy unfunded commitments.For further information regarding Energy and energy-related loans, refer to the "Energy Lending" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review. An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets is presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.Noninterest Income Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,(in millions)2017 2016 2017 2016Card fees$80 $76 $157 $148Service charges on deposit accounts57 55 115 110Fiduciary income51 49 100 95Commercial lending fees22 22 42 42Letter of credit fees11 13 23 26Bank-owned life insurance9 9 19 18Foreign exchange income11 11 22 21Brokerage fees6 5 11 9Net securities losses (2) (1) (2) (3)Other noninterest income (a)31 29 60 46Total noninterest income$276 $268 $547 $512(a)The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income.Noninterest income increased $8 million to $276 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $268 million for the same period in 2016 and increased $35 million to $547 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $512 million for the same period in the prior year. Excluding a $3 million decrease and a $5 million increase in deferred compensation asset returns in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2017, respectively, noninterest income increased $11 million and $30 million in each respective period, partly due to the impact of GEAR Up initiatives. See the above table for further detail of changes in noninterest income. Deferred compensation asset returns are included in other noninterest income.The following table illustrates certain categories included in "other noninterest income" on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

Income earned on these assets is reported in noninterest income and the resulting change in deferred compensation plan liabilities is reported in salaries and benefits expense. Changes in income earned on deferred compensation assets are substantially offset by changes in deferred compensation plan expense.42Table of ContentsNoninterest Expenses Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,(in millions)2017 2016 2017 2016Salaries and benefits expense$219 $247 $452 $495Outside processing fee expense88 83 175 161Net occupancy expense38 39 76 77Equipment expense11 14 22 27Restructuring charges14 53 25 53Software expense31 30 60 59FDIC insurance expense12 14 25 25Advertising expense7 6 11 10Litigation-related expense— — (2) —Other noninterest expenses37 32 70 69Total noninterest expenses$457 $518 $914 $976Noninterest expenses decreased $61 million to $457 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $518 million for the same period in 2016. Noninterest expenses decreased $19 million excluding the $39 million decrease in restructuring charges and a $3 million decrease in deferred compensation plan expense (included in salaries and benefits expense). This primarily reflected decreases in salaries and benefits expense of $25 million, $3 million in equipment expense and smaller decreases in other categories, partially offset by an $8 million gain from the sale of leased assets in the second quarter of 2016 and an increase of $5 million in outside processing fees primarily tied to revenue-generating activities. The decrease in salaries and benefits primarily reflected the impact of the GEAR Up initiative, partially offset by merit raises.Noninterest expenses decreased $62 million to $914 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $976 million for the same period in 2016. Excluding the $28 million decrease in restructuring charges and a $5 million increase in deferred compensation plan expense, noninterest expenses decreased $39 million, primarily due to decreases of $48 million in salaries and benefits expense and $5 million in equipment expense, partially offset by a $14 million increase in outside processing fees and the 2016 gain from the sale of leased assets discussed above. The decrease in salaries and benefits expense primarily reflected the impact of the GEAR Up initiative and one fewer day in 2017, partially offset by merit raises.For further information about restructuring charges associated with the GEAR Up initiative, see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.Provision for Income TaxesThe provision for income taxes increased $57 million to $99 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $42 million for the same period in 2016, and increased $98 million to $165 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $67 million for the same period in 2016. The increases were primarily due to increases in pretax income, partially offset by tax benefits from employee stock transactions as a result of new accounting guidance for stock compensation. Income tax benefits from employee stock transactions were $5 million and $29 million for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2017, respectively.For further information about the new accounting guidance for stock compensation, see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.STRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESSThe Corporation has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, the Finance Division is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes items not directly associated with these business segments or the Finance segment. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Market segment results are also provided for the Corporation's three primary geographic markets: Michigan, California and Texas. In addition to the three primary geographic markets, Other Markets is also reported as a market segment. Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of these business and market segments for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2017 and 2016.The Corporation's management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. These methodologies may be modified as the management 43Table of Contentsaccounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines. Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report describes the Corporation's segment reporting methodology.Funds transfer pricing (FTP) credit rates for deposits reflect the long-term value of deposits, based on their implied maturities, and FTP charge rates for funding assets reflect a matched cost of funds based on the pricing and duration characteristics of the assets. These rates reset in response to changes in market conditions. FTP crediting rates were generally higher in the six months ended June 30, 2017 than in the same period in the prior year, and, as a result, net interest income for deposit-providing business segments has been positively impacted during the current year. As overall market rates increased, FTP charges increased for asset-generating business segments in the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to the same period in the prior year.Business SegmentsThe following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.

Net interest income of $668 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 decreased $38 million compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting an increase in net FTP charges, an $899 million decrease in average loans and one fewer day in 2017, partially offset by an increase in loan yields. The increase in net FTP charges primarily reflected an increase in the cost of funds, partially offset by the benefit from a $418 million increase in average deposits. The provision for credit losses decreased $175 million to $22 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting improved credit quality in Energy.

Changes in average total loans by geographic market are provided in the table above.Total liabilities decreased $1.7 billion to $63.5 billion at June 30, 2017, compared to $65.2 billion at December 31, 2016, primarily reflecting a decrease of $2.2 billion in total deposits, partially offset by an increase of $516 million in short-term borrowings. The increase in short-term borrowings primarily reflected 3-month FHLB advances borrowed in the second quarter 2017 for liquidity management purposes. The decrease in total deposits primarily reflected decreases of $1.6 billion in money market and interest-bearing checking deposits, $368 million in customer certificates of deposits and $330 million in noninterest-bearing deposits. On an average basis, total liabilities decreased $3.0 billion in the second quarter 2017, compared to the fourth quarter 2016, primarily due to decreases of $2.5 billion in total deposits and $417 million in medium- and long-term debt. The decrease in average total deposits primarily reflected seasonality and customers funding increased working capital needs, with the largest decreases in general Middle Market ($1.6 billion), Energy ($386 million) and Technology and Life Sciences ($342 million). The decrease in debt was primarily due to the maturity of $650 million of subordinated notes during the fourth quarter 2016.47Table of ContentsCapitalTotal shareholders' equity increased $189 million to $8.0 billion at June 30, 2017, compared to December 31, 2016.

These stress tests are a normal part of the Corporation's overall risk management and capital planning process and are part of the forecasting process used by the Corporation to conduct the enterprise-wide stress test that was part of the Federal Reserve's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). For additional information about risk management processes, refer to the "Risk Management" sections of this financial review and the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report.The Federal Reserve completed its 2017 CCAR review in June 2017 and did not object to the Corporation's 2017 capital plan and capital distributions contemplated in the plan for the period ending June 30, 2018. The plan includes equity repurchases of up to $605 million for the four quarters commencing in the third quarter 2017 and ending in the second quarter 2018. The timing and ultimate amount of future equity repurchases will be subject to various factors, including the Corporation's financial performance and market conditions. On April 25, 2017 the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the Board) approved a 3-cent increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.26 per share, and on July 25, 2017, the Board further increased the quarterly dividend to $0.30 per share, effective for the dividend payable October 1, 2017. Also on July 25, 2017, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 5.0 million shares of Comerica Incorporated outstanding common stock, in addition to the 8.3 million shares remaining at June 30, 2017 under the Board's prior authorizations for the equity repurchase program initially approved in November 2010. Including the July 25, 2017 authorization, a total of 55.2 million shares and 14.1 million warrants (12.1 million share-equivalents) have been authorized for repurchase under the equity repurchase program since its inception in 2010.

Upon exercise of a warrant, the number of shares with a value equal to the aggregate exercise price is withheld from an exercising warrant holder as payment (known as a "net exercise provision"). During the six months ended June 30, 2017, Comerica withheld the equivalent of approximately 1,035,000 shares to cover an aggregate $30.5 million in exercise price and issued approximately 1,516,000 shares to the exercising warrant holders. Shares withheld in connection with the net exercise provision are not included in the total number of shares or warrants purchased in the above table.(b)Maximum number of shares and warrants that may yet be purchased under the publicly announced plans or programs.(c)Includes approximately 200,000 shares purchased pursuant to deferred compensation plans and shares purchased from employees to pay for taxes related to restricted stock vesting under the terms of an employee share-based compensation plan during the six months ended June 30, 2017.

The allowance for loan losses represents management's assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporation's loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in "accrued expenses 49Table of Contentsand other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets, provides for probable losses inherent in lending-related commitments, including unused commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.Both consumer and business confidence measures for the U.S. were stable and economic indicators are generally positive, providing some stability to financial markets. The Federal Reserve responded to improving U.S. economic data, including a tightening labor market, by raising the federal funds rate by an additional 25 basis points in June 2017. Economic and financial market uncertainty is increasing as the Trump Administration works to implement its policies. Looking ahead, the Corporation expects the U.S economy to continue to expand at a moderate pace throughout 2017 but remains conservative with regard to the reserve process in light of the uncertainties that exist.The allowance for loan losses was $705 million at June 30, 2017, compared to $730 million at December 31, 2016, a decrease of $25 million, or 3 percent. The decrease in the allowance for loan losses resulted primarily from a decrease in reserves for Energy and energy-related loans. The decrease in reserves for Energy and energy-related loans reflected a decline in criticized loans as, overall, these borrowers lowered operating costs, decreased leverage and maintained hedging strategies. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain letters of credit in a manner consistent with business loans, and allowances based on the pool of the remaining letters of credit and all unused commitments to extend credit within each internal risk rating. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $48 million and $41 million at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The $7 million increase in the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments primarily reflected the impact of market conditions and an increase in cited letters of credit.For additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses, refer to page F-38 in the "Critical Accounting Policies" section and pages F-54 through F-56 in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report. For additional information regarding Energy and energy-related exposures, refer to "Energy Lending" subheading later in this section.Nonperforming AssetsNonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, troubled debt restructured loans (TDRs) which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans) and foreclosed property.

Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $11.8 billion at June 30, 2017, of which $4.4 billion, or 37 percent, were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to real estate developers, a decrease of $117 million compared to December 31, 2016. The remaining $7.4 billion, or 63 percent, of commercial real estate loans in other business lines consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages, which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans. In the Texas market, commercial real estate loans totaled $3.1 billion at June 30, 2017, of which $1.7 billion were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line. Substantially all of the remaining $1.4 billion were owner-occupied commercial mortgages. Loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line secured by properties located in Texas totaled $1.4 billion at June 30, 2017, primarily including $885 million for multifamily projects. No loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line that were secured by properties located in Texas were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2017.The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-tenured customers with satisfactory completion experience. Credit quality in the real estate construction loan portfolio was strong, with criticized loans of $15 million and $3 million at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, and no real estate construction loan charge-offs in either of the six-month periods ended June 30, 2017 and 2016.Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Of the $1.8 billion of commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line, $9 million were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2017, compared to $2.0 billion with $9 million on nonaccrual status at December 31, 2016. Commercial mortgage loan net recoveries in the Commercial Real Estate business line were $2 million and $11 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In other business lines, $32 million and $37 million of commercial mortgage loans were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Commercial mortgage loan net recoveries in other business lines were $1 million and $3 million for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Residential Real Estate LendingThe following table summarizes the Corporation's residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios by geographic market.

Residential mortgages totaled $2.0 billion at June 30, 2017, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $2.0 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $36 million were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2017. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.8 billion at June 30, 2017, of which $1.6 billion was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit, $123 million 54Table of Contentswere on amortizing status and $34 million were closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.8 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $23 million were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2017. A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at June 30, 2017. The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation's primary geographic markets. Substantially all residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more are placed on nonaccrual status, and substantially all junior lien home equity loans that are current or less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status if full collection of the senior position is in doubt. At no later than 180 days past due, such loans are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell.Energy LendingThe Corporation has a portfolio of Energy and energy-related loans that are included primarily in "commercial loans" in the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation has over 30 years of experience in energy lending, with a focus on middle market companies in the oil and gas business. Customers in the Corporation's Energy business line (approximately 180 relationships) are engaged in three segments of the oil and gas business: exploration and production (E&P) (70 percent), midstream (17 percent) and energy services (13 percent). E&P generally includes such activities as searching for potential oil and gas fields, drilling exploratory wells and operating active wells. Commitments to E&P borrowers are typically subject to semi-annual borrowing base re-determinations based on a variety of factors including updated pricing (reflecting market and competitive conditions), energy reserve levels and the impact of hedging. The midstream sector is generally involved in the transportation, storage and marketing of crude and/or refined oil and gas products. The Corporation's energy services customers provide products and services primarily to the E&P segment. About 94 percent of the loans in the Energy business line are Shared National Credit (SNC) loans, which are facilities greater than $20 million shared by three or more federally supervised institutions, reflecting the Corporation's focus on larger middle market companies that have financing needs that generally exceed internal individual borrower credit risk limits. The Corporation seeks to develop full relationships with SNC borrowers. In addition to oil and gas loans in the Energy business line, the Corporation is monitoring a portfolio of loans in other lines of business to companies that have a sizable portion of their revenue related to oil and gas or could be otherwise negatively impacted by prolonged lower oil and gas prices ("energy-related"), primarily in general Middle Market, Corporate Banking, Small Business, and Technology and Life Sciences. These companies include downstream businesses such as refineries and petrochemical companies, companies that sell products to E&P, midstream and energy services companies, companies involved in developing new technologies for the oil and gas industry, and other similar businesses.The following table summarizes information about the Corporation's portfolio of Energy and energy-related loans.

Total exposure, including unused commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, was $4.4 billion and $4.7 billion at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The decrease in total exposure in the Energy business line primarily reflected energy customers taking actions to adjust their cash flow and reduce their bank debt, including selling assets to pay down debt and raising capital in the equity markets, as well as improved operations. Energy-related outstandings were approximately $367 million at June 30, 2017 (approximately 70 relationships), a decrease of $30 million, or 8 percent, compared to December 31, 2016.The Corporation's allowance methodology carefully considers the various risk elements within the loan portfolio. At June 30, 2017, the reserve allocation for loans in the Energy business line decreased to approximately 6 percent of total Energy business line loans. Including energy-related, the reserve allocation for Energy and energy-related loans at June 30, 2017 decreased to approximately 7 percent of total Energy and energy-related loans. The Corporation continued to incorporate a qualitative reserve component for Energy and energy-related loans at June 30, 2017. Energy and energy-related net credit-related charge-offs totaled $16 million and $37 million for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2017 compared to net credit-related charge-offs of $34 million and $78 million for the same periods in 2016.55Table of ContentsAutomotive LendingSubstantially all dealer loans are in the National Dealer Services business line. Loans in the National Dealer Services business line include floor plan financing and other loans to automotive dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in “commercial loans” in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $4.3 billion at June 30, 2017, a decrease of $77 million compared to $4.3 billion at December 31, 2016. At June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $2.9 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, including $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Automotive lending also includes loans to borrowers involved with automotive production, primarily Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers. Loans to borrowers involved with automotive production totaled approximately $1.3 billion at both June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.For further discussion of credit risk, see the "Credit Risk" section of pages F-23 through F-32 in the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report.Market and Liquidity RiskMarket risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse movements in market rates or prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. Liquidity risk represents the failure to meet financial obligations coming due, resulting from an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding, and the inability to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significant changes in pricing, due to inadequate market depth or market disruptions.The Asset and Liability Policy Committee (ALCO) of the Corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities. ALCO meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies, and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit gathering and risk management. The Treasury Department mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of ALCO through the actions it takes to manage the Corporation's market, liquidity and capital positions.Market Risk Analytics, within the Office of Enterprise Risk, supports ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk and coordinating all other market risks. Key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analysis of the Corporation's balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks; (ii) monitoring and reporting of the Corporation's positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines; (iii) developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions; (iv) reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval; (v) monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market risks; and (vi) developing and monitoring the interest rate risk economic capital estimate.Interest Rate RiskNet interest income is the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities, primarily through the Corporation's core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by core deposits. Approximately 90 percent of the Corporation's loans were floating at June 30, 2017, of which approximately 80 percent were based on LIBOR and 20 percent were based on Prime. This creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the floating-rate loan portfolio and the more slowly repricing deposit products. In addition, the growth and/or contraction in the Corporation's loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing investment securities, primarily fixed-rate, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, and hedging the sensitivity with interest rate swaps. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk, with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.Since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives, a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk. These techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve, utilizing multiple simulation analyses. Simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income, as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors, including, but not limited to, the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, regulatory impacts and management strategies.Sensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest RatesThe analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is management's principal risk management technique. Management models a base case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment. Existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes are included in the analysis, but no additional hedging is currently forecasted. These derivative instruments currently comprise interest rate swaps that convert 56Table of Contentsfixed-rate long-term debt to variable rates. This base case net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which rates rise or decline in a linear, non-parallel fashion from the base case over 12 months. In the scenarios presented, short-term interest rates increase 200 basis points, resulting in an average increase in short-term interest rates of 100 basis points over the period (+200 scenario). Due to the current low level of interest rates, the analysis reflects declining interest rate scenarios of -125 basis points and -75 basis points at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.Each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth, investment security prepayment levels, depositor behavior, yield curve changes, loan and deposit pricing, and overall balance sheet mix and growth. Because deposit balances have continued to grow significantly in this persistent low rate environment, historical depositor behavior may be less indicative of future trends. As a result, the +200 scenario reflects a greater decrease in deposits than we have experienced historically as rates begin to rise. Changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis.The table below, as of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above. Estimated Annual Change June 30, 2017 December 31, 2016(in millions)Amount % Amount %Change in Interest Rates:       Rising 200 basis points$207 10 % $212 11 %Declining to zero percent(226) (11) (138) (7)Sensitivity to rising rates changed modestly from December 31, 2016 to June 30, 2017, primarily due to minor balance sheet changes. The risk to declining interest rates is limited by an assumed floor on interest rates of zero percent, but reflects the recent rise in short-term interest rates, allowing for a decline of 125 basis points at June 30, 2017, relative to a 75 basis point decline at December 31, 2016.Sensitivity of Economic Value of Equity to Changes in Interest RatesIn addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income, an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position. The economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the Corporation's financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements. The economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel 200 basis point increase. The declining interest rate scenarios are based on decreases of 125 basis points and 75 basis points in interest rates at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.The table below, as of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above. June 30, 2017 December 31, 2016(in millions)Amount % Amount %Change in Interest Rates:       Rising 200 basis points$970 7 % $1,133 10 %Declining to zero percent(2,070) (16) (891) (7)The change in the sensitivity of the economic value of equity to a 200 basis point parallel increase in rates between December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2017 was primarily driven by changes in funding mix between deposits and floating-rate borrowed funds. The change in the sensitivity of the economic value of equity to a parallel decrease in rates to zero during the same period was primarily driven by the increase in short-term rates between the periods, allowing for an additional 50 basis point decrease in rates in the June 30, 2017 scenario.Wholesale FundingThe Corporation may access the purchased funds market when necessary, which includes a variety of funding sources. Capacity for incremental purchased funds at June 30, 2017 included FHLB advances, the ability to purchase federal funds, sell securities under agreements to repurchase, as well as issue deposits through brokers. Purchased funds increased to $564 million at June 30, 2017, compared to $44 million at December 31, 2016 to manage liquidity partly in anticipation of the scheduled maturity of subordinated notes in August 2017. At June 30, 2017, the Bank had pledged loans totaling $21.5 billion which provided for up to $17.4 billion of available collateralized borrowing with the FRB.The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Dallas, Texas, which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available 57Table of Contentsto be pledged to the FHLB. At June 30, 2017, $15.6 billion of real estate-related loans were pledged to the FHLB as blanket collateral for current and potential future borrowings and the Corporation had $2.8 billion of outstanding borrowings maturing in 2026, $524 million of short-term advances and capacity for potential future borrowings of approximately $3.5 billion.Additionally, as of June 30, 2017 the Bank had the ability to issue up to $14 billion of debt under an existing $15 billion note program which allows the issuance of debt with maturities between three months and 30 years. The Corporation also maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and/or equity securities.The ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise funds at competitive rates is impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings of the Corporation and the Bank. As of June 30, 2017, the four major rating agencies had assigned the following ratings to long-term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Liquid assets totaled $17.0 billion at June 30, 2017, compared to $18.2 billion at December 31, 2016. Liquid assets include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits with banks, other short-term investments and unencumbered investment securities. In September 2014, U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule implementing a quantitative liquidity requirement in the U.S. generally consistent with the LCR minimum liquidity measure established under the Basel III liquidity framework. Under the rule, the Corporation is subject to a modified LCR standard, which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of high-quality liquid assets to fully cover modified net cash outflows under a 30-day systematic liquidity stress scenario. The rule was fully effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2017. The Corporation is in compliance with the fully phased-in LCR requirement, plus a buffer.In 2016, U.S. banking regulators issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (the proposed rule) implementing a second quantitative liquidity requirement in the U.S. generally consistent with the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) minimum liquidity measure established under the Basel III liquidity framework. Under the proposed rule, the Corporation will be subject to a modified NSFR standard effective January 1, 2018, which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of available longer-term, stable sources of funding to fully cover a modified amount of required longer-term stable funding, over a one-year period. The Corporation does not currently expect the proposed rule to have a material impact on its liquidity needs.The Corporation performs monthly liquidity stress testing to evaluate its ability to meet funding needs in hypothetical stressed environments. Such environments cover a series of broad events, distinguished in terms of duration and severity. The evaluation as of June 30, 2017 projected sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events.58Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe Corporation’s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation’s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2016, the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to the allowance for credit losses, fair value measurement, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages F-38 through F-41 in the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report. As of the date of this report, there have been no significant changes to the Corporation's critical accounting policies or estimates.SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATAThe following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this financial review with financial measures defined by GAAP.(dollar amounts in millions)June 30, 2017 December 31, 2016Tangible Common Equity Ratio:   Common shareholders' equity$7,985 $7,796Less:   Goodwill635 635Other intangible assets9 10Tangible common equity$7,341 $7,151Total assets$71,447 $72,978Less:   Goodwill635 635Other intangible assets9 10Tangible assets$70,803 $72,333Common equity ratio11.18% 10.68%Tangible common equity ratio10.37 9.89Tangible Common Equity per Share of Common Stock:   Common shareholders' equity$7,985 $7,796Tangible common equity7,341 7,151Shares of common stock outstanding (in millions)176 175Common shareholders' equity per share of common stock$45.39 $44.47Tangible common equity per share of common stock41.73 40.79The tangible common equity ratio removes the effect of intangible assets from capital and the effect of intangible assets from total assets. Tangible common equity per share of common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders' equity per share of common stock. The Corporation believes these are meaningful measures because they reflect the adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators, and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of common equity. Tangible common equity is used by the Corporation to measure the quality of capital and the return relative to balance sheet risks.59Table of ContentsITEM 3.
