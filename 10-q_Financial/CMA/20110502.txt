The increase in net income in the first quarter 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, was primarily due to a $136 million decrease in the provision for credit losses ($126 million decrease in the provision for loan losses and a $10 million decrease in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments), partially offset by increases of $40 million in the provision for income taxes and $19 million in salaries expense and a $20 million decrease in net interest income. Net income attributable to common shares was $102 million for the first quarter 2011, compared to a net loss attributable to common shares of $71 million for the same period one year ago. As a result of the first quarter 2010 full redemption of $2.25 billion of preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury, there were no preferred stock dividends included in net income attributable to common shares for the three months ended March 31, 2011, compared to $123 million of preferred stock dividends, including a $94 million, one-time redemption charge, reflected in the net loss attributable to common shares for the same period one year ago. Net income per diluted common share was $0.57 in the first quarter 2011, compared to a net loss per diluted common share of $0.46 for the same period one year ago.  Full-Year 2011 Outlook  For the full-year 2011, management expects the following, compared to full-year 2010, based on a continuation of modest growth in the economy. This outlook does not include any impact from the pending acquisition of Sterling Bancshares, Inc.        •    A low single-digit decrease in average loans. Excluding the Commercial Real Estate business line, a low single-digit increase in average loans.      •    Average earning assets of approximately $48.5 billion, reflecting lower excess liquidity in addition to a decrease in average loans.      •    An average net interest margin of 3.25 percent to 3.30 percent, based on no increase in the Federal Funds rate.      •    Net credit-related charge-offs between $350 million and $400 million for full-year 2011. The provision for credit losses is expected to be between $150 and $200 million for full-year 2011.      •    A low single-digit decline in noninterest income compared to 2010, primarily due to the impact of regulatory changes. In the event that the implementation of the interchange rules under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is delayed past year-end 2011, management expects 2011 full-year noninterest income to be stable relative to 2010.      •    A low single-digit increase in noninterest expenses compared to 2010, primarily due to an increase in employee benefits expense.      •    Income tax expense to approximate 36 percent of income before income taxes less approximately $60 million of permanent differences related to low-income housing and bank-owned life insurance.      •    Continue share repurchase program that, combined with dividend payments, results in a payout up to 50 percent of full-year 2011 earnings.    41    Table of Contents Net Interest Income  Net interest income was $395 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011, a decrease of $20 million compared to $415 million for the same period in 2010. The decrease in net interest income in the first quarter 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, resulted primarily from a decline in average earning assets, maturities of higher-yield fixed-rate loans and expirations of loan rate floors, partially offset by a continued shift in the funding sources toward lower-cost funds, maturities and redemptions of higher-cost medium- and long-term debt. The “Quarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume – Fully Taxable Equivalent” table of this financial review details the components of the change in net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis for the three months ended March 31, 2011, compared to the same period in the prior year. Average earning assets decreased $3.6 billion, or seven percent, to $49.3 billion in the first quarter 2011, compared to $52.9 billion in the first quarter 2010, primarily due to decreases of $1.8 billion, or 43 percent, in average interest-bearing deposits with banks and $1.8 billion, or four percent, in average loans. The net interest margin (FTE) for the three months ended March 31, 2011 increased seven basis points to 3.25 percent, from 3.18 percent for the comparable period in 2010, primarily due to a reduction in excess liquidity and the continued shift in funding sources toward lower-cost funds, maturities and redemptions of higher-cost medium- and long-term debt, partially offset by the maturity of interest rate swaps at positive spreads and the reduced contribution of noninterest-bearing funds in a lower rate environment. The net interest margin was reduced by approximately 14 basis points and 24 basis points in the first quarters of 2011 and 2010, respectively, from excess liquidity. Excess liquidity was represented by $2.3 billion and $4.1 billion of average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) in the first quarters of 2011 and 2010, respectively, included in “interest-bearing deposits with banks” in the consolidated balance sheets.  For further discussion of the effects of market rates on net interest income, refer to the “Market Risk” section of this financial review.  For full-year 2011, management expects an average net interest margin of 3.25 percent to 3.30 percent based on no increase in the Federal Funds rate.

Provision for Credit Losses  The provision for credit losses includes both the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The provision for loan losses was $49 million for the first quarter 2011, compared to $175 million for the same period in 2010. The Corporation establishes this provision to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses, which is discussed under the “Credit Risk” subheading in the “Risk Management” section of this financial review. The decrease of $126 million in the provision for loan losses in the three month period ended March 31, 2011, when compared to the same period in 2010, resulted primarily from improvements in credit quality. Improvements in credit quality included a decline of $376 million, to $5.2 billion, in the Corporation’s watch list loans from December 31, 2010 to March 31, 2011, compared to a decrease of $228 million, to $7.5 billion, in the same period in 2010. The Corporation’s internal watch list is generally consistent with loans in the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful (nonaccrual) categories defined by regulatory authorities. Additional indicators of improved credit quality included a decrease in the inflow to nonaccrual (based on an analysis of nonaccrual loans with book balances greater than $2 million) of $79 million and a decrease in net credit-related charge-offs of $72 million in the three month period ended March 31, 2011, compared to the same period in the prior year.  Growth in the national economy rebounded in the second half of 2010, driven mainly by a private-sector lead recovery, but remained at a moderate level due to the depressed housing sector and reduced spending by state and local governments. Real gross domestic product reached a milestone in the fourth quarter 2010 as it surpassed the previous peak reached in the fourth quarter 2007. The economic outlook for 2011 improved slightly as private-sector hiring accelerated in the first quarter and the national unemployment rate declined by a percentage point in the four months leading into March 2011. However, surging energy prices in reaction to the turmoil in North Africa and the Middle East could dampen growth later in 2011. Texas continued to outperform the national economy in early 2011, with notable strength in manufacturing and energy exploration. Reflecting the broadening recovery in Texas, job growth in January 2011 and February 2011 was approximately three percent, more than double the national rate. The Michigan economy is showing signs of a stronger recovery than the nation. In the twelve months prior to February 2011, Michigan had a three percentage point drop in the unemployment rate and nonfarm payroll grew almost twice as fast as the nation. The California economy lagged the national recovery in 2010, but appears to be improving in early 2011. Payrolls in the first two months of 2011 grew at a five percent annual rate, four times faster than nationally. California’s housing sector appears to have improved as home prices are now more aligned to income and the inventory of unsold homes has declined. Forward-looking indicators suggest that economic conditions in the Corporation’s primary geographic markets are likely to continue to strengthen gradually against a background of moderate national and global expansions.  Total net credit-related charge-offs include net charge-offs on both loans and lending-related commitments. Net loan charge-offs for the first quarter 2011 decreased $72 million to $101 million, or 1.03 percent of average total loans, compared to $173 million, or 1.68 percent for the first quarter 2010. The decrease in net loan charge-offs in the first quarter 2011, compared to the first quarter 2010, consisted primarily of decreases in net loan charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate ($75 million), Leasing, included in Specialty Businesses ($6 million) and Private Banking ($5 million) business lines, partially offset by an increase in net loan charge-offs in the Middle Market    44    Table of Contents  business line ($20 million). By geographic market, net loan charge-offs decreased in all markets in the first quarter 2011, compared to the same period in 2010.  The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was a negative provision of $3 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2011, compared to a provision of $7 million for the comparable period in 2010. The $10 million decrease for the three-month period ended March 31, 2011, when compared to the same period in 2010, resulted primarily from improved credit quality in unfunded commitments in the Midwest and Texas market. The Corporation establishes this provision to maintain an adequate allowance to cover probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments, which is discussed under the “Credit Risk” subheading in the “Risk Management” section of this financial review. Lending-related commitment charge-offs were insignificant in both the three month periods ended March 31, 2011 and 2010.  An analysis of allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets is presented under the “Credit Risk” subheading in the “Risk Management” section of this financial review.  Management expects net credit-related charge-offs between $350 million and $400 million for full-year 2011. The provision for credit losses is expected to be between $150 million and $200 million for full-year 2011. This outlook does not include any impact from the pending acquisition of Sterling Bancshares, Inc.  Noninterest Income  Noninterest income was $207 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011, an increase of $13 million, or seven percent, compared to $194 million for the same period in 2010, resulting primarily from increases of $6 million in risk management hedge gains and $5 million in net income from principal investing and warrants.  Management expects a low single-digit decline in noninterest income for full-year 2011, compared to full-year 2010, primarily due to the impact of regulatory changes. In the event that the implementation of the interchange rules under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is delayed past year-end 2011, management expects 2011 full-year noninterest income to be stable relative to 2010. This outlook does not include any impact from the pending acquisition of Sterling Bancshares, Inc.  Noninterest Expenses  Noninterest expenses were $415 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011, an increase of $11 million, or three percent, from $404 million for the comparable period in 2010, resulting primarily from an increase in salaries expense ($19 million), reflecting an increase in incentive compensation, and employee benefits expense ($6 million), partially offset by decreases in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments ($10 million) and other real estate expense ($4 million).  Management expects a low single-digit increase in noninterest expenses for full-year 2011, compared to full-year 2010, primarily due to an increase in employee benefits expense. This outlook does not include any impact from the pending acquisition of Sterling Bancshares, Inc.  Provision for Income Taxes  The provision for income taxes for the first quarter 2011 was $35 million, compared to a benefit of $5 million for the same period in 2010. The $40 million increase in the provision for income taxes in the three-month period ended March 31, 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, primarily reflects an increase in income before taxes. For further information on income taxes, refer to Note 12 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements.  Net deferred tax assets were $363 million at March 31, 2011, compared to $383 million at December 31, 2010, a decrease of $20 million, resulting primarily from a reduction in deferred tax assets due to a decrease in the allowance for loan losses. Deferred tax assets were evaluated for realization and it was determined that no valuation allowance was needed at both March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. This conclusion was based on available evidence of loss carryback capacity, projected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and assumptions made regarding future events.  Management expects income tax expense to approximate 36 percent of income before income taxes less approximately $60 million of permanent differences related to low-income housing and bank-owned life insurance. This outlook does not include any impact from the pending acquisition of Sterling Bancshares, Inc.    45    Table of Contents Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax  In the first three months of 2011, there was no income from discontinued operations, net of tax. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, in the first quarter 2010 of $17 million reflected an after-tax gain from the cash settlement of a note receivable related to the 2006 sale of an investment advisory subsidiary. For further information on the cash settlement of the note and discontinued operations, refer to Note 15 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements.  Business Segments  The Corporation’s operations are strategically aligned into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth & Institutional Management. These business segments are differentiated based on the products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, the Finance Division is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes discontinued operations and items not directly associated with these business segments or the Finance Division. Note 14 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements presents financial results of these business segments for the three months ended March 31, 2011 and 2010. For a description of the business activities of each business segment and the methodologies which form the basis for these results, refer to Note 14 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements and Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation’s 2010 Annual Report.  The following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.

The Business Bank’s net income of $167 million increased $78 million in the three months ended March 31, 2011, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2010. Net interest income (FTE) of $341 million was unchanged in the three months ended March 31, 2011 compared to the same period in the prior year, as the benefit provided by a $2.3 billion increase in average deposits was offset by a $1.3 billion decrease in average loans. The provision for loan losses of $18 million decreased $119 million from the comparable period in the prior year, reflecting decreases in the Commercial Real Estate (in all markets) and Middle Market (primarily in the Midwest market and Other Markets) business lines. Net credit-related charge-offs of $73 million decreased $64 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line, partially offset by an increase in charge-offs in the Middle Market business line. Noninterest income of $77 million increased $1 million from the comparable prior year period, primarily due to increases in warrant income ($2 million) and customer derivative income ($2 million), partially offset by a decrease in service charges on deposit accounts ($2 million). Noninterest expenses of $160 million decreased $2 million from the same period in the prior year, primarily due to decreases in the provision for credit losses on lending commitments ($10 million), other real estate expenses ($4 million), outside processing costs ($3 million) and nominal decrease in other noninterest expense categories, partially offset by increases in allocated corporate overhead expenses ($9 million) and incentive compensation ($8 million). The provision for income taxes (FTE) of $73 million for the three month period ended March 31, 2011, increased $44 million, compared to $29 million for the comparable period the prior year, primarily resulting from an increase in income before income taxes.  The net loss for the Retail Bank was $2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2011, compared to a net loss of $7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2010. Net interest income (FTE) of $139 million increased $9 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in loan and deposit spreads and the benefit provided by a $642 million increase in average deposits, partially offset by a $493 million decrease in average loans. The provision for loan losses decreased $8 million from the comparable period in the prior year, reflecting decreases in the Small Business (primarily the Midwest market) and Personal Banking business lines. Net credit-related charge-offs of $23 million decreased $3 million from the comparable period in the prior    46    Table of Contents  year, due to decreases in charge-offs in the Small Business and Personal Banking business lines. Noninterest income of $42 million decreased $2 million from the comparable prior year period, primarily due to a $2 million decline in service charges on deposit accounts. Noninterest expenses of $162 million increased $8 million from the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in allocated corporate overhead expenses ($5 million).  Wealth & Institutional Management’s net income of $14 million increased $3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2011, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2010. Net interest income (FTE) of $44 million increased $2 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to increases in loan and deposit spreads. The provision for loan losses decreased $4 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting decreases in the Midwest and Western markets, partially offset by an increase in the Florida market. Net credit-related charge-offs of $5 million decreased $5 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in the Private Banking business line. Noninterest income of $64 million increased $4 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to nominal increases in various noninterest income categories. Noninterest expenses of $78 million increased $5 million, primarily due to an increase in allocated corporate overhead expense ($3 million).  The net loss for the Finance Division was $76 million in the three months ended March 31, 2011, compared to a net loss of $59 million in the three months ended March 31, 2010. Net interest expense (FTE) increased $30 million in the three months ended March 31, 2011, compared to the same period in the prior year. Net interest expense (FTE) in the Finance Division is primarily impacted by the Corporation’s internal funds transfer methodology. The methodology is designed to centralize interest rate risk in the Finance Division and to measure profitability across all interest rate environments. To that end, the Finance Division pays the three major business segments for the long-term value of deposits based on their assumed lives. The three major business segments pay the Finance Division for funding based on the repricing and term characteristics of their loans. Noninterest income increased $4 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a $6 million increase in risk management hedge income, partially offset by a $2 million gain on the repurchase of subordinated debt in the first quarter 2010. Noninterest expenses increased $1 million in the first quarter 2011 compared to the same period in the prior year.  The Other category’s net income decreased $18 million in the three months ended March 31, 2011, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2010. The decrease in net income primarily reflected the $17 million after-tax discontinued operations gain recorded in the first quarter 2010.  Market Segments  The Corporation’s management accounting system also produces market segment results for the Corporation’s four primary geographic markets: Midwest, Western, Texas and Florida. In addition to the four primary geographic markets, Other Markets and International are also reported as market segments.

These increases were more than offset by decreases in the Mortgage Banker Finance ($535 million), included in Specialty Businesses, and Commercial Real Estate ($324 million) business lines. Mortgage Banker Finance provides short-term financing to borrowers in the mortgage banking industry who originate and refinance residential mortgage loans which they subsequently sell in the secondary market (mortgage warehousing loans). Average loans in Mortgage Banker Finance, included in “Commercial Loans” on the consolidated balance sheets, declined 49 percent to $566 million at March 31, 2011, compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2010, primarily due to a decline in consumer refinance volumes in the first quarter 2011 compared to the fourth quarter 2010. Average loans in the Commercial Real Estate line of business continued to run-off as expected. By market, increases in average loans in the Texas ($389 million) and International ($126 million) markets were more than offset by decreases in Other Markets ($691 million), which included Mortgage Banker Finance, the Midwest ($115 million) and Western ($114 million) markets.  Management anticipates the crisis in Japan, triggered by natural disasters, will cause a disruption in the automotive supply chain which may result in a temporary decline in average loans outstanding in the National Dealer Services business line from the first quarter 2011.  Management expects average earning assets of approximately $48.5 billion for the full-year 2011, reflecting lower excess liquidity in addition to a low single-digit decrease in average loans for full-year 2011 compared to full-year 2010. Excluding the Commercial Real Estate business line, management expects a low single-digit increase in average loans for full-year 2011 compared to full-year 2010. This outlook does not include any impact from the pending acquisition of Sterling Bancshares, Inc.  Total liabilities increased $1.3 billion, or three percent, to $49.1 billion at March 31, 2011, compared to December 31, 2010, primarily due to a $1.4 billion increase in total deposits. On an average basis, liabilities were    50    Table of Contents  $47.9 billion for both the first quarter 2011 and fourth quarter 2010. Average core deposits, which exclude other time deposits and foreign office time deposits, were $40.2 billion for the first quarter 2011, compared to $39.9 billion for the fourth quarter 2010, primarily reflecting an increase of $495 million in money market and NOW deposits, partially offset by decreases of $148 million in noninterest-bearing deposits and $93 million in customer certificates of deposit. Within average core deposits, increases from the fourth quarter 2010 to the first quarter 2011 were noted in the Global Corporate Banking ($351 million), Technology and Life Sciences ($231 million) and Personal Banking ($181 million) business lines, partially offset by decreases in the Middle Market ($160 million), Financial Services Division ($150 million) and Commercial Real Estate ($103 million) business lines. By market, average core deposits increased in the Midwest ($271 million) and Texas ($229 million) markets in the first quarter 2011, compared to the fourth quarter 2010, partially offset by a decrease in the Western market ($216 million).

(b) The Corporation made no repurchases of warrants under the repurchase program during the three months ended March 31, 2011.    (c) Maximum number of shares and warrants that may yet be purchased under the publicly announced plans or programs.  Management expects to continue the share repurchase program that, combined with dividend payments, results in a payout up to 50 percent of earnings for full-year 2011.  Risk-based regulatory capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in credit risk profiles among banking institutions and to account for off-balance sheet exposure. Assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with specified risk-weighting factors. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items. As shown in the table below, the Tier 1 common capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, Total risk-based capital and leverage ratios increased from December 31, 2010 to March 31, 2011. These increases were primarily due to a decrease in risk-weighted assets resulting from a decrease in loans, partially offset by an increase in interest-bearing deposits with banks, which carry a lower risk weight. The tangible common equity ratio    51    Table of Contents  decreased 11 basis points primarily due to an increase in tangible assets, reflecting an increase in interest-bearing deposits with banks, partially offset by a decrease in loans.  In December 2009, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee) released proposed Basel III guidance on bank capital and liquidity. In September 2010, the Basel Committee proposed higher global minimum capital standards, including a minimum Tier 1 common capital ratio and additional capital and liquidity requirements, with rules expected to be implemented between 2013 and 2019. Adoption in the U.S. is expected to occur over a similar timeframe, but the final form of the U.S. rules is uncertain. The Corporation believes that the expected impacts from changes in the components of capital and the calculation of risk-weighted assets would not be material. A higher degree of uncertainty exists regarding the implementation and interpretation of the liquidity rules. If subject to these rules, the Corporation expects the liquidity requirements to be manageable. While uncertainty exists in both the final form of the Basel III guidance and whether or not the Corporation will be required to adopt the guidelines, the Corporation is closely monitoring the development of the guidance.  The Corporation’s capital ratios exceeded minimum regulatory requirements as follows:                             March 31, 2011     December 31, 2010     (dollar amounts in millions)   Capital     Ratio     Capital     Ratio     Tier 1 common (a) (b)   $ 6,105       10.37 %    $ 6,027       10.13 %    Tier 1 risk-based (4.00% - minimum) (b)     6,105       10.37       6,027       10.13     Total risk-based (8.00% - minimum) (b)     8,726       14.83       8,651       14.54     Leverage (3.00% - minimum) (b)     6,105       11.37       6,027       11.26     Tangible common equity (a)     5,722       10.43       5,637       10.54                 (a) See Supplemental Financial Data section for reconcilements of non-GAAP financial measures.

At March 31, 2011, the Corporation and its U.S. banking subsidiaries exceeded the ratios required for an institution to be considered “well capitalized” (Tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based capital and leverage ratios greater than six percent, 10 percent and five percent, respectively).  Risk Management  The following updated information should be read in conjunction with the “Risk Management” section on pages 38-60 in the Corporation’s 2010 Annual Report.  Credit Risk  Allowance for Credit Losses and Nonperforming Assets  The allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The allowance for loan losses represents management’s assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporation’s loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain loans and loan relationships, and allowances for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics for the remaining business and retail loans. The Corporation defines business loans as those belonging to the commercial, real estate construction, commercial mortgage, lease financing and international loan portfolios. Retail loans consist of traditional residential mortgage, home equity and other consumer loans.  The total allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb incurred losses inherent in the total loan portfolio. Unanticipated economic events, including political, economic and regulatory instability could cause changes in the credit characteristics of the portfolio and result in an unanticipated increase in the allowance. Inclusion of other industry-specific portfolio exposures in the allowance, as well as significant increases in the current portfolio exposures, could also increase the amount of the allowance. Any of these events, or some combination thereof, may result in the need for additional provision for loan losses in order to maintain an allowance that complies with credit risk and accounting policies. The allowance for loan losses was $849 million at March 31, 2011, compared to $901 million at December 31, 2010, a decrease of $52 million, or six percent. The decrease resulted primarily from improvements in credit quality, including a decline of $376 million in the Corporation’s watch list loans from December 31, 2010 to March 31, 2011, and a decrease in loan balances. The decrease in the allowance for loan losses consisted of decreases in the Midwest and Other Markets of the Middle Market business line and the Commercial Real Estate (primarily the Western market) and Global Corporate Banking business lines, partially    52    Table of Contents  offset by increases in the Western Market of the Middle Market business line and the Private Banking business line. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total period-end loans was 2.17 percent at March 31, 2011, compared to 2.24 percent at December 31, 2010. Nonperforming loans of $1.0 billion at March 31, 2011 decreased $93 million, compared to December 31, 2010. All large nonperforming loans are individually reviewed each quarter for potential charge-offs and reserves. Charge-offs are taken as amounts are determined to be uncollectible. A measure of the level of charge-offs already taken on nonperforming loans is the current book balance as a percentage of the contractual amount owed. At both March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, nonperforming loans were charged-off to 54 percent of the contractual amount. This level of write-downs is consistent with losses experienced on loan defaults in the first three months of 2011 and in recent years. The allowance as a percentage of total nonperforming loans, a ratio which results from the actions noted above, was 82 percent at March 31, 2011, compared to 80 percent at December 31, 2010. The Corporation’s loan portfolio is primarily composed of business loans, which, in the event of default, are typically carried on the books at fair value as nonperforming assets for a longer period of time than are consumer loans, resulting in a lower nonperforming loan allowance coverage when compared to banking organizations with higher concentrations of consumer loans.  The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in “accrued expenses and other liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets, includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain letters of credit in a manner consistent with business loans, and allowances based on the pool of the remaining letters of credit and all unused commitments to extend credit with each internal risk rating. A probability of draw estimate is applied to the commitment amount, and the result is multiplied by standard reserve factors consistent with business loans. In general, the probability of draw for letters of credit is considered certain for all letters of credit supporting loans and for letters of credit assigned an internal risk rating generally consistent with regulatory defined substandard or doubtful. Other letters of credit and all unfunded commitments have a lower probability of draw.  The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $32 million at March 31, 2011, a decrease of $3 million from $35 million at December 31, 2010.    53    Table of Contents Nonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, loans which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans) and real estate which has been acquired through foreclosure and awaiting disposition (foreclosed property). Nonperforming assets decreased $131 million to $1.1 billion at March 31, 2011, from $1.2 billion at December 31, 2010, and are summarized in the following table.

There were 21 loan relationships with balances greater than $2 million, totaling $166 million, transferred to nonaccrual status in the first quarter 2011, a decrease of $14 million from $180 million in the fourth quarter 2010. Of the transfers to nonaccrual in the first quarter 2011, $101 million were from the Middle Market business line, primarily in the Midwest Market and Other Markets and $37 million were from Commercial Real Estate business line in the Midwest market. There were 4 loan relationships greater than $10 million, totaling $98 million, transferred to nonaccrual in the first quarter 2011, including $61 million and $37 million to companies in the Middle Market and Commercial Real Estate business lines, respectively.  In the first quarter of 2011, the Corporation sold $60 million of nonaccrual business loans at prices approximating carrying value plus reserves, which were substantially all from the Commercial Real Estate and Global Corporate Banking business lines.    55    Table of Contents The following table presents a summary of nonaccrual loans at March 31, 2011 and loan relationships transferred to nonaccrual and net loan charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2011, based primarily on the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) industry categories.

(b) Consumer, excluding residential mortgage and certain personal purpose, nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs, are included in the “Other” category.  Business loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when management determines that full collection of principal or interest is unlikely or when principal or interest payments are 90 days past due, unless the loan is fully collateralized and in the process of collection. Residential mortgage and home equity loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status and charged off to current appraised values, less costs to sell, during the foreclosure process, normally no later than 180 days past due. Other consumer loans are generally not placed on nonaccrual status and are charged off at no later than 120 days past due, earlier if deemed uncollectible. Loan amounts in excess of probable future cash collections are charged off to an amount that management ultimately expects to collect. At the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, interest previously accrued but not collected is charged against current income. Income on such loans is then recognized only to the extent that cash is received and the future collection of principal is probable. Generally, a loan may be returned to accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest have been received and the Corporation expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest, or when the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. For a further discussion of impaired loans refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation’s 2010 Annual Report.  At March 31, 2011, troubled debt restructurings totaled $202 million, of which $146 million were included in nonperforming loans ($112 million nonaccrual loans and $34 million reduced-rate loans) and $56 million were included in performing loans. Performing restructured loans included $41 million of commercial loans (mostly in the Middle Market business line) and $14 million of commercial mortgage loans (across several business lines) at March 31, 2011. At December 31, 2010, troubled debt restructurings totaled $165 million, including $44 million performing restructured loans, $78 million nonaccrual loans and $43 million reduced-rate loans. The $37 million increase in troubled debt restructurings was primarily due to increases in the Technology and Life Sciences and Middle Market business lines.  Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest generally represent loans that are well collateralized and in a continuing process that is expected to result in repayment or restoration to current status. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing increased $10 million, to $72 million at March 31, 2011, compared to $62 million at December 31, 2010 and are summarized in the following table. Loans past due 30-89 days increased $92 million to $373 million at March 31, 2011, compared to $281 million at December 31, 2010.    56    Table of Contents Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing are summarized in the following table.

(b) Primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate.  The Corporation limits risk inherent in its commercial real estate lending activities by limiting exposure to those borrowers directly involved in the commercial real estate markets and adhering to conservative policies on loan-to-value ratios for such loans. Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $11.7 billion at March 31, 2011, of which $3.5 billion, or 30 percent, were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to residential real estate investors and developers. The remaining $8.2 billion, or 70 percent, of commercial real estate loans in other business lines consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans.  The real estate construction portfolio totaled $2.0 billion at March 31, 2011. The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-time customers with satisfactory completion experience. However, the significant and sudden decline in residential real estate activity that began in late 2008 in the Western, Florida and Midwest markets proved extremely difficult for many of the smaller residential real estate developers. Of the $1.6 billion of real estate construction loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line, $195 million were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2011, including single family projects totaling $63 million (primarily in the Western and Florida markets), residential land development projects totaling $53 million (primarily in the Western market), multi-use projects totaling $46 million (primarily in the Western market) and retail projects totaling $25 million (Western and Midwest markets). Real estate construction loan net charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011, including $3 million from multi-use projects (Western market), $3 million from single family projects (primarily the Western market) and $2 million from multi-family projects (primarily the Florida market).  The commercial mortgage loan portfolio totaled $9.7 billion at March 31, 2011 and included $1.9 billion in the Commercial Real Estate business line and $7.8 billion in other business lines. Of the $1.9 billion of commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line, $197 million were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2011, including retail projects totaling $55 million (primarily in the Midwest market), multi-family projects totaling $28 million (primarily in the Florida market), single family projects totaling $25 million (primarily in the Other Markets) and residential land carry projects totaling $24 million. Commercial mortgage loan net charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011, primarily including net charge-offs of $3 million from retail projects (Midwest market) and $2 million from multi-use projects (Midwest market), partially offset by a $4 million net recovery from residential land carry projects (primarily in the Western market).    58    Table of Contents The geographic distribution and project type of commercial real estate loans are important factors in diversifying credit risk within the portfolio.

Residential mortgages totaled $1.6 billion at March 31, 2011, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.6 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $58 million were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2011. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.6 billion at March 31, 2011, of which $1.5 billion was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit and $197 million consisted of closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.6 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $6 million were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2011. A substantial majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens.  The Corporation rarely originates residential real estate loans with a loan-to-value ratio above 100 percent at origination, has no sub-prime mortgage programs and does not originate payment-option adjustable-rate mortgages or other nontraditional mortgages that allow negative amortization. A significant majority of residential mortgage originations are sold in the secondary market. Since 2008, the Corporation has used a third party to originate, document and underwrite residential mortgage loans on behalf of the Corporation. Under this arrangement, the third party assumes any repurchase liability for the loans it originates. The Corporation has repurchase liability exposure for residential mortgage loans originated prior to 2008, however based on historical experience, the Corporation believes such exposure, which could be triggered by early payment defaults by borrowers or by underwriting discrepancies, is minimal. The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation’s primary geographic markets. The economic recession and significant declines in home values in the Western, Florida and Midwest markets following the financial market turmoil beginning in the fall of 2008 adversely impacted the residential real estate portfolio. At March 31, 2011, the Corporation estimated that, of the $17 million total residential mortgage loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest, approximately $2 million exceeded 90 percent of the current value of the underlying collateral, based on S&P/Case-Shiller home price indices. To account for this exposure, the Corporation factors changes in home values into estimated loss ratios for residential real estate loans, using index-based estimates by major metropolitan area, resulting in an increased allowance allocated for residential real estate loans when home values decline. Additionally, to mitigate increasing credit exposure due to depreciating home values, the Corporation periodically reviews home equity lines of credit and makes line reductions or converts outstanding balances at line maturity to closed-end, amortizing loans when necessary.  Shared National Credits  Shared National Credit (SNC) loans are facilities greater than $20 million shared by three or more federally supervised financial institutions that are reviewed by regulatory authorities at the agent bank level. The Corporation generally seeks to obtain ancillary business at the origination of a SNC relationship. Loans classified as SNC loans (approximately 920 borrowers at March 31, 2011) totaled $7.3 billion at both March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. SNC net loan charge-offs totaled $1 million and $17 million for the three- periods ended March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. SNC loans, diversified by both business line and geographic market, comprised approximately 19 percent and 18 percent of total loans at March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. SNC loans are held to the same credit underwriting standards as the remainder of the loan portfolio and face similar credit challenges.  Automotive Lending  Loans to borrowers involved with automotive production totaled approximately $900 million at March 31, 2011, compared to $831 million at December 31, 2010. Loans in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $4.0 billion at both March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. Of the $4.0 billion of outstanding loans in the National Dealer Services business line at March 31, 2011, approximately $2.5 billion, or 62 percent, were to foreign franchises, $1.0 billion, or 26 percent, were to domestic franchises and $469 million, or 12 percent, were to other. Other dealer loans include obligations where a primary franchise was indeterminable, such as loans to large public dealership consolidators and rental car, leasing, heavy truck and recreation vehicle companies.  For further discussion of credit risk, see the “Credit Risk” section on pages 38-52 in the Corporation’s 2010 Annual Report.    60    Table of Contents Market and Liquidity Risk  Interest Rate Risk  Net interest income is the predominant source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises primarily through the Corporation’s core business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits. The Corporation’s balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by a combination of core deposits and wholesale borrowings. Approximately 80 percent of the Corporation’s loans were floating at March 31, 2011, of which approximately 70 percent were based on LIBOR and 30 percent were based on prime. This creates a natural imbalance between the floating-rate loan portfolio and the more slowly repricing deposit products. The result is that growth and/or contraction in the Corporation’s core businesses will lead to sensitivity to interest rate movements without mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing investment securities, primarily fixed-rate, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, and hedging the sensitivity with interest rate swaps. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk, with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.  The Corporation frequently evaluates net interest income under various balance sheet and interest rate scenarios, looking at both 12 and 24 month time horizons, using simulation modeling analysis as its principal risk management evaluation technique. The results of these analyses provide the information needed to assess the balance sheet structure. Changes in economic activity, whether domestic or international, different from those management included in its simulation analyses could translate into a materially different interest rate environment than currently expected. Management evaluates a base case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment and what is believed to be the most likely balance sheet structure. This base case net interest income is then evaluated against non-parallel interest rate scenarios that increase and decrease 200 basis points in a linear fashion from the base case over twelve months resulting in a 100 basis points average change in interest rates over the period. Due to the current low level of interest rates, the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of a 25 basis point drop, to zero percent. In addition, consistent with each interest rate scenario, adjustments to asset prepayment levels, yield curves, and overall balance sheet mix and growth assumptions are made. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model may not precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions and management strategies, among other factors. However, the model can indicate the likely direction of change. Existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes are included in these analyses, but no additional hedging is forecasted.  The table below, as of March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above.                            March 31, 2011     December 31, 2010     (dollar amounts in millions)   Amount     %     Amount     %     Sensitivity on net interest income to changes in interest rates:                       +200 basis points   $ 101       7 %    $ 104       7 %    - 25 basis points (to zero percent)     (16 )      (1 )      (15 )      (1 )              61    Table of Contents In addition to the simulation analysis, an economic value of equity analysis is performed for a longer term view of the interest rate risk position. The economic value of equity analysis begins with an estimate of the economic value of the financial assets and liabilities on the Corporation’s balance sheet, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period, and then applies the estimated impact of rate movements to the economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments. The economic value of equity is then calculated as the difference between the estimated market value of assets and liabilities net of the impact of off-balance sheet instruments. As with net interest income shocks, a variety of alternative scenarios are performed to measure the impact on economic value of equity, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve.  The table below, as of March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from a 200 basis point immediate parallel increase or decrease in interest rates. Similar to the simulation analysis above, due to the current low level of interest rates, the economic value of equity analyses below reflect an interest rate scenario of an immediate 25 basis point drop, to zero percent, while the rising interest rate scenario reflects an immediate 200 basis point rise. The change in the sensitivity of the economic value of equity to a 200 basis point parallel increase in rates between December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2011 was primarily driven by changes in market interest rates, deposit mix, and the Corporation’s mortgage-backed securities portfolio’s forecasted prepayments.

Liquid assets, which totaled $9.7 billion at March 31, 2011, compared to $7.8 billion at December 31, 2010, provide a reservoir of liquidity. Liquid assets include cash and due from bank, federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell, interest-bearing deposits with banks, other short-term investments and unencumbered investment securities available-for-sale. At March 31, 2011, the Corporation held excess liquidity, represented by $3.5 billion deposited with the FRB, compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2010.  The Corporation may access the purchased funds market when necessary, which includes certificates of deposit issued to institutional investors in denominations in excess of $100,000 and to retail customers in denominations of less than $100,000 through brokers (“other time deposits” on the consolidated balance sheets), foreign office time deposits and short-term borrowings. Purchased funds totaled $560 million at March 31, 2011, compared to $562 million at December 31, 2010. Capacity for incremental purchased funds at March 31, 2011, consisted largely of federal funds purchased, brokered certificates of deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. In addition, the Corporation is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, Texas (FHLB), which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. The actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. As of March 31, 2011, the Corporation had $2.5 billion of outstanding borrowings from the FHLB with remaining maturities ranging from June 2011 to May 2014. The Corporation also maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and/or equity securities. Additionally, the Bank had the ability to issue up to $14.0 billion of debt at March 31, 2011 under an existing $15 billion medium-term senior note program which allows the issuance of debt with maturities between three months and 30 years.  Other Market Risks  Certain components of the Corporation’s noninterest income, primarily fiduciary income, are at risk to fluctuations in the market values of underlying assets, particularly equity and debt securities. Other components of noninterest income, primarily brokerage fees, are at risk to changes in the volume of market activity.  At March 31, 2011, the Corporation had a $18 million portfolio of investments in indirect private equity and venture capital funds, with commitments of $8 million to fund additional investments in future periods, compared to a portfolio of $47 million at December 31, 2010. In the first quarter 2011, the Corporation sold 44 funds for a total of $31 million and recognized a net gain of $2 million. The value of these investments is at risk to changes in equity markets, general economic conditions and a variety of other factors. The majority of these investments are not readily marketable and are included in “accrued income and other assets” on the consolidated    62    Table of Contents  balance sheets. The investments are individually reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value.  For further discussion of market risk, see Note 6 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements and pages 52-59 in the Corporation’s 2010 Annual Report.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act  On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Financial Reform Act”) was signed into law. The Financial Reform Act provides for, among other matters, increased regulatory supervision and examination of financial institutions, the imposition of more stringent capital requirements on financial institutions and increased regulation of derivatives and hedging transactions. Provided below is an overview of key elements of the Financial Reform Act relevant to the Corporation. Most of the provisions contained in the Financial Reform Act will be effective immediately upon enactment; however, many have delayed effective dates. Implementation of the Financial Reform Act will require many new mandatory and discretionary rules to be made by federal regulatory agencies over the next several years. The estimates of the impact on the Corporation discussed below are based on the limited information currently available and, given the uncertainty of the timing and scope of the impact, are subject to change until final rulemaking is complete.        •    Interest on Demand Deposits: Allows interest on commercial demand deposits, which could lead to increased cost of commercial demand deposits, depending on the interplay of interest, deposit credits and service charges.        •    Unlimited Deposit Insurance Extension: Provides unlimited deposit insurance on noninterest-bearing accounts from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2012. There will not be a separate assessment for unlimited deposit insurance coverage for this period.        •    Deposit Insurance: Changes the definition of assessment base from domestic deposits to net assets (average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity), increases the deposit insurance fund’s minimum reserve ratio and permanently increases general deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 to $250,000. The Corporation expects 2011 FDIC insurance expense to be slightly lower than the 2010 expense.        •    Derivatives: Allows continued trading of foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives. Requires banks to shift energy, uncleared commodities and agriculture derivatives to a separately capitalized subsidiary within their holding company. Directly impacts client-driven energy derivatives business (approximately $1 million in annual revenue, based on full-year 2010).        •    Interchange Fee: Limits debit card transaction processing fees that card issuers can charge to merchants. Based on the options currently contemplated in the draft, estimated annual revenue from debit card PIN and signature-based interchange fees in 2011 is expected to decrease by approximately $13 million to $15 million.        •    Trust Preferred Securities: Prohibits holding companies with more than $15 billion in assets from including trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital, and allows for a phase-in period of three years, beginning January 1, 2013. As of March 31, 2011, the Corporation had no outstanding trust preferred securities.  Critical Accounting Policies  The Corporation’s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation’s 2010 Annual Report. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation’s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2010, the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to allowance for credit losses, valuation methodologies, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages 60-68 in the Corporation’s 2010 Annual Report. As of the date of this report, the Corporation does not believe that there has been a material change in the nature or categories of the critical accounting policies or estimates and assumptions from those discussed in the Corporation’s 2010 Annual Report.    63    Table of Contents Supplemental Financial Data  The following tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this financial review with financial measures defined by GAAP.

(b) Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as defined by regulation.    (c) March 31, 2011 Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets are estimated.  The net interest margin (FTE), excluding excess liquidity, removes interest earned on balances deposited with the FRB from net interest income (FTE) and average balances deposited with the FRB from average earning assets from the numerator and denominator of the net interest margin (FTE) ratio, respectively. The Corporation believes this measurement provides meaningful information to investors, regulators, management and others of the impact on net interest income and net interest margin resulting from the Corporation’s short-term investment in low yielding instruments.    64    Table of Contents The Tier 1 common capital ratio removes preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations. The tangible common equity ratio removes preferred stock and the effect of intangible assets from capital and the effect of intangible assets from total assets. The Corporation believes these measurements are meaningful measures of capital adequacy used by investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and to compare against other companies in the industry.      ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  Quantitative and qualitative disclosures for the current period can be found in the “Market and Liquidity Risk” section of “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”      ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures      (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Corporation maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Corporation’s management, including the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management has evaluated, with the participation of the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report (the “Evaluation Date”). Based on the evaluation, the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.      (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. During the period to which this report relates, there have not been any changes in the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, such controls.
