For any forward-looking statements made in this report or in any documents, the Corporation claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.37Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe Corporation recently announced the implementation of its efficiency and revenue initiative ("GEAR Up"). Results for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 included restructuring charges of $53 million ($34 million, after-tax, or $0.19 per share), associated with this initiative. More information regarding GEAR Up is provided under the "Growth in Efficiency and Revenue Initiative" subheading below.Net income for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was $104 million, a decrease of $31 million from $135 million  reported for the three months ended June 30, 2015. Excluding the $34 million after-tax impact of the second quarter 2016 restructuring charges and the $19 million after-tax impact of a $30 million net release of litigation reserves in the second quarter 2015, net income increased $22 million, primarily reflecting increases in net interest income and noninterest income. Net income per diluted common share was $0.58 and $0.73 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and average diluted common shares were 177 million and 182 million for each respective period.Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $164 million, a decrease of $105 million from $269 million  reported for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Excluding the $34 million after-tax impact of the second quarter 2016 restructuring charges and the $19 million after-tax impact of the second quarter 2015 net release of litigation reserves, net income decreased $52 million, primarily reflecting an increase in the provision for credit losses in the first quarter 2016, partially offset by an increase in net interest income. Net income per diluted common share was $0.92 and $1.46 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Average diluted common shares were 177 million and 182 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.Growth in Efficiency and Revenue InitiativeThe initial GEAR Up initiative is expected to drive additional annual pre-tax income, before restructuring charges, of approximately $230 million for full-year 2018 from the actions identified to-date. The Corporation is continuing to identify additional opportunities to further enhance profitability.•Revenue enhancements expected to gradually ramp-up to approximately $30 million for full-year 2017, gradually increasing to approximately $70 million for full-year 2018, through expanded product offerings, enhanced sales tools and training, re-aligned employee incentives and enhanced customer analytics to drive opportunities.•Expense reductions expected to save approximately $20 million in the fourth quarter 2016, approximately $110 million for full-year 2017, and approximately $160 million for full-year 2018. This is to be achieved through an approximately 9 percent reduction in workforce, streamlining operational processes, real estate optimization including consolidating about 40 banking centers as well as reducing office and operations space, selective outsourcing of technology functions and reduction of technology system applications.•Pre-tax restructuring charges of $140 million to $160 million in total are expected to be incurred through 2018, including an estimated $90 million to $110 million by year-end 2016. Restructuring charges totaling $53 million were incurred through June 30, 2016. For additional information regarding restructuring charges, refer to Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.Full-Year 2016 Outlook Compared to Full-Year 2015Management expectations for full-year 2016 compared to full-year 2015, assuming a continuation of the current economic and low-rate environment, are as follows:•Average loans modestly higher, in line with real Gross Domestic Product growth, reflecting a continued decline in Energy more than offset by increases in most other lines of business. Seasonality in National Dealer Services, Mortgage Banker and Middle Market to impact the second half of the year.•Net interest income higher, primarily reflecting the benefits from the December 2015 short-term rate increase, loan growth and a larger securities portfolio.•Provision for credit losses higher, reflecting the first quarter 2016 reserve build for Energy, with net charge-offs for the remainder of the year between 35 basis points and 45 basis points. Additional reserve changes dependent on developments in the oil and gas sector. Continued solid credit quality in the remainder of the portfolio, with metrics, absent Energy, better than historical norms.•Noninterest income modestly higher, with continued focus on cross-sell opportunities, including card, fiduciary and brokerage services offset by lower market-driven fees, including commercial lending fees, investment banking fees, derivative income and warrant income. Benefits from GEAR Up expected to begin in early 2017.•Noninterest expenses higher, with an estimated $90 million to $110 million in restructuring expense, related GEAR Up expense savings of approximately $20 million, increased outside processing in line with growing revenue, higher FDIC insurance expense in part due to regulatory surcharge, and typical inflationary pressures. Additionally, 2015 benefited from $33 million in legal reserve releases, which is offset by lower pension expense in 2016.38Table of Contents•Income tax expense to approximate 30 percent of pre-tax income.Net Interest IncomeThe "Quarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume" table that follows provides an analysis of net interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 and details the components of the change in net interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year.Quarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 June 30, 2015(dollar amounts in millions)AverageBalanceInterestAverageRate (a) AverageBalanceInterestAverageRate (a)Commercial loans$31,511$2513.23% $31,788$2423.07%Real estate construction loans2,429223.62 1,807163.51Commercial mortgage loans9,033783.47 8,672733.38Lease financing73041.98 79563.19International loans1,396133.63 1,453133.68Residential mortgage loans1,880173.76 1,877183.78Consumer loans2,490213.37 2,441203.25Total loans49,4694063.31 48,8333883.20        Mortgage-backed securities (b)9,326512.21 9,057502.23Other investment securities3,008111.50 87931.16Total investment securities (b)12,334622.03 9,936532.13        Interest-bearing deposits with banks3,69050.50 5,11030.25Other short-term investments104—0.58 102—0.42Total earning assets65,5974732.91 63,9814442.79        Cash and due from banks1,074   1,041  Allowance for loan losses(749)   (613)  Accrued income and other assets4,746   4,554  Total assets$70,668   $68,963          Money market and interest-bearing checking deposits$22,78560.11 $23,65960.11Savings deposits2,010—0.02 1,834—0.02Customer certificates of deposit3,32040.40 4,42240.37Foreign office time deposits30—0.35 11811.26Total interest-bearing deposits28,145100.14 30,033110.14Short-term borrowings159—0.45 78—0.04Medium- and long-term debt5,072181.42 2,661121.83Total interest-bearing sources33,376280.33 32,772230.28        Noninterest-bearing deposits28,376   27,365  Accrued expenses and other liabilities1,262   1,314  Total shareholders’ equity7,654   7,512  Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity$70,668   $68,963          Net interest income/rate spread $4452.58  $4212.51        Impact of net noninterest-bearing sources of funds  0.16   0.14Net interest margin (as a percentage of average earning assets)  2.74%   2.65%(a)Fully taxable equivalent.(b)Includes investment securities available-for-sale and investment securities held-to-maturity.39Table of ContentsQuarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume (continued) Three Months Ended June 30, 2016/June 30, 2015(in millions)Increase(Decrease)Due to RateIncrease(Decrease)Due to Volume (a)NetIncrease(Decrease)Interest Income:      Loans$12 $6 $18 Investment securities (b)1 8 9 Interest-bearing deposits with banks3 (1) 2 Total interest income16 13 29 Interest Expense:      Interest-bearing deposits— (1) (1) Medium- and long-term debt(2) 8 6 Total interest expense(2) 7 5 Net interest income$18 $6 $24 (a)Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume.(b)Includes investment securities available-for-sale and investment securities held-to-maturity.Net interest income was $445 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $24 million compared to $421 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in net interest income resulted primarily from the impact of higher yields on loans and Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) deposits, reflecting the benefit from the December 2015 short-term rate increase, loan growth and a larger investment securities portfolio, partially offset by higher funding costs, primarily the result of new Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings during the three months ended June 30, 2016. Average earning assets increased $1.6 billion, or 3 percent, to $65.6 billion, compared to $64.0 billion for the same period in 2015. The increase in average earning assets primarily reflected increases of $2.4 billion in average investment securities and $636 million in average loans, partially offset by a decrease of $1.4 billion in average FRB deposits, included in "interest-bearing deposits with banks" on the consolidated balance sheets. The net interest margin (FTE) for the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased 9 basis points to 2.74 percent, from 2.65 percent for the comparable period in 2015, primarily from higher yields on loans and the reinvestment of FRB deposits into higher yielding Treasury securities, partially offset by the impact of increased FHLB borrowings. The increase in loan yields primarily reflected the benefit from the increase in short-term rates, partially offset by the impact of a negative residual value adjustment to assets in the leasing portfolio and the impact of a higher level of nonaccrual loans in the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same period in the prior year.40Table of ContentsYear-to-Date Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 June 30, 2015(dollar amounts in millions)AverageBalanceInterestAverageRate (a) AverageBalanceInterestAverageRate (a)Commercial loans$31,162$5003.24% $31,442$4753.06%Real estate construction loans2,272413.64 1,872323.43Commercial mortgage loans8,9971583.53 8,6271463.41Lease financing728102.66 796123.12International loans1,408263.64 1,482273.69Residential mortgage loans1,886363.85 1,866353.77Consumer loans2,478413.35 2,409393.23Total loans48,9318123.34 48,4947663.19        Mortgage-backed securities (b)9,3411022.21 9,0641012.24Other investment securities3,004221.50 85851.13Total investment securities (b)12,3451242.04 9,9221062.15        Interest-bearing deposits with banks3,47890.50 5,21670.25Other short-term investments106—0.76 100—0.75Total earning assets64,8609452.94 63,7328792.79        Cash and due from banks1,071   1,034  Allowance for loan losses(714)   (607)  Accrued income and other assets4,731   4,693  Total assets$69,948   $68,852          Money market and interest-bearing checking deposits$22,989130.11 $23,809130.11Savings deposits1,973—0.02 1,810—0.02Customer certificates of deposit3,39970.40 4,42380.37Foreign office and other time deposits40—0.34 12111.36Total interest-bearing deposits28,401200.14 30,163220.14Short-term borrowings262—0.45 94—0.05Medium- and long-term debt4,083331.62 2,675231.78Total interest-bearing sources32,746530.32 32,932450.28        Noninterest-bearing deposits28,214   27,033  Accrued expenses and other liabilities1,345   1,405  Total shareholders’ equity7,643   7,482  Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity$69,948   $68,852          Net interest income/rate spread $8922.62  $8342.51        Impact of net noninterest-bearing sources of funds  0.16   0.14Net interest margin (as a percentage of average earning assets  2.78%   2.65%(a)Fully taxable equivalent.(b)Includes investment securities available-for-sale and investment securities held-to-maturity.41Table of ContentsYear-to-Date Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume Six Months Ended June 30, 2016/June 30, 2015(in millions)Increase(Decrease)Due to RateIncrease(Decrease)Due to Volume (a)NetIncrease(Decrease)Interest Income:      Loans$37 $9 $46 Investment securities (b)— 18 18 Interest-bearing deposits with banks6 (4) 2 Total interest income43 23 66 Interest Expense:      Interest-bearing deposits1 (3) (2) Medium- and long-term debt(2) 12 10 Total interest expense(1) 9 8 Net interest income$44 $14 $58 (a)Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume.(b)Includes investment securities available-for-sale and investment securities held-to-maturity.Net interest income was $892 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $58 million compared to $834 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in net interest income resulted primarily from the same reasons as described in the quarterly discussion above, as well as the benefit of one additional day in 2016. Average earning assets increased $1.1 billion, or 2 percent, to $64.9 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $63.7 billion for the same period in 2015. The increase in average earning assets primarily reflected increases of $2.4 billion in average investment securities and $437 million in average loans, partially offset by a decrease of $1.7 billion in average FRB deposits. The net interest margin (FTE) for the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased 13 basis points to 2.78 percent, from 2.65 percent for the comparable period in 2015, primarily from higher yields on loans and the reinvestment of FRB deposits into higher yielding Treasury securities, partially offset by the impact of increased FHLB borrowings. The increase in loan yields primarily reflected the benefit from the increase in short-term rates. The negative impact of a higher level of nonaccrual loans in the first six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, and a negative residual value adjustment to assets in the leasing portfolio in the second quarter 2016 were largely offset by higher interest recoveries on nonaccrual loans in the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015.For further discussion of the effects of market rates on net interest income, refer to the "Market and Liquidity Risk" section of this financial review.Provision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses was $49 million and $47 million for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $197 million and $61 million for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The provision for credit losses includes both the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments.The provision for loan losses is recorded to maintain the allowance for loan losses at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio. The provision for loan losses was $47 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $35 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The provision for the three months ended June 30, 2016 was primarily driven by Energy, Corporate Banking, and, to a lesser extent, general Middle Market and Technology and Life Sciences. In the same period in 2015, the provision was similarly driven by Energy, Technology and Life Sciences, and Corporate Banking, partially offset by credit quality improvements in the remainder of the portfolio. The provision for loan losses was $188 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of $137 million compared to $51 million for the same period in the prior year. The provision for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was primarily driven by Energy and, to a much lesser extent, general Middle Market and Corporate Banking, partially offset by the benefit from recoveries in Commercial Real Estate. In the same period in the prior year, the provision was driven by Energy and Corporate Banking, partially offset by credit quality improvements in the remainder of the portfolio.Net loan charge-offs in the three months ended June 30, 2016 increased $24 million to $42 million, or 0.34 percent of average total loans, compared to $18 million, or 0.15 percent, for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in net loan charge-offs primarily reflected increases in Energy and Private Banking, partially offset by decreases in Corporate Banking and Technology and Life Sciences. Excluding Energy, net loan charge-offs in the three months ended June 30, 2016 totaled $15 million, or 0.13 percent of average total loans. Net loan charge-offs in the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased $68 million to $94 million, or 0.39 percent of average total loans, compared to $26 million, or 0.11 percent, for the six months ended June 30, 2015. 42Table of ContentsThe increase in net loan charge-offs primarily reflected increases in Energy and Private Banking, partially offset by decreases in Commercial Real Estate and Corporate Banking. Excluding Energy, net loan charge-offs in the six months ended June 30, 2016 totaled $25 million, or 0.11 percent of average total loans.The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments is recorded to maintain the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $2 million in the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $12 million in the three months ended June 30, 2015, primarily reflecting a decrease in Energy. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to $10 million for the same period in 2015. Lending-related commitment charge-offs were $5 million and $1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $11 million and $1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The lending-related commitment charge-offs of $11 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were the result of sales of Corporate Banking and Energy unfunded commitments.For further information regarding Energy and energy-related loans, refer to the "Energy Lending" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review. An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets is presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.Noninterest Income Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,(in millions)2016 2015 2016 2015Card fees77 69 151 132Service charges on deposit accounts$55 $56 $110 $111Fiduciary income49 48 95 95Commercial lending fees22 22 42 47Letter of credit fees13 13 26 26Bank-owned life insurance9 10 18 19Foreign exchange income11 9 21 19Brokerage fees5 4 9 8Net securities losses (1) — (3) (2)Other noninterest income (a)29 27 46 54Total noninterest income$269 $258 $515 $509(a)The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income.Noninterest income increased $11 million to $269 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $258 million for the same period in 2015, primarily reflecting an increase in card fees, due to volume-driven increases from merchant payment processing services and government card programs. In other noninterest income (refer to the table below), an increase in deferred compensation asset returns (offsets an increase in deferred compensation plan expense included in noninterest expenses) was offset by a decrease in investment banking fees.Noninterest income increased $6 million to $515 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $509 million for the same period in 2015, primarily due to an increase in card fees, partially offset by decreases in other noninterest income and commercial lending fees. The increase in card fees was largely for the same reasons as described in the quarterly discussion above. The decrease in other noninterest income (refer to table below) primarily reflected decreases in investment banking fees and income from unconsolidated subsidiaries, partially offset by an increase in risk management hedge income. The decrease in commercial lending fees reflected both a decrease in commitment fees, which resulted from a combination of higher utilization levels and lower commitment totals in 2016, as well as lower syndication agent fees. The decrease in income from unconsolidated subsidiaries primarily reflected the termination of a joint venture with a payment processor in the second quarter 2015 and was more than offset by the increase in merchant payment processing services revenue included in card fees.The following table illustrates certain categories included in "other noninterest income" on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.43Table of Contents Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,(in millions)2016 2015 2016 2015Customer derivative income$6 $5 $9 $8Deferred compensation asset returns (a)5 1 — 2Insurance commissions3 2 5 5Securities trading income2 3 4 5Investment banking fees1 5 3 9Risk management hedge income1 (1) 4 (1)Income from principal investing and warrants1 1 2 1Income (loss) from unconsolidated subsidiaries(1) 1 (1) 3All other noninterest income11 10 20 22Other noninterest income$29 $27 $46 $54(a)Compensation deferred by the Corporation's officers and directors is invested based on investment selections of the officers and directors. Income earned on these assets is reported in noninterest income and the resulting change in deferred compensation plan liabilities is reported in salaries and benefits expense. Changes in income earned on deferred compensation assets are substantially offset by changes in deferred compensation plan expense.Noninterest Expenses Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,(in millions)2016 2015 2016 2015Salaries and benefits expense$247 $251 $495 $504Outside processing fee expense84 83 163 156Net occupancy expense39 39 77 77Equipment expense14 13 27 26Restructuring charges53 — 53 —Software expense30 24 59 47FDIC insurance expense14 9 25 18Advertising expense6 5 10 11Litigation-related expense— (30) — (29)Other noninterest expenses32 39 70 78Total noninterest expenses$519 $433 $979 $888Noninterest expenses increased $86 million to $519 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $433 million for the same period in 2015. Noninterest expenses increased $3 million excluding the second quarter 2016 restructuring charges of $53 million and the impact of a $30 million net release of litigation reserves in second quarter 2015. The remaining increase primarily reflected an increase in technology-related software expense and an increase in FDIC insurance premiums, partially offset by an $8 million benefit from the sale of leased assets included in other noninterest expenses in the three months ended June 30, 2016 and a decrease in salaries and benefits expense. The decrease in salaries and benefits primarily reflected decreases in pension expense and share-based compensation, partially offset by increases in deferred compensation plan expense (offset by an increase in deferred compensation asset returns included in noninterest income) and regular salaries, mostly due to the impact of merit raises.Noninterest expenses increased $91 million to $979 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to $888 million for the same period in 2015. Noninterest expenses increased $8 million excluding the second quarter 2016 restructuring charges of $53 million and the impact of a $30 million net release of litigation reserves in second quarter 2015, primarily for the same reasons as describe above, as well as higher outside processing fee expense related to revenue generating activities. The decrease in salaries and benefits primarily reflected decreases in pension expense and executive incentive expense, partially offset by an increase in regular salaries, mostly due to the impact of merit increases and one more day in 2016.Restructuring charges for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016  associated with the initial implementation of the GEAR Up initiative included $46 million of severance-related expenses and $7 million of professional services and other charges. For further discussion of restructuring charges, see Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.STRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESSThe Corporation's management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. These methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines. Restructuring charges associated with the GEAR Up initiative were assigned to the segments based on the Corporation's segment reporting methodology, which is described in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report.44Table of ContentsEffective January 1, 2016, in conjunction with the effective date for regulatory Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) requirements, the Corporation prospectively implemented an additional funds transfer pricing (FTP) charge, primarily for the cost of maintaining liquid assets to support potential draws on unfunded loan commitments and for the long-term economic cost of holding collateral for secured deposits. Business SegmentsThe Corporation's operations are strategically aligned into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based upon the products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, Finance is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes items not directly associated with these business segments or the Finance segment. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of these business segments for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.The following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.  Six Months Ended June 30,(dollar amounts in millions)2016 2015Business Bank$247 85% $369 83%Retail Bank9 3 35 8Wealth Management35 12 42 9 291 100% 446 100%Finance(127)   (178)  Other (a)—   1  Total$164   $269  (a) Includes items not directly associated with the three major business segments or the Finance Division.The Business Bank's net income of $247 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $122 million compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015. Net interest income of $716 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $24 million compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting a increase in the net funds transfer pricing (FTP) charges, partially offset by an increase in loan yields, the benefit provided by a $200 million increase in average loans and one additional day in 2016. The increase in net FTP charges primarily reflected an increase in the cost of funds due to the increase in short-term market rates, lower funding credits due to a $1.4 billion decrease in average deposits, and the new 2016 FTP charges for LCR as described above. The provision for credit losses increased $111 million to $197 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in the provision primarily reflected the increased reserves for Energy and energy-related loans. To a lesser extent, Corporate Banking and general Middle Market contributed to the increase in the provision. These increases were partially offset by improvements in credit quality in the remainder of the portfolio. Net credit-related charge-offs of $98 million increased $66 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting increases in Energy and energy-related loans, partially offset by a decrease in Commercial Real Estate. Noninterest income for the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased $1 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting a $14 million increase in card fees and small increases in several other categories of noninterest income, partially offset by decreases of $7 million in investment banking fees, $5 million in commercial lending fees and $4 million in income from unconsolidated subsidiaries (largely related to the exit in the second quarter 2015 from a joint venture that provided merchant payment processing services). Noninterest expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased $59 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Excluding restructuring charges of $26 million and the impact of a $30 million net release of litigation reserves in second quarter 2015, noninterest expenses increased $3 million, primarily reflecting an $11 million increase in corporate overhead expense, primarily reflecting increased technology expenses, partially offset by the benefit from an $8 million gain on the sale of leased assets in the second quarter 2016. A $5 million decrease in salaries and benefits expense was largely offset by an increase in outside processing fee expense tied to revenue growth and higher FDIC insurance expense.Net income for the Retail Bank of $9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $26 million, compared to $35 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Net interest income of $311 million increased $4 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016, primarily due to higher loan yields and one more day in 2016, partially offset by a higher FTP funding costs due to an increase in short-term lending rates. The FTP benefit provided by a $751 million increase in average deposits was more than offset by a lower deposit crediting rate. The provision for credit losses increased $20 million to $4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to a $16 million benefit in the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting an increase in Small Business.

Noninterest income of $91 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased $4 45Table of Contentsmillion compared to the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a $3 million increase in card fees and smaller increases in several other fee categories, partially offset by a $2 million increase in securities losses. Noninterest expenses of $384 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased $27 million from the comparable period in the prior year; primarily due to second quarter 2016 restructuring charges of $19 million and an $11 million increase in corporate overhead expense, partially offset by a $4 million decrease in salaries and benefits expense. Wealth Management's net income of $35 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $7 million, compared to $42 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Net interest income of $85 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $3 million compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting higher FTP funding costs due to an increase in short-term lending rates, partially offset by the benefit from a $96 million increase in average loans and an increase in loan yields. The FTP benefit provided by a $164 million increase in average deposits was more than offset by a lower deposit crediting rate. The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to a benefit of $10 million for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the benefit to the prior year from net loan recoveries in Private Banking. Net credit-related charge-offs were $3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to net loan recoveries of $7 million in the same period for the prior year. Noninterest income of $121 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016  increased $3 million compared to the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting a $2 million securities loss in the prior year period. Noninterest expenses of $154 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 increased $3 million from the comparable period in the prior year. Excluding restructuring charges of $8 million, noninterest expenses decreased $5 million, primarily reflecting a $4 million decrease in salaries and benefits expense as well as smaller increases in several other categories, partially offset by a $4 million increase in corporate overhead.The net loss in the Finance segment was $127 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to a net loss of $178 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. Net interest expense of $228 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 decreased $77 million, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2015, primarily reflecting a decrease in net FTP expense as a result of higher rates charged to the business segments under the Corporation's internal FTP methodology, as well as an increase due to a larger investment securities portfolio.Market SegmentsMarket segment results are provided for the Corporation's three largest geographic markets: Michigan, California and Texas.

Net unrealized gains on investment securities available-for-sale increased $191 million to a net unrealized gain of $219 million at June 30, 2016, compared to $28 million at December 31, 2015. On an average basis, investment securities increased $1.5 billion in the second quarter 2016, compared to the fourth quarter 2015, primarily reflecting the purchase of approximately $2.2 billion of U.S. Treasury securities in the fourth quarter 2015, largely from the reinvestment of Federal Reserve Bank deposits into higher yielding securities. Total liabilities decreased $731 million to $63.6 billion at June 30, 2016, compared to $64.3 billion at December 31, 2015, primarily reflecting a decrease of $3.5 billion in total deposits, partially offset by an increase of $2.9 billion in medium- and long-term debt. The decrease in total deposits was largely related to an elevated deposit level at December 31, 2015 associated with the government card program. The increase in medium- and long-term debt primarily reflected the addition of $2.8 billion of 10-year, 49Table of Contentsfloating rate Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances during the second quarter 2016. On an average basis, total liabilities decreased $1.3 billion in the second quarter 2016, compared to the fourth quarter 2015, primarily due to a decrease of $3.2 billion in total deposits, comprising a $1.9 billion decrease in interest-bearing deposits and a $1.3 billion decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits. The decrease in average total deposits primarily reflected seasonality, and, to a lesser extent, purposeful pricing discipline and strategic actions in light of new LCR rules, with the largest decreases in Corporate Banking ($1.6 billion), Municipalities ($902 million), and the Financial Services Division ($427 million). The Financial Services Division and Municipalities are included in general Middle Market.CapitalTotal shareholders' equity increased $134 million to $7.7 billion at June 30, 2016, compared to December 31, 2015.

These stress tests are a normal part of the Corporation's overall risk management and capital planning process and are part of the forecasting process used by the Corporation to conduct the enterprise-wide stress test that was part of the Federal Reserve's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). For additional information about risk management processes, refer to the "Risk Management" sections of this financial review and the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report.The Federal Reserve completed its 2016 CCAR review in June 2016 and did not object to the Corporation's 2016/2017 capital plan and capital distributions contemplated in the plan for the period ending June 30, 2017. The plan includes equity repurchases of up to $440 million for the four-quarter period commencing in the third quarter 2016 and ending in the second quarter 2017. The timing and ultimate amount of future equity repurchases will be subject to various factors, including the Corporation's overall capital position, financial performance and market conditions, including interest rates. Restructuring charges associated with the GEAR Up initiative are not expected to impact the pace of repurchases. On April 26, 2016 the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the Board) approved a 1-cent increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.22 per share, and on July 26, 2016, the Board further increased the quarterly dividend to $0.23 per share, effective with the dividend payable October 1, 2016. Also on July 26, 2016, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 10.0 million shares of Comerica Incorporated outstanding common stock, in addition to the 5.7 million shares remaining at June 30, 2016 under the Board's prior authorizations for the equity repurchase program initially approved in November 2010. Including the July 26, 2016 authorization, a total of 50.3 million shares and 14.1 million warrants (12.1 million share-equivalents) have been authorized for repurchase under the equity repurchase program since its inception in 2010. There is no expiration date for the Corporation's equity repurchase program.

The allowance for loan losses represents management's assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporation's loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in "accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets, provides for probable losses inherent in lending-related commitments, including unused commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.U.S. economic data for the second quarter of 2016 continued to show slow growth combined with weaknesses in select industries. Job growth and employment rates continued to slowly improve. Energy price levels improved compared to the previous 51Table of Contentsquarter and volatility in prices eased. Looking ahead, the Corporation expects Gross Domestic Product growth to improve through 2016 after the weak first quarter. The allowance for loan losses was $729 million at June 30, 2016, compared to $634 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $95 million, or 15 percent. The increase in the allowance for loan losses resulted primarily from a significant increase in reserves for energy and energy-related loans, partially offset by improved credit quality in the remainder of the portfolio. The increase in reserves for energy and energy-related loans reflected additional negative migration into criticized loans, primarily in the first quarter 2016, due to the deteriorating financial condition and increasing leverage of these borrowers, as well as an increased loss estimate in the event of default. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain letters of credit in a manner consistent with business loans, and allowances based on the pool of the remaining letters of credit and all unused commitments to extend credit within each internal risk rating.The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $43 million at June 30, 2016 compared to $45 million at December 31, 2015. The $2 million decrease in the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments primarily reflected a reduction in Energy unfunded commitments, partially offset by an increase in cited letters of credit. For additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses, refer to page F-40 in the "Critical Accounting Policies" section and pages F-56 through F-58 in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report. For additional information regarding energy and energy-related exposures, refer to "Energy Lending" subheading later in this section.Nonperforming AssetsNonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, troubled debt restructured loans (TDRs) which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans) and foreclosed property. TDRs include performing and nonperforming loans. Nonperforming TDRs are either on nonaccrual or reduced-rate status.

The increase in nonperforming assets primarily reflected an increase of $221 million in nonaccrual energy and energy-related loans. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and foreclosed property was 1.26 percent at June 30, 2016, compared to 0.80 percent at December 31, 2015.52Table of ContentsThe following table presents a summary of TDRs at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.(in millions)June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015Nonperforming TDRs:   Nonaccrual TDRs$186 $100Reduced-rate TDRs8 12Total nonperforming TDRs194 112Performing TDRs (a)142 128Total TDRs$336 $240(a)TDRs that do not include a reduction in the original contractual interest rate which are performing in accordance with their modified terms.At June 30, 2016, nonaccrual TDRs and performing TDRs included $104 million and $106 million of energy and energy-related loans, respectively, increases of $43 million and $26 million, respectively, compared to December 31, 2015.The following table presents a summary of changes in nonaccrual loans.

Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $11.6 billion at June 30, 2016, of which $4.4 billion, or 38 percent, were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to real estate developers, an increase of $648 million compared to December 31, 2015. The growth in Commercial Real Estate primarily reflected construction draws and term financing, mainly with existing customers who are proven developers, on projects with favorable risk characteristics (predominantly multifamily projects located in California and Texas). The remaining $7.2 billion, or 62 percent, of commercial real estate loans in other business lines consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages, which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans. In the Texas market, commercial real estate loans totaled $3.0 billion at June 30, 2016, of which $1.6 billion were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line. Substantially all of the remaining $1.4 billion were owner-occupied commercial mortgages. Loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line secured by properties located in Texas totaled $1.4 billion at June 30, 2016, primarily including $840 million for multifamily properties, $157 million for retail properties and $139 million for commercial properties. No loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line that were secured by properties located in Texas were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2016.The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-time customers with satisfactory completion experience. Credit quality in the real estate construction loan portfolio was strong, with none on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2016 compared to $1 million at December 31, 2015, and no real estate construction loan charge-offs in either of the six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Of the $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion of commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line outstanding at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, $8 million and $16 million were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Commercial mortgage loan net recoveries in the Commercial Real Estate business line were $10 million and $3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In other business lines, $36 million and $44 million of commercial mortgage loans were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Commercial mortgage loan net recoveries in other business lines were $3 million for both the six-month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.Residential Real Estate LendingThe following table summarizes the Corporation's residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios by geographic market.

Residential mortgages totaled $1.9 billion at June 30, 2016, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.9 billion of residential mortgage 55Table of Contentsloans outstanding, $26 million were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2016. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.8 billion at June 30, 2016, of which $1.7 billion was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit, $142 million were on amortizing status and $48 million were closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.8 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $28 million were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2016. A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at June 30, 2016. The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation's primary geographic markets. Substantially all residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more are placed on nonaccrual status, and substantially all junior lien home equity loans that are current or less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status if full collection of the senior position is in doubt. At no later than 180 days past due, such loans are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell.Energy LendingThe Corporation has a portfolio of energy and energy-related loans that are included primarily in "commercial loans" in the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation has over 30 years of experience in energy lending, with a focus on middle market companies in the oil and gas business. Customers in the Corporation's Energy business line (approximately 200 relationships) are engaged in three segments of the oil and gas business: exploration and production (E&P) (70 percent), midstream (17 percent) and energy services (13 percent). E&P generally includes such activities as searching for potential oil and gas fields, drilling exploratory wells and operating active wells. Commitments to E&P borrowers are subject to semi-annual borrowing base re-determinations based on a variety of factors including updated pricing (reflecting market and competitive conditions), energy reserve levels and the impact of hedging. The midstream sector is generally involved in the transportation, storage and marketing of crude and/or refined oil and gas products. The Corporation's energy services customers provide products and services primarily to the E&P segment. About 95 percent of the loans in the Energy business line are Shared National Credits (SNC), which are facilities greater than $20 million shared by three or more federally supervised institutions, reflecting the Corporation's focus on larger middle market companies that have financing needs that generally exceed internal individual borrower credit risk limits. The Corporation seeks to develop full relationships with SNC borrowers. In addition to oil and gas loans in the Energy business line, the Corporation is monitoring a portfolio of loans in other lines of business to companies that have a sizable portion of their revenue related to oil and gas or could be otherwise disproportionately negatively impacted by prolonged lower oil and gas prices ("energy-related"), primarily in general Middle Market, Corporate Banking, Small Business, and Technology and Life Sciences. These companies include downstream businesses such as refineries and petrochemical companies, companies that sell products to E&P, midstream and energy services companies, companies involved in developing new technologies for the oil and gas industry, and other similar businesses.The following table summarizes information about the Corporation's portfolio of energy and energy-related loans.

Total exposure, including unused commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, was $5.2 billion and $6.1 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The decrease in total exposure in the Energy business line primarily reflected reduced borrowing bases as a result of the spring re-determinations for E&P borrowers, resulting in about a 22 percent average reduction in total commitment for the portion reviewed, while the decrease in outstandings largely reflected energy customers taking actions to adjust their cash flow and reduce their bank debt. As of the end of June 2016, the Corporation had completed approximately 88 percent of the spring borrowing base re-determinations for E&P borrowers. While the value and coverage benefit of hedging contracts are dependent upon the underlying oil/gas price in each contract and will be different for each borrower, as of June 30, 2016, a majority of the Corporation’s E&P customers had at least 50 percent of their oil and/or gas production hedged up to the end of 2016. Approximately 95 percent of the loans outstanding and 90 percent of total exposure in the Energy business line had varying levels and types of collateral at June 30, 2016, including oil and gas reserves and pipelines, equipment, accounts receivable, inventory and other assets, or some combination thereof. Energy-related outstandings were approximately $489 million at June 30, 2016 (approximately 100 relationships), a decrease of $135 million, or 22 percent, compared to December 31, 2015.56Table of ContentsCriticized energy and energy-related loans increased $303 million in the six months ended June 30, 2016. The increase in criticized loans largely reflected the increase in criticized loans largely reflected additional negative migration due to the deteriorating financial condition and increasing leverage of these borrowers. Energy and energy-related net credit-related charge-offs totaled $34 million and $78 million for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2016, respectively, compared to net charge-offs of $2 million and $4 million for the same periods in 2015. Net credit-related charge-offs of $78 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 included $14 million from E&P, $9 million from midstream, $51 million from energy services and $4 million from the energy-related portfolio. Substantially all of the net charge-offs during the same period 2015 were from the energy-related portfolio.The Corporation's allowance methodology carefully considers the various risk elements within the loan portfolio. At June 30, 2016, the reserve allocation for energy and energy-related loans exceeded 8 percent of total energy and energy-related loans. The reserve allocation for energy and energy-related loans appropriately incorporated the changing dynamics in energy and energy-related loans described above, including, but not limited to, migration in the portfolio and the value of collateral considered in determining estimated loss given default. The Corporation continued to incorporate a qualitative reserve component for energy and energy-related loans at June 30, 2016. Refer to the “Allowance for Credit Losses” subheading earlier in this section for a discussion of changes in the allowance for loan losses as a result of the above-described events.Automotive LendingSubstantially all dealer loans are in the National Dealer Services business line. Loans in the National Dealer Services business line include floor plan financing and other loans to automotive dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in “commercial loans” in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $4.1 billion at June 30, 2016, a increase of $181 million compared to $3.9 billion at December 31, 2015. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, including $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Automotive lending also includes loans to borrowers involved with automotive production, primarily Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers. Loans to borrowers involved with automotive production totaled approximately $1.3 billion at both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.International ExposureInternational assets are subject to general risks inherent in the conduct of business in foreign countries, including economic uncertainties and each foreign government's regulations. Risk management practices minimize the risk inherent in international lending arrangements. These practices include structuring bilateral agreements or participating in bank facilities, which secure repayment from sources external to the borrower's country. Accordingly, such international outstandings are excluded from the cross-border risk of that country.The Corporation's international strategy is to focus on international companies doing business in North America, with an emphasis on the Corporation's primary geographic markets. The following table summarizes cross-border exposure to entities domiciled in European countries at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.(in millions) June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015European exposure:    Commercial and industrial $339 $285Banks and other financial institutions 26 35Total outstanding 365 320Unfunded commitments and guarantees 368 456Total European exposure (a) $733 $776(a)Primarily United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The Corporation had no exposure to Greece, Portugal or Ireland at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.For further discussion of credit risk, see the "Credit Risk" section of pages F-24 through F-33 in the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report.Market and Liquidity RiskMarket risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse movements in market rates or prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and commodity and equity prices. Liquidity risk represents the failure to meet financial obligations coming due resulting from an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding, and the inability to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significant changes in pricing, due to inadequate market depth or market disruptions.57Table of ContentsThe Asset and Liability Policy Committee (ALCO) of the Corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities. ALCO meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies, and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit gathering and risk management. The Treasury Department mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of ALCO through the actions it takes to manage the Corporation's market, liquidity and capital positions.Market Risk Analytics, within the Office of Enterprise Risk, supports ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk and coordinating all other market risks. Key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analysis of the Corporation's balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks; (ii) monitoring and reporting of the Corporation's positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines; (iii) developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions; (iv) reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval; (v) monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market risks; and (vi) developing and monitoring the interest rate risk economic capital estimate.Interest Rate RiskNet interest income is the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities, primarily through the Corporation's core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by a combination of core deposits and wholesale borrowings. Approximately 90 percent of the Corporation's loans were floating at June 30, 2016, of which approximately 80 percent were based on LIBOR and 20 percent were based on Prime. This creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the floating-rate loan portfolio and the more slowly repricing deposit products. In addition, growth and/or contraction in the Corporation's loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing investment securities, primarily fixed-rate, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, and hedging the sensitivity with interest rate swaps. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk, with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.Since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives, a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk. These techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve, utilizing multiple simulation analyses. Simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income, as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors, including, but not limited to, the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, regulatory impacts and management strategies.Sensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest RatesThe analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is management's principal risk management technique. Management models a base case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment and what is believed to be the most likely balance sheet structure. Existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes are included in the analysis, but no additional hedging is currently forecasted. These derivative instruments currently comprise interest rate swaps that convert fixed-rate long-term debt to variable rates. This base case net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which rates rise or decline in a linear, non-parallel fashion from the base case over 12 months. In the scenarios presented, short-term interest rates increase 200 basis points, resulting in an average increase in short-term interest rates of 100 basis points over the period (+200 scenario). Due to the current low level of interest rates, the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of a 50 basis point drop in short-term interest rates, to zero percent.Each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth, investment security prepayment levels, depositor behavior, yield curve changes, loan and deposit pricing, and overall balance sheet mix and growth. In the +200 scenario, assumptions related to loan growth are based on historical experience. Because deposit balances have continued to grow significantly in this persistent low rate environment, historical depositor behavior may be less indicative of future trends. As a result, the +200 scenario reflects a greater decrease in deposits than we have experienced historically as rates begin to rise. Investment securities modeling includes the replacement of prepayments and expected funding maturities. In addition, the model reflects deposit pricing based on historical price movements with short-term interest rates, and loan spreads are held at current levels. Changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis.58Table of ContentsThe table below, as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above.

The risk to declining interest rates is limited by an assumed floor on interest rates of zero percent.Sensitivity of Economic Value of Equity to Changes in Interest RatesIn addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income, an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position. The economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the Corporation's financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements. The economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel 200 basis point increase and 50 basis point decrease in interest rates.The table below, as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above.

Capacity for incremental purchased funds at June 30, 2016 included short-term FHLB advances, the ability to purchase federal funds, sell securities under agreements to repurchase, as well as issue deposits to institutional investors and issue certificates of deposit through brokers. Purchased funds totaled $36 million at June 30, 2016, compared to $55 million at December 31, 2015. At June 30, 2016, the Bank had pledged loans totaling $24 billion which provided for up to $19 billion of available collateralized borrowing with the FRB.The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Dallas, Texas, which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. At June 30, 2016, $14.9 billion of real estate-related loans were pledged to the FHLB as blanket collateral for current and potential future borrowings. As of June 30, 2016, the Corporation had $2.8 billion of outstanding borrowings from the FHLB maturing in 2026, and capacity for potential future borrowings of approximately $3.7 billion. On April 6, 2016, the Bank borrowed $1.6 billion of 10-year, floating-rate FHLB advances due March 4, 2026, and on May 27, 2016, the Bank borrowed an additional $1.2 billion of 10-year, floating-rate FHLB advances due May 20, 2026. The interest rate on each of eight notes resets every four weeks, based on the FHLB auction rate, with the reset date of each note scheduled at one-week intervals. Each note may be prepaid in full, without penalty, at each scheduled reset date. Proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including to provide cost-effective funding for upcoming debt maturities. Additionally, as of June 30, 2016 the Bank had the ability to issue up to $14 billion of debt under an existing $15 billion note program which allows the issuance of debt with maturities between three months and 30 years.The Corporation also maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and/or equity securities.59Table of ContentsThe ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise funds at competitive rates is impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings of the Corporation and the Bank. As of June 30, 2016, the four major rating agencies had assigned the following ratings to long-term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Liquid assets, which totaled $14.8 billion at June 30, 2016, compared to $16.4 billion at December 31, 2015, provide a reservoir of liquidity. Liquid assets include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits with banks, other short-term investments and unencumbered investment securities. In September 2014, U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule implementing a quantitative liquidity requirement in the U.S. generally consistent with the LCR minimum liquidity measure established under the Basel III liquidity framework. Under the rule, the Corporation is subject to a modified LCR standard, which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of high-quality liquid assets to fully cover modified net cash outflows under a 30-day systematic liquidity stress scenario. The rule was effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2016. During the transition year, 2016, the Corporation is required to maintain a minimum LCR of 90 percent. Beginning January 1, 2017, and thereafter, the minimum required LCR will be 100 percent. At June 30, 2016, the Corporation was in compliance with the fully phased-in LCR requirement, plus a buffer.In the second quarter 2016, U.S. banking regulators issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (the proposed rule) implementing a second quantitative liquidity requirement in the U.S. generally consistent with the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) minimum liquidity measure established under the Basel III liquidity framework. Under the proposed rule, the Corporation will be subject to a modified NSFR standard effective January 1, 2018, which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of available longer-term, stable sources of funding to fully cover a modified amount of required longer-term stable funding, over a one-year period. The Corporation is currently assessing the impact of the proposed rule.The Corporation regularly evaluates its ability to meet funding needs in unanticipated, stressed environments. In conjunction with the quarterly 200 basis point interest rate simulation analyses, discussed in the “Interest Rate Sensitivity” section of this financial review, liquidity ratios and potential funding availability are examined. Each quarter, the Corporation also evaluates its ability to meet liquidity needs under a series of broad events, distinguished in terms of duration and severity. The evaluation as of June 30, 2016 projected that sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe Corporation’s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation’s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2015, the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to the allowance for credit losses, fair value measurement, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages F-40 through F-43 in the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report. As of the date of this report, there have been no significant changes to the Corporation's critical accounting policies or estimates.60Table of ContentsSUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATAThe following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this financial review with financial measures defined by GAAP.(dollar amounts in millions)June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015Tangible Common Equity Ratio:   Common shareholders' equity$7,694 $7,560Less:   Goodwill635 635Other intangible assets12 14Tangible common equity$7,047 $6,911Total assets$71,280 $71,877Less:   Goodwill635 635Other intangible assets12 14Tangible assets$70,633 $71,228Common equity ratio10.79% 10.52%Tangible common equity ratio9.98 9.70Tangible Common Equity per Share of Common Stock:   Common shareholders' equity$7,694 $7,560Tangible common equity7,047 6,911Shares of common stock outstanding (in millions)174 176Common shareholders' equity per share of common stock$44.24 $43.03Tangible common equity per share of common stock40.52 39.33The tangible common equity ratio removes preferred stock and the effect of intangible assets from capital and the effect of intangible assets from total assets. Tangible common equity per share of common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders' equity per share of common stock. The Corporation believes these measurements are meaningful measures of capital adequacy used by investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and to compare against other companies in the industry.61Table of ContentsITEM 3.

OTHER INFORMATIONITEM 1. Legal ProceedingsFor information regarding the Corporation's legal proceedings, see "Part I. Item 1. Note 12 – Contingent Liabilities," which is incorporated herein by reference.ITEM 1A. Risk FactorsOther than as set forth below, there has been no material change in the Corporation’s risk factors as previously disclosed in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 in response to Part I, Item 1A. of such Form 10-K. Such risk factors are incorporated herein by reference. Below we amend the following risk factor discussed in Part II, "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. •Proposed revenue enhancements and efficiency improvements may not be achieved.In July 2016 Comerica announced the implementation of its efficiency and revenue initiative, GEAR Up (the "initiative") and related financial targets. There may be changes in the scope or assumptions underlying the initiative, delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to the initiative and higher than expected or unanticipated costs to implement them, and some benefits may not be fully achieved. Furthermore, the implementation of the initiative may have unintended impacts on Comerica's ability to attract and retain business, customers and employees, and could result in disruptions to systems, processes, controls and procedures. Any revenue enhancement ideas may not be successful in the marketplace. Accordingly, Comerica's results of operations and profitability may be negatively impacted, making it less competitive and potentially causing a loss of market share. Additionally, Comerica's future performance is subject to the various risks inherent to its business and operations. ITEM 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
