On July 28, 2011, the Corporation issued approximately 24 million shares of common stock to acquire all the outstanding common stock of Sterling Bancshares, Inc. (Sterling), a bank holding company headquartered in Houston, Texas, in a stock-for-stock transaction. Sterling common shareholders and holders of outstanding Sterling phantom stock units received 0.2365 shares of the Corporation’s common stock in exchange for each share of Sterling common stock or phantom stock unit. Including the fair value of options and warrants to purchase common stock of the Corporation issued in connection with the transaction, the fair value of total consideration paid was $803 million. The acquisition of Sterling significantly expands the Corporation’s presence in Texas, particularly in the Houston and San Antonio areas, and gives the Corporation the ability to leverage additional marketing capacity to offer a wide array of products through a larger distribution network, particularly to middle market and small business companies.  The assets and liabilities of Sterling were recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at estimated fair value on the acquisition date. The fair value of assets acquired totaled $4.7 billion, including $2.1 billion of loans and leases and $1.5 billion in investment securities. The fair value of liabilities assumed was $4.4 billion, including $4.0 billion of deposits. Initial goodwill of $485 million was recorded after adjusting for the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired. The results of operations acquired in the Sterling transaction have been included in the Corporation’s financial results since July 28, 2011, including net interest income of $48 million, which included accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio of $27 million, noninterest income of $16 million and noninterest expenses of $18 million.  For further information regarding the Sterling acquisition, refer to Note 2 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements.  Results of Operations  Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2011 was $98 million, an increase of $39 million from $59 million reported for the three months ended September 30, 2010. The increase in net income in the third quarter 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, was primarily due to an $81 million decrease in the provision for credit losses ($84 million decrease in the provision for loan losses and a $3 million increase in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments) and a $19 million increase in net interest income, partially offset by $33 million of merger and restructuring charges related to the Sterling acquisition and an increase of $21 million in the provision for income taxes. Results of Sterling operations included in net income since July 28, 2011 totaled $30 million, excluding merger and restructuring charges. Net income per diluted common share was $0.51 in the third quarter 2011, compared to $0.33 for the same period one year ago.  Net income for the first nine months of 2011 was $297 million, an increase of $116 million from $181 million reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2010. The increase in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 from the comparable 2010 period was primarily due to a $298 million decrease in the provision for credit losses ($289 million decrease in the provision for loan losses and a $9 million decrease in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments), partially offset by an increase of $79 million in the provision for income taxes, $38 million of merger and restructuring charges related to the Sterling acquisition and a decrease of $32 million in net interest income. Results of Sterling operations included in net income since July 28, 2011 totaled $30 million, excluding merger and restructuring charges. Net income attributable to common shares was $294 million for the first nine months of 2011, compared to $58 million for the same period one year ago. No preferred stock dividends were included in net income attributable to common shares for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, compared to $123 million of preferred stock dividends for the same period one year ago. The decrease in preferred stock dividends was due to the first quarter 2010 full redemption of $2.25 billion of preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury. Diluted net income per common share was $1.61 for the first nine months of 2011, compared to $0.34 for the comparable 2010 period.  Fourth Quarter 2011 Outlook  For the fourth quarter 2011, compared to the third quarter 2011, management expects the following, assuming a continuation of the current economic environment:        •    A low-single digit increase in average total loans, largely reflecting the impact of one additional month of Sterling. Period-end loans are expected to be relatively stable. In the fourth quarter 2011, loans in the National Dealer Services business line are expected to grow, Mortgage Banker Finance loan growth is expected to moderate, and loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line are expected to continue to decrease.    51    Table of Contents     •    Average earning assets of approximately $54.5 billion, reflecting increases, primarily related to Sterling, in average loans and average investment securities available-for-sale.        •    An average net interest margin of about 3.15 percent, reflecting the benefit from an increase in mortgage-backed investment securities, one additional month of Sterling and lower excess liquidity, offset by a reduction in the accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio ($15 million to $20 million, compared to $27 million in the third quarter 2011).        •    Net credit-related charge-offs between $65 million and $75 million for the fourth quarter 2011. The provision for credit losses is expected to trend modestly lower from the third quarter 2011.        •    A mid-single digit decline in noninterest income in the fourth quarter 2011 compared to the third quarter 2011, primarily due to the impact of regulatory changes and no significant net securities gains expected in the fourth quarter 2011, partially offset by one additional month of Sterling noninterest income in the fourth quarter 2011.        •    Excluding merger and restructuring charges, a low- to mid-single digit increase in noninterest expenses in the fourth quarter 2011 compared to the third quarter 2011, primarily due to one additional month of Sterling expenses in the fourth quarter 2011.        •    Merger and restructuring charges of approximately $25 million, after-tax, ($40 million, pre-tax) recognized in the fourth quarter 2011.        •    Total acquisition synergies of approximately 35 percent of Sterling expenses, or about $56 million, with the majority realized in 2012.        •    For fourth quarter 2011, income tax expense to approximate 36 percent of income before income taxes less approximately $17 million in tax benefits.        •    Continue share repurchase program that, combined with dividend payments, results in a payout up to 50 percent of full-year 2011 earnings.  Net Interest Income  Net interest income was $423 million for the three months ended September 30, 2011, an increase of $19 million compared to $404 million for the same period in 2010. Sterling-related net interest income was $48 million for the three months ended September 30, 2011, which included accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio of $27 million. The increase in net interest income in the third quarter 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, resulted primarily from an increase in average earning assets, accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio, and the continued shift in funding sources toward lower-cost funds, partially offset by the maturity of interest rate swaps at positive spreads, maturities of higher-yield fixed-rate loans and decreases in LIBOR rates. The “Quarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume – Fully Taxable Equivalent” table of this financial review details the components of the change in net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis for the three months ended September 30, 2011, compared to the same period in the prior year. Average earning assets increased $3.0 billion, or six percent, to $53.2 billion in the third quarter 2011, compared to $50.2 billion in the third quarter 2010, primarily due to increases of $1.8 billion, or 59 percent, in average interest-bearing deposits with banks and $1.3 billion, or 18 percent, in average investment securities available-for-sale, in part due to the addition of investment securities acquired from Sterling. The net interest margin (FTE) for the three months ended September 30, 2011 decreased five basis points to 3.18 percent, from 3.23 percent for the comparable period in 2010, as the accretion of the purchase discount on the Sterling acquired loan portfolio was more than offset by an increase in excess liquidity, the impacts of LIBOR-based loan rates declining faster than deposit rates, accelerated premium amortization due to increased prepayment activity on mortgage-backed investment securities, and the maturity of interest rate swaps at positive spreads. Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio increased the net interest margin by 20 basis points in the third quarter 2011. The net interest margin was reduced by approximately 29 basis points and 19 basis points in the third quarters of 2011 and 2010, respectively, from excess liquidity. Excess liquidity was represented by $4.8 billion and $3.0 billion of average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) in the third quarters of 2011 and 2010, respectively, included in “interest-bearing deposits with banks” in the consolidated balance sheets.  Net interest income was $1.2 billion for both the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010. Net interest income in the nine months ended 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, remained unchanged as the benefit provided by accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio and the continued shift in funding sources toward lower-cost funds was offset by the impacts of a decrease in average earning assets, the maturity of interest rate swaps at positive spreads, maturities of higher-yield fixed-rate loans and decreases in LIBOR rates. The “Year-to-date Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume – Fully Taxable Equivalent” table provides an analysis of net interest income for the first nine months of 2011 on a FTE basis, compared to the same period in the prior year. Average earning assets decreased $722 million, or one percent, to $50.9 billion for the nine    52    Table of Contents  months ended September 30, 2011, compared to $51.6 billion for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease of $1.1 billion, or three percent, in average loans, partially offset by an increase of $446 million, or six percent, in average investment securities available-for-sale. The net interest margin (FTE) for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 decreased four basis points to 3.19 percent, from 3.23 percent for the same period in 2010, primarily due to the same reasons cited in the quarterly discussion above, other than excess liquidity, which had no impact on the year-to-date change. Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio of $27 million increased the net interest margin by seven basis points in the first nine months of 2011. Excess liquidity, represented by $3.5 billion and $3.6 billion of average balances deposited with the FRB in the first nine months of 2011 and 2010, respectively, reduced the net interest margin by approximately 22 basis points in both the nine month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010.  For further discussion of the effects of market rates on net interest income, refer to the “Market Risk” section of this financial review.  For the fourth quarter 2011, compared to the third quarter 2011, management expects an average net interest margin of about 3.15 percent, reflecting the benefit from an increase in mortgage-backed investment securities, one additional month of Sterling and lower excess liquidity, offset by a reduction in the accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio ($15 million to $20 million, compared to $27 million in the third quarter 2011).    53    Table of Contents Quarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume – Fully Taxable Equivalent (FTE)

Provision for Credit Losses   The provision for credit losses includes both the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The provision for loan losses was $38 million for the third quarter 2011, compared to $122 million for the same period in 2010. The provision for loan losses for the first nine months of 2011 was $134 million, compared to $423 million for the same period in 2010. The Corporation establishes this provision to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses, which is discussed under the “Credit Risk” subheading in the “Risk Management” section of this financial review. Loans acquired from Sterling in the third quarter 2011 were initially recorded at fair value with no carryover of any allowance for loan losses. For Sterling loans not deemed impaired at acquisition, a provision for loan losses is recorded only to the extent the estimated loss exceeds any remaining purchase discounts. For purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans, an impairment charge to the provision may be required if there is a decrease in expected cash flows. No provision for loan losses was recorded for loans acquired from Sterling in the third quarter 2011. The decreases of $84 million and $289 million in the provision for loan losses in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2010, resulted primarily from improvements in credit quality. Improvements in credit quality included a decline in the Corporation’s watch list loans of $573 million, to $5.0 billion, from December 31, 2010 to September 30, 2011. Excluding loans acquired from Sterling, watch list loans declined $978 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011. The Corporation’s internal watch list is generally consistent with loans in the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful categories defined by regulatory authorities. Additional indicators of improved credit quality included a decrease in the inflow to nonaccrual (based on an analysis of nonaccrual loans with book balances greater than $2 million) of $160 million and a decrease in net credit-related charge-offs of $55 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2011, compared to the same period in the prior year.  Growth in the U.S. economy has been weak during the first nine months of 2011. Fortunately, the outlook for fourth quarter 2011 domestic economic conditions appears better than it did earlier in the year, even as conditions in the euro-zone appear to have worsened. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth for the first half of 2011 averaged 0.8 percent. For the second half of the year it is expected to average close to 2.0 percent. The low-growth expansion in the U.S. is generating too few new jobs to bring the unemployment rate down. The year began with a 9.0 percent U.S. unemployment rate and will finish the year at nearly the same rate. Looking ahead to 2012, the probability of relapsing back into recession remains near 50 percent. However, many of the excesses that led to the “Great Recession” of 2008 and 2009, such as inflated home values, swollen manufacturing payrolls and elevated inventory levels, have already been wrung out of the system. The Corporation expects economic conditions in 2012 to remain challenging, but positive overall, as the low-growth expansion continues with real U.S. GDP growth averaging 2.3 percent for the year. Texas should continue to show forward momentum in this low-growth environment. Sufficient demand for Texas’ exports plus stable oil prices should allow for ongoing moderate job creation. The Michigan economy should be supported by moderately improving demand for automobiles. Recent gains to Michigan manufacturing employment will likely ease in the year ahead as demand remains within the range of existing productive capabilities. California continues to benefit from its growing high tech sector; however, weak house prices remain a fundamental drag in many parts of the state.    57    Table of Contents Net loan charge-offs for the third quarter 2011 decreased $55 million to $77 million, or 0.77 percent of average loans outstanding, compared to $132 million, or 1.32 percent for the third quarter 2010. The decrease in net loan charge-offs in the third quarter 2011, compared to the third quarter 2010, consisted primarily of decreases in net loan charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate ($39 million), Middle Market ($13 million) and Specialty Businesses ($9 million) business lines, partially offset by an increase in the Small Business ($9 million) business line. By geographic market, net loan charge-offs decreased in all primary markets in the third quarter 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, with the largest decreases noted in the Midwest ($27 million) and Western ($27 million) markets.  Net loan charge-offs for the first nine months of 2011 were $268 million, compared to $451 million for the same period in 2010. The $183 million decrease in net loan charge-offs for the first nine months of 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, consisted primarily of decreases in net loan charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate ($137 million), Middle Market ($27 million) and Specialty Businesses ($26 million) business lines, partially offset by an increase in the Global Corporate Banking business line ($7 million). By geographic market, net loan charge-offs decreased in all markets, with the exception of Florida, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, with the largest decreases noted in the Western ($86 million), Midwest ($43 million), Other Markets ($31 million), and Texas ($25 million) markets. In the Florida market, net loan charge-offs increased $6 million, primarily due to increases in the Private Banking and Middle Market business lines.  The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments increased $3 million to a benefit of $3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2011, compared to a benefit of $6 million in the same period in the prior year. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments decreased $9 million to a benefit of $8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, compared to a provision of $1 million for the comparable periods in 2010. The decrease in provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, compared to the same period of 2010 resulted primarily from improved credit quality in unfunded commitments in the Midwest, Western and Texas markets. The Corporation establishes this provision to maintain an adequate allowance to cover probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments, which is discussed under the “Credit Risk” subheading in the “Risk Management” section of this financial review. The Corporation recorded a purchase discount for lending-related commitments acquired from Sterling. A provision for credit losses will not be recorded on Sterling lending-related commitments until the required allowance exceeds the remaining purchase discount. No provision was recorded for Sterling lending-related commitments during the third quarter 2011. Lending-related commitment charge-offs were insignificant in both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010.  An analysis of allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets is presented under the “Credit Risk” subheading in the “Risk Management” section of this financial review.  Management expects net credit-related charge-offs between $65 million and $75 million for the fourth quarter 2011. The provision for credit losses is expected to trend modestly lower from the third quarter 2011.  Noninterest Income  Noninterest income was $201 million for the three months ended September 30, 2011, an increase of $15 million, or seven percent, compared to $186 million for the same period in 2010. The increase resulted primarily from $16 million of Sterling noninterest income included in the three months ended September 30, 2011, which included $11 million of net securities gains and $5 million of core noninterest income, principally fee-related. Sterling legacy securities were sold in the third quarter 2011 to reposition the acquired portfolio to more closely match the mix of the Corporation’s portfolio.  Noninterest income was $610 million for the first nine months of 2011, an increase of $36 million, or six percent, compared to the same period in 2010, resulting primarily from increases in net securities gains ($15 million), primarily due to gains from sales of Sterling legacy securities as discussed above, net income from principal investing and warrants ($13 million) and risk management hedge gains ($5 million).  Management expects a mid-single digit decline in noninterest income in the fourth quarter 2011 compared to the third quarter 2011, primarily due to the impact of regulatory changes and no significant net securities gains expected in the fourth quarter 2011, partially offset by one additional month of Sterling noninterest income in the fourth quarter 2011.  Noninterest Expenses  Noninterest expenses were $460 million for the three months ended September 30, 2011, an increase of $58 million, or 14 percent, from $402 million for the comparable period in 2010, resulting primarily from merger and restructuring charges ($33 million), noninterest expenses from the addition of Sterling operations ($18 million, including $10 million of salaries and employee benefits expenses) and an increase in litigation and operational losses ($6 million), partially offset by a decrease in FDIC insurance expense ($6 million).    58    Table of Contents Noninterest expenses were $1.3 billion for the first nine months of 2011, an increase of $81 million, or seven percent, compared to $1.2 billion for the comparable period in 2010. The increase in noninterest expense resulted primarily from an increase in salaries and employee benefits expenses ($47 million, including $10 million from Sterling), merger and restructuring charges ($38 million), other noninterest expenses from the addition of Sterling operations ($8 million), and an increase in litigation and operational losses ($11 million), partially offset by decreases in FDIC insurance expense ($12 million) and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments ($9 million). The increase in salaries and employee benefits expenses reflected the addition of Sterling ($10 million) and increases in incentive compensation ($16 million), pension expense ($13 million) and share-based compensation ($5 million).  The Corporation committed to a restructuring plan in connection with the completion of the acquisition of Sterling. The restructuring plan, which is expected to be substantially completed by December 31, 2012, is intended to streamline operations across the combined organization. The restructuring plan is expected to result in cumulative costs of approximately $125 million through the end of the plan, primarily encompassing facilities and contract termination charges, systems integration and related charges, severance and other employee-related charges and transaction-related costs. The Corporation recognized merger and restructuring charges of $33 million and $38 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011, respectively, recorded in “merger and restructuring charges” in the consolidated statements of income. Merger and restructuring charges include the incremental costs to integrate the operations of Sterling and do not reflect the costs of the fully integrated combined organization.  Excluding merger and restructuring charges, management expects a low- to mid-single digit increase in noninterest expenses in the fourth quarter 2011 compared to the third quarter 2011, primarily due to one additional month of Sterling expenses in the fourth quarter 2011. Management expects merger and restructuring charges of approximately $25 million, after-tax, ($40 million, pre-tax) to be recognized in the fourth quarter 2011. Total acquisition synergies of approximately 35 percent of Sterling expenses, or about $56 million, are expected, with the majority realized in 2012.  Provision for Income Taxes  The provision for income taxes for the third quarter 2011 was $28 million, compared to $7 million for the same period in 2010. The $21 million increase in the provision for income taxes in the three-month period ended September 30, 2011, compared to the same period in 2010, was primarily due to an increase in income before taxes during the same period.  For the first nine months of 2011, the provision for income taxes was $104 million, an increase of $79 million compared to the same period in 2010. The increase in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to an increase in income before taxes during the same period and a $19 million charge related to a final settlement agreement with the Internal Revenue Service involving the repatriation of foreign earnings on a structured investment transaction, partially offset by a release of tax reserves of $9 million due to the Corporation’s participation in a recently enacted State of California voluntary compliance initiative.  Net deferred tax assets were $351 million at September 30, 2011, compared to $383 million at December 31, 2010, a decrease of $32 million, resulting primarily from a reduction in deferred tax assets due to a decrease in the allowance for loan losses and an increase in unrealized gains recognized in other comprehensive income, partially offset by an increase in deferred tax assets due to the acquisition of Sterling. Deferred tax assets were evaluated for realization and it was determined that no valuation allowance was needed at both September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010. This conclusion was based on available evidence of loss carryback capacity, projected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and assumptions made regarding future events. For further information on income taxes, refer to Note 13 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements.  For fourth quarter 2011, management expects income tax expense to approximate 36 percent of income before income taxes less approximately $17 million in tax benefits.    59    Table of Contents Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax  In the first nine months of 2011, there was no income from discontinued operations, net of tax. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, for the first nine months of 2010 was $17 million, reflecting a first quarter after-tax gain from the cash settlement of a note receivable related to the 2006 sale of an investment advisory subsidiary. For further information on the cash settlement of the note and discontinued operations, refer to Note 16 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements.  Business Segments  The Corporation’s operations are strategically aligned into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based on the products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, the Finance Division is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes discontinued operations and items not directly associated with these business segments or the Finance Division. Note 15 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements presents financial results of these business segments for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 and 2010. For a description of the business activities of each business segment and the methodologies which form the basis for these results, refer to Note 15 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements and Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation’s 2010 Annual Report.  The following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.

The Business Bank’s net income of $522 million increased $167 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2011, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2010. Net interest income (FTE) of $1.0 billion increased $17 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2011 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to $13 million in accretion of the purchase discount on the Sterling acquired loan portfolio, an increase in loan spreads and the benefit provided by an increase of $2.1 billion in average deposits, partially offset by a decrease of $753 million in average loans. The provision for loan losses of $44 million decreased $233 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting decreases in the Commercial Real Estate (in all markets) and Middle Market (primarily in the Other Markets and Midwest markets) business lines. Net credit-related charge-offs of $166 million decreased $185 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to decreases in net charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate and Middle Market business lines. Noninterest income of $232 million increased $10 million from the comparable prior year period, primarily due to increases in warrant income ($8 million) and customer derivative income ($6 million), partially offset by a decrease in investment banking fees ($5 million). Noninterest expenses of $479 million increased $4 million from the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increases in allocated corporate overhead expense ($16 million), outside processing fees ($5 million) and nominal increases in other noninterest expense categories, partially offset by decreases in net processing charges ($16 million) and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments ($6 million). The addition of Sterling operations increased noninterest expenses $5 million. The provision for income taxes (FTE) of $233 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2011 increased $89 million, compared to $144 million for the comparable period the prior year, primarily resulting from an increase in income before income taxes.  Net income for the Retail Bank was $14 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2011, compared to a net loss of $17 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2010. Net interest income (FTE) of $454 million increased $57 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to $13 million in accretion of the purchase discount on the Sterling acquired loan portfolio, an increase in loan and deposit spreads and the benefit provided by an increase of $1.4 billion in average deposits, partially offset by a decrease of $252 million in average loans. The provision for loan losses decreased $11 million from the comparable period in the prior year, reflecting a decrease in the Small Business business line (primarily the Midwest market), partially offset by an increase in the Personal Banking business line (primarily the Midwest market). Net credit-related charge-offs of $74 million decreased $8 million from the comparable period in the prior year. Noninterest income of $135 million    60    Table of Contents  increased $4 million from the comparable prior year period, primarily due to nominal increases in several noninterest income categories. Noninterest expenses of $499 million increased $19 million from the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in allocated corporate overhead expenses ($10 million) and salaries and benefit expenses ($10 million). The addition of Sterling operations increased noninterest expenses $10 million, including $3 million of allocated corporate overhead expenses and $4 million of salaries and benefits expenses.  Wealth Management’s net income of $37 million increased $30 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2011, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2010. Net interest income (FTE) of $137 million increased $9 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to increases in loan and deposit spreads. The provision for loan losses decreased $39 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting decreases in the Midwest and Western markets. Net credit-related charge-offs of $28 million decreased $6 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in the Western market, partially offset by an increase in the Florida market. Noninterest income of $184 million increased $3 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to nominal increases in various noninterest income categories. Noninterest expenses of $232 million increased $2 million, primarily due to an increase in allocated corporate overhead expenses ($5 million), partially offset by nominal decreases in various noninterest expense categories.  The net loss for the Finance Division was $255 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2011, compared to a net loss of $175 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2010. Net interest expense (FTE) increased $138 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2011, compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in net interest expense (FTE) in the Finance Division was primarily due to the increase in average deposits in the three major business segments. The Corporation’s internal funds transfer methodology is designed to centralize interest rate risk in the Finance Division and to measure profitability across all interest rate environments. To that end, the Finance Division pays the three major business segments for the long-term value of deposits based on their assumed lives. The three major business segments pay the Finance Division for funding based on the repricing and term characteristics of their loans. Noninterest income increased $15 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to $11 million in gains on the sale of investment securities, primarily due to gains from sales of Sterling legacy securities, and a $5 million increase in risk management hedge income. Noninterest expenses increased $2 million from the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a $3 million increase in salaries expense. The benefit for income taxes (FTE) of $152 million increased $45 million, compared to a benefit of $107 million for the comparable period in the prior year, primarily resulting from the decrease in income before income taxes.  The Other category’s net income decreased $32 million to a net loss of $21 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2011, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2010. The decrease in net income primarily reflected $38 million in restructuring charges related to the Sterling acquisition and a $17 million after-tax discontinued operations gain recorded in the first quarter 2010, partially offset by a $5 million increase in net income from principal investing and warrants.

September 30, 2011 total assets included $4.7 billion related to Sterling, including $810 million of interest-bearing deposits with banks, $690 million of investment securities available-for-sale, $2.0 billion of total loans and $485 million of goodwill, included in “accrued income and other assets” on the consolidated balance sheets. On an average basis, total assets increased $4.5 billion in the third quarter 2011, compared to the fourth quarter 2010, resulting primarily from increases of $3.0 billion in average interest-bearing deposits with banks and $1.0 billion in average investment securities available-for-sale.

By business line, increases in average loans in the Global Corporate Banking ($545 million), Energy Lending ($357 million) (included in Specialty Businesses), Small Business ($296 million), Technology and Life Sciences ($184 million) (included in Specialty Businesses) and Middle Market ($151 million) business lines were largely offset by decreases in the National Dealer Services, ($648 million), Commercial Real Estate ($315 million), Mortgage Banker Finance ($178 million) (included in Specialty Businesses), Private Banking ($168 million) and Leasing ($125 million) (included in Specialty Business) business lines. The addition of loans acquired from Sterling primarily increased average loans in the Commercial Real Estate ($590 million), Small Business ($463 million) and Personal Financial Services ($156 million) business lines in the third quarter 2011. The decrease in average loans in the National Dealer Services business line primarily reflected the impact of supply-chain disruptions related to the    64    Table of Contents  earthquake and tsunami in Japan in March 2011. Average loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line continued to decline, reflecting ongoing payment activity and the continued workout of the nonperforming portfolio, as well as the ability of customers to access external sources of long-term refinancing. Mortgage Banker Finance provides short-term financing to borrowers in the mortgage banking industry who originate and refinance residential mortgage loans which they subsequently sell in the secondary market (mortgage warehousing loans). Average loans in Mortgage Banker Finance declined primarily as a result of the decline in consumer refinance volumes experienced in the first quarter 2011. Changes in average loans by geographic market are displayed in the table above. Loans acquired from Sterling increased average loans $1.4 billion in the Texas market in the third quarter 2011.  Management expects average earning assets of approximately $54.5 billion for the fourth quarter 2011, reflecting increases, primarily related to one additional month of Sterling, in average loans and average investment securities available-for-sale, compared to third quarter 2011. Management expects a low-single digit increase in average total loans, largely reflecting the impact of one additional month of Sterling. Period-end loans are expected to be relatively stable. In the fourth quarter 2011, loans in the National Dealer Services business line are expected to grow, Mortgage Banker Finance loan growth is expected to moderate, and loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line are expected to continue to decrease.  Total liabilities increased $6.1 billion to $53.9 billion at September 30, 2011, compared to December 31, 2010, primarily due to a $7.0 billion increase in total deposits, in part from the addition of $3.6 billion in total deposits acquired from Sterling, partially offset by a $1.1 billion decrease in medium- and long-term debt. On an average basis, total liabilities increased $3.7 billion in the third quarter 2011, compared to the fourth quarter 2010, primarily due to a $4.7 billion increase in average deposits, in part from the addition of $2.5 billion in average deposits acquired from Sterling, partially offset by a $1.0 billion decrease in medium- and long-term debt. Average core deposits, which exclude other time deposits and foreign office time deposits, were $44.6 billion for the third quarter 2011, compared to $39.9 billion for the fourth quarter 2010, primarily reflecting increases of $2.3 billion in money market and NOW deposits and $1.9 billion in noninterest-bearing deposits. Within average core deposits, changes from the fourth quarter 2010 to the third quarter 2011 included average deposits acquired from Sterling ($2.5 billion) and increases in average deposits in the Global Corporate Banking ($1.1 billion), Specialty Businesses ($700 million), Private Banking ($468 million), Personal Banking ($350 million) and Small Business ($252 million) business lines, partially offset by a decrease in the Middle Market business line ($454 million). By geographic market, average core deposits increased in all major markets in the third quarter 2011, compared to the fourth quarter 2010.  Capital  Total shareholders’ equity increased $1.2 billion to $7.0 billion at September 30, 2011, compared to December 31, 2010, primarily due to the retention of earnings and the issuance of equity in connection with the Sterling acquisition. The following table presents a summary of changes in total shareholders’ equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2011.

These transactions are not considered part of the Corporation's repurchase program.    (b) The Corporation made no repurchases of warrants under the repurchase program during the nine months ended September 30, 2011.    (c) Maximum number of shares and warrants that may yet be purchased under the publicly announced plans or programs.  Management expects to continue the share repurchase program that, when combined with dividend payments, results in a payout up to 50 percent of full-year 2011 earnings.  Risk-based regulatory capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in credit risk profiles among banking institutions and to account for off-balance sheet exposure. Assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with specified risk-weighting factors. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items. As shown in the table below, the Tier 1 common capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based capital and leverage ratios increased from December 31, 2010 to September 30, 2011. The tangible common equity ratio decreased 11 basis points primarily due to an increase in intangible assets due to the acquisition of Sterling.  The Corporation’s capital ratios exceeded minimum regulatory requirements as follows:                             September 30, 2011     December 31, 2010     (dollar amounts in millions)   Capital     Ratio     Capital     Ratio     Tier 1 common (a) (b)   $ 6,511       10.57 %    $ 6,027       10.13 %    Tier 1 risk-based (4.00% – minimum) (b)     6,560       10.65       6,027       10.13     Total risk-based (8.00% – minimum) (b)     9,141       14.84       8,651       14.54     Leverage (3.00% – minimum) (b)     6,560       11.41       6,027       11.26     Tangible common equity (a)     6,280       10.43       5,637       10.54                                                  (a) See Supplemental Financial Data section for reconcilements of non-GAAP financial measures.    (b) September 30, 2011 capital and ratios are estimated.  At September 30, 2011, the Corporation and its U.S. banking subsidiaries exceeded the ratios required for an institution to be considered “well capitalized” (Tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based capital and leverage ratios greater than six percent, 10 percent and five percent, respectively).  In December 2009, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee) released proposed Basel III guidance on bank capital and liquidity. In September 2010, the Basel Committee proposed higher global minimum capital standards, including a minimum Tier 1 common capital ratio and additional capital and liquidity requirements, with rules expected to be implemented between 2013 and 2019. Adoption in the U.S. is expected to occur over a similar timeframe, but the final form of the U.S. rules is not yet certain. The Corporation believes that the expected impacts from changes in the components of capital and the calculation of risk-weighted assets would not be material. A higher degree of uncertainty exists regarding the implementation and interpretation of the liquidity rules. If subject to these rules, the Corporation expects the liquidity requirements to be manageable. While uncertainty exists in both the final form of the Basel III guidance and whether or not the Corporation will be required to adopt the guidelines, the Corporation is closely monitoring the development of the guidance.    66    Table of Contents Risk Management  The following updated information should be read in conjunction with the “Risk Management” section on pages 38-60 in the Corporation’s 2010 Annual Report.  Credit Risk  Allowance for Credit Losses and Nonperforming Assets  The allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The allowance for loan losses represents management’s assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporation’s loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain loans and loan relationships, and allowances for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics for the remaining business and retail loans. The Corporation defines business loans as those belonging to the commercial, real estate construction, commercial mortgage, lease financing and international loan portfolios. Retail loans consist of traditional residential mortgage, home equity and other consumer loans. Loans acquired from Sterling were initially recorded at fair value, which included an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans, and therefore no corresponding allowance for loan losses was recorded for these loans. Methods utilized to estimate the required allowance for loan losses for acquired loans not deemed credit-impaired at acquisition are similar to originated loans; however, the estimate of loss is based on the unpaid principal balance less the remaining purchase discount. At September 30, 2011, no allowance was required for acquired loans not deemed credit-impaired and $122 million of purchase discounts remained. Acquired PCI loans are not considered nonperforming loans.  The total allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb incurred losses inherent in the total loan portfolio. Unanticipated economic events, including political, economic and regulatory instability could cause changes in the credit characteristics of the portfolio and result in an unanticipated increase in the allowance. Inclusion of other industry-specific portfolio exposures in the allowance, as well as significant increases in the current portfolio exposures, could also increase the amount of the allowance. Any of these events, or some combination thereof, may result in the need for additional provision for loan losses in order to maintain an allowance that complies with credit risk and accounting policies.  The allowance for loan losses was $767 million at September 30, 2011, compared to $901 million at December 31, 2010, a decrease of $134 million, or 15 percent. The decrease in the allowance for loan losses resulted primarily from improvements in credit quality, including a decline of $573 million in the Corporation’s watch list loans from December 31, 2010 to September 30, 2011. Excluding loans acquired from Sterling, watch list loans declined $978 million from December 31, 2010 to September 30, 2011. The decrease in the allowance for loan losses primarily reflected decreases in the Commercial Real Estate (in all major markets), Middle Market (primarily the Midwest and Other markets) and Small Business (in all markets) business lines, partially offset by an increase in the Middle Market business line in the Western market. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total period-end loans was 1.86 percent at September 30, 2011, compared to 2.24 percent at December 31, 2010. The decline in the ratio of the allowance to total loans reflects the impact of the increase in period-end loans as a result of loans acquired from Sterling that were initially recorded at fair value without a corresponding allowance for loan losses. Nonperforming loans of $958 million at September 30, 2011 decreased $165 million, compared to December 31, 2010. All large nonperforming loans are individually reviewed each quarter for potential charge-offs and reserves. Charge-offs are taken as amounts are determined to be uncollectible based on a qualitative assessment of the recoverability of the principal amount from collateral and other cash flow sources. A measure of the level of charge-offs already taken on nonperforming loans is the current book balance as a percentage of the contractual amount owed. At September 30, 2011, nonperforming loans were charged-off to 60 percent of the contractual amount, compared to 58 percent at December 31, 2010. This level of write-downs is consistent with losses experienced on loan defaults in the first nine months of 2011 and in recent years. The allowance as a percentage of total nonperforming loans, a ratio which results from the actions noted above, was 80 percent at both September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010. The Corporation’s loan portfolio is primarily composed of business loans, which, in the event of default, are typically carried on the books at fair value as nonperforming assets for a longer period of time than are consumer loans, resulting in a lower nonperforming loan allowance coverage when compared to banking organizations with higher concentrations of consumer loans.  The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in “accrued expenses and other liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets, includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain letters of credit in a manner consistent with business loans, and allowances based on the pools of the    67    Table of Contents  remaining letters of credit and all unused commitments to extend credit within each internal risk rating. A probability of draw estimate is applied to the commitment amount, and the result is multiplied by standard reserve factors consistent with business loans. In general, the probability of draw for letters of credit is considered certain for all letters of credit supporting loans and for letters of credit assigned an internal risk rating generally consistent with regulatory defined substandard or doubtful. Other letters of credit and all unfunded commitments have a lower probability of draw. The Corporation recorded a purchase discount for lending-related commitments acquired from Sterling. An allowance for credit losses will be recorded on Sterling lending-related commitments only to the extent that the required allowance exceeds the remaining purchase discount. At September 30, 2011, no allowance was recorded for Sterling lending-related commitments and $4 million of purchase discount remained.  The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $27 million at September 30, 2011, a decrease of $8 million from $35 million at December 31, 2010.  Nonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, troubled debt restructured loans (TDRs) which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans) and real estate which has been acquired through foreclosure and is awaiting disposition (foreclosed property). Nonperforming assets do not include acquired PCI loans. Nonperforming assets decreased $190 million to $1.0 billion at September 30, 2011, from $1.2 billion at December 31, 2010, and are summarized in the following table.

There were 21 borrowers with balances greater than $2 million, totaling $130 million, transferred to nonaccrual status in the third quarter 2011, a decrease of $20 million from $150 million in the second quarter 2011. Of the transfers to nonaccrual in the third quarter 2011, $63 million were from the Middle Market business line, primarily in the Midwest and Western markets, and $48 million were from Commercial Real Estate business line, primarily in the Western and Other markets. There were three borrowers with balances greater than $10 million, totaling $58 million, transferred to nonaccrual in the third quarter 2011, including $35 million and $23 million in the Commercial Real Estate and Middle Market business lines, respectively.

(b) Consumer, excluding residential mortgage and certain personal purpose nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs, are included in the “Other” category.  Business loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when management determines that full collection of principal or interest is unlikely or when principal or interest payments are 90 days past due, unless the loan is fully collateralized and in the process of collection. The primary driver of when the principal amount of a business loan should be fully or partially charged off is based on a qualitative assessment of the recoverability of the principal amount from collateral and other cash flow sources. Residential mortgage and home equity loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status and charged off to current appraised values, less costs to sell, during the foreclosure process, normally no later than 180 days past due. Other consumer loans are generally not placed on nonaccrual status and are charged off at no later than 120 days past due, earlier if deemed uncollectible. Loan amounts in excess of probable future cash collections are charged off to an amount that management ultimately expects to collect. At the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, interest previously accrued but not collected is charged against current income. Income on such loans is then recognized only to the extent that cash is received and the future collection of principal is probable. Generally, a loan may be returned to accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest have been received and the Corporation expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest, generally based on a period of sustained payment performance, normally at least six months, or when the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. For a further discussion of impaired loans, refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation’s 2010 Annual Report.  At September 30, 2011, TDRs totaled $290 million, of which $197 million were nonperforming ($168 million nonaccrual TDRs and $29 million reduced-rate TDRs) and $93 million were considered performing. Performing TDRs primarily included $75 million of commercial loans (primarily in the Middle Market and Global Corporate Banking business lines) and $16 million of commercial mortgage loans (primarily in the Middle Market business line) at September 30, 2011. At December 31, 2010, TDRs totaled $165 million, including $44 million performing TDRs, $78 million nonaccrual TDRs and $43 million reduced-rate TDRs. The $125 million increase in total TDRs was primarily due to increases in the Commercial Real Estate, Specialty Businesses and Global Corporate Banking business lines.  Loans past due 30-89 days increased $47 million to $328 million at September 30, 2011, compared to $281 million at December 31, 2010. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest generally represent loans that are well collateralized and in a continuing process of collection. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing are summarized in the following table.    70    Table of Contents              (in millions)   September 30, 2011     December 31, 2010     Business loans:             Commercial   $ 17     $ 3     Real estate construction     18       22     Commercial mortgage     26       16                           Total business loans     61       41     Retail loans:             Residential mortgage     6       7     Consumer     14       14                           Total retail loans     20       21                           Total loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing   $ 81     $ 62                          The following table presents a summary of total internally classified watch list loans. Watch list loans that meet certain criteria are individually subjected to quarterly credit quality reviews, and the Corporation may establish specific allowances for such loans. Total watch list loans included $405 million of loans acquired from Sterling at September 30, 2011. The $573 million decrease in total watch list loans, compared to December 31, 2010, is reflected in the decrease in the allowance for loan losses in the same period.

Commercial and Residential Real Estate Lending  The following table summarizes the Corporation’s commercial real estate loan portfolio by loan category as of September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010.                 (in millions)   September 30,2011     December 31,2010     Real estate construction loans:             Commercial Real Estate business line (a)   $ 1,164     $ 1,826     Other business lines (b)     484       427                           Total real estate construction loans   $ 1,648     $ 2,253                           Commercial mortgage loans:             Commercial Real Estate business line (a)   $ 2,271     $ 1,937     Other business lines (b)     8,268       7,830                           Total commercial mortgage loans   $ 10,539     $ 9,767                              (a) Primarily loans to real estate investors and developers.    (b) Primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate.  The Corporation limits risk inherent in its commercial real estate lending activities by limiting exposure to those borrowers directly involved in the commercial real estate markets and adhering to conservative policies on loan-to-value ratios for such loans. Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $12.2 billion at September 30, 2011, of which $3.4 billion, or 28 percent, were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to residential real estate investors and developers. The remaining $8.8 billion, or 72 percent, of commercial real estate loans in other business lines consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans.  The real estate construction portfolio totaled $1.6 billion at September 30, 2011. The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-time customers with satisfactory completion experience. However, the significant and sudden decline in residential real estate activity that began in late 2008 in the Western, Florida and Midwest markets proved extremely difficult for many of the smaller residential real estate developers. Of the $1.2 billion of real estate construction loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line, $109 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2011, including retail projects totaling $33 million (primarily in the Western and Florida markets), single family projects totaling $29 million (primarily in the Western and Florida markets), residential land development projects totaling $26 million (primarily in the Western market) and multi-use projects totaling $16 million in the Western market. Real estate construction loan net charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $22 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, including $10 million from residential land development projects (primarily in the Western market), $5 million from multi-use projects (primarily in the Western market), and $4 million from single family projects (primarily in the Western market).  The commercial mortgage portfolio totaled $10.5 billion at September 30, 2011 and included $2.3 billion in the Commercial Real Estate business line and $8.2 billion in other business lines. Of the $2.3 billion of commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line, $198 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2011, including retail projects totaling $53 million (primarily in the Midwest market), other land development projects totaling $36 million (primarily in the Western market), residential land development projects totaling $25 million (primarily in the Western, Midwest and Florida markets) and multi-family projects totaling $24 million (primarily in the Florida market). Commercial mortgage loan net charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $20 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, primarily including net charge-offs of $7 million from multi-use projects in the Midwest market, $5 million from retail projects in the Midwest market, and $4 million from multi-family projects (primarily in the Florida market).    72    Table of Contents The geographic distribution and project type of commercial real estate loans are important factors in diversifying credit risk within the portfolio.

Residential mortgages totaled $1.6 billion at September 30, 2011, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.6 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $65 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2011. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.7 billion at September 30, 2011, of which $1.5 billion was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit and $221 million consisted of closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.7 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $4 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2011. A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens.  The Corporation rarely originates residential real estate loans with a loan-to-value ratio above 100 percent at origination, has no sub-prime mortgage programs and does not originate payment-option adjustable-rate mortgages or other nontraditional mortgages that allow negative amortization. A significant majority of residential mortgage originations are sold in the secondary market. Since 2008, the Corporation has used a third party to originate, document and underwrite residential mortgage loans on behalf of the Corporation. Under this arrangement, the third party assumes any repurchase liability for the loans it originates. The Corporation has repurchase liability exposure for residential mortgage loans originated prior to 2008, however based on historical experience, the Corporation believes such exposure, which could be triggered by early payment defaults by borrowers or by underwriting discrepancies, is minimal. The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation’s primary geographic markets. The economic recession and significant declines in home values in the Western, Florida and Midwest markets following the financial market turmoil beginning in the fall of 2008 adversely impacted the residential real estate portfolio. At September 30, 2011, the Corporation estimated that, of the $6 million total residential mortgage loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest, approximately $1 million exceeded 90 percent of the current value of the underlying collateral, based on S&P/Case-Shiller home price indices. To account for this exposure, the Corporation factors changes in home values into estimated loss ratios for residential real estate loans, using index-based estimates by major metropolitan area, resulting in an increased allowance allocated for residential real estate loans when home values decline. Additionally, to mitigate increasing credit exposure due to depreciating home values, the Corporation periodically reviews home equity lines of credit and makes line reductions or converts outstanding balances at line maturity to closed-end, amortizing loans when necessary.  Shared National Credits  Shared National Credit (SNC) loans are facilities greater than $20 million shared by three or more federally supervised financial institutions that are reviewed annually by regulatory authorities at the agent bank level. The Corporation generally seeks to obtain ancillary business at the origination of a SNC relationship. Loans classified as SNC loans (approximately 880 borrowers at September 30, 2011) totaled $8.0 billion at September 30, 2011, including $111 million from the Sterling acquisition, compared to $7.3 billion at December 31, 2010. SNC net loan charge-offs totaled $4 million and $18 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011, respectively. SNC loans, diversified by both business line and geographic market, comprised approximately 19 percent and 18 percent of total loans at September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. SNC loans are held to the same credit underwriting standards as the remainder of the loan portfolio and face similar credit challenges.  Automotive Lending  Loans in the National Dealer Services business line include floor plan financing and other loans to automotive dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in “commercial loans” in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $1.2 billion at September 30, 2011, a decrease of $808 million compared to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2010, primarily reflecting the impact of supply chain disruptions caused by the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami in Japan in March 2011, as the significant majority of the decrease in floor plan loans was concentrated in automotive franchises selling Japanese-made vehicles. At both September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $1.9 billion, including $1.4 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans. Automotive lending also includes loans to borrowers involved with automotive production, primarily Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers. Loans to borrowers involved with automotive production totaled approximately $980 million at September 30, 2011, compared to $831 million at December 31, 2010.    74    Table of Contents State and Local Municipalities  In the normal course of business, the Corporation serves the needs of state and local municipalities in multiple capacities, including traditional banking products such as deposit services, loans and letters of credit, investment banking services such as bond underwriting and private placements, and by investing in municipal securities.  The following table summarizes the Corporation’s direct exposure to state and local municipalities as of September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010.                 (in millions)   September 30, 2011     December 31, 2010     Loans outstanding   $ 43     $ 27     Lease financing     402       446     Investment securities available-for-sale     24       39     Trading account securities     17       19     Standby letters of credit     78       80     Unused commitments to extend credit     17       12                           Total direct exposure to state and local municipalities   $ 581     $ 623                          Indirect exposure comprised $320 million in auction-rate preferred securities collateralized by municipal securities at September 30, 2011, compared to $436 million at December 31, 2010. Additionally, the Corporation is exposed to Automated Clearing House (ACH) transaction risk for those municipalities utilizing this electronic payment and/or deposit method and similar products in their cash flow management. The Corporation sets limits on ACH activity during the underwriting process.  Extensions of credit to state and local municipalities are subjected to the same underwriting standards as other business loans. At September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, all outstanding municipal loans and leases were performing according to contractual terms and none were included in the Corporation’s internal watch list. Municipal leases are secured by the underlying equipment, and a substantial majority of the leases are fully defeased with AAA-rated U.S. government securities. Substantially all municipal investment securities available-for sale are auction-rate securities. All auction-rate securities are reviewed quarterly for other-than-temporary impairment. All auction-rate municipal securities were rated investment grade, and all auction-rate preferred securities collateralized by municipal securities were rated AAA or the equivalent and were adequately collateralized at both September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010. Municipal securities are held in the trading account for resale to customers. In addition, Comerica Securities, a broker-dealer subsidiary of Comerica Bank, underwrites bonds issued by municipalities. All bonds underwritten by Comerica Securities are sold to third party investors.  European Exposure  The Corporation does not hold any sovereign exposure to Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece or Spain. The Corporation’s international strategy as it pertains to Europe is to focus on European corporations doing business in North America, with an emphasis on the major geographic markets. Credit limits to banks domiciled in the aforementioned countries totaled less than $15 million at September 30, 2011. In addition, exposure to corporations in the aforementioned European countries was less than $125 million at September 30, 2011.  For further discussion of credit risk, see the “Credit Risk” section on pages 38-52 in the Corporation’s 2010 Annual Report.    75    Table of Contents Market and Liquidity Risk  Interest Rate Risk  Net interest income is the predominant source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises primarily through the Corporation’s core business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits. The Corporation’s balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by a combination of core deposits and wholesale borrowings. Approximately 80 percent of the Corporation’s loans were floating at September 30, 2011, of which approximately 70 percent were based on LIBOR and 30 percent were based on Prime. This creates a natural imbalance between the floating-rate loan portfolio and the more slowly repricing deposit products. The result is that growth and/or contraction in the Corporation’s core businesses will lead to sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing investment securities, primarily fixed-rate, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, and hedging the sensitivity with interest rate swaps. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk, with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.  The Corporation frequently evaluates net interest income under various balance sheet and interest rate scenarios, looking at both 12 and 24 month time horizons, using simulation modeling analysis as its principal risk management evaluation technique. The results of these analyses provide the information needed to assess the balance sheet structure. Changes in economic activity, whether domestic or international, different from those management included in its simulation analyses could translate into a materially different interest rate environment than currently expected. Management evaluates a base case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment and what is believed to be the most likely balance sheet structure. This base case net interest income is then evaluated against non-parallel interest rate scenarios that increase and decrease 200 basis points in a linear fashion from the base case over twelve months, resulting in an average change in interest rates of 100 basis points over the period. Due to the current low level of interest rates, the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of a 25 basis point drop, to zero percent. In addition, consistent with each interest rate scenario, adjustments to asset prepayment levels, yield curves, and overall balance sheet mix and growth assumptions are made. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model may not precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions and management strategies, among other factors. However, the model can indicate the likely direction of change. Existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes are included in these analyses, but no additional hedging is forecasted.  The table below, as of September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above.                             September 30, 2011     December 31, 2010     (dollar amounts in millions)   Amount     %     Amount     %     Sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates:                       +200 basis points   $ 135       8 %    $ 104       7 %    - 25 basis points (to zero percent)     (16 )      (1 )      (15 )      (1 )                                             In addition to the simulation analysis, an economic value of equity analysis is performed for a longer term view of the interest rate risk position. The economic value of equity analysis begins with an estimate of the economic value of the financial assets and liabilities on the Corporation’s balance sheet, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period, and then applies the estimated impact of rate movements to the economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments. The economic value of equity is then calculated as the difference between the estimated market value of assets and liabilities net of the impact of off-balance sheet instruments. As with net interest income shocks, a variety of alternative scenarios are performed to measure the impact on economic value of equity, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve.    76    Table of Contents The table below, as of September 30, 2011 and December 31, 2010, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from a 200 basis point immediate parallel increase or decrease in interest rates. Similar to the simulation analysis above, due to the current low level of interest rates, the economic value of equity analyses below reflect an interest rate scenario of an immediate 25 basis point drop, to zero percent, while the rising interest rate scenario reflects an immediate 200 basis point rise. The change in the sensitivity of the economic value of equity to a 200 basis point parallel increase in rates between December 31, 2010 and September 30, 2011 was primarily driven by changes in market interest rates, deposit mix, and the Corporation’s mortgage-backed securities portfolio’s forecasted prepayments.

Liquid assets, which totaled $12.5 billion at September 30, 2011, compared to $7.8 billion at December 31, 2010, provide a reservoir of liquidity. Liquid assets include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell, interest-bearing deposits with banks, other short-term investments and unencumbered investment securities available-for-sale. At September 30, 2011, the Corporation held excess liquidity, represented by $4.2 billion deposited with the FRB, compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2010.  The Corporation may access the purchased funds market when necessary, which includes certificates of deposit issued to institutional investors in denominations in excess of $100,000 and to retail customers in denominations of less than $100,000 through brokers (“other time deposits” on the consolidated balance sheets), foreign office time deposits and short-term borrowings. Purchased funds totaled $512 million at September 30, 2011, compared to $562 million at December 31, 2010. Capacity for incremental purchased funds at September 30, 2011, consisted largely of federal funds purchased, brokered certificates of deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. In addition, the Corporation is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, Texas (FHLB), which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. The actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. As of September 30, 2011, the Corporation had $2.0 billion of outstanding borrowings from the FHLB with remaining maturities ranging from May 2013 to May 2014. The Corporation also maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and/or equity securities. Additionally, the Bank had the ability to issue up to $14.8 billion of debt at September 30, 2011 under an existing $15 billion medium-term senior note program which allows the issuance of debt with maturities between three months and 30 years.  Other Market Risks  Certain components of the Corporation’s noninterest income, primarily fiduciary income, are at risk to fluctuations in the market values of underlying assets, particularly equity and debt securities. Other components of noninterest income, primarily brokerage fees, are at risk to changes in the volume of market activity.  At September 30, 2011, the Corporation had a $16 million portfolio of investments in indirect private equity and venture capital funds, with commitments of $9 million to fund additional investments in future periods, compared to a portfolio of $47 million at December 31, 2010. During the nine months ended September 30, 2011, the Corporation sold 49 funds for a total of $33 million and recognized a net gain of $2 million. The value of these investments is at risk to changes in equity markets, general economic conditions and a variety of other factors. The majority of these investments are not readily marketable and are included in “accrued income and other assets” on the consolidated balance sheets. The investments are individually reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value.  For further discussion of market risk, see Note 7 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements and pages 52-59 in the Corporation’s 2010 Annual Report.    77    Table of Contents The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act  On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Financial Reform Act”) was signed into law. The Financial Reform Act provides for, among other matters, increased regulatory supervision and examination of financial institutions, the imposition of more stringent capital requirements on financial institutions and increased regulation of derivatives and hedging transactions. Provided below is an overview of key elements of the Financial Reform Act relevant to the Corporation. Most of the provisions contained in the Financial Reform Act were effective immediately upon enactment; however, many have delayed effective dates. Implementation of the Financial Reform Act will require many new mandatory and discretionary rules to be made by federal regulatory agencies over the next several years. The estimates of the impact on the Corporation discussed below are based on the limited information currently available and, given the uncertainty of the timing and scope of the impact, are subject to change until final rulemaking is complete.        •    Interest on Demand Deposits: Allows interest on commercial demand deposits, which could lead to increased cost of commercial demand deposits, depending on the interplay of interest, deposit credits and service charges.        •    Derivatives: Allows continued trading of foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives. Requires banks to shift energy, uncleared commodities and agriculture derivatives to a separately capitalized subsidiary within their holding company. Directly impacts client-driven energy derivatives business (approximately $1 million in annual revenue, based on full-year 2010).        •    Interchange Fee: Limits debit card transaction processing fees that card issuers can charge to merchants. Based on the final Federal Reserve Board rules, estimated annual revenue from debit card PIN and signature-based interchange fees in 2011 is expected to decrease by approximately $4 million, compared to full-year 2010, and decrease by an incremental $20 million in 2012 compared to 2011.        •    Trust Preferred Securities: Prohibits holding companies with more than $15 billion in assets from including trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital, and allows for a phase-in period of three years, beginning January 1, 2013. As of September 30, 2011, the Corporation had $80 million of trust preferred securities outstanding, due to the acquisition of Sterling. The Corporation called $31 million of the trust preferred securities issued by Sterling effective October 27, 2011 and excluded the amount from Tier 1 and total capital as of September 30, 2011. The Corporation expects to redeem an additional $24 million of callable trust preferred securities in the near future.  Critical Accounting Policies  The Corporation’s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation’s 2010 Annual Report. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation’s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2010, the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to the allowance for credit losses, valuation methodologies, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages 60-68 in the Corporation’s 2010 Annual Report.  The following is the critical accounting policy for goodwill reflecting the results of the most recent impairment test performed in the third quarter 2011. As of the date of this report, the Corporation does not believe there are any other material changes in the nature or categories of the critical accounting policies or estimates and assumptions from those discussed in the Corporation’s 2010 Annual Report.  Goodwill  Goodwill is the value attributed to unidentifiable intangible elements in acquired businesses. Goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment. The Corporation performs its annual evaluation of goodwill impairment in the third quarter of each year and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate goodwill might be impaired. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level, equivalent to a business segment or one level below. The Corporation has three reporting units: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management.    78    Table of Contents As discussed in Note 2 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements, the Corporation completed the acquisition of Sterling in the third quarter 2011. Under the acquisition method of accounting, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date, which involves estimates that are inherently subjective. Initial goodwill of $485 million was recorded after adjusting for the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired and was allocated to the three reporting units based on each reporting units’ estimated economic benefit from the transaction. The annual test of goodwill impairment was performed as of the beginning of the third quarter and excluded the effects of the Sterling acquisition. As a result of deterioration in overall market and economic conditions, clarification regarding legislative and regulatory changes, and the recent announcement by the Federal Reserve that the Federal Funds target rate is expected to remain at current levels through the middle of 2013, the Corporation determined that an additional interim goodwill impairment test should be performed in the third quarter 2011. The additional interim goodwill impairment test included the effects of the Sterling acquisition.  The goodwill impairment test is a two-step test. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of identified reporting units with their carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. At the conclusion of the first step of both goodwill impairment tests performed in the third quarter 2011, the estimated fair values of all reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts, including goodwill.  Estimating the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process involving the use of estimates and judgments. Material assumptions used in the valuation models included the comparable public company price multiples used in the terminal value, future cash flows and the market risk premium component of the discount rate. The estimated fair values of the reporting units were determined using a blend of two commonly used valuation techniques: the market approach and the income approach. The Corporation gives consideration to both valuation techniques, as either technique can be an indicator of value. For the market approach, valuations of reporting units were based on an analysis of relevant price multiples in market trades in companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit. For the income approach, estimated future cash flows (derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for each reporting unit) and terminal value (value at the end of the cash flow period, based on price multiples) were discounted. The discount rate was based on the imputed cost of equity capital appropriate for each reporting unit.  At September 30, 2011, goodwill totaled $635 million, including $380 million allocated to the Business Bank, $194 million allocated to the Retail Bank and $61 million allocated to Wealth Management. The first step of the interim goodwill impairment test performed in the third quarter 2011 indicated that the estimated fair values of the Business Bank and Wealth Management reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values, including goodwill. The estimated fair value of the Retail Bank reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, including goodwill, by approximately three percent. The results of the goodwill impairment test for each reporting unit were subjected to stress testing as appropriate. Economic conditions impact the assumptions related to interest and growth rates, loss rates and imputed cost of equity capital. The fair value estimates for each reporting unit incorporated current economic and market conditions, including the recent Federal Reserve announcement and the impact of legislative and regulatory changes, as described above. However, further weakening in the economic environment, such as adverse changes in interest rates, a decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below their carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Additionally, new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management’s expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Any impairment charge would not affect the Corporation’s regulatory capital ratios, tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position.    79    Table of Contents Supplemental Financial Data  The following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this financial review with financial measures defined by GAAP.

(b) September 30, 2011 Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets are estimated.  The Tier 1 common capital ratio removes preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations. The tangible common equity ratio removes preferred stock and the effect of intangible assets from capital and the effect of intangible assets from total assets. The Corporation believes these measurements are meaningful measures of capital adequacy used by investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and to compare against other companies in the industry.    80    Table of Contents   ITEM 3.
