Decreases of $18 million in noninterest expenses and $6 million in the provision for credit losses were offset by decreases of $21 million in net interest income and $3 million in noninterest income. Noninterest expenses included no merger and restructuring charges for the three months ended June 30, 2013, compared to $8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2012. Net income per diluted common share was $0.76 for the three months ended June 30, 2013, compared to $0.73 for the same period one year ago. Average diluted common shares were 187 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013, compared to 194 million for the same period in the prior year.Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2013 was $277 million, an increase of $3 million from $274 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012. The increase in net income in the six months ended June 30, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, reflected decreases of $49 million in noninterest expenses and $12 million in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by decreases of $47 million in net interest income and $9 million in noninterest income and an increase of $2 million in the provision for income taxes. Noninterest expenses included no merger and restructuring charges for the six months ended June 30, 2013, compared to $8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012. Net income per diluted common share was $1.46 for the six months ended June 30, 2013, compared to $1.39 for the same period one year ago. Average diluted common shares were 187 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013, compared to 195 million for the same period in the prior year.Full-Year 2013 Outlook Compared to Full-Year 2012For full-year 2013, management expects the following compared to 2012, assuming a continuation of the current slow growing economic environment:•Continued growth in average loans at a slower pace, with economic uncertainty impacting demand and a continued focus on maintaining pricing and structure discipline in a competitive environment.•Lower net interest income, reflecting both a decline in purchase accounting accretion and the effect of continued low rates. Loan growth should partially offset the impact of low rates on loans and securities. Purchase accounting accretion is expected to be $25 million to $30 million for full-year 2013, compared to $71 million in full-year 2012.•Provision for credit losses declining, reflecting lower nonperforming loans and net charge-offs, partially offset by loan growth. The provision for credit losses for the second half of 2013 is expected to be similar to the provision for the first six months of 2013.•Customer-driven noninterest income relatively stable, reflecting cross-sell initiatives partially offset by regulatory pressures on certain fees. Outlook does not include expectations for non-customer driven income.•Lower noninterest expense, reflecting further cost savings due to tight expense control and no restructuring expenses. Full-year 2012 included restructuring expenses of $35 million.•Effective tax rate of approximately 27.5 percent.38Table of ContentsNet Interest IncomeQuarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent (FTE) Three Months Ended June 30, 2013 June 30, 2012(dollar amounts in millions)AverageBalanceInterestAverageRate AverageBalanceInterestAverageRateCommercial loans$28,393$2333.29% $25,983$2273.52%Real estate construction loans1,453154.04 1,420154.50Commercial mortgage loans9,192883.86 9,9831124.46Lease financing85573.22 86973.28International loans1,262123.81 1,265123.66Residential mortgage loans1,602164.04 1,487174.53Consumer loans2,136183.30 2,221183.37Total loans (a)44,8933893.47 43,2284083.79        Mortgage-backed securities available-for-sale9,415512.17 9,262582.51Other investment securities available-for-sale37810.56 46610.85Total investment securities available-for-sale9,793522.15 9,728592.49        Interest-bearing deposits with banks (b)4,12530.26 3,55530.26Other short-term investments117—1.05 141—1.55Total earning assets58,9284443.02 56,6524703.35        Cash and due from banks972   931  Allowance for loan losses(625)   (710)  Accrued income and other assets4,434   4,808  Total assets$63,709   $61,681          Money market and interest-bearing checking deposits$21,54480.13 $20,45180.18Savings deposits1,658—0.03 1,60710.07Customer certificates of deposit5,68560.43 6,10790.53Foreign office time deposits48510.60 379—0.64Total interest-bearing deposits29,372150.19 28,544180.25Short-term borrowings193—0.07 68—0.12Medium- and long-term debt4,044141.43 4,854171.40Total interest-bearing sources33,609290.34 33,466350.42        Noninterest-bearing deposits22,076   20,128  Accrued expenses and other liabilities1,042   1,085  Total shareholders’ equity6,982   7,002  Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity$63,709   $61,681          Net interest income/rate spread (FTE) $4152.68  $4352.93        FTE adjustment $1   $—         Impact of net noninterest-bearing sources of funds  0.15   0.17Net interest margin (as a percentage of average earning assets) (FTE) (a) (b)  2.83%   3.10%(a)Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio of $7 million and $18 million increased the net interest margin by 5 basis points and 13 basis points in the three months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.(b)Excess liquidity, represented by average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank, reduced the net interest margin by 18 basis points and 18 basis points in the three months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.39Table of ContentsQuarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent (FTE) (continued) Three Months Ended June 30, 2013/June 30, 2012(in millions)Increase(Decrease)Due to RateIncrease(Decrease)Due to Volume (a)NetIncrease(Decrease)Interest Income (FTE):      Loans$(32)(b)$13 $(19)(b)Investment securities available-for-sale(8) 1 (7) Total interest income (FTE)(40) 14 (26)        Interest Expense:      Interest-bearing deposits(3) — (3) Medium- and long-term debt— (3) (3) Total interest expense(3) (3) (6) Net interest income (FTE)$(37) $17 $(20) (a)Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume.(b)Reflected a decrease of $11 million in accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio.Net interest income was $414 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013, a decrease of $21 million compared to $435 million for the three months ended June 30, 2012. The decrease in net interest income in the three months ended June 30, 2013, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2012, resulted primarily from a decrease in yields and an $11 million decrease in the accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio, partially offset by an increase in average earning assets. Average earning assets increased $2.2 billion, or 4 percent, to $58.9 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2013, compared to $56.7 billion for the same period in 2012. The increase in average earning assets primarily reflected increases of $1.7 billion in average loans and $570 million in average interest-bearing deposits with banks. The net interest margin (FTE) for the three months ended June 30, 2013 decreased 27 basis points to 2.83% percent, from 3.10% percent for the comparable period in 2012, primarily from decreased yields on loans and mortgage-backed investment securities and a decrease in accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio, partially offset by lower deposit rates. The decrease in loan yields reflected a shift in the average loan portfolio mix, largely due to an increase in lower-yielding average commercial loans as well as a decrease in higher-yielding commercial mortgage loans, lower LIBOR rates and positive credit quality migration throughout the portfolio. Yields on mortgage-backed investment securities decreased as a result of prepayments on higher-yielding securities and new investments in lower-yielding securities impacted by the lower rate environment. Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio increased the net interest margin by 5 basis points in the three months ended June 30, 2013, compared to 13 basis points in the same period in 2012, and excess liquidity reduced the net interest margin by approximately 18 basis points in both the three-month periods ended June 30, 2013 and 2012. Excess liquidity was represented by $4.0 billion and $3.5 billion of average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) in the three months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, included in “interest-bearing deposits with banks” on the consolidated balance sheets. The "Quarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent" table above provides an analysis of net interest income (FTE) for the three months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 and details the components of the change in net interest income on a FTE basis for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year.40Table of ContentsYear-to-Date Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent (FTE) Six Months Ended June 30, 2013 June 30, 2012(dollar amounts in millions)AverageBalanceInterestAverageRate AverageBalanceInterestAverageRateCommercial loans$28,225$4623.30% $25,359$4463.54%Real estate construction loans1,384284.10 1,437324.54Commercial mortgage loans9,2951833.97 10,0932314.59Lease financing856143.23 883153.35International loans1,272233.72 1,235233.71Residential mortgage loans1,579334.21 1,503354.65Consumer loans2,145363.33 2,239383.43Total loans (a)44,7567793.51 42,7498203.86        Mortgage-backed securities available-for-sale9,5321042.18 9,3121202.60Other investment securities available-for-sale37410.55 49620.79Total investment securities available-for-sale9,9061052.16 9,8081222.57        Interest-bearing deposits with banks (b)3,99050.26 3,72350.26Other short-term investments11711.67 13811.76Total earning assets58,7698903.06 56,4189483.39        Cash and due from banks975   965  Allowance for loan losses(629)   (723)  Accrued income and other assets4,621   4,853  Total assets$63,736   $61,513          Money market and interest-bearing checking deposits$21,442150.14 $20,623180.18Savings deposits1,640—0.03 1,57510.08Customer certificates of deposit5,715130.45 6,042170.55Foreign office time deposits50520.57 36910.61Total interest-bearing deposits29,302300.20 28,609370.26Short-term borrowings158—0.09 73—0.11Medium- and long-term debt4,374291.37 4,897331.37Total interest-bearing sources33,834590.35 33,579700.42        Noninterest-bearing deposits21,793   19,882  Accrued expenses and other liabilities1,140   1,081  Total shareholders’ equity6,969   6,971  Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity$63,736   $61,513          Net interest income/rate spread (FTE) $8312.71  $8782.97        FTE adjustment $1   $1         Impact of net noninterest-bearing sources of funds  0.15   0.17Net interest margin (as a percentage of average earning assets) (FTE) (a) (b)  2.86%   3.14%(a)Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio of $18 million and $43 million increased the net interest margin by 6 basis points and 15 basis points in the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.(b)Excess liquidity, represented by average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank, reduced the net interest margin by 18 basis points and 20 basis points in the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.41Table of ContentsYear-to-Date Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent (FTE) (continued) Six Months Ended June 30, 2013/June 30, 2012(in millions)Increase(Decrease)Due to RateIncrease(Decrease)Due to Volume (a)NetIncrease(Decrease)Interest Income (FTE):      Loans$(71)(b)$30 $(41)(b)Investment securities available-for-sale(20) 3 (17) Total interest income (FTE)(91) 33 (58)        Interest Expense:      Interest-bearing deposits(8) 1 (7) Medium- and long-term debt— (4) (4) Total interest expense(8) (3) (11) Net interest income (FTE)$(83) $36 $(47) (a)Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume.(b)Reflected a decrease of $25 million in accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio.Net interest income was $830 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013, a decrease of $47 million compared to $877 million for the same period in 2012. The decrease in net interest income in the six months ended June 30, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, resulted primarily from a decrease in yields and a $25 million decrease in the accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio in the six months ended June 30, 2013, partially offset by an increase in average earning assets. Average earning assets increased $2.4 billion, or 4 percent, to $58.8 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2013, compared to $56.4 billion for the same period in 2012. The increase in average earning assets primarily reflected increases of $2.0 billion in average loans and $267 million in average interest-bearing deposits with banks. The net interest margin (FTE) for the six months ended June 30, 2013 decreased 28 basis points to 2.86 percent, from 3.14 percent for the comparable period in 2012, primarily due to the reasons cited in the quarterly discussion above. Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio increased the net interest margin by 6 basis points in the six months ended June 30, 2013, compared to 15 basis points in the same period in 2012, and excess liquidity reduced the net interest margin by approximately 18 basis points in the six months ended June 30, 2013, compared to 20 basis points in the same period in 2012. Excess liquidity was represented by $3.8 billion and $3.6 billion of average balances deposited with the FRB in first six months of 2013 and 2012, respectively, included in “interest-bearing deposits with banks” on the consolidated balance sheets. The "Quarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent" table that follows provides an analysis of net interest income (FTE) for the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 and details the components of the change in net interest income on a FTE basis for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year.For further discussion of the effects of market rates on net interest income, refer to the "Market and Liquidity Risk" section of this financial review.Provision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses was $13 million and $19 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013, and 2012, respectively, and $29 million and $41 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013, and 2012, respectively. The provision for credit losses includes both the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The provision for loan losses is recorded to maintain the allowance for loan losses at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio. For discussion of the allowance for loan losses and the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for loan losses, refer to the "Credit Risk" and "Critical Accounting Policies" sections of this financial review. The provision for loan losses was $13 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013, compared to $8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2012, and was $25 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013, compared to $31 million for the same period in the prior year. Credit quality in the loan portfolio continued to improve in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, compared to the same periods in the prior year, in part reflecting improvements in the U.S. economy. Improvements in credit quality included a decline of $949 million in the Corporation's internal watch list loans from June 30, 2012 to June 30, 2013. Reflected in the decline in watch list loans was a decrease in nonaccrual loans of $270 million. The Corporation's internal watch list is generally consistent with loans in the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful categories defined by regulatory authorities.Net loan charge-offs in the three months ended June 30, 2013 decreased $28 million to $17 million, or 0.15 percent of average total loans, compared to $45 million, or 0.42 percent, for the first three months of 2012. The $28 million decrease in net 42Table of Contentsloan charge-offs in the three months ended June 30, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, primarily reflected decreases in Commercial Real Estate ($16 million) and Private Banking ($7 million). By geographic market, the decrease in net loan charge-offs in the second quarter 2013 compared to the second quarter 2012, primarily reflected decreases in Other Markets ($15 million), Texas ($7 million) and Michigan ($7 million). Net loan charge-offs in the first six months of 2013 decreased $49 million to $41 million, or 0.18 percent of average total loans, compared to $90 million, or 0.42 percent, for the same period in 2012. The $49 million decrease in net loan charge-offs in the first six months of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, primarily reflected decreases in Commercial Real Estate ($30 million) and Private Banking ($13 million). Net loan charge-offs decreased in all geographic markets in the first six months of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments is recorded to maintain the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was zero, a decrease of $11 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2012, and was $4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013, compared to $10 million for the comparable period in prior year. The $11 million and $6 million decreases in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, compared to the same periods in 2012, respectively, resulted primarily from the reduction of specific reserves established in the second quarter 2012 for set aside/bonded stop loss commitments related to residential real estate construction credits in the California market. The reserves for set aside/bonded stop loss commitments were reduced in the second quarter 2013 as the underlying commitments were funded and simultaneously charged-off against the allowance for loan losses. Lending-related commitment charge-offs were insignificant for the three months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012.An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets is presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.Noninterest Income Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,(in millions)2013 2012 2013 2012Customer-driven income:       Service charges on deposit accounts$53 $53 $108 $109Fiduciary income44 39 87 77Commercial lending fees22 24 43 49Letter of credit fees16 18 32 35Card fees13 12 25 23Foreign exchange income9 10 18 20Brokerage fees4 4 9 9Other customer-driven income (a)27 27 50 48Total customer-driven noninterest income188 187 372 370Noncustomer-driven income:       Bank-owned life insurance10 10 19 20Net securities (losses) gains(2) 6 (2) 11Other noncustomer-driven income (a)12 8 19 16Total noninterest income$208 $211 $408 $417(a)The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income.Noninterest income was $208 million for the three months ended June 30, 2013, a decrease of $3 million compared to $211 million for the same period in 2012. Fiduciary income increased $5 million, primarily reflecting an increase in personal trust fees, largely driven by an increase in the volume of fiduciary services sold and increases in market value. Net securities (losses) gains reflected a $2 million charge related to a derivative contract tied to the conversion rate of Visa Class B shares in the three months ended June 30, 2013, compared to gains of $6 million in the three months ended June 30, 2012, primarily from the redemption of auction-rate securities. Other noncustomer-driven income increased $4 million, primarily due to a $5 million increase in deferred compensation asset returns in the three months ended June 30, 2013, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2012. The increase in deferred compensation asset returns in noninterest income is offset by an increase in deferred compensation plan expense in noninterest expenses.Noninterest income was $408 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013, a decrease of $9 million compared to $417 million for the same period in 2012. Fiduciary income increased $10 million and net securities (losses) gains decreased $13 million, primarily for the same reasons described in the quarterly discussion above. In addition, commercial lending fees decreased $6 million in the six months ended June 30, 2013, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in 43Table of Contentssyndication agent fees. Other noncustomer-driven income increased $3 million, primarily due to a $4 million increase in deferred compensation asset returns in the six months ended June 30, 2013, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2013. The increase in deferred compensation asset returns in noninterest income is offset by an increase in deferred compensation plan expense in noninterest expenses. The following table illustrates certain categories included in "other noninterest income" on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

Salaries expense decreased $7 million in the three months ended June 30, 2013, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a reduction in staffing levels and lower expected executive incentive compensation, partially offset by a $5 million increase in deferred compensation plan expense and the impact of annual merit increases. Employee benefits expense increased $2 million, primarily reflecting increased pension expense. Outside processing fee expense increased $4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2013, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2012, primarily due to increased activity tied to revenue growth, transactional costs related to increased volume and outsourcing of certain operational functions. Other noninterest expenses decreased $5 million, primarily reflecting a $10 million decrease in legal and litigation-related expenses, as well as small decreases in several other categories of other noninterest expense, partially offset by a $4 million write-down on other foreclosed assets in the three months ended June 30, 2013. Noninterest expenses were $832 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013, a decrease of $49 million compared to $881 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012. Salaries expense decreased $20 million and employee benefits expense increased $6 million, primarily due to the same reasons discussed above. Other noninterest expenses decreased $20 million, 44Table of Contentsprimarily reflecting a $19 million decrease in legal and litigation-related expenses, as well as small decreases in several other categories of other noninterest expense, partially offset by a $4 million write-down on other foreclosed assets in the six months ended June 30, 2013.Provision for Income TaxesThe provision for income taxes was $50 million for both the three-month periods ended June 30, 2013 and 2012. The provision for income taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2013 was $100 million, compared to $98 million for the same period in 2012. The $2 million increase in the provision for income taxes in the six months ended June 30, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, was primarily due to an increase in pretax net income.45Table of ContentsSTRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESSThe Corporation's management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. These methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines.In the first quarter 2013, the Corporation changed the method of assigning the allowance for loan losses to each segment. In 2012, national probability of default and loss given default statistics were incorporated into the Corporation's allowance methodology. Each segment was assigned an allowance for loan losses based on market-specific standard reserve factors applied to the loans in each segment, and the difference between the total allowance required on a national basis and the market-specific allowances was allocated based on the relative loan balances in each segment. Effective first quarter 2013, each segment is assigned an allowance for loan losses by applying national standard reserve factors to the loan balances in each segment by risk rating distribution. For comparability purposes, amounts in all periods are based on segments and methodologies in effect at June 30, 2013. For further information regarding the Corporation's segment methodologies, refer to page F-13 of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report.Business SegmentsThe Corporation's operations are strategically aligned into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based upon the products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, Finance is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes discontinued operations and items not directly associated with these business segments or the Finance segment. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of these business segments for the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012.The following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.

Assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with specified risk-weighting factors. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items. As shown in the table below, the Corporation's capital ratios increased from December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013.The Corporation's capital ratios exceeded minimum regulatory requirements as follows: June 30, 2013 December 31, 2012(dollar amounts in millions)Capital Ratio Capital RatioTier 1 common (a) (b)$6,800 10.41% $6,705 10.14%Tier 1 risk-based (4.00% - minimum) (b)6,800 10.41 6,705 10.14Total risk-based (8.00% - minimum) (b)8,667 13.27 8,695 13.15Leverage (3.00% - minimum) (b)6,800 10.81 6,705 10.57Tangible common equity (a)6,256 10.04 6,285 9.76(a)See Supplemental Financial Data section for reconcilements of non-GAAP financial measures.(b)June 30, 2013 capital and ratios are estimated.In July 2013, U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule for the U.S. adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework. The regulatory framework includes a more conservative definition of capital, two new capital buffers - a conservation buffer and a countercyclical buffer, new and more stringent risk weight categories for assets and off-balance sheet items, and a supplemental leverage ratio. As a banking organization subject to the standardized approach, the rules will be effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2015, with certain transition provisions phasing in through January 1, 2018.According to the rule, the Corporation will be subject to the capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent, when fully phased in, to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses. However, the rules do not subject the Corporation to the capital countercyclical buffer of up to 2.5 percent or the supplemental leverage ratio. The Corporation estimates the June 30, 2013 Tier 1 and Tier 1 common risk-based ratio would be 10.1 percent if calculated under the final rule, assuming the Corporation elects to exclude most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) from regulatory capital. If the option to exclude most elements of AOCI from regulatory capital is not elected, the estimated ratio would be 9.3 percent. Under both scenarios, the Corporation's June 30, 2013 estimated Tier 1 and Tier 1 common capital ratios exceed the minimum required by the final rule (7 percent and 8.5 percent, respectively, including the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer). For a reconcilement of these non-GAAP financial measures, refer to the "Supplemental Financial Data" section of this financial review.The Basel III liquidity framework, which was revised by the Basel Committee in January 2013, includes two minimum liquidity measures. Rules are expected to be implemented between 2015 and 2019. Adoption in the U.S. is expected to occur over 52Table of Contentsa similar timeframe, but the final form of the U.S. rules is not yet known. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) requires a financial institution to hold a buffer of high-quality, liquid assets to fully cover net cash outflows under a 30-day systematic liquidity stress scenario. The revisions announced by the Basel Committee in January 2013 eased several requirements related to the LCR, including certain outflow assumptions. The Net Stable Funding Ratio requires the amount of available longer-term, stable sources of funding to be at least 100 percent of the required amount of longer-term stable funding over a one-year period. The Corporation's liquidity position is strong, but if subject to the Basel III liquidity framework as currently proposed, the Corporation may decide to consider additional liquidity management initiatives. While uncertainty exists in the final form and timing of the U.S. rules implementing the Basel III liquidity framework and whether or not the Corporation will be subject to the full requirements, the Corporation is closely monitoring the development of the rules. We expect to meet the final requirements adopted by U.S. banking regulators within regulatory timelines.53Table of ContentsRISK MANAGEMENTThe following updated information should be read in conjunction with the "Risk Management" section on pages F-23 through F-41 in the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report.Credit RiskAllowance for Credit LossesThe allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The allowance for loan losses represents management's assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporation's loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in "accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets, provides for probable losses inherent in lending-related commitments, including unused commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.The Corporation disaggregates the loan portfolio into segments for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses. These segments are based on the level at which the Corporation develops, documents and applies a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The Corporation's portfolio segments are business loans and retail loans. Business loans are defined as those belonging to the commercial, real estate construction, commercial mortgage, lease financing and international loan portfolios. Retail loans consist of traditional residential mortgage, home equity and other consumer loans.The allowance for loan losses includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain loans, and allowances for homogeneous pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. In the first quarter 2013, the Corporation implemented enhancements to the approach utilized for determining standard reserve factors for business loans not individually evaluated by changing from a dollar-based migration method for developing probability of default statistics to a count-based method. Under the dollar-based method, each dollar that moved to default received equal weight in the determination of standard reserve factors for each internal risk rating. As a result, the movement of larger loans impacted standard reserve factors more than the movement of smaller loans. By moving to a count-based approach, where each loan that moves to default receives equal weighting, unusually large or small loans will not have a disproportionate influence on the standard reserve factors. The change resulted in a $40 million increase to the allowance for loan losses at March 31, 2013. The U.S. economy showed evidence of ongoing moderate economic expansion through the second quarter 2013. A complex mix of forces remained engaged that provided some forward momentum, but prevented the economy from growing at a robust pace. Forward momentum was fueled by improving residential real estate conditions. The combination of growing homeowner equity and improved investment portfolios created a positive wealth effect for many homeowners, and contributed to an increase in consumer confidence, supporting consumer spending in the second quarter 2013, including spending on automobiles. This promoted moderate job growth through the quarter which further reinforced consumer spending. These positive forces were held in check by tightening fiscal policy. Federal spending was suppressed through the second quarter as a result of the spending sequester that took effect at the end of March. State and local government spending remained weak even though tax collections improved. Monetary policy was also an important economic factor in the second quarter. The Federal Reserve maintained highly accommodative monetary policy by keeping the federal funds rate near zero, by maintaining its program of asset purchases known as QE3, and by communicating its intent to keep policy highly accommodative for an extended period. However, the expectation that the Federal Reserve may begin to wind down QE3 sometime this fall has grown, contributing to an upward shift in the Treasury yield curve, particularly at the long end of the curve. Global economic demand remained impaired as the European recession lingered. China's economy also showed signs of cooling. As a result of this mix of opposing forces, U.S. real gross domestic product for 2013 is expected to grow by only 1.8 percent over 2012. The Texas economy is expected to continue to be a job growth leader for the remainder of the year. Michigan is expected to benefit from moderate gains in auto sales over the course of 2013, and from firmer commercial and residential real estate conditions. California should feel the broad positive effects of improved real estate markets through the end of the year.The allowance for loan losses was $613 million at June 30, 2013, compared to $629 million at December 31, 2012, a decrease of $16 million, or 3 percent. The decrease reflected the impact of improvements in the U.S. economy as described above and resulted primarily from a reduction in specific reserves due to a decline in individually evaluated loan balances and a reduction in reserves required on collateral-dependent impaired loans, the elimination of certain incremental industry reserves and lower loan balances in pools of loans with higher standard reserve factors, partially offset by an increase in the allowance for loan losses resulting from the enhancements to the approach utilized for determining standard reserve factors described above. The $16 million decrease in the allowance for loan losses primarily reflected decreased reserves in Commercial Real Estate, Private Banking and general Middle Market, partially offset by increased reserves in Technology and Life Sciences, and Energy. By market, reserves decreased in Michigan and Other Markets and increased in California (primarily Technology and Life Sciences) and Texas (primarily Energy).Acquired loans were initially recorded at fair value, which included an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans, and therefore no corresponding allowance for loan losses was recorded for these loans at 54Table of Contentsacquisition. Methods utilized to estimate the required allowance for loan losses for acquired loans not deemed credit-impaired at acquisition are similar to originated loans; however, the estimate of loss is based on the unpaid principal balance less the remaining purchase discount, either on an individually evaluated basis or based on the pool of acquired loans not deemed credit-impaired at acquisition within each risk rating, as applicable. At June 30, 2013, there was no allowance for loan losses on acquired loans, and $28 million of purchase discount remained, compared to a $3 million allowance for loan losses and $41 million of remaining purchase discount at December 31, 2012.The total allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb incurred losses inherent in the total loan portfolio. Unanticipated economic events, including political, economic and regulatory instability could cause changes in the credit characteristics of the portfolio and result in an unanticipated increase in the allowance. Inclusion of other industry-specific portfolio exposures in the allowance, as well as significant increases in the current portfolio exposures, could also increase the amount of the allowance. Any of these events, or some combination thereof, may result in the need for additional provision for loan losses in order to maintain an allowance that complies with credit risk and accounting policies. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain letters of credit in a manner consistent with business loans, and allowances based on the pool of the remaining letters of credit and all unused commitments to extend credit within each internal risk rating.The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $36 million at June 30, 2013, an increase of $4 million from $32 million at December 31, 2012. The $4 million increase in the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments resulted primarily from an increase in specific reserves in the first six months of 2013 for standby letters of credit. An allowance for credit losses will be recorded on acquired lending-related commitments only to the extent that the required allowance exceeds the remaining purchase discount. The purchase discount remaining for acquired lending-related commitments was $2 million at both June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012. No allowance was recorded on acquired lending-related commitments at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012. For additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses, refer to the "Critical Accounting Policies" section of this financial review and Notes 1 and 4 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements.Nonperforming AssetsNonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, troubled debt restructured loans (TDRs) which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans) and foreclosed property. TDRs include performing and nonperforming loans. Nonperforming TDRs are either on nonaccrual or reduced-rate status. Nonperforming assets do not include purchased credit impaired (PCI) loans.55Table of ContentsSUMMARY OF NONPERFORMING ASSETS AND PAST DUE LOANS(dollar amounts in millions)June 30, 2013 December 31, 2012Nonaccrual loans:   Business loans:   Commercial$102 $103Real estate construction:   Commercial Real Estate business line (a)26 30Other business lines (b)2 3Total real estate construction28 33Commercial mortgage:   Commercial Real Estate business line (a)69 94Other business lines (b)157 181Total commercial mortgage226 275Lease financing— 3Total nonaccrual business loans356 414Retail loans:   Residential mortgage62 70Consumer:   Home equity28 31Other consumer3 4Total consumer31 35Total nonaccrual retail loans93 105Total nonaccrual loans449 519Reduced-rate loans22 22Total nonperforming loans471 541Foreclosed property29 54Total nonperforming assets$500 $595Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans1.04% 1.17%Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and foreclosed property1.10 1.29Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total nonperforming loans130 116Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing$20 $23Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing as a percentage of total loans0.04% 0.05%(a)Primarily loans to real estate developers.(b)Primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate.Nonperforming assets decreased $95 million to $500 million at June 30, 2013, from $595 million at December 31, 2012.

Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $10.5 billion at June 30, 2013, of which $3.0 billion, or 28 percent, were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to real estate developers. The remaining $7.5 billion, or 72 percent, of commercial real estate loans in other business lines consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans. The real estate construction loan portfolio totaled $1.5 billion at June 30, 2013. The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-time customers with satisfactory completion experience. Of the $1.2 billion of real estate 59Table of Contentsconstruction loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line, $26 million were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2013. In other business lines, $2 million of real estate construction loans were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2013. The commercial mortgage loan portfolio totaled $9.0 billion at June 30, 2013 and included $1.8 billion in the Commercial Real Estate business line and $7.2 billion in other business lines. Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Of the $1.8 billion of commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line, $69 million were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2013. Commercial mortgage loan net charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line were $1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013. In other business lines, $157 million of commercial mortgage loans were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2013, and net charge-offs were $13 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013. The geographic distribution and project type of commercial real estate loans are important factors in diversifying credit risk within the portfolio.

Residential mortgages totaled $1.6 billion at June 30, 2013, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.6 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $62 million were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2013. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.5 billion at June 30, 2013, of which $1.4 billion was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit and $125 million were closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.5 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $28 million were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2013. A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at June 30, 2013. The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation's primary geographic markets. Substantially all residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more are placed on nonaccrual status, and substantially all junior lien home equity loans that are current or less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status if full collection of the senior position is in doubt. Such loans are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell no later than 180 days past due.Shared National CreditsShared National Credit (SNC) loans are facilities greater than $20 million shared by three or more federally supervised financial institutions that are reviewed annually by regulatory authorities at the agent bank level. The Corporation generally seeks to obtain ancillary business at the origination of a SNC relationship. Loans classified as SNC loans (approximately 870 borrowers at June 30, 2013) were $9.2 billion and $9.4 billion at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. Comerica Bank (the Bank) was the agent for $1.6 billion of the SNC loans outstanding at both June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012. SNC net loan charge-offs totaled $5 million and $8 million for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013, respectively, compared to $4 million and $18 million for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, respectively. Nonaccrual SNC loans decreased $12 million to $12 million at June 30, 2013, compared to $24 million at December 31, 2012. SNC loans, diversified by both business line and geographic market, comprised approximately 20 percent of total loans at both June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012. SNC loans are held to the same credit underwriting and pricing standards as the remainder of the loan portfolio. Energy LendingThe Corporation has a portfolio of energy-related loans that are included primarily in "commercial loans" in the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation has over 30 years of experience in energy lending, with a focus on middle market companies. Loans in the Middle Market - Energy business line were $2.9 billion and $3.0 billion at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively, or approximately 6 percent of total loans each period. Nonaccrual Middle Market - Energy loans totaled $1 million and $3 million at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. Middle Market - Energy net loan charge-offs were zero for both three-month periods ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 and totaled $2 million for both six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 and 2012. Energy loans are diverse in nature, with outstanding balances by customer market segment distributed approximately as follows at June 30, 2013: 66 percent exploration and production (comprised of approximately 53 percent oil, 27 percent mixed and 20 percent natural gas), 20 percent midstream and 14 percent energy services.Automotive LendingSubstantially all dealer loans are in the National Dealer Services business line. Loans in the National Dealer Services business line include floor plan financing and other loans to automotive dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in “commercial loans” in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $3.2 billion at June 30, 2013, an increase of $302 million compared to $2.9 billion at December 31, 2012. At June 30, 2013, other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $2.1 billion, including $1.4 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans, compared to $2.2 billion of other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Service line, including $1.5 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans, at December 31, 2012. Automotive lending also includes loans to borrowers involved with automotive production, primarily Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers. Loans to borrowers involved with automotive production totaled approximately $1.2 billion at both June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012.61Table of ContentsState and Local MunicipalitiesIn the normal course of business, the Corporation serves the needs of state and local municipalities in multiple capacities, including traditional banking products such as deposit services, loans and letters of credit, investment banking services such as bond underwriting and private placements, and by investing in municipal securities.The following table summarizes the Corporation's direct exposure to state and local municipalities as of June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012.(in millions)June 30, 2013 December 31, 2012Loans outstanding$42 $53Lease financing347 359Investment securities available-for-sale25 23Trading account securities8 19Standby letters of credit108 108Unused commitments to extend credit43 24Total direct exposure to state and local municipalities$573 $586Indirect exposure comprised $119 million in auction-rate preferred securities collateralized by municipal securities at June 30, 2013, compared to $127 million at December 31, 2012. Additionally, the Corporation is exposed to Automated Clearing House (ACH) transaction risk for those municipalities utilizing this electronic payment and/or deposit method and similar products in their cash flow management. The Corporation sets limits on ACH activity during the underwriting process.Extensions of credit to state and local municipalities are subjected to the same underwriting standards as other business loans. At both June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, all outstanding municipal loans and leases were performing according to contractual terms, and one municipal lease was included in the Corporation's internal watch list. Municipal leases are secured by the underlying equipment, and a substantial majority of the leases are fully defeased with AAA-rated U.S. government securities. Substantially all municipal investment securities available-for sale are auction-rate securities. All auction-rate securities are reviewed quarterly for other-than-temporary impairment. All auction-rate municipal securities were rated investment grade, and all auction-rate preferred securities collateralized by municipal securities were rated investment grade and were adequately collateralized at both June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012. Municipal securities are held in the trading account for resale to customers. In addition, Comerica Securities, a broker-dealer subsidiary of the Bank, underwrites bonds issued by municipalities. All bonds underwritten by Comerica Securities are sold to third party investors. On July 18, 2013, the city of Detroit filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection in federal court. The Corporation's direct exposure to the city of Detroit is insignificant. International ExposureInternational assets are subject to general risks inherent in the conduct of business in foreign countries, including economic uncertainties and each foreign government's regulations. Risk management practices minimize the risk inherent in international lending arrangements. These practices include structuring bilateral agreements or participating in bank facilities, which secure repayment from sources external to the borrower's country. Accordingly, such international outstandings are excluded from the cross-border risk of that country. 62Table of ContentsThe Corporation does not hold any sovereign exposure to Europe. The Corporation's international strategy as it pertains to Europe is to focus on European companies doing business in North America, with an emphasis on the Corporation's primary geographic markets. The following table summarizes cross-border exposure to entities domiciled in European countries at June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012.

Liquidity risk represents the failure to meet financial obligations coming due resulting from an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding, and the inability to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significant changes in pricing, due to inadequate market depth or market disruptions.The Asset and Liability Policy Committee (ALCO) of the Corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities. ALCO meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies, and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit gathering and risk management. The Corporation's Treasury Department supports ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate, liquidity and coordination of all other market risks. The area's key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analysis of the Corporation's balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate, liquidity and all other market risks; (ii) monitoring and reporting of the Corporation's positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines; (iii) development and presentation of analysis and strategies to adjust risk positions; (iv) review and presentation of policies and authorizations for approval; (v) monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate, liquidity and all other market risks; (vi) developing and monitoring the interest rate risk economic capital estimate; and (vii) monitoring of capital adequacy in accordance with the Capital Management Policy.63Table of ContentsInterest Rate RiskNet interest income is the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises primarily through the Corporation's core business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by a combination of core deposits and wholesale borrowings. Approximately 85 percent of the Corporation's loans were floating at June 30, 2013, of which approximately 75 percent were based on LIBOR and 25 percent were based on Prime. This creates a natural imbalance between the floating-rate loan portfolio and the more slowly repricing deposit products. The result is that growth and/or contraction in the Corporation's core businesses may lead to sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing investment securities, primarily fixed-rate, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, and hedging the sensitivity with interest rate swaps. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk, with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.The Corporation frequently evaluates net interest income under various balance sheet and interest rate scenarios, looking at a 12-month time horizon, using simulation modeling analysis as its principal risk management evaluation technique. The results of this analysis provides the information needed to assess the balance sheet structure. Changes in economic activity, whether domestic or international, different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis could translate into a materially different interest rate environment than currently expected. Management evaluates a base case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment and what is believed to be the most likely balance sheet structure. This base case net interest income is then evaluated against non-parallel interest rate scenarios that increase and decrease 200 basis points in a linear fashion from the base case over 12 months, resulting in an average change in interest rates of 100 basis points over the period. Due to the current low level of interest rates, the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of a 25 basis point drop, to zero percent. In addition, consistent with each interest rate scenario, adjustments are made to assumptions regarding asset prepayment levels, yield curves, and overall balance sheet mix and growth. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model may not precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions and management strategies, among other factors. However, the model can indicate the likely direction of change. Existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes are included in the analysis, but no additional hedging is forecasted.The table below, as of June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above. The sensitivity increased from December 31, 2012 to June 30, 2013 primarily due to higher forecasted core deposits, though risk to declining interest rates is limited by the current low level of rates.Sensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest Rates June 30, 2013 December 31, 2012(in millions)Amount % Amount %Change in Interest Rates:       +200 basis points$187 11 % $178 11 %-25 basis points (to zero percent)(29) (2) (23) (1)Corporate policy limits adverse change to no more than four percent of management's base case net interest income forecast, and the Corporation was within this policy guideline at June 30, 2013. Interest rate risk is actively managed principally through the use of either on-balance sheet financial instruments or interest rate derivatives to achieve the desired risk profile.In addition to the simulation analysis, an economic value of equity analysis is performed for a longer term view of the interest rate risk position. The economic value of equity analysis begins with an estimate of the economic value of the financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments on the Corporation's balance sheet, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period. Next, the estimated impact of rate movements is applied to the economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments. The economic value of equity is then calculated as the difference between the estimated market value of assets and liabilities net of the impact of off-balance sheet instruments. As with net interest income simulation analysis, a variety of alternative scenarios are performed to measure the impact on economic value of equity, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve.64Table of ContentsThe table below, as of June 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from a 200 basis point immediate parallel increase or decrease in interest rates. Similar to the simulation analysis above, due to the current low level of interest rates, the economic value of equity analyses below reflect an interest rate scenario of an immediate 25 basis point drop, to zero percent, while the rising interest rate scenario reflects an immediate 200 basis point rise. The change in the sensitivity of the economic value of equity to a 200 basis point parallel increase in rates between December 31, 2012 and June 30, 2013 was primarily driven by changes in market interest rates, an increase in period-end deposits, and a reduction in the Corporation's mortgage-backed securities portfolio.

Capacity for incremental purchased funds at June 30, 2013 included the ability to purchase federal funds, sell securities under agreements to repurchase, as well as issue deposits to institutional investors and issue certificates of deposit through brokers. Purchased funds totaled $568 million at June 30, 2013, compared to $612 million at December 31, 2012.The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, Texas (FHLB), which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. At June 30, 2013, $14 billion of real estate-related loans were pledged to the FHLB as blanket collateral for current and potential future borrowings. As of June 30, 2013, the Corporation had $1.0 billion of outstanding borrowings from the FHLB maturing in May 2014. Additionally, the Bank had the ability to issue up to $15.0 billion of debt at June 30, 2013 under an existing $15 billion medium-term senior note program which allows the issuance of debt with maturities between three months and 30 years. The Corporation also maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and/or equity securities.The ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise funds at competitive rates is impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings of the Corporation and the Bank. As of June 30, 2013, the four major rating agencies had assigned the following ratings to long-term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Liquid assets, which totaled $10.9 billion at June 30, 2013, compared to $12.1 billion at December 31, 2012, provide a reservoir of liquidity. Liquid assets include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits with banks, other short-term investments and unencumbered investment securities available-for-sale. At June 30, 2013, the Corporation held excess liquidity, represented by $2.8 billion deposited with the FRB, compared to $2.9 billion at December 31, 2012.65Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe Corporation’s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation’s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2012, the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to the allowance for credit losses, valuation methodologies, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages F-42 through F-47 in the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report. As of the date of this report, there have been no significant changes to the Corporation's critical accounting policies, except as discussed below.Allowance for Credit LossesThe allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments.The allowance for loan losses represents management’s assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporation’s loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain loans, and allowances for homogeneous pools of loans with similar risk characteristics.The allowance for business loans which do not meet the criteria to be evaluated individually is determined by applying standard reserve factors to the pool of business loans within each internal risk rating. In the first quarter 2013, the Corporation enhanced the approach utilized for determining standard reserve factors by changing from a dollar-based migration method for developing probability of default statistics to a count-based method. Under the dollar-based method, each dollar that moved to default received equal weight in the determination of standard reserve factors for each internal risk rating. Under the count-based approach, each loan that moves to default receives equal weighting. The change resulted in a $40 million increase to the allowance for loan losses at March 31, 2013.For further discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses, refer to the “Allowance for Credit Losses” section in this financial review and Note 1 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.66Table of ContentsSUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATAThe following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this financial review with financial measures defined by GAAP.(dollar amounts in millions)June 30, 2013 December 31, 2012Tier 1 Common Capital Ratio:   Tier 1 and Tier 1 common capital (a) (b)$6,800 $6,705Risk-weighted assets (a) (b)65,312 66,115Tier 1 and Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio (b)10.41% 10.14%Basel III Tier 1 Common Capital Ratio:   Tier 1 and Tier 1 common capital (b)$6,800 $6,705Basel III adjustments (c)— (39)Basel III Tier 1and Tier 1 common capital (c)6,800 6,666Basel III adjustments (d)(537) (413)Basel III Tier 1 and Tier 1 common capital (d)$6,263 $6,253Risk-weighted assets (a) (b)$65,312 $66,115Basel III adjustments (c)2,165 1,854Basel III risk-weighted assets (c)$67,477 $67,969Tier 1 and Tier 1 common capital ratio (b)10.4% 10.1%Basel III Tier 1 and Tier 1 common capital ratio (c)10.1 9.8Basel III Tier 1 and Tier 1 common capital ratio (d)9.3 9.2Tangible Common Equity Ratio:   Common shareholders' equity$6,911 $6,942Less:   Goodwill635 635Other intangible assets20 22Tangible common equity$6,256 $6,285Total assets$62,947 $65,069Less:   Goodwill635 635Other intangible assets20 22Tangible assets$62,292 $64,412Common equity ratio10.98% 10.67%Tangible common equity ratio10.04 9.76Tangible Common Equity per Share of Common Stock:   Common shareholders' equity$6,911 $6,942Tangible common equity6,256 6,285Shares of common stock outstanding (in millions)185 188Common shareholders' equity per share of common stock$37.29 $36.87Tangible common equity per share of common stock33.76 33.38(a)Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as defined by regulation.(b)June 30, 2013 Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted-assets are estimated.(c)Estimated ratios based on the standardized approach in the final rule for the U.S. adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework and assuming the election to exclude most elements of AOCI.(d)Estimated ratios based on the standardized approach in the final Basel III capital rules, assuming no election to exclude most elements of AOCI.The Tier 1 common capital ratio removes preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations. The Basel III Tier 1 common capital ratio further adjusts Tier 1 common capital and risk-weighted assets to account for the final rule approved by U.S. banking regulators in July 2013 for the U.S. adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework. The final Basel III capital rules are effective January 1, 2015 for banking organizations subject to the standardized approach. The tangible common equity ratio removes preferred stock and the effect of intangible assets from capital and the effect of intangible assets from total assets and tangible common equity per share of common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders' equity per share of common stock. The Corporation believes these measurements are meaningful measures of capital adequacy used by investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and to compare against other companies in the industry.67Table of ContentsITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskQuantitative and qualitative disclosures for the current period can be found in the "Market and Liquidity Risk" section of "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures(a)Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Corporation maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Corporation's management, including the Corporation's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management has evaluated, with the participation of the Corporation's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the Corporation's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report (the "Evaluation Date"). Based on the evaluation, the Corporation's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Corporation's disclosure controls and procedures are effective.(b)Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. During the period to which this report relates, there have not been any changes in the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, such controls.PART II.

Risk FactorsOther than as set forth below, there has been no material change in the Corporation's risk factors as previously disclosed in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 in response to Part I, Item 1A. of such Form 10-K. Such risk factors are incorporated herein by reference.Below we amend the following risk factor discussed in Part I, "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.•Competitive product and pricing pressures among financial institutions within Comerica's markets may change.Comerica operates in a very competitive environment, which is characterized by competition from a number of other financial institutions in each market in which it operates. Comerica competes with large national and regional financial institutions and with smaller financial institutions in terms of products and pricing. Some of Comerica's larger competitors, including certain nationwide banks that have a significant presence in Comerica's market area, may make available to their customers a broader array of product, pricing and structure alternatives and, due to their asset size, may more easily absorb loans in a larger overall portfolio. Some of Comerica's smaller competitors may have more liberal lending policies and processes. Additionally, the financial services industry has recently been subject to increasing regulation. For more information, see “Supervision and Regulation.” Such regulations may require significant investments in technology, personnel or other resources or place limitations on the ability of financial institutions, including Comerica, to engage in certain activities. Comerica's competitors may be subject to a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation due to their asset size or types of products offered. They may also have the ability to more efficiently utilize resources to comply with regulations or may be able to more effectively absorb the costs of regulations into their existing cost structure. If Comerica is unable to compete effectively in products and pricing in its markets, business could decline, which could have a material adverse effect on Comerica's business, financial condition or results of operations.ITEM 2.
