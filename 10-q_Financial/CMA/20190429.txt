Net income per diluted common share for the same respective periods was $2.11 compared to $1.59. Careful management of loan and deposit pricing in a rising rate environment, sustained strong credit quality and expense control contributed to the increase in net income. The following table lists certain items impacting net income and earnings per share for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.

assuming a continuation of the current economic and rate environment:•Growth in average loans of 2 percent to 4 percent, reflecting increases in most lines of business. •Decline in average deposits of 1 percent to 2 percent from a decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits.•Growth in net interest income of 3 percent to 4 percent from the full-year net benefit of higher interest rates, growth in average loans and repositioning the securities portfolio, partially offset by higher wholesale funding, a shift in deposit mix and lower interest recoveries.•Provision for credit losses of 10 basis points to 15 basis points and net charge-offs to remain low, with continued strong credit quality.•Noninterest income higher by 1 percent to 2 percent (including $8 million securities repositioning loss in first quarter 2019), benefiting from growth in card fees and fiduciary income, partially offset by lower derivative income and service charges on deposit accounts.•Noninterest expenses lower by 3 percent, reflecting the end of restructuring charges from the GEAR Up initiatives ($53 million in full-year 2018), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") insurance expense lower by $16 million from the discontinuance of the surcharge, as well as lower compensation and pension expense, partially offset by higher outside processing expenses in line with growing revenue, technology expenditures and typical inflationary pressures.◦Lower compensation driven by incentive compensation, partially offset by merit increases.•Income tax expense to be approximately 23 percent of pre-tax income, excluding any tax impact from employee stock transactions.◦Full-year 2018 included discrete tax benefits of $48 million.•Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio target of 9.5 percent to 10 percent through continued return of excess capital.33Table of ContentsNet Interest IncomeQuarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income  Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 March 31, 2018(dollar amounts in

for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The increase in net interest income primarily reflected a net benefit from higher rates and a $1.3 billion increase in average loans, partially offset by the impact of a $1.5 billion increase in average debt primarily used for share repurchases as well as a $1.7 billion decrease in Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) deposits. The net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2019 increased 38 basis points to 3.79 percent, from 3.41 percent for the comparable period in 2018, primarily reflecting the net benefit from higher rates, higher average loan balances and a decrease in lower-yielding FRB deposit balances, partially offset by higher average debt.For further discussion of the effects of market rates on net interest income, refer to the "Market and Liquidity Risk" section of this financial review.Provision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses was a benefit of $13 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to a provision expense of $12 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The provision for credit losses includes both the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The provision for loan losses is recorded to maintain the allowance for loan losses at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio and includes qualitative adjustments for factors that have not been fully accounted for in the quantitative reserve calculations.The provision for loan losses decreased $27 million to a benefit of $13 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to a provision expense of $14 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in the provision primarily reflected sustained strong credit quality in most lines of business driven by low levels of net charge-offs and inflows of nonaccrual loans as well as a decline in nonperforming loans. Net loan charge-offs decreased $17 million to $11 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to $28 million for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The decrease in net charge-offs was primarily reflected in general Middle Market and Small Business. Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans decreased 29 basis points to 0.39 percent for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to the same period in the prior year.The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments is recorded to maintain the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments. No provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was necessary for the three months ended March 31, 2019. Additionally, there were no lending-related commitment charge-offs for both the three-month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets is presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.35Table of ContentsNoninterest Income Three Months Ended March 31,(in millions)2019 2018Card fees$63 $59Service charges on deposit accounts51 54Fiduciary income49 52Commercial lending fees22 18Foreign exchange income11 12Letter of credit fees9 10Bank-owned life insurance9 9Brokerage fees7 7Net securities (losses) gains(8) 1Other noninterest income (a)25 22Total noninterest income$238 $244(a)The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income.Noninterest income decreased $6 million to $238 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to $244 million for the same period in 2018. Excluding an $8 million pre-tax loss on the sale of securities from repositioning approximately $1 billion of treasury securities, noninterest income increased $2 million, reflecting increases in syndication agent fees (component of commercial lending fees) and card fees, partially offset by decreases in service charges on deposit accounts and fiduciary income.The following table illustrates certain categories included in other noninterest income on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

Excluding $16 million of restructuring charges completed in 2018, noninterest expenses increased $3 million, reflecting an increase in salaries and benefits expense, partially offset by a decrease in FDIC insurance expense due to the end of FDIC surcharges. The increase in salaries and benefits expense was primarily due to an increase in technology-related labor costs and the impact of merit increases.36Table of ContentsProvision for Income TaxesThe provision for income taxes increased $31 million to $85 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to $54 million for the same period in 2018, due to an increase in pre-tax income and an $11 million decrease in discrete tax benefits, primarily from a lower volume of employee stock transactions. STRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESSThe Corporation has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, the Finance Division is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes items not directly associated with these business segments or the Finance segment. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Market segment results are also provided for the Corporation's three primary geographic markets: Michigan, California and Texas. In addition to the three primary geographic markets, Other Markets is also reported as a market segment. Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of these business and market segments for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.The Corporation's management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. These methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines. Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation's 2018 Annual Report describes the Corporation's segment reporting methodology.Net interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities plus the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing (FTP). The FTP methodology allocates credits to each business segment for deposits and other funds provided as well as charges for loans and other assets being funded. FTP crediting rates for deposits and other funds provided reflect the long-term value of deposits and other funding sources based on their implied maturities. FTP charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost of funds based on the pricing and duration characteristics of the assets. Therefore, net interest income for each segment primarily reflects the volume and associated FTP impacts of loan and deposit levels. Business segments that generate deposits benefited from higher FTP crediting rates on deposits in the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. As overall market rates increased, FTP charges for funding loans increased for asset-generating business segments in the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to the same period in the prior year. Additionally, the net FTP impact to a specific business or market segment is a function of the changes in that segment's balance sheet composition, primarily loan and deposit volumes.The following sections present a summary of the performance of each of the Corporation's business and market segments for the three months ended March 31, 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year. Business SegmentsThe following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.

A $753 million decrease in interest-bearing deposits with banks was mostly offset by a $621 million increase in accrued income and other assets. On an average basis, total assets decreased $1.0 billion to $69.8 billion in the first quarter 2019, compared to $70.8 billion in the fourth quarter 2018, driven by a $2.1 billion decrease in interest-bearing deposits with banks, partially offset by an $845 million increase in average loans.The following tables provide information about the change in the Corporation's average loan portfolio in the first quarter 2019, compared to the fourth quarter 2018, by loan type and geographic market.

The decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits included a $1.2 billion decrease due to the timing of deposits by the U.S. Treasury funding a government card program which typically fund on the first day of each month. The January payment was received in the fourth quarter of 2018 due to the New Year's holiday. The increase in short-term borrowings reflected temporary increases in federal funds purchased and short-term Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances. The increase in medium- and long-term debt reflected the issuance of $350 million in long-term notes during the first quarter 2019. On an average basis, total liabilities decreased $1.0 billion in the first quarter 2019, compared to the fourth quarter 2018, due to a $1.7 billion seasonal decrease in total deposits, mostly offset by increases of $311 million in accrued expenses and other liabilities as well as $274 million in medium- and long-term debt.39Table of ContentsCapitalTotal shareholders' equity decreased $98 million to $7.4 billion at March 31, 2019, compared to $7.5 billion at December 31, 2018.

The allowance for loan losses represents management's assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporation's loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, provides for probable losses inherent in lending-related commitments, including unused commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.The allowance for loan losses was $647 million at March 31, 2019, compared to $671 million at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $24 million, or 4 percent. As a percentage of total loans, the allowance for loan losses was 1.29 percent at March 31, 2019, compared to 1.34 percent at December 31, 2018. The decrease in the allowance for loan losses reflected sustained strong credit quality of the portfolio and continued solid economic conditions across our geography and within industry exposures. The strong credit quality performance resulted in nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans of 0.39 percent at March 31, 2019, compared to 0.46 percent at December 31, 2018, and an allowance coverage of 3.3 at March 31, 2019, compared to 2.9 at December 31, 2018.The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain letters of credit in a manner consistent with business loans, and allowances based on the pool of the remaining letters of credit and all unused commitments to extend credit within each internal risk rating. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $30 million at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.For additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses, refer to page F-35 in the "Critical Accounting Policies" section and pages F-51 through F-52 in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation's 2018 Annual Report.Nonperforming AssetsNonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, troubled debt restructured loans (TDRs) which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans) and foreclosed property. TDRs include performing and nonperforming loans. Nonperforming TDRs are either on nonaccrual or reduced-rate status.41Table of ContentsThe following table presents a summary of nonperforming assets and past due loans.(dollar amounts in millions)March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018Nonaccrual loans:   Business loans:   Commercial$114 $141Commercial mortgage16 20Lease financing2 2International3 3Total nonaccrual business loans135 166Retail loans:   Residential mortgage37 36Consumer:   Home equity19 19Total nonaccrual retail loans56 55Total nonaccrual loans191 221Reduced-rate loans7 8Total nonperforming loans198 229Foreclosed property1 1Total nonperforming assets$199 $230Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans0.39% 0.46%Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and foreclosed property0.40 0.46Allowance for loan losses as a multiple of total nonperforming loans3.3x 2.9xLoans past due 90 days or more and still accruing$24 $16Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing as a percentage of total loans0.05% 0.03%Nonperforming assets decreased $31 million, or 13 percent, to $199 million at March 31, 2019, from $230 million at December 31, 2018.

Loans past due 90 days or more increased $8 million to $24 million at March 31, 2019, compared to $16 million at December 31, 2018. Loans past due 30-89 days increased $14 million to $147 million at March 31, 2019, compared to $133 million at December 31, 2018. Past due loans increased slightly from very low year-end levels. An aging analysis of loans included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements provides further information about the balances comprising past due loans.The following table presents a summary of total criticized loans. The Corporation's criticized list is consistent with the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful categories defined by regulatory authorities. Criticized loans with balances of $2 million or more on nonaccrual status or loans with balances of $1 million or more whose terms have been modified in a TDR are individually subjected to quarterly credit quality reviews, and the Corporation may establish specific allowances for such loans. A table of loans by credit quality indicator included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements provides further information about the balances comprising total criticized loans.(dollar amounts in millions)March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018Total criticized loans$1,806 $1,548As a percentage of total loans3.6% 3.1% The $258 million increase in criticized loans in the three months ended March 31, 2019 included increases of $125 million in general Middle Market and $73 million in Corporate Banking.   43Table of ContentsCommercial Real Estate LendingAt March 31, 2019, the Corporation's commercial real estate portfolio represented 24 percent of total loans. The following table summarizes the Corporation's commercial real estate loan portfolio by loan category.(in millions)March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018Real estate construction loans:   Commercial Real Estate business line (a)$2,888 $2,687Other business lines (b)403 390Total real estate construction loans$3,291 $3,077Commercial mortgage loans:   Commercial Real Estate business line (a)$1,739 $1,743Other business lines (b)7,250 7,363Total commercial mortgage loans$8,989 $9,106(a)Primarily loans to real estate developers.(b)Primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate.The Corporation limits risk inherent in its commercial real estate lending activities by monitoring borrowers directly involved in the commercial real estate markets and adhering to conservative policies on loan-to-value ratios for such loans. Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $12.3 billion at March 31, 2019, of which $4.6 billion, or 38 percent, were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to real estate developers, an increase of $97 million compared to December 31, 2018. The remaining $7.7 billion, or 62 percent, of commercial real estate loans in other business lines consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages, which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans.The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-tenured customers with satisfactory completion experience. Credit quality in the real estate construction loan portfolio was strong, with criticized loans of $27 million and $31 million at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, and no real estate construction loan charge-offs in either of the three-month periods ended March 31, 2019 and 2018.Commercial mortgage loans are loans where the primary collateral is a lien on any real property and are primarily loans secured by owner occupied real estate. Real property is generally considered primary collateral if the value of that collateral represents more than 50 percent of the commitment at loan approval. Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Criticized commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $61 million at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. In other business lines, $247 million and $206 million of commercial mortgage loans were criticized at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Commercial mortgage loan net charge-offs were $1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to none for the three months ended March 31, 2018.Residential Real Estate LendingResidential real estate loans, which consist of traditional residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit, totaled $3.7 billion, or 7 percent of total loans, at March 31, 2019. The following table summarizes the Corporation's residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios by geographic market.

Substantially all residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more are placed on nonaccrual status, and substantially all junior lien home equity loans that are current or less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status if full collection of the senior position is in doubt. At no later than 180 days past due, such loans are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell.Residential mortgages totaled $1.9 billion at March 31, 2019, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.9 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $37 million were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2019. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.8 billion at March 31, 2019, of which $1.6 billion was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit, $116 million were in amortizing 44Table of Contentsstatus and $32 million were closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.8 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $19 million were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2019. A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at March 31, 2019. Energy LendingLoans in the Corporation's Energy business line are included almost entirely in commercial loans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Customers in the Corporation's Energy line of business (approximately 160 relationships) are engaged in three segments of the oil and gas business: exploration and production (E&P), midstream and energy services. E&P generally includes such activities as searching for potential oil and gas fields, drilling exploratory wells and operating active wells. Commitments to E&P borrowers are generally subject to semi-annual borrowing base re-determinations based on a variety of factors including updated pricing (reflecting market and competitive conditions), energy reserve levels and the impact of hedging. The midstream sector is generally involved in the transportation, storage and marketing of crude and/or refined oil and gas products. The Corporation's energy services customers provide products and services primarily to the E&P segment.The following table summarizes information about loans in the Corporation's Energy business line.

Total exposure, including unused commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, was $4.8 billion and $4.5 billion at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively.The Corporation's allowance methodology considers the various risk elements within the loan portfolio. When merited, the Corporation may incorporate a qualitative reserve component for Energy loans. Net credit-related charge-offs were $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, compared to no net charge-offs for the same period in 2018.Automotive LendingSubstantially all dealer loans are in the National Dealer Services business line. Loans in the National Dealer Services business line primarily include floor plan financing and other loans to automotive dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in commercial loans, totaled $4.5 billion at March 31, 2019, a decrease of $151 million compared to $4.7 billion at December 31, 2018. At both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $3.4 billion, including $2.0 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Automotive lending also includes loans to borrowers involved with automotive production, primarily Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers. Loans to borrowers involved with automotive production totaled $1.3 billion at both March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.Leveraged LoansCertain loans in the Corporation's commercial portfolio are considered leveraged transactions. These loans are typically used for mergers, acquisitions, business recapitalizations, refinancing and equity buyouts. To help mitigate the risk associated with these loans, the Corporation focuses on middle market companies with highly capable management teams, strong sponsors and solid track records of financial performance. Industries prone to cyclical downturns and acquisitions with a high degree of integration risk are generally avoided. Other considerations include the sufficiency of collateral, the level of balance sheet leverage and the adequacy of financial covenants. During the underwriting process, cash flows are stress tested to evaluate the borrowers' abilities to handle economic downturns and an increase in interest rates.The FDIC defines higher-risk commercial and industrial (HR C&I) loans for assessment purposes as loans generally with leverage of four times total debt to earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation (EBITDA) as well as three times senior debt to EBITDA, excluding certain collateralized loans. HR C&I loans were $2.6 billion and $2.5 billion at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Criticized loans within the HR C&I loan portfolio were $176 million and $147 million at March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. Charge-offs of HR C&I loans totaled $5 million and $11 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.45Table of ContentsFor further discussion of credit risk, see the "Credit Risk" section of pages F-21 through F-29 in the Corporation's 2018 Annual Report.Market and Liquidity RiskMarket risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse movements in market rates or prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. Liquidity risk represents the failure to meet financial obligations coming due resulting from an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding, and the inability to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significant changes in pricing, due to inadequate market depth or market disruptions.The Asset and Liability Policy Committee (ALCO) of the Corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities. ALCO meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies, and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit gathering and risk management. Corporate Treasury mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of ALCO through the actions it takes to manage the Corporation's market, liquidity and capital positions.In addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis, Corporate Treasury also monitors the parent company's liquidity and has established limits for the minimum number of months into the future in which the parent company can meet existing and forecasted obligations without the support of additional dividends from subsidiaries. ALCO's liquidity policy requires the parent company to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet expected capital and debt obligations with a target of 24 months but no less than 18 months.Corporate Treasury and the Enterprise Risk Division support ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk as well as all other market risks. Key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analysis of the Corporation's balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks; (ii) monitoring and reporting of the Corporation's positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines; (iii) developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions; (iv) reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval; and (v) monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks.Interest Rate RiskNet interest income is the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities, primarily through the Corporation's core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by core deposits. The Corporation's loan composition at March 31, 2019 was 67 percent 30-day LIBOR, 9 percent other LIBOR (primarily 60-day), 16 percent prime and 8 percent fixed rate. This creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the floating-rate loan portfolio and more slowly repricing deposit products. In addition, the growth and/or contraction in the Corporation's loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing fixed-rate investment securities, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, as well as hedging with interest rate swaps and options. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.Since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives, a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk. These techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses. Simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors, including, but not limited to, the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, regulatory impacts and management strategies.Sensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest RatesThe analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is management's principal risk management technique. Management models a base case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment. Existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes as of the reporting date are included in the analysis, but no additional hedging is forecasted. At March 31, 2019, these derivative instruments comprise interest rate swaps that convert fixed-rate medium- and long-term debt to variable rates and $800 million of variable-rate loans to fixed rates. This base case net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which rates rise or decline in a linear, non-parallel fashion from the base case over 12 months. The first scenario presents a 200 basis-point increase in short-term rates, resulting in an average increase in short-term interest rates of 100 basis points over the period (+200 scenario). The second scenario presents a 200 basis-point decrease in short-term interest rates.46Table of ContentsEach scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth, investment security prepayment levels, depositor behavior, yield curve changes, loan and deposit pricing, and overall balance sheet mix and growth. In this low rate environment, depositors have maintained a higher level of liquidity and their historical behavior may be less indicative of future trends. As a result, the +200 scenario reflects a greater decrease in deposits than we have experienced historically as rates rise. Changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis.The table below, as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above. Estimated Annual Change March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018(in millions)Amount % Amount %Change in Interest Rates:       Rising 200 basis points$127 5 % $142 6 %Declining 200 basis points(285) (12) (313) (12)Sensitivity to rising and declining rates decreased from December 31, 2018 to March 31, 2019 due to changes in balance sheet composition and the impact of swaps converting variable-rate loans to fixed rates.Sensitivity of Economic Value of Equity to Changes in Interest RatesIn addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income, an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position. The economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the Corporation's financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period, and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements. The Corporation primarily monitors the percentage change on the base case economic value of equity. The economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel 200 basis point shock. The table below, as of March 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above.

Capacity for incremental purchased funds at March 31, 2019 included short-term FHLB advances, the ability to purchase federal funds, sell securities under agreements to repurchase, as well as issue deposits through brokers. Short-term borrowings totaled $944 million at March 31, 2019, compared to $52 million at December 31, 2018. The increase in short-term borrowings reflected temporary increases in federal funds purchased and short-term FHLB advances. At March 31, 2019, the Bank had pledged loans totaling $23.6 billion which provided for up to $19.7 billion of available collateralized borrowing with the FRB.The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Dallas, Texas, which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. At March 31, 2019, $16.3 billion of real estate-related loans were pledged to the FHLB as collateral for current and potential future borrowings. The Corporation had $3.8 billion of outstanding borrowings maturing between 2026 and 2028, $400 million in short-term advances and capacity for potential future borrowings of approximately $4.6 billion.Additionally, as of March 31, 2019 the Bank had the ability to issue up to $14.0 billion of debt under an existing $15.0 billion note program which allows the issuance of debt with maturities between three months and 30 years. The Corporation also maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and/or equity securities.47Table of ContentsThe ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise funds at competitive rates is impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings of the Corporation and the Bank. As of March 31, 2019, the three major rating agencies had assigned the ratings below to long-term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Liquid assets totaled $15.4 billion at March 31, 2019, compared to $16.3 billion at December 31, 2018. Liquid assets include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits with banks, other short-term investments and unencumbered investment securities. The Corporation performs monthly liquidity stress testing to evaluate its ability to meet funding needs in hypothetical stressed environments. Such environments cover a series of broad events, distinguished in terms of duration and severity. The evaluation as of March 31, 2019 projected sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events.48Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe Corporation’s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation's 2018 Annual Report. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation’s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2018, the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to the allowance for credit losses, fair value measurement, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages F-35 through F-37 in the Corporation's 2018 Annual Report. As of the date of this report, there have been no significant changes to the Corporation's critical accounting policies or estimates.49Table of ContentsSUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATAThe Corporation believes non-GAAP measures are meaningful because they reflect adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and our performance trends.
