The increase in net income in the three months ended March 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, reflected decreases of $6 million in the provision for credit losses and $32 million in noninterest expenses, partially offset by decreases of $26 million in net interest income and $6 million in noninterest income and an increase of $2 million in the provision for income taxes. Net income per diluted common share was $0.70 for the three months ended March 31, 2013, compared to $0.66 for the same period one year ago.Full-Year 2013 Outlook Compared to Full-Year 2012For full-year 2013, management expects the following compared to 2012, assuming a continuation of the current slow growing economic environment:•Continued growth in average loans at a slower pace, with economic uncertainty impacting demand and a continued focus on maintaining pricing and structure discipline in a competitive environment.•Lower net interest income, reflecting both a decline of $40 million to $50 million in purchase accounting accretion and the effect of continued low rates. Loan growth should partially offset the impact of low rates on loans and securities.•Provision for credit losses stable, reflecting loan growth offset by a decline in nonperforming loans and net charge-offs.•Customer-driven noninterest income relatively stable, reflecting cross-sell initiatives and selective pricing adjustments partially offset by regulatory pressures on certain products, such as customer derivatives. Outlook does not include expectations for non-customer driven income.•Lower noninterest expense, reflecting further cost savings due to tight expense control and no restructuring expenses.•Effective tax rate of approximately 27.5 percent.Net Interest IncomeNet interest income was $416 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013, a decrease of $26 million compared to $442 million for the same period in 2012. The decrease in net interest income in the three months ended March 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, resulted primarily from a decrease in yields, a $14 million decrease in the accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio and one less day in the first quarter 2013, partially offset by an increase in average earning assets. Average earning assets increased $2.4 billion, or 4 percent, to $58.6 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2013, compared $56.2 billion for the same period in 2012. The increase in average earning assets primarily reflected increases of $2.3 billion in average loans and $132 million in average investment securities available-for-sale. The net interest margin (FTE) for the three months ended March 31, 2013 decreased 31 basis points to 2.88 percent, from 3.19 percent for the comparable period in 2012, primarily from decreased yields on loans and mortgage-backed investment securities and a decrease in accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio, partially offset by lower deposit rates. The decrease in loan yields reflected a shift in the average loan portfolio mix, largely due to an increase in lower-yielding average commercial loans as well as decreases in higher-yielding commercial mortgage and real estate construction loans, lower LIBOR rates and positive credit quality migration throughout the portfolio. Yields on mortgage-backed investment securities decreased as a result of prepayments on higher-yielding securities and new investments in lower-yielding securities impacted by the lower rate environment. Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio increased the net interest margin by 8 basis points in the three months ended March 31, 2013, compared to 18 basis points in the same period in 2012, and excess liquidity reduced the net interest margin by approximately 17 basis points in the three months ended March 31, 2013, compared to 21 basis points in the same period in 2012. Excess liquidity was represented by $3.7 billion and $3.8 billion of average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) in first three months of 2013 and 2012, respectively, included in “interest-bearing deposits with banks” on the consolidated balance sheets. The "Quarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent" table that follows provides an analysis of net interest income (FTE) for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 and details the components of the change in net interest income on a FTE basis for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year.For further discussion of the effects of market rates on net interest income, refer to the "Market and Liquidity Risk" section of this financial review.38Table of ContentsQuarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent (FTE) Three Months Ended March 31, 2013 March 31, 2012(dollar amounts in millions)AverageBalanceInterestAverageRate AverageBalanceInterestAverageRateCommercial loans$28,056$2293.31% $24,736$2193.56%Real estate construction loans1,314134.15 1,453174.58Commercial mortgage loans9,398954.08 10,2021194.73Lease financing85773.23 89783.41International loans1,282113.62 1,205113.76Residential mortgage loans1,556174.39 1,519184.77Consumer loans2,154183.36 2,257203.49Total loans (a)44,6173903.54 42,2694123.92        Auction-rate securities available-for-sale176—0.31 352—0.63Other investment securities available-for-sale9,845532.21 9,537632.73Total investment securities available-for-sale10,021532.17 9,889632.65        Interest-bearing deposits with banks (b)3,85220.27 3,89220.26Other short-term investments11712.30 13511.97Total earning assets58,6074463.09 56,1854783.44        Cash and due from banks979   999  Allowance for loan losses(633)   (737)  Accrued income and other assets4,498   4,898  Total assets$63,451   $61,345          Money market and interest-bearing checking deposits$21,29470.14 $20,795100.19Savings deposits1,623—0.03 1,543—0.08Customer certificates of deposit5,74470.47 5,97880.57Foreign office time deposits52510.55 35810.57Total interest-bearing deposits29,186150.21 28,674190.26Short-term borrowings123—0.11 78—0.11Medium- and long-term debt4,707151.32 4,940161.34Total interest-bearing sources34,016300.36 33,692350.42        Noninterest-bearing deposits21,506   19,637  Accrued expenses and other liabilities973   1,077  Total shareholders’ equity6,956   6,939  Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity$63,451   $61,345          Net interest income/rate spread (FTE) $4162.73  $4433.02        FTE adjustment $—   $1         Impact of net noninterest-bearing sources of funds  0.15   0.17Net interest margin (as a percentage of average earning assets) (FTE) (a) (b)  2.88%   3.19%(a)Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio of $11 million and $25 million increased the net interest margin by 8 basis points and 18 basis points in the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.(b)Excess liquidity, represented by average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank, reduced the net interest margin by 17 basis points and 21 basis points in the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.39Table of ContentsQuarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent (FTE) (continued) Three Months Ended March 31, 2013/March 31, 2012(in millions)Increase(Decrease)Due to RateIncrease(Decrease)Due to Volume (a)NetIncrease(Decrease)Interest Income (FTE):      Loans$(39)(b)$17 $(22)(b)Investment securities available-for-sale(12) 2 (10) Total interest income (FTE)(51) 19 (32)        Interest Expense:      Interest-bearing deposits(4) — (4) Medium- and long-term debt— (1) (1) Total interest expense(4) (1) (5) Net interest income (FTE)$(47) $20 $(27) (a)Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume.(b)Reflected a decrease of $14 million in accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio.Provision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses was $16 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013, compared to $22 million for the same period in 2012. The provision for credit losses includes both the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The provision for loan losses is recorded to maintain the allowance for loan losses at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio. For discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for loan losses, refer to the "Credit Risk" and "Critical Accounting Policies" sections of this financial review. The provision for loan losses was $12 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013, compared to $23 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012. The decrease of $11 million in the provision for loan losses in the three months ended March 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, resulted primarily from continued improvements in credit quality in the loan portfolio, in part reflecting improvements in the U.S. economy. Improvements in credit quality included a decline of $1.1 billion in the Corporation's internal watch list loans from March 31, 2012 to March 31, 2013. Reflected in the decline in watch list loans was a decrease in nonaccrual loans of $336 million. The Corporation's internal watch list is generally consistent with loans in the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful categories defined by regulatory authorities.Net loan charge-offs in the first three months of 2013 decreased $21 million to $24 million, or 0.21 percent of average total loans, compared to $45 million, or 0.43 percent, for the first three months of 2012. The $21 million decrease in net loan charge-offs in the first three months of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, primarily reflected decreases in Commercial Real Estate ($15 million) and Private Banking ($6 million). Net loan charge-offs decreased in all geographic markets in the first three months of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments is recorded to maintain the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments increased $5 million to a provision of $4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2013, compared to a benefit of $1 million for the same period in 2012. The $5 million increase in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments in the three months ended March 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, resulted primarily from an increase in specific reserves in the first quarter 2013 for standby letters of credit, primarily attributable to a single borrower relationship in the Michigan market. Lending-related commitment charge-offs were insignificant for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012.An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets is presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.40Table of ContentsNoninterest Income Three Months Ended March 31,(in millions)2013 2012Customer-driven income:   Service charges on deposit accounts$55 $56Fiduciary income43 38Commercial lending fees21 25Letter of credit fees16 17Card fees12 11Foreign exchange income9 10Brokerage fees5 5Other customer-driven income (a)23 22Total customer-driven noninterest income184 184Noncustomer-driven income:   Bank-owned life insurance9 10Net securities gains— 5Other noncustomer-driven income (a)7 7Total noninterest income$200 $206(a)The table that follows below illustrates further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income.Noninterest income was $200 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013, a decrease of $6 million compared to $206 million for the same period in 2012. Fiduciary income increased $5 million, primarily reflecting an increase in personal trust fees, largely driven by an increase in the volume of fiduciary services sold and increases in market value. Commercial lending fees decreased $4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2013, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in syndication agent fees. Net securities gains decreased $5 million, as first quarter 2012 included net securities gains from the redemption of auction-rate securities.

Salaries expense decreased $13 million, primarily due to a reduction in staffing levels, lower executive incentive compensation and one less day in the three months ended March 31, 2013, partially offset by an increase in business unit incentives and the impact of annual merit increases effective in the second quarter 2012. Employee benefits expense increased $4 million, primarily reflecting increased pension expense. Other real estate expense decreased $3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2013, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in carrying costs, reflecting a lower inventory of other real estate properties. Other noninterest expenses decreased $15 million, primarily reflecting a $10 million decrease in legal and litigation-related expenses, as well as smaller decreases in several other categories of other noninterest expense.Provision for Income TaxesThe provision for income taxes for the first three months of 2013 was $50 million, compared to $48 million for the same period in 2012. The $2 million increase in the provision for income taxes in the first three months of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, was primarily due to an increase in pretax income.Net deferred tax assets were $222 million at March 31, 2013, compared to $254 million at December 31, 2012. The decrease of $32 million resulted primarily from the utilization of tax credits. Deferred tax assets were evaluated for realization and it was determined that no valuation allowance was needed at both March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012. This conclusion was based on available evidence of loss carryback capacity, projected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and assumptions made regarding future events.42Table of ContentsSTRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESSThe Corporation's management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. These methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines.In the first quarter 2013, the Corporation changed the method of assigning the allowance for loan losses to each segment. In 2012, national probability of default and loss given default statistics were incorporated into the Corporation's allowance methodology. Each segment was assigned an allowance for loan losses based on market-specific standard reserve factors applied to the loans in each segment, and the difference between the total allowance required on a national basis and the market-specific allowances was allocated based on the relative loan balances in each segment. Effective first quarter 2013, each segment is assigned an allowance for loan losses by applying national standard reserve factors to the loan balances in each segment by risk rating distribution. For comparability purposes, amounts in all periods are based on segments and methodologies in effect at March 31, 2013. For further information regarding the Corporation's segment methodologies, refer to page F-13 of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report.Business SegmentsThe Corporation's operations are strategically aligned into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based upon the products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, Finance is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes discontinued operations and items not directly associated with these business segments or the Finance segment. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of these business segments for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012.The following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.

Net interest income (FTE) of $375 million increased $2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2013, primarily due to the benefit provided by an increase of $2.5 billion in average loans, an increase in net funds transfer pricing (FTP) credits and lower deposit rates, partially offset by lower loan yields and a $9 million decrease in accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio. The increase in net FTP credits reflected the benefit provided by an increase of $1.5 billion in average deposits. The provision for credit losses increased $18 million, to $20 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to first quarter 2013 enhancements to the approach utilized to determine the allowance for loan losses and loan growth, partially offset by improvements in credit quality and reflecting increases in Middle Market, primarily in Technology and Life Sciences, and Corporate, partially offset by a decrease in Commercial Real Estate. Net credit-related charge-offs of $16 million decreased $12 million in the three months ended March 31, 2013, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2012, primarily reflecting a decrease in Commercial Real Estate. Noninterest income of $77 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 decreased $4 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in commercial lending fees ($4 million). Noninterest expenses of $146 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 decreased $12 million compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to decreases in corporate overhead expense ($7 million) and lower processing costs ($3 million).Net income for the Retail Bank of $10 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 decreased $3 million, compared to $13 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012. Net interest income (FTE) of $155 million decreased $12 million in the three months ended March 31, 2013, primarily due to a $5 million decrease in accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio, lower loan yields and a $186 million decrease in average loans, partially offset by an increase in net FTP credits, primarily due to the benefit provided by an increase of $676 million in average deposits. The provision for credit losses of $6 43Table of Contentsmillion for the three months ended March 31, 2013 was unchanged from the comparable period in the prior year. Net credit-related charge-offs of $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 decreased $4 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2012, primarily reflecting a decrease in Small Business in the California market. Noninterest income of $41 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 decreased $1 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2012. Noninterest expenses of $175 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 decreased $8 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in corporate overhead expense ($4 million) and smaller decreases in several other noninterest expense categories. Wealth Management's net income of $25 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 increased $12 million, compared to $13 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012.

Net credit-related charge-offs were insignificant for the three months ended March 31, 2013, compared to net credit-related charge-offs of $5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2012. Noninterest income of $65 million was unchanged from the comparable period in the prior year, as increases in fiduciary income ($3 million) and smaller increases in several noninterest income categories were offset by a decrease in net securities gains ($5 million). Noninterest expenses of $79 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 decreased $1 million from the three months ended March 31, 2012. The net loss in the Finance segment was $98 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013, compared to a net loss of $88 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012. Net interest expense (FTE) of $167 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 increased $15 million, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2012, primarily reflecting a $10 million decrease in interest earned on mortgage-backed investment securities. Noninterest income of $14 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 increased $1 million compared to the three months ended March 31, 2012. Noninterest expenses of $3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 were unchanged from the comparable period in the prior year.The net loss in the Other category of $1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 decreased $10 million, compared to a net loss of $11 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012. The decrease in net loss primarily reflected an $11 million decrease in noninterest expenses, primarily due to an $8 million decrease in litigation-related expenses. Market SegmentsMarket segment results are provided for the Corporation's three largest geographic markets: Michigan, California and Texas. In addition to the three largest geographic markets, Other Markets is also reported as a market segment. The Finance & Other category includes the Finance segment and the Other category as previously described in the "Business Segments" section of this financial review. The table and narrative below present the market results based on the structure and methodologies in effect at March 31, 2013. Note 13 to these consolidated financial statements presents a description of each of these market segments as well as the financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012.

Noninterest expenses of $91 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 decreased $2 million from the three months ended March 31, 2012, primarily reflecting a decrease in corporate overhead expense ($2 million).Net income in Other Markets of $56 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 increased $10 million compared to $46 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012. Net interest income (FTE) of $81 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 increased $5 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in net FTP credits, primarily the result of the benefits provided by increases of $1.0 billion in average deposits and $305 million in average loans. The provision for credit losses decreased $2 million in the three months ended March 31, 2013, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to improvements in credit quality. Net credit-related charge-offs of $3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 decreased $6 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting decreases in Commercial Real Estate and Private Banking, partially offset by an increase in Environmental Services. Noninterest income of $25 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 decreased $1 million from the comparable period in the prior year, reflecting a decrease in net securities gains ($5 million), as first quarter 2012 included net securities gains from the redemption of auction-rate securities were partially offset by small increases in several other noninterest income categories. Noninterest expenses of $44 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 decreased $6 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to decreases in corporate overhead expense ($2 million) and smaller decreases in several other noninterest expense categories.The net loss for the Finance & Other category of $99 million in the three months ended March 31, 2013 was unchanged compared to the three months ended March 31, 2012.

The $594 million increase in average commercial loans primarily reflected an increase in Middle Market ($799 million), partially offset by a decrease in Mortgage Banker Finance ($357 million). The decline in Mortgage Banker Finance, which provides mortgage warehousing lines, reflected a decline in refinancing activity. The increase in Middle Market primarily reflected increases in general Middle Market ($298 million), National Dealer Services ($236 million), Energy ($153 million), and Technology and Life Sciences ($112 million). In general, Middle Market serves customers with annual revenue between $20 million and $500 million; while Corporate serves customers with revenue over $500 million, and Small Business serves customers with revenue under $20 million. Changes in average total loans by geographic market is provided in the table above. Total liabilities decreased $230 million to $57.9 billion at March 31, 2013, compared to $58.1 billion  at December 31, 2012, primarily due to decreases of $502 million in noninterest-bearing deposits and $83 million in accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by a $428 million increase in interest-bearing deposits. On an average basis, total liabilities decreased 47Table of Contents$700 million in the first quarter 2013 compared to the fourth quarter 2012, primarily due to a decrease of $1.3 billion in average noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by an increase of $662 million in average interest-bearing deposits. The decrease in average noninterest-bearing deposits primarily reflected a decrease in Middle Market ($1.0 billion), largely due to a decline in the Financial Services Division in general Middle Market, which provides services to title and escrow companies. The increase in average interest-bearing deposits primarily reflected increases of $534 million in money market and interest-bearing checking deposits and $110 million in customer certificates of deposit. By geographic market, the decrease in average total deposits of $590 million from the fourth quarter 2012 to the first quarter 2013 primarily reflected a decrease in the California market ($1.1 billion), partially offset by increases in the Michigan market ($237 million), Other Markets ($202 million) and the Texas market ($150 million). The decrease in the California market primarily reflected decreases in the Financial Services Division, Private Banking and Technology and Life Sciences, partially offset by an increase in Corporate.CapitalTotal shareholders' equity increased $46 million to $7.0 billion at March 31, 2013, compared to December 31, 2012.

The capital plan includes up to $288 million of equity repurchases for the four-quarter period ending March 31, 2014. In January 2013, the Corporation declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.17 per share, an increase of 13 percent from the fourth quarter 2012 quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. The January 2013 dividend increase was contemplated in the Corporation's 2012 capital plan.On November 16, 2010, the Board of Directors of the Corporation authorized the repurchase of up to 12.6 million shares of Comerica Incorporated outstanding common stock and authorized the purchase of up to all 11.5 million of the Corporation's original outstanding warrants. On April 24, 2012 and April 23, 2013, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 5.7 million shares and up to an additional 10.0 million shares of Comerica Incorporated outstanding common stock, respectively. There is no expiration date for the Corporation's share repurchase program.

Assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with specified risk-weighting factors. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items. As shown in the table below, the Corporation's capital ratios increased from December 31, 2012 to March 31, 2013.48Table of ContentsThe Corporation's capital ratios exceeded minimum regulatory requirements as follows: March 31, 2013 December 31, 2012(dollar amounts in millions)Capital Ratio Capital RatioTier 1 common (a) (b)$6,748 10.40% $6,705 10.17%Tier 1 risk-based (4.00% - minimum) (b)6,748 10.40 6,705 10.17Total risk-based (8.00% - minimum) (b)8,730 13.45 8,695 13.18Leverage (3.00% - minimum) (b)6,748 10.76 6,705 10.57Tangible common equity (a)6,332 9.86 6,285 9.76(a)See Supplemental Financial Data section for reconcilements of non-GAAP financial measures.(b)March 31, 2013 capital and ratios are estimated.In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee) issued a framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation (Basel III). In June 2012, U.S. banking regulators issued proposed rules for the U.S. adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework. The proposed regulatory framework includes a more conservative definition of capital, two new capital buffers - a conservation buffer and a countercyclical buffer, new and more stringent risk weight categories for assets and off-balance sheet items, and a supplemental leverage ratio. Under the proposal, rules are expected to be implemented between 2013 and 2019.According to the proposed rules, the Corporation will be subject to the capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses. However, the rules as proposed would not subject the Corporation to the capital countercyclical buffer of up to 2.5 percent or the supplemental leverage ratio. The Corporation currently estimates that its March 31, 2013 capital ratios would be in compliance with the fully phased-in Basel III capital rules as proposed. Under the proposed rules, the Corporation estimates the March 31, 2013 Tier 1 and Tier 1 common risk-based ratio would be 9.4 percent if calculated under the proposed rules. For a reconcilement of this non-GAAP financial measure, refer to the "Supplemental Financial Data" section of this financial review.The Basel III liquidity framework, which was revised by the Basel Committee in January 2013, includes two minimum liquidity measures. Rules are expected to be implemented between 2015 and 2019. Adoption in the U.S. is expected to occur over a similar timeframe, but the final form of the U.S. rules is not yet known. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) requires a financial institution to hold a buffer of high-quality, liquid assets to fully cover net cash outflows under a 30-day systematic liquidity stress scenario. The revisions announced by the Basel Committee in January 2013 eased several requirements related to the LCR, including certain outflow assumptions. The Net Stable Funding Ratio requires the amount of available longer-term, stable sources of funding to be at least 100 percent of the required amount of longer-term stable funding over a one-year period. The Corporation's liquidity position is strong, but if subject to the Basel III liquidity framework as currently proposed, the Corporation may decide to consider additional liquidity management initiatives. While uncertainty exists in the final form and timing of the U.S. rules implementing the Basel III liquidity framework and whether or not the Corporation will be subject to the full requirements, the Corporation is closely monitoring the development of the rules. We expect to meet the final requirements adopted by U.S. banking regulators within regulatory timelines.49Table of ContentsRISK MANAGMENTThe following updated information should be read in conjunction with the "Risk Management" section on pages F-23 through F-41 in the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report.Credit RiskAllowance for Credit LossesThe allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The allowance for loan losses represents management's assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporation's loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in "accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets, provides for probable losses inherent in lending-related commitments, including unused commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.The Corporation disaggregates the loan portfolio into segments for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses. These segments are based on the level at which the Corporation develops, documents and applies a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The Corporation's portfolio segments are business loans and retail loans. Business loans are defined as those belonging to the commercial, real estate construction, commercial mortgage, lease financing and international loan portfolios. Retail loans consist of traditional residential mortgage, home equity and other consumer loans.The allowance for loan losses includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain loans, and allowances for homogeneous pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. In the first quarter 2013, the Corporation implemented enhancements to the approach utilized for determining standard reserve factors for business loans not individually evaluated by changing from a dollar-based migration method for developing probability of default statistics to a count-based method. Under the dollar-based method, each dollar that moved to default received equal weight in the determination of standard reserve factors for each internal risk rating. As a result, the movement of larger loans impacted standard reserve factors more than the movement of smaller loans. By moving to a count-based approach, where each loan that moves to default receives equal weighting, unusually large or small loans will not have a disproportionate influence on the standard reserve factors. The change resulted in a $40 million increase to the allowance for loan losses at March 31, 2013. At the start of 2013, the U.S. economy was still being influenced by a mix of forces that together, were providing some forward momentum, but were not allowing the economy to grow at its full potential. Monetary policy over the previous quarter was highly accommodative as the Federal Reserve ended its program of reconfiguring its balance sheet, known as"Operation Twist," in December 2012 and launched a new program of outright bond purchases known as "QE3." The fed funds rate has remained exceptionally low, near-zero, and is now linked to a 6.5 percent threshold for the unemployment rate. That threshold is not expected to be reached until late 2014 through mid-2015. Federal fiscal policy tightened at the start of 2013 as federal payroll taxes increased for all workers and income, dividend and capital gains taxes increased for the wealthiest households. The expected combination of tax increases and spending cuts, known as "the Fiscal Cliff," impaired business confidence in late 2012 and early 2013. Fiscal tightening continued through early 2013 as the federal budget sequester enforced cutbacks in defense and non-defense discretionary spending, beginning March 1, 2013. Within the context of expansive monetary policy, repressive fiscal policy and subdued global growth, the domestic U.S. economy began to show more signs of improving over the course of 2012. Residential real estate markets firmed nationwide as residential construction increased and housing prices showed consistent year-over-year price gains. Auto sales improved through the year. Momentum in housing and auto sales is expected to continue through 2013. Commercial real estate markets are expected to show more signs of firming up. Oil drilling activity is expected to remain strong through 2013. Natural gas prices firmed in early 2013 though natural gas drilling activity is expected to remain cooler in 2013 than in recent years. Real Gross Domestic Product growth for the U.S. is expected to average a moderate 2.2 percent over the course of 2013, matching the moderate pace for 2012. The Texas economy will continue to be a job growth leader over 2013. Michigan is expected to benefit from moderate gains in auto sales over the course of 2013, and from firmer commercial and residential real estate conditions. California will feel the broad positive effects of improved real estate markets in the year ahead. High technology industries in Northern California are expected to continue to drive growth for the state.The allowance for loan losses was $617 million at March 31, 2013, compared to $629 million at December 31, 2012, a decrease of $12 million, or 2 percent. The decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in specific reserves required on collateral-dependent impaired loans, the elimination of certain incremental industry reserves and decreases in loan balances, partially offset by an increase in the allowance for loan losses resulting from the enhancements to the approach utilized for determining standard reserve factors described above. The $12 million decrease in the allowance for loan losses primarily reflected decreased reserves in Commercial Real Estate, general Middle Market, Private Banking and Mortgage Banker Finance, partially offset by increased reserves in Technology and Life Sciences. By market, reserves decreased in Michigan, Other Markets and Texas and increased in California, primarily due to increased reserves in Technology and Life Sciences.Acquired loans were initially recorded at fair value, which included an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans, and therefore no corresponding allowance for loan losses was recorded for these loans at 50Table of Contentsacquisition. Methods utilized to estimate the required allowance for loan losses for acquired loans not deemed credit-impaired at acquisition are similar to originated loans; however, the estimate of loss is based on the unpaid principal balance less the remaining purchase discount, either on an individually evaluated basis or based on the pool of acquired loans not deemed credit-impaired at acquisition within each risk rating, as applicable. At March 31, 2013, there was no allowance for loan losses on acquired loans, and $34 million of purchase discount remained, compared to a $3 million allowance for loan losses and $41 million of remaining purchase discount at December 31, 2012.The total allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb incurred losses inherent in the total loan portfolio. Unanticipated economic events, including political, economic and regulatory instability could cause changes in the credit characteristics of the portfolio and result in an unanticipated increase in the allowance. Inclusion of other industry-specific portfolio exposures in the allowance, as well as significant increases in the current portfolio exposures, could also increase the amount of the allowance. Any of these events, or some combination thereof, may result in the need for additional provision for loan losses in order to maintain an allowance that complies with credit risk and accounting policies. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain letters of credit in a manner consistent with business loans, and allowances based on the pool of the remaining letters of credit and all unused commitments to extend credit within each internal risk rating.The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $36 million at March 31, 2013, an increase of $4 million from $32 million at December 31, 2012. The $4 million increase in the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments resulted primarily from an increase in specific reserves in the first quarter 2013 for standby letters of credit, primarily attributable to a single borrower relationship in the Michigan market. An allowance for credit losses will be recorded on acquired lending-related commitments only to the extent that the required allowance exceeds the remaining purchase discount. The purchase discount remaining for acquired lending-related commitments was $2 million at both March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012. No allowance was recorded on acquired lending-related commitments at March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012. For additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses, refer to the "Critical Accounting Policies" section of this financial review and Notes 1 and 4 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements.Nonperforming AssetsNonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, troubled debt restructured loans (TDRs) which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans) and foreclosed property. TDRs include performing and nonperforming loans. Nonperforming TDRs are either on nonaccrual or reduced-rate status. Nonperforming assets do not include purchased credit impaired (PCI) loans.51Table of ContentsSUMMARY OF NONPERFORMING ASSETS AND PAST DUE LOANS(dollar amounts in millions)March 31, 2013 December 31, 2012Nonaccrual loans:   Business loans:   Commercial$102 $103Real estate construction:   Commercial Real Estate business line (a)30 30Other business lines (b)3 3Total real estate construction33 33Commercial mortgage:   Commercial Real Estate business line (a)86 94Other business lines (b)178 181Total commercial mortgage264 275Lease financing— 3Total nonaccrual business loans399 414Retail loans:   Residential mortgage65 70Consumer:   Home equity28 31Other consumer2 4Total consumer30 35Total nonaccrual retail loans95 105Total nonaccrual loans494 519Reduced-rate loans21 22Total nonperforming loans515 541Foreclosed property40 54Total nonperforming assets$555 $595Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans1.14% 1.17%Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and foreclosed property1.23 1.29Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total nonperforming loans120 116Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing$25 $23Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing as a percentage of total loans0.05% 0.05%(a)Primarily loans to real estate investors and developers.(b)Primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate.Nonperforming assets decreased $40 million to $555 million at March 31, 2013, from $595 million at December 31, 2012.

Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $10.7 billion at March 31, 2013, of which $3.0 billion, or 28 percent, were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to real estate investors and developers. The remaining $7.7 billion, or 72 percent, of commercial real estate loans in other business lines consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans. 55Table of ContentsThe real estate construction loan portfolio totaled $1.4 billion at March 31, 2013. The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-time customers with satisfactory completion experience. Of the $1.2 billion of real estate construction loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line, $30 million were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2013. In other business lines, $3 million of real estate construction loans were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2013. There were net residential construction loan recoveries of $1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013.The commercial mortgage loan portfolio totaled $9.3 billion at March 31, 2013 and included $1.8 billion in the Commercial Real Estate business line and $7.5 billion in other business lines. Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Of the $1.8 billion of commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line, $86 million were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2013. Commercial mortgage loan net charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line were insignificant for the three months ended March 31, 2013. In other business lines, $178 million of commercial mortgage loans were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2013, and net charge-offs were $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013. The geographic distribution and project type of commercial real estate loans are important factors in diversifying credit risk within the portfolio.

Residential mortgages totaled $1.6 billion at March 31, 2013, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.6 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $65 million were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2013. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.5 billion at March 31, 2013, of which $1.4 billion was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit and $135 million were closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.5 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $28 million were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2013. A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at March 31, 2013. The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation's primary geographic markets. The economic recession and significant declines in home values following the financial market turmoil beginning in the fall of 2008 adversely impacted the residential real estate portfolio. As of March 31, 2013, substantially all residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more were placed on nonaccrual status, and substantially all junior lien home equity loans that were current or less than 90 days past due were placed on nonaccrual status if full collection of the senior position was in doubt. Such loans are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell no later than 180 days past due.Shared National CreditsShared National Credit (SNC) loans are facilities greater than $20 million shared by three or more federally supervised financial institutions that are reviewed annually by regulatory authorities at the agent bank level. The Corporation generally seeks to obtain ancillary business at the origination of a SNC relationship. Loans classified as SNC loans (876 borrowers at March 31, 2013) were $9.4 billion at both March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012. SNC net loan charge-offs totaled $3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to $14 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012. Nonaccrual SNC loans increased $10 million to $34 million at March 31, 2013, compared to $24 million at December 31, 2012. SNC loans, diversified by both business line and geographic market, comprised approximately 21 percent and 20 percent of total loans at March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. SNC loans are held to the same credit underwriting and pricing standards as the remainder of the loan portfolio. Energy LendingThe Corporation has a portfolio of energy-related loans that are included primarily in "commercial loans" in the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation has over 30 years of experience in energy lending, with a focus on middle market companies. Average loans in the Middle Market - Energy business line for the three months ended March 31, 2013 were $3.0 billion, or approximately 7 percent of total average loans, compared to $2.9 billion, or approximately 6 percent of total average loans, for the three months ended December 31, 2012. Nonaccrual Middle Market - Energy loans totaled $1 million and $3 million at March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. Middle Market - Energy net loan charge-offs totaled $2 million for both the three-month periods ended March 31, 2013 and 2012. Energy loans are diverse in nature, with outstanding balances by customer market segment distributed approximately as follows at March 31, 2013: 67 percent exploration and production (comprised of approximately 50 percent oil, 31 percent mixed and 19 percent natural gas), 19 percent midstream and 14 percent energy services.Automotive LendingSubstantially all dealer loans are in the National Dealer Services business line. Loans in the National Dealer Services business line include floor plan financing and other loans to automotive dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in “commercial loans” in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $3.0 billion at March 31, 2013, an increase of $24 million compared to $2.9 billion at December 31, 2012. At March 31, 2013, other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $2.0 billion, including $1.5 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans, compared to $2.2 billion of other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Service line, including $1.5 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans, at December 31, 2012 . Automotive lending also includes loans to borrowers involved with automotive production, primarily Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers. Loans to borrowers involved with automotive production totaled approximately $1.3 billion at March 31, 2013, compared to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2012.57Table of ContentsState and Local MunicipalitiesIn the normal course of business, the Corporation serves the needs of state and local municipalities in multiple capacities, including traditional banking products such as deposit services, loans and letters of credit, investment banking services such as bond underwriting and private placements, and by investing in municipal securities.The following table summarizes the Corporation's direct exposure to state and local municipalities as of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012.(in millions)March 31, 2013 December 31, 2012Loans outstanding$42 $53Lease financing358 359Investment securities available-for-sale23 23Trading account securities7 19Standby letters of credit108 108Unused commitments to extend credit37 24Total direct exposure to state and local municipalities$575 $586Indirect exposure comprised $125 million in auction-rate preferred securities collateralized by municipal securities at March 31, 2013, compared to $127 million at December 31, 2012. Additionally, the Corporation is exposed to Automated Clearing House (ACH) transaction risk for those municipalities utilizing this electronic payment and/or deposit method and similar products in their cash flow management. The Corporation sets limits on ACH activity during the underwriting process.Extensions of credit to state and local municipalities are subjected to the same underwriting standards as other business loans. At March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, all outstanding municipal loans and leases were performing according to contractual terms, and one municipal lease was included in the Corporation's internal watch list. Municipal leases are secured by the underlying equipment, and a substantial majority of the leases are fully defeased with AAA-rated U.S. government securities. Substantially all municipal investment securities available-for sale are auction-rate securities. All auction-rate securities are reviewed quarterly for other-than-temporary impairment. All auction-rate municipal securities were rated investment grade, and all auction-rate preferred securities collateralized by municipal securities were rated investment grade and were adequately collateralized at both March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012. Municipal securities are held in the trading account for resale to customers. In addition, Comerica Securities, a broker-dealer subsidiary of Comerica Bank, underwrites bonds issued by municipalities. All bonds underwritten by Comerica Securities are sold to third party investors. International ExposureInternational assets are subject to general risks inherent in the conduct of business in foreign countries, including economic uncertainties and each foreign government's regulations. Risk management practices minimize the risk inherent in international lending arrangements. These practices include structuring bilateral agreements or participating in bank facilities, which secure repayment from sources external to the borrower's country. Accordingly, such international outstandings are excluded from the cross-border risk of that country. 58Table of ContentsThe Corporation does not hold any sovereign exposure to Europe. The Corporation's international strategy as it pertains to Europe is to focus on European companies doing business in North America, with an emphasis on the Corporation's primary geographic markets. The following table summarizes cross-border exposure to entities domiciled in European countries at March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012.

Liquidity risk represents the failure to meet financial obligations coming due resulting from an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding, and the inability to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significant changes in pricing, due to inadequate market depth or market disruptions.The Asset and Liability Policy Committee (ALCO) of the Corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities. ALCO meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies, and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit gathering and risk management. The Corporation's Treasury Department supports ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate, liquidity and coordination of all other market risks. The area's key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analysis of the Corporation's balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate, liquidity and all other market risks; (ii) monitoring and reporting of the Corporation's positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines; (iii) development and presentation of analysis and strategies to adjust risk positions; (iv) review and presentation of policies and authorizations for approval; (v) monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate, liquidity and all other market 59Table of Contentsrisks; (vi) developing and monitoring the interest rate risk economic capital estimate; and (vii) monitoring of capital adequacy in accordance with the Capital Management Policy.Interest Rate RiskNet interest income is the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises primarily through the Corporation's core business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by a combination of core deposits and wholesale borrowings. Approximately 85 percent of the Corporation's loans were floating at March 31, 2013, of which approximately 75 percent were based on LIBOR and 25 percent were based on Prime. This creates a natural imbalance between the floating-rate loan portfolio and the more slowly repricing deposit products. The result is that growth and/or contraction in the Corporation's core businesses may lead to sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing investment securities, primarily fixed-rate, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, and hedging the sensitivity with interest rate swaps. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk, with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.The Corporation frequently evaluates net interest income under various balance sheet and interest rate scenarios, looking at a 12-month time horizon, using simulation modeling analysis as its principal risk management evaluation technique. The results of this analysis provides the information needed to assess the balance sheet structure. Changes in economic activity, whether domestic or international, different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis could translate into a materially different interest rate environment than currently expected. Management evaluates a base case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment and what is believed to be the most likely balance sheet structure. This base case net interest income is then evaluated against non-parallel interest rate scenarios that increase and decrease 200 basis points in a linear fashion from the base case over 12 months, resulting in an average change in interest rates of 100 basis points over the period. Due to the current low level of interest rates, the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of a 25 basis point drop, to zero percent. In addition, consistent with each interest rate scenario, adjustments are made to assumptions regarding asset prepayment levels, yield curves, and overall balance sheet mix and growth. The impact of these assumptions on the balance sheet is based on historical experience. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model may not precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions and management strategies, among other factors. However, the model can indicate the likely direction of change. Existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes are included in the analysis, but no additional hedging is forecasted.The table below, as of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above. The sensitivity from December 31, 2012 to March 31, 2013 increased primarily due to higher forecasted core deposits, though risk to declining interest rates is limited by the current low level of rates.Sensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest Rates March 31, 2013 December 31, 2012(in millions)Amount % Amount %Change in Interest Rates:       +200 basis points$181 11 % $178 11 %-25 basis points (to zero percent)(24) (1) (23) (1)Corporate policy limits adverse change to no more than four percent of management's base case net interest income forecast, and the Corporation was within this policy guideline at March 31, 2013. Interest rate risk is actively managed principally through the use of either on-balance sheet financial instruments or interest rate derivatives to achieve the desired risk profile.In addition to the simulation analysis, an economic value of equity analysis is performed for a longer term view of the interest rate risk position. The economic value of equity analysis begins with an estimate of the economic value of the financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments on the Corporation's balance sheet, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period. Next, the estimated impact of rate movements is applied to the economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments. The economic value of equity is then calculated as the difference between the estimated market value of assets and liabilities net of the impact of off-balance sheet instruments. As with net interest income simulation analysis, a variety of alternative scenarios are performed to measure the impact on economic value of equity, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve.60Table of ContentsThe table below, as of March 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from a 200 basis point immediate parallel increase or decrease in interest rates. Similar to the simulation analysis above, due to the current low level of interest rates, the economic value of equity analyses below reflect an interest rate scenario of an immediate 25 basis point drop, to zero percent, while the rising interest rate scenario reflects an immediate 200 basis point rise. The change in the sensitivity of the economic value of equity to a 200 basis point parallel increase in rates between December 31, 2012 and March 31, 2013 was primarily driven by changes in market interest rates, a decrease in period-end noninterest-bearing deposits, and forecasted prepayments on the Corporation's mortgage-backed securities portfolio.

Capacity for incremental purchased funds at March 31, 2013 included the ability to purchase federal funds, sell securities under agreements to repurchase, as well as issue deposits to institutional investors and issue certificates of deposit through brokers. Purchased funds totaled $453 million at March 31, 2013, compared to $612 million at December 31, 2012.Comerica Bank (the Bank), a subsidiary of the Corporation, is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, Texas (FHLB), which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. At March 31, 2013, $14 billion of real estate-related loans were pledged to the FHLB as blanket collateral for current and potential future borrowings. As of March 31, 2013, the Corporation had $2.0 billion of outstanding borrowings from the FHLB with maturities ranging from May 2013 to May 2014. Additionally, the Bank had the ability to issue up to $15.0 billion of debt at March 31, 2013 under an existing $15 billion medium-term senior note program which allows the issuance of debt with maturities between three months and 30 years. The Corporation also maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and/or equity securities.The ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise funds at competitive rates is impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings of the Corporation and the Bank. As of March 31, 2013, the four major rating agencies had assigned the following ratings to long-term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Liquid assets, which totaled $13.0 billion at March 31, 2013, compared to $12.1 billion at December 31, 2012, provide a reservoir of liquidity. Liquid assets include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits with banks, other short-term investments and unencumbered investment securities available-for-sale. At March 31, 2013, the Corporation held excess liquidity, represented by $4.6 billion deposited with the FRB, compared to $2.9 billion at December 31, 2012.61Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe Corporation’s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation’s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2012, the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to the allowance for credit losses, valuation methodologies, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages F-42 through F-47 in the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report. As of the date of this report, there have been no significant changes to the Corporation's critical accounting policies, except as discussed below.Allowance for Credit LossesThe allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments.The allowance for loan losses represents management’s assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporation’s loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain loans, and allowances for homogeneous pools of loans with similar risk characteristics.The allowance for business loans which do not meet the criteria to be evaluated individually is determined by applying standard reserve factors to the pool of business loans within each internal risk rating. In the first quarter 2013, the Corporation enhanced the approach utilized for determining standard reserve factors by changing from a dollar-based migration method for developing probability of default statistics to a count-based method. Under the dollar-based method, each dollar that moved to default received equal weight in the determination of standard reserve factors for each internal risk rating. Under the count-based approach, each loan that moves to default receives equal weighting. The change resulted in a $40 million increase to the allowance for loan losses at March 31, 2013.For further discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses, refer to the “Allowance for Credit Losses” section in this financial review and Note 1 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.62Table of ContentsSUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATAThe following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this financial review with financial measures defined by GAAP.(dollar amounts in millions)March 31, 2013 December 31, 2012Tier 1 Common Capital Ratio:   Tier 1 capital (a) (b)$6,748 $6,705Less:   Trust preferred securities— —Tier 1 common capital (b)$6,748 $6,705Risk-weighted assets (a) (b)$64,895 $65,954Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio (b)10.40% 10.17%Tier 1 common capital ratio (b)10.40 10.17Basel III Tier 1 and Tier 1 Common Capital Ratio:   Tier 1 and Tier 1 common capital (b)$6,748  Basel III proposed adjustments (c)(410)  Basel III Tier 1 and Tier 1 common capital (c)$6,338  Risk-weighted assets (a) (b)$64,895  Basel III proposed adjustments (c)2,609  Basel III risk-weighted assets (c)$67,504  Tier 1 and Tier 1 common capital ratio (b)10.4%  Basel III Tier 1 and Tier 1 common capital ratio (c)9.4%  Tangible Common Equity Ratio:   Common shareholders' equity$6,988 $6,942Less:   Goodwill635 635Other intangible assets21 22Tangible common equity$6,332 $6,285Total assets$64,885 $65,069Less:   Goodwill635 635Other intangible assets21 22Tangible assets$64,229 $64,412Common equity ratio10.77% 10.67%Tangible common equity ratio9.86 9.76Tangible Common Equity per Share of Common Stock:   Common shareholders' equity$6,988 $6,942Tangible common equity6,332 6,285Shares of common stock outstanding (in millions)187 188Common shareholders' equity per share of common stock$37.38 $36.87Tangible common equity per share of common stock33.87 33.38(a)Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as defined by regulation.(b)March 31, 2013 Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted-assets are estimated.(c)March 31, 2013 Basel III Tier 1 common capital and risk-weighted assets are estimated based on the proposed rules for the U.S. adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework issued in June 2012, as fully phased in on January 1, 2019.The Tier 1 common capital ratio removes qualifying trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations. The Basel III Tier 1 common capital ratio further adjusts Tier 1 common capital and risk-weighted assets to account for the rules proposed by U.S. banking regulators in June 2012 for the U.S. adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework. The tangible common equity ratio removes preferred stock and the effect of intangible assets from capital and the effect of intangible assets from total assets and tangible common equity per share of common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders' equity per share of common stock. The Corporation believes these measurements are meaningful measures of capital adequacy used by investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and to compare against other companies in the industry.63Table of ContentsITEM 3.
