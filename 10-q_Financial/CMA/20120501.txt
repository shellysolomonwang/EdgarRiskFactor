The increase in net income in the first quarter 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, was primarily due to a $48 million increase in net interest income and a $26 million decrease in the provision for loan losses, partially offset by a $23 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense. Net income per diluted common share was $0.66 in the first quarter 2012, compared to $0.57 for the same period one year ago. Results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2012 include the impact of operations of the former Sterling Bancshares, Inc. (Sterling), acquired by the Corporation on July 28, 2011.Full-year 2012 OutlookFor full-year 2012, management expects the following, compared to full-year 2011, assuming a continuation of the current economic environment. For purposes of this outlook, management defines "moderate" as two percent to five percent.•Average loans increasing moderately. •Net interest income increasing moderately. •Net credit-related charge-offs and provision for credit losses declining.•Noninterest income relatively stable. •Noninterest expenses relatively stable.•Effective tax rate of approximately 27 percent.Net Interest IncomeNet interest income was $443 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012, an increase of $48 million compared to $395 million for the same period in 2011. The increase in net interest income in the first quarter 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, resulted primarily from an increase in average earning assets, accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio, one additional day in first quarter 2012, lower deposit rates and the continued shift in funding sources toward lower-cost funds, partially offset by decreased yields on loans and mortgage-backed investment securities. The lower loan yields reflected a shift in the average loan portfolio mix, largely due to a decrease in average commercial real estate loans and an increase in average commercial loans. The "Quarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent" table of this financial review details the components of the change in net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis for the three months ended March 31, 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year. Average earning assets increased $6.8 billion, or 14 percent, to $56.2 billion in the first quarter 2012, compared to $49.3 billion in the first quarter 2011, primarily due to the acquisition of Sterling and reflecting increases of $2.7 billion in average loans, $2.6 billion in average investment securities available-for-sale and $1.5 billion in average interest-bearing deposits with banks. The net interest margin (FTE) for the three months ended March 31, 2012 decreased 6 basis points to 3.19 percent, from 3.25 percent for the comparable period in 2011, primarily from decreased yields on loans and mortgage-backed investment securities and the impact of higher excess liquidity levels from deposit growth, partially offset by the benefit from accretion of the purchase discount on the Sterling acquired loan portfolio and lower deposit costs. Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio of $25 million increased the net interest margin by 18 basis points in the first quarter 2012, and excess liquidity reduced the net interest margin by approximately 21 basis points and 14 basis points in the first quarters of 2012 and 2011, respectively. At March 31, 2012, $76 million of purchase discounts remained on acquired loans not deemed credit impaired at acquisition. Excess liquidity was represented by $3.8 billion and $2.3 billion of average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) in the first quarters of 2012 and 2011, respectively, included in “interest-bearing deposits with banks” on the consolidated balance sheets. For further discussion of the effects of market rates on net interest income, refer to the "Market Risk" section of this financial review.41Table of ContentsQuarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent (FTE) Three Months Ended March 31, 2012 March 31, 2011(dollar amounts in millions)AverageBalance Interest AverageRate AverageBalance Interest AverageRateCommercial loans$24,736 $219 3.56% $21,496 $201 3.76%Real estate construction loans1,453 17 4.58 2,179 19 3.51Commercial mortgage loans10,202 119 4.73 9,790 95 3.95Lease financing897 8 3.41 987 9 3.62International loans1,205 11 3.76 1,219 12 3.87Residential mortgage loans1,519 18 4.77 1,599 21 5.24Consumer loans2,257 20 3.49 2,281 19 3.42Total loans (a)42,269 412 3.92 39,551 376 3.85            Auction-rate securities available-for-sale352 1 0.63 554 1 0.88Other investment securities available-for-sale9,537 63 2.73 6,757 56 3.37Total investment securities available-for-sale9,889 64 2.65 7,311 57 3.17            Federal funds sold9 — 0.29 3 — 0.32Interest-bearing deposits with banks (b)3,884 2 0.26 2,354 1 0.26Other short-term investments135 1 1.97 128 1 2.68Total earning assets56,186 479 3.44 49,347 435 3.57            Cash and due from banks999     884    Allowance for loan losses(737)     (908)    Accrued income and other assets5,165     4,452    Total assets$61,613     $53,775                Money market and NOW deposits$20,795 10 0.19 $17,797 12 0.26Savings deposits1,543 — 0.08 1,421 — 0.09Customer certificates of deposit5,978 8 0.57 5,509 10 0.76Foreign office time deposits358 1 0.57 412 — 0.49Total interest-bearing deposits28,674 19 0.26 25,139 22 0.37            Short-term borrowings78 — 0.11 94 — 0.31Medium- and long-term debt4,940 16 1.34 6,128 17 1.10Total interest-bearing sources33,692 35 0.42 31,361 39 0.51            Noninterest-bearing deposits19,637     15,459    Accrued expenses and other liabilities1,345     1,120    Total shareholders’ equity6,939     5,835    Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity$61,613     $53,775                Net interest income/rate spread (FTE)  $444 3.02   $396 3.06            FTE adjustment  $1     $1              Impact of net noninterest-bearing sources of funds    0.17     0.19Net interest margin (as a percentage of average earning assets (FTE) (a) (b)    3.19%     3.25%(a)Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio of $25 million increased the net interest margin by 18 basis points in the three months ended March 31, 2012.(b)Excess liquidity, represented by average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank, reduced the net interest margin by 21 basis points and 14 basis points in the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.42Table of ContentsQuarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent (FTE) (continued) Three Months Ended March 31, 2012/March 31, 2011(in millions)Increase(Decrease)Due to Rate Increase(Decrease)Due to Volume (a) NetIncrease(Decrease)Loans$13 $23 $36Investment securities available-for-sale(12) 19 7Interest-bearing deposits with banks— 1 1Total earning assets1 43 44      Interest-bearing deposits(5) 2 (3)Medium- and long-term debt3 (4) (1)Total interest-bearing sources(2) (2) (4)      Net interest income/rate spread (FTE)$3 $45 $48(a)Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume.Provision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses includes both the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The Corporation performs a detailed credit quality review quarterly to determine the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments and records provisions for each based on the results. For further discussion of both allowances, refer to the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.The provision for loan losses was $23 million for the first quarter 2012, compared to $49 million for the same period in 2011. The decrease of $26 million in the provision for loan losses in the three-month period ended March 31, 2012, when compared to the same period in 2011, resulted primarily from continued improvements in credit quality. Improvements in credit quality included a decline of $960 million, to $4.2 billion, in the Corporation's internal watch list loans from March 31, 2011 to March 31, 2012. The Corporation's internal watch list is generally consistent with loans in the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful categories defined by regulatory authorities. Additional indicators of improved credit quality included a decrease of $80 million in the inflow to nonaccrual loans (based on an analysis of nonaccrual loans with book balances greater than $2 million) and a decrease in net credit-related charge-offs of $56 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year.Net loan charge-offs for the first quarter 2012 decreased $56 million to $45 million, or 0.43 percent of average total loans, compared to $101 million, or 1.03 percent, for the first quarter 2011. The $56 million decrease in net loan charge-offs for the first quarter 2012, compared to the first quarter 2011, primarily reflected a decrease of $50 million in Middle Market. By geographic market, net loan charge-offs decreased in all markets for the first quarter 2012, compared to the first quarter 2011.The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments, a component of other noninterest expenses on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, increased $2 million to a benefit of $1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012, compared to a benefit of $3 million for the same period in the prior year. The Corporation establishes this provision to maintain an appropriate allowance to cover probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments, which is discussed under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review. The Corporation recorded a purchase discount for lending-related commitments acquired from Sterling. A provision for credit losses will not be recorded on Sterling lending-related commitments until the required allowance exceeds the remaining purchase discount. No provision was recorded for Sterling lending-related commitments during the first quarter 2012. Lending-related commitment charge-offs were insignificant in the three month periods ended March 31, 2012 and 2011.The U.S. economy showed increasing momentum through the second half of 2011 and into the first quarter 2012. Real gross domestic product (GDP) for the fourth quarter 2011 grew at a 3.0 percent annualized rate. The Corporation expects real GDP growth in the first half of 2012 to be positive, but slow-to-moderate, indicative of an economy still hampered by lingering aftereffects of the recession of 2008-2009. The ISM Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing Indexes for March both indicate ongoing expansion for those two broad sectors of the economy. U.S. automotive sales for March registered a 14.3 million unit annual rate and are expected to total 14.9 million units for all of 2012. The unemployment rate has declined to 8.2 percent as of March 2012. However, March 2012 payroll job growth of 120,000 was below expectations. Interest rates remain historically low. Inflation in early 2012 notched up on a month-to-month basis as petroleum prices increased. However, year-to-year comparisons of price levels trended down in early 2012. Gasoline prices climbed through the first quarter 2012 but appear to be peaking early in the second quarter 2012. Recession in the Eurozone and slower economic growth in Asia are key risk factors for the U.S. 43Table of Contentseconomy in 2012, as is the threat of rapidly climbing oil prices in the aftermath of military conflict in the Middle East. Momentum in the Texas economy increased in early 2012. Labor market conditions have improved, the energy sector remains very active, and residential construction activity is picking up. Risks to the Texas economy include possible cuts in defense spending and consolidation in the airlines industry. The economy of California remains hindered by a depressed housing market. Some parts of the California economy are vibrant, notably the high tech industries of Silicon Valley. The state's large government sector remains challenged by weaker than expected tax revenues. California's economy may also be further challenged by cuts to defense spending. Michigan's economy is being buoyed by a rebounding U.S. automotive industry. Gains in durable goods manufacturing are broadening and supporting improvement to other manufacturing and to the service sector. However, many areas of the state remain hampered following the restructuring of the domestic automotive industry.An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets is presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.Noninterest IncomeNoninterest income was $206 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012, a decrease of $1 million  compared to $207 million for the same period in 2011. Service charges on deposit accounts increased $4 million, in part from the acquisition of Sterling. Commercial lending fees increased $4 million, due to an increase in syndication agent fees, reflecting a higher volume of activity in the first three months of 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year. Net securities gains increased $3 million, primarily from an increase in gains from redemptions of auction-rate securities. Card fees decreased $4 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting the impact of regulatory limits on debit card transaction processing fees implemented in the fourth quarter 2011. Net income from principal investing and warrants decreased $4 million and risk management hedge gains decreased $2 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to one-time gains recognized in the first quarter 2011.Noninterest ExpensesNoninterest expenses were $448 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012, an increase of $33 million, or 8 percent, from $415 million for the comparable period in 2011. Salaries expense increased $13 million, primarily due to the acquisition of Sterling. Employee benefits expense increased $10 million, primarily reflecting increased pension expense and the addition of Sterling. Litigation-related expenses, included in other noninterest expenses on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, increased $10 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily as a result of developments on certain litigation claims during the first quarter 2012. FDIC insurance expense decreased $5 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to the implementation of changes to the deposit insurance assessment system effective April 1, 2011. Other real estate expense decreased $4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting a decrease in write-downs on foreclosed property.Provision for Income TaxesThe provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2012 was $48 million, compared to $35 million for the same period in 2011. The $13 million increase in the provision for income taxes in the three-month period ended March 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, was due primarily to an increase in income before income taxes during the same period.Net deferred tax assets were $356 million at March 31, 2012, compared to $395 million at December 31, 2011, a decrease of $39 million, primarily due to a decrease in deferred tax assets due to the utilization of tax credits, accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio and an increase in unrealized gains recognized in other comprehensive income. Deferred tax assets were evaluated for realization and it was determined that no valuation allowance was needed at both March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. This conclusion was based on available evidence of loss carryback capacity, projected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and assumptions made regarding future events.44Table of ContentsBusiness SegmentsThe Corporation's operations are strategically aligned into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based upon the products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, the Finance Division is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes items not directly associated with these business segments or the Finance Division. The performance of the business segments in not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Note 14 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements presents financial results of these business segments for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011. For a description of the business activities of each business segment and the methodologies which form the basis for these results, refer to Note 14 to these unaudited financial statements and Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation's 2011 Annual Report.The following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.

Net interest income (FTE) of $379 million increased $38 million in the three months ended March 31, 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the benefit provided by an increase of $2.6 billion in average loans, accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio of $16 million in the three months ended March 31, 2012, an increase in net funds transfer pricing (FTP) funding credits, primarily due to the benefit provided by an increase of $3.9 billion in average deposits, one more day in 2012 and lower deposit rates, partially offset by lower loan yields. The provision for loan losses of $1 million decreased $17 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting a decrease in Middle Market, partially offset by increases in Commercial Real Estate and National Dealer Services. Net credit-related charge-offs of $28 million decreased $45 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in net charge-offs in Middle Market. Noninterest income of $81 million increased $4 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a $5 million increase in syndication agent fees. Noninterest expenses of $159 million decreased $1 million from the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a $4 million decrease in other real estate expense, partially offset by smaller increases in several other noninterest expense categories. The provision for income taxes (FTE) of $94 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012 increased $21 million, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in income before income taxes. Net income for the Retail Bank was $14 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012, compared to a net loss of $2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011. Net interest income (FTE) of $167 million increased $28 million in the three months ended March 31, 2012 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase of $356 million in average loans, an increase in net FTP funding credits, primarily due to the benefit provided by an increase of $3.0 billion in average deposits, accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio of $9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2012, and lower deposit rates. The provision for loan losses of $4 million decreased $19 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting decreases in Small Business Banking and Personal Banking. Net credit-related charge-offs of $12 million decreased $11 million from the comparable period in the prior year, with broad-based decreases across all major markets and business lines. Noninterest income of $42 million was unchanged from the comparable period in the prior year, as smaller increases in several other noninterest income categories were offset by a $5 million decrease in card fees. Noninterest expenses of $184 million increased $22 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to increases in salaries and benefit expense ($9 million), processing charges ($4 million) and allocated net corporate overhead expenses ($3 million). The increase in salaries and benefit expense was primarily due to the addition of Sterling. The provision for income taxes (FTE) of $7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012 increased $9 million, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in income before income taxes. Wealth Management's net income of $11 million decreased $3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012, 45Table of Contentscompared to the three months ended March 31, 2011. Net interest income (FTE) of $47 million increased $3 million in the three months ended March 31, 2012 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in FTP funding credits, primarily due to the benefit provided by an $811 million increase in average deposits, and a decrease in FTP funding costs, partially offset by lower loan yields and the impact of a $242 million decrease in average loan balances. The provision for loan losses of $14 million increased $6 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting increases in the Florida and Midwest markets. Net credit-related charge-offs of $5 million were unchanged from the comparable period in the prior year. Noninterest income of $65 million increased $1 million from the comparable period in the prior year. Noninterest expenses of $81 million increased $3 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a $2 million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense. The provision for income taxes (FTE) of $6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012 decreased $2 million, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in income before income taxes. The net loss in the Finance Division was $92 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012, compared to a net loss of $75 million in the three months ended March 31, 2011. Net interest expense (FTE) of $156 million increased $21 million in the three months ended March 31, 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily as a result of the Corporation's internal FTP methodology as described on page F-13 of the Corporation's 2011 Annual Report. The Finance Division pays the three major business segments for the long-term value of deposits based on their assumed lives. The three major business segments pay the Finance Division for funding based on the pricing and term characteristics of their loans. The increase in net interest expense (FTE) was primarily due to an increase in average deposits in the three major business segments, partially offset by an increase in average loans in the three major business segments and an an increase in average investment securities available-for-sale in the Finance Division. Noninterest income of $13 million decreased $5 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to decreases in customer derivative income and risk management hedge income. Noninterest expenses of $3 million decreased $1 million from the comparable period in the prior year. The benefit for income taxes (FTE) of $54 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012 increased $10 million, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily resulting from an increase in losses before income taxes.The net loss in the Other category of $9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011 increased $8 million from the comparable period in the prior year. The increase in net loss primarily reflected an $8 million increase in noninterest expenses, primarily due to an increase in litigation and legal expenses.Market SegmentsMarket segment results are provided for the Corporation's four primary geographic markets: Midwest, Western, Texas and Florida. In addition to the four primary geographic markets, Other Markets and International are also reported as market segments. The Finance & Other category includes items not directly associated with the market segments. Note 14 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements presents a description of each of these market segments as well as the financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2012 and 2011. The following table presents net income (loss) by market segment.

Net interest income (FTE) of $198 million decreased $5 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in loan yields, the impact of a $275 million decrease in average loans and an increase in net FTP funding costs, partially offset by the benefit provided by a $1.2 billion increase in average deposits, lower deposit rates and the benefit of one more day in 2012. The provision for loan losses of $10 million decreased $24 million from the comparable prior year period, primarily reflecting decreases in Middle Market, Commercial Real Estate, Small Business Banking and Personal Banking. Net credit-related charge-offs decreased $28 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in Middle Market. Noninterest income of $98 million decreased $2 million from the comparable prior 46Table of Contentsyear period, primarily due to a $2 million decrease in card fees. Noninterest expenses of $183 million decreased $5 million from the comparable prior year period, primarily due to decreases in other real estate expense ($6 million) and FDIC insurance expense ($3 million), partially offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments ($5 million). The provision for income taxes (FTE) of $35 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012 increased $7 million compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily resulting from an increase in income before income taxes.The Western market's net income of $65 million increased $14 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011. Net interest income (FTE) of $171 million increased $7 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in FTP funding credits, reflecting the benefit provided by a $1.7 billion increase in average deposits, a decrease in FTP funding costs, lower deposit rates and one more day in 2012, partially offset by lower loan yields. The provision for loan losses decreased $18 million from the comparable prior year period, primarily reflecting decreases in Middle Market and Small Business Banking, partially offset by increases in Commercial Real Estate and Global Corporate Banking. Net credit-related charge-offs decreased $15 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to decreases in net charge-offs in Middle Market, Commercial Real Estate and Small Business Banking. Noninterest income of $33 million decreased $4 million from the comparable prior year period, primarily due to a $2 million decrease in net income from principal investing and warrants. Noninterest expenses of $107 million decreased $2 million from the comparable prior year period, primarily due to smaller decreases in several other noninterest expense categories. The provision for income taxes (FTE) of $39 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012 increased $9 million compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily resulting from an increase in income before income taxes.The Texas market's net income increased $20 million to $49 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011. Net interest income (FTE) of $151 million increased $64 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio of $25 million in three months ended March 31, 2012, an increase in FTP funding credits, primarily due to the benefit provided by an increase of $4.4 billion in average deposits, a $2.5 billion increase in average loans, lower deposit rates and an increase in loan yields, partially offset by an increase in FTP funding costs. The increases in average loans and average deposits were primarily due to the acquisition of Sterling. The provision for loan losses increased $10 million from the comparable prior year period, primarily reflecting an increase in Commercial Real Estate. Net credit-related charge-offs of $7 million decreased $1 million from the comparable prior year period, primarily due to a decrease in Middle Market. Noninterest income of $31 million increased $8 million from the comparable prior year period, primarily due to a $3 million increase in service charges on deposit accounts, substantially all from the addition of Sterling, and smaller increases in several other noninterest income categories. Noninterest expenses of $92 million increased $31 million from the comparable prior year period, primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits expense ($9 million), allocated corporate overhead ($6 million), processing charges ($4 million) and smaller increases in several other noninterest expense categories. The increase in salaries and benefit expense was primarily due to the addition of Sterling. The provision for income taxes (FTE) of $27 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012 increased $11 million compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily resulting from an increase in income before income taxes. The net loss in the Florida market was $1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012, compared to a net loss of $4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2011. Net interest income (FTE) of $10 million decreased $1 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a $162 million decrease in average loans. The provision for loan losses decreased $2 million from the comparable prior year period, primarily reflecting decreases in Commercial Real Estate and Middle Market, partially offset by an increase in Private Banking. Net credit-related charge-offs of $2 million decreased $6 million from the comparable prior year period, primarily due to decreases in Commercial Real Estate and Middle Market. Noninterest income of $4 million was unchanged from the comparable prior year period. Noninterest expenses of $9 million decreased $3 million from the comparable prior year period, primarily due to smaller decreases in several noninterest expense categories.Net income in Other Markets of $38 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012, was unchanged compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011. Net interest income (FTE) of $45 million increased $4 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily the result of the benefit provided by an increase of $733 million in average loans, partially offset by lower loan yields. The provision for loan losses increased $4 million from the comparable prior year period, primarily reflecting an increase in Commercial Real Estate, partially offset by a decrease in Middle Market. Net credit-related charge-offs decreased $3 million from the comparable prior year period, primarily due to a decrease in Middle Market, partially offset by an increase in Commercial Real Estate. Noninterest income of $14 million and noninterest expenses of $24 million each increased $3 million from the comparable prior year period.The International market's net income of $12 million was unchanged for the three months ended March 31, 2012, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2011. Net interest income (FTE) of $18 million was unchanged from the comparable period in the prior year. The provision for loan losses was unchanged compared to the comparable prior year period. Net credit-related charge-offs decreased $3 million from the comparable prior year period. Noninterest income of $8 million and noninterest expenses of $9 million were each unchanged from the comparable prior year period.47Table of ContentsThe net loss for the Finance & Other segment was $101 million in the three months ended March 31, 2012, compared to a net loss of $76 million in the three months ended March 31, 2011. The $25 million increase in net loss resulted from the same reasons noted in the Finance Division and Other category discussions under the “Business Segments” heading above.The following table lists the Corporation's banking centers by geographic market segment.

The increase in accrued income and other assets primarily reflected a receivable for the pending settlement of a large customer-initiated sweep transaction that cleared on the first business day in April 2012. On an average basis, total assets increased $568 million to $61.6 billion in the first quarter 2012, compared to the fourth quarter 2011, resulting primarily from increases in average loans ($815 million) and investment securities available-for-sale ($108 million), partially offset by a decrease in average interest-bearing deposits with banks ($409 million).48Table of ContentsThe following tables show the change in the Corporation's average loan portfolio by business line and geographic market in the first quarter 2012, compared to the fourth quarter 2011.

The increase in average loans reflected increases in National Dealer Services ($407 million), Energy ($359 million), Global Corporate Banking ($254 million), Middle Market ($127 million) and Technology and Life Sciences ($126 million), partially offset by a decrease in Commercial Real Estate ($211 million). Average loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line continued to decline, primarily reflecting ongoing payment activity. Changes in average loans by geographic market are displayed in the table above.Total liabilities increased $1.5 billion to $55.6 billion at March 31, 2012, compared to December 31, 2011, due to a $1.5 billion increase in total deposits. On an average basis, total liabilities increased $576 million in the first quarter 2012, compared to the fourth quarter 2011, primarily due to a $532 million increase in average deposits. The increases in average deposits from the fourth quarter 2011 to the first quarter 2012 resulted primarily from an increase in average noninterest-bearing deposits of $461 million and primarily reflected increases in Global Corporate Banking ($296 million), the Financial Services Division ($285 million), Technology and Life Sciences ($262 million) and Private Banking ($208 million), partially offset by decreases in Small Business Banking ($301 million) and Energy ($179 million). By geographic market, the increase in average deposits from the fourth quarter 2011 to the first quarter 2012 primarily reflected increases in the Midwest ($339 million), Western ($227 million) and Other ($214 million) markets, partially offset by a $105 million decrease in the Texas market.49Table of ContentsCapitalTotal shareholders' equity increased $117 million to $7.0 billion at March 31, 2012, compared to December 31, 2011.

The capital plan provides for up to $375 million in equity repurchases for the five-quarter period ending March 31, 2013. The capital plan, which was approved by the Corporation's Board of Directors, further contemplated a 50 percent increase in Comerica's quarterly dividend, from 10 cents per share to 15 cents per share. The dividend proposal was approved by the Board on April 24, 2012. In addition, the capital plan included the authority to redeem the remaining $25 million of trust preferred securities outstanding as of March 31, 2012. On April 24, 2012, the Corporation provided notice to the trustee of its intent to redeem these securities effective June 15, 2012. In November 2010, the Board of Directors of the Corporation authorized the repurchase of up to 12.6 million shares of Comerica Incorporated outstanding common stock and authorized the purchase of up to all 11.5 million of the Corporation's original outstanding warrants. On April 24, 2012, the Board authorized the repurchase of an additional 5.7 million shares of Comerica Incorporated outstanding common stock. There is no expiration date for the Corporation's share repurchase program. For further information regarding the repurchase program, refer to Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation's 2011 Annual Report.

Assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with specified risk-weighting factors. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items. As shown in the table below, the Tier 1 common capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based capital and tangible common equity ratios decreased from December 31, 2011 to March 31, 2012, while the leverage ratio increased in the same period. The risk-based ratios decreased, while the leverage ratio increased, because the denominator for the risk-based ratios, period-end risk-weighted assets, increased more relative to the increase in capital than the denominator for the leverage ratio, adjusted quarterly average assets. 50Table of ContentsThe Corporation's capital ratios exceeded minimum regulatory requirements as follows: March 31, 2012 December 31, 2011(dollar amounts in millions)Capital Ratio Capital RatioTier 1 common (a) (b)$6,647 10.33% $6,557 10.37%Tier 1 risk-based (4.00% - minimum) (b)6,672 10.37 6,582 10.41Total risk-based (8.00% - minimum) (b)9,081 14.11 9,015 14.25Leverage (3.00% - minimum) (b)6,672 10.97 6,582 10.92Tangible common equity (a)6,320 10.21 6,201 10.27(a)See Supplemental Financial Data section for reconcilements of non-GAAP financial measures.(b)March 31, 2012 capital and ratios are estimated.In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee) issued a framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation (Basel III). The Basel III capital framework includes higher global minimum capital standards, including a more stringent definition of capital, new capital conservation buffers and a minimum Tier 1 common capital ratio. The Basel III capital framework also proposes the deduction of certain assets from capital, including deferred tax assets and mortgage servicing rights, among others and within prescribed limitations, as well as the inclusion of other comprehensive income in capital and increased capital requirements for counterparty credit risk. Rules are expected to be implemented between 2013 and 2019. Adoption in the U.S. is expected to occur over a similar timeframe, but the final form of the U.S. rules is not yet known. The Basel III liquidity framework includes two minimum liquidity measures. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio requires a financial institution to hold a buffer of high-quality, liquid assets to fully cover net cash outflows under a 30-day systematic liquidity stress scenario. The Net Stable Funding Ratio requires the amount of available longer-term, stable sources of funding to be at least 100 percent of the required amount of longer-term stable funding over a one-year period. The Corporation's liquidity position is strong, but if subject to the Basel III liquidity framework as currently proposed, the Corporation may decide to consider additional liquidity management initiatives. While uncertainty exists in both the final form of the Basel III guidance and whether or not the Corporation will be required to adopt the guidelines, the Corporation is closely monitoring the development of the guidance. We expect to meet the final requirements adopted by U.S. banking regulators within regulatory timelines.Risk ManagementThe following updated information should be read in conjunction with the "Risk Management" section on pages F-23 through F-42 in the Corporation's 2011 Annual Report.Credit RiskAllowance for Credit Losses and Nonperforming AssetsThe allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The allowance for loan losses represents management's assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporation's loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in "accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets, provides for probable losses inherent in lending-related commitments, including unused commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.The Corporation disaggregates the loan portfolio into segments for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses. These segments are based on the level at which the Corporation develops, documents and applies a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The Corporation's portfolio segments are business loans and retail loans. Business loans are defined as those belonging to the commercial, real estate construction, commercial mortgage, lease financing and international loan portfolios. Retail loans consist of traditional residential mortgage, home equity and other consumer loans.The allowance for loan losses includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain loans, and allowances for homogeneous pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. In the first quarter 2012, the Corporation implemented enhancements to the methodology used for determining the allowance for loan losses for business loans. The enhancements included expanding the historical borrower rating migration and loss experience periods and estimating probability of default and loss given default from a national perspective, in addition to a market-by-market basis.The allowance for loan losses was $704 million at March 31, 2012, compared to $726 million at December 31, 2011, a decrease of $22 million, or 3 percent. The decrease resulted primarily from improvements in credit quality, partially offset by increased loan volumes and an increase in the allowance for loan losses resulting from the methodology enhancements described above. Improvements in credit quality included a decline of $261 million in the Corporation's internal watch list loans from December 31, 2011 to March 31, 2012, a decrease in the inflow to nonaccrual (based on an analysis of nonaccrual loans with balances greater than $2 million) of $30 million and a decrease in net credit-related charge-offs of $15 million for the three months 51Table of Contentsended December 31, 2011 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2012. The $22 million decrease in the allowance for loan losses primarily reflected decreases in Commercial Real Estate and Middle Market, partially offset by an increase in Private Banking. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total period-end loans was 1.64 percent at March 31, 2012, compared to 1.70 percent at December 31, 2011. Nonperforming loans of $856 million at March 31, 2012 decreased $31 million, compared to December 31, 2011. Loan charge-offs are taken as amounts are determined to be uncollectible. A measure of the level of charge-offs already taken on nonaccrual loans is the current book balance as a percentage of the contractual amount owed. At both March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, nonaccrual loans were charged-off to approximately 60 percent of the contractual amount. This level of write-downs is consistent with losses experienced on loan defaults in the first three months of 2012 and in recent years. The allowance as a percentage of total nonperforming loans, a ratio which results from the actions noted above, was 82 percent at both March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. The Corporation's loan portfolio is primarily composed of business loans, which, in the event of default, are typically carried on the books at fair value as nonperforming assets for a longer period of time than are consumer loans, which are generally fully charged off when they become nonperforming, resulting in a lower nonperforming loan allowance coverage when compared to banking organizations with higher concentrations of consumer loans.Loans acquired from Sterling were initially recorded at fair value, which included an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans, and therefore no corresponding allowance for loan losses was recorded for these loans at acquisition. Methods utilized to estimate the required allowance for loan losses for acquired loans not deemed credit-impaired at acquisition are similar to originated loans; however, the estimate of loss is based on the unpaid principal balance less the remaining purchase discount. At both March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, no allowance was required for acquired loans not deemed credit-impaired and $76 million and $96 million of purchase discounts remained, respectively. Purchased credit impaired (PCI) loans are not considered nonperforming loans.The total allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb incurred losses inherent in the total loan portfolio. Unanticipated economic events, including political, economic and regulatory instability could cause changes in the credit characteristics of the portfolio and result in an unanticipated increase in the allowance. Inclusion of other industry-specific portfolio exposures in the allowance, as well as significant increases in the current portfolio exposures, could also increase the amount of the allowance. Any of these events, or some combination thereof, may result in the need for additional provision for loan losses in order to maintain an allowance that complies with credit risk and accounting policies. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain letters of credit in a manner consistent with business loans, and allowances based on the pool of the remaining letters of credit and all unused commitments to extend credit within each internal risk rating.The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $25 million at March 31, 2012, a decrease of $1 million from $26 million at December 31, 2011. The Corporation recorded a purchase discount for lending-related commitments acquired from Sterling. An allowance for credit losses will be recorded on Sterling lending-related commitments only to the extent that the required allowance exceeds the remaining purchase discount. At both March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, no allowance was recorded for Sterling lending-related commitments and $3 million of purchase discount remained.52Table of ContentsNonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, troubled debt restructured loans (TDRs) which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans) and real estate which has been acquired through foreclosure and is awaiting disposition (foreclosed property). Nonperforming assets do not include PCI loans. Nonperforming assets decreased $58 million to $923 million at March 31, 2012, from $981 million at December 31, 2011.

The primary driver of when the principal amount of a business loan should be fully or partially charged off is based on a qualitative assessment of the recoverability of the principal amount from collateral and other cash flow sources. Residential mortgage and home equity loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status and charged off to current appraised values, less costs to sell, during the foreclosure process, normally no later than 180 days past due. Other consumer loans are generally not placed on nonaccrual status and are charged off at no later than 120 days past due, earlier if deemed uncollectible. Loan amounts in excess of probable future cash collections are charged off to an amount that management ultimately expects to collect. At the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, interest previously accrued but not collected is charged against current income. Income on such loans is then recognized only to the extent that cash is received and the future collection of principal is probable. Generally, a loan may be returned to accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest have been received and the Corporation expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest, generally based on a period of sustained payment performance, normally at least six months, or when the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation's 2011 Annual Report for further information regarding impaired loans.  At March 31, 2012, TDRs totaled $346 million, of which $235 million were nonperforming ($209 million nonaccrual TDRs and $26 million reduced-rate TDRs) and $111 million were considered performing. Performing TDRs included $60 million of commercial loans (primarily in Middle Market, Global Corporate Banking and Private Banking) and $51 million of commercial mortgage loans (primarily in Commercial Real Estate, Middle Market, National Dealer Services and Private Banking) at March 31, 2012. At December 31, 2011, TDRs totaled $331 million, including $206 million nonaccrual TDRs, $27 million reduced-rate TDRs and $98 million TDRs considered performing. The $15 million increase in total TDRs primarily reflected increases in Global Corporate Banking and Private Banking.55Table of ContentsLoans past due 30-89 days increased $40 million to $315 million at March 31, 2012, compared to $275 million at December 31, 2011.

Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $11.5 billion at March 31, 2012, of which $3.6 billion, or 31 percent, were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to residential real estate investors and developers. The remaining $7.9 billion, or 69 percent, of commercial real estate loans in other business lines consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans. The real estate construction loan portfolio totaled $1.4 billion at March 31, 2012. The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-time customers with satisfactory completion experience. However, the significant and prolonged decline in residential real estate activity that began in late 2008 in the Western, Florida and Midwest markets proved extremely difficult for many of the smaller residential real estate developers. Of the $1.1 billion of real estate construction loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line, $77 million were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2012. Real estate construction loan net charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012.The commercial mortgage loan portfolio totaled $10.1 billion at March 31, 2012 and included $2.5 billion in the Commercial Real Estate business line and $7.6 billion in other business lines. Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Of the $2.5 billion of commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line, $174 million were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2012. Commercial mortgage loan net charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $12 million for the three months ended March 31, 2012. 57Table of ContentsThe geographic distribution and project type of commercial real estate loans are important factors in diversifying credit risk within the portfolio.

Residential mortgages totaled $1.5 billion at March 31, 2012, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.5 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $69 million were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2012. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.6 58Table of Contentsbillion at March 31, 2012, of which $1.4 billion was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit and $186 million consisted of closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.6 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $9 million were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2012. A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens. The Corporation rarely originates residential real estate loans with loan-to-value ratios above 100 percent at origination, has no sub-prime mortgage programs and does not originate payment-option adjustable-rate mortgages or other nontraditional mortgages that allow negative amortization. A significant majority of residential mortgage originations are sold in the secondary market. Since 2008, the Corporation has used a third party to originate, document and underwrite residential mortgage loans on behalf of the Corporation. Under this arrangement, the third party assumes repurchase liability for the loans it originates. The Corporation has repurchase liability exposure for residential mortgage loans originated prior to 2008, however based on historical experience, the Corporation believes such exposure, which could be triggered by underwriting discrepancies, is minimal. The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation's primary geographic markets. The economic recession and significant declines in home values in the Western, Florida and Midwest markets following the financial market turmoil beginning in the fall of 2008 adversely impacted the residential real estate portfolio. At March 31, 2011, the Corporation estimated that, of the $8 million total residential mortgage loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest, approximately $1 million exceeded 90 percent of the current value of the underlying collateral, based on S&P/Case-Shiller home price indices. To account for this exposure, the Corporation factors changes in home values into estimated loss ratios for residential real estate loans, using index-based estimates by major metropolitan area, resulting in an increased allowance allocated for residential real estate loans when home values decline. Additionally, to mitigate increasing credit exposure due to depreciating home values, the Corporation periodically reviews home equity lines of credit and makes line reductions or converts outstanding balances at line maturity to closed-end, amortizing loans when necessary. Shared National CreditsShared National Credit (SNC) loans are facilities greater than $20 million shared by three or more federally supervised financial institutions that are reviewed annually by regulatory authorities at the agent bank level. The Corporation generally seeks to obtain ancillary business at the origination of a SNC relationship. Loans classified as SNC loans (approximately 890 borrowers at March 31, 2012) totaled $8.7 billion at March 31, 2012, compared to $8.4 billion at December 31, 2011. SNC net loan charge-offs totaled $14 million and $1 million for the three month periods ended March 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. SNC loans, diversified by both business line and geographic market, comprised approximately 20 percent of total loans at both March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011 SNC loans are held to the same credit underwriting standards as the remainder of the loan portfolio and face similar credit challenges. Automotive LendingSubstantially all dealer loans are in the National Dealer Services business line. Loans in the National Dealer Services business line include floor plan financing and other loans to automotive dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in “commercial loans” in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $2.2 billion at March 31, 2012, an increase of $330 million compared to $1.8 billion at December 31, 2011, primarily reflecting the continued recovery from the impact of supply chain disruptions caused by the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami in Japan in March 2011, as the significant majority of the decrease in floor plan loans was concentrated in automotive franchises selling Japanese-made vehicles. At both March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $1.9 billion, including $1.4 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans at both March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. Automotive lending also includes loans to borrowers involved with automotive production, primarily Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers. Loans to borrowers involved with automotive production totaled approximately $1.1 billion at March 31, 2012, compared to $931 million at December 31, 2011.State and Local MunicipalitiesIn the normal course of business, the Corporation serves the needs of state and local municipalities in multiple capacities, including traditional banking products such as deposit services, loans and letters of credit, investment banking services such as bond underwriting and private placements, and by investing in municipal securities. The following table summarizes the Corporation's direct exposure to state and local municipalities as of March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011.

Additionally, the Corporation is exposed to Automated Clearing House (ACH) transaction risk for those municipalities utilizing this electronic payment and/or deposit method and similar products in their cash flow management. The Corporation sets limits on ACH activity during the underwriting process.Extensions of credit to state and local municipalities are subjected to the same underwriting standards as other business loans. At March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, all outstanding municipal loans and leases were performing according to contractual terms and none were included in the Corporation's internal watch list. Municipal leases are secured by the underlying equipment, and a substantial majority of the leases are fully defeased with AAA-rated U.S. government securities. Substantially all municipal investment securities available-for sale are auction-rate securities. All auction-rate securities are reviewed quarterly for other-than-temporary impairment. All auction-rate municipal securities were rated investment grade, and all auction-rate preferred securities collateralized by municipal securities were rated AAA or the equivalent and were adequately collateralized at both March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. Municipal securities are held in the trading account for resale to customers. In addition, Comerica Securities, a broker-dealer subsidiary of Comerica Bank, underwrites bonds issued by municipalities. All bonds underwritten by Comerica Securities are sold to third party investors. European ExposureThe Corporation does not hold any sovereign exposure to Europe. The Corporation's international strategy as it pertains to Europe is to focus on European corporations doing business in North America, with an emphasis on the major geographic markets. The following table summarizes cross-border exposure to entities domiciled in European countries at March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011.

Interest rate risk arises primarily through the Corporation's core business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by a combination of core deposits and wholesale borrowings. Approximately 80 percent of the Corporation's loans were floating at March 31, 2012, of which approximately 70 percent were based on LIBOR and 30 percent were based on Prime. This creates a natural imbalance between the floating-rate loan portfolio and the more slowly repricing deposit products. The result is that growth and/or contraction in the Corporation's core businesses may lead to sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing investment securities, primarily fixed-rate, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, and hedging the sensitivity with interest rate swaps. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk, with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.The Corporation frequently evaluates net interest income under various balance sheet and interest rate scenarios, looking at a 12-month time horizon, using simulation modeling analysis as its principal risk management evaluation technique. The results of this analysis provides the information needed to assess the balance sheet structure. Changes in economic activity, whether domestic or international, different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis could translate into a materially different interest rate environment than currently expected. Management evaluates a base case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment and what is believed to be the most likely balance sheet structure. This base case net interest income is then evaluated against non-parallel interest rate scenarios that increase and decrease 200 basis points in a linear fashion from the base case over 12 months, resulting in an average change in interest rates of 100 basis points over the period. Due to the current low level of interest rates, the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of a 25 basis point drop, to zero percent. In addition, consistent with each interest rate scenario, adjustments to asset prepayment levels, yield curves, and overall balance sheet mix and growth assumptions are made. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model may not precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income. Additionally, the estimated impact on net interest income over the 12-month time horizon is generally not linear relative to other time horizons. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions and management strategies, among other factors. However, the model can indicate the likely direction of change. Existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes are included in the analysis, but no additional hedging is forecasted. The table below, as of March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above. The sensitivity from December 31, 2011 to March 31, 2012 increased primarily due to growth in core deposits, though risk to declining interest rates is limited by the current low level of rates.

The economic value of equity analysis begins with an estimate of the economic value of the financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments on the Corporation's balance sheet, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period. Next, the estimated impact of rate movements is applied to the economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments. The economic value of equity is then calculated as the difference between the estimated market value of assets and liabilities net of the impact of off-balance sheet instruments. As with net interest income simulation analysis, a variety of alternative scenarios are performed to measure the impact on economic value of equity, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve.61Table of ContentsThe table below, as of March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from a 200 basis point immediate parallel increase or decrease in interest rates. Similar to the simulation analysis above, due to the current low level of interest rates, the economic value of equity analyses below reflect an interest rate scenario of an immediate 25 basis point drop, to zero percent, while the rising interest rate scenario reflects an immediate 200 basis point rise. The change in the sensitivity of the economic value of equity to a 200 basis point parallel increase in rates between December 31, 2011 and March 31, 2012 was primarily driven by changes in market interest rates, increases in noninterest-bearing and lower cost deposits, and forecasted prepayments on the Corporation's mortgage-backed securities portfolio.

Liquid assets, which totaled $11.4 billion at March 31, 2012, compared to $11.2 billion at December 31, 2011, provide a reservoir of liquidity. Liquid assets include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits with banks, other short-term investments and unencumbered investment securities available-for-sale. At March 31, 2012, the Corporation held excess liquidity, represented by $2.9 billion deposited with the FRB, compared to $2.5 billion at December 31, 2011.The Corporation may access the purchased funds market when necessary, which includes foreign office time deposits and short-term borrowings. Capacity for incremental purchased funds at March 31, 2012 included the ability to purchase federal funds, sell securities under agreements to repurchase, as well as issue deposits to institutional investors and issue certificates of deposit through brokers. Purchased funds totaled $414 million at March 31, 2012, compared to $418 million at December 31, 2011. The Corporation is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, Texas (FHLB), which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. The actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. As of March 31, 2012, the Corporation had $2.0 billion of outstanding borrowings from the FHLB with remaining maturities ranging from May 2013 to May 2014. Additionally, the Bank had the ability to issue up to $14.8 billion of debt at March 31, 2012 under an existing $15 billion medium-term senior note program which allows the issuance of debt with maturities between three months and 30 years. The Corporation also maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and/or equity securities. The ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise funds at competitive rates is impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings of the Corporation and the Bank. As of March 31, 2012, the four major rating agencies had assigned the following ratings to long-term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.March 31, 2012Comerica Incorporated Comerica BankStandard and Poor’sA- AMoody’s Investors ServiceA3 A2Fitch RatingsA ADBRSA A (High)Other Market RisksMarket risk related to the Corporation's trading instruments is not significant, as trading activities are limited. Certain components of the Corporation's noninterest income, primarily fiduciary income, are at risk to fluctuations in the market values of underlying assets, particularly equity and debt securities. Other components of noninterest income, primarily brokerage fees, are at risk to changes in the volume of market activity. At both March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, the Corporation had a $15 million portfolio of investments in indirect private equity and venture capital funds, with commitments of $9 million to fund additional investments in future periods. The value of these investments is at risk to changes in equity markets, general economic conditions and a variety of other factors. The majority of these investments are not readily marketable and are included in “accrued income and other assets” on the consolidated balance sheets. The investments are individually reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value.62Table of ContentsFor further discussion of market risk, see Note 6 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements and pages F-36 through F-41 in the Corporation's 2011 Annual Report.Critical Accounting PoliciesThe Corporation’s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation’s 2011 Annual Report. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation’s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2011, the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to the allowance for credit losses, valuation methodologies, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages F-43 through F-48 in the Corporation’s 2011 Annual Report.The following is the critical accounting policy for goodwill reflecting the results of the most recent impairment test performed in the first quarter 2012. As of the date of this report, the Corporation does not believe there are any other material changes in the nature or categories of the critical accounting policies or estimates and assumptions from those discussed in the Corporation’s 2011 Annual Report.GoodwillGoodwill is the value attributed to unidentifiable intangible elements in acquired businesses. Goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level, equivalent to a business segment or one level below. The Corporation has three reporting units: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. At both March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $635 million, including $380 million allocated to the Business Bank, $194 million allocated to the Retail Bank and $61 million allocated to Wealth Management. The Corporation performs its annual evaluation of goodwill impairment in the third quarter of each year and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests suggest additional testing may be warranted to determine if goodwill might be impaired. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step test. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of identified reporting units with their carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. Estimating the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process involving the use of estimates and judgments related to the selection of inputs such as future cash flows, discount rates, comparable public company multiples, applicable control premiums and economic expectations used in determining the interest rate environment. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are determined using a blend of two commonly used valuation techniques: the market approach and the income approach. For the market approach, valuations of reporting units consider a combination of earnings, equity and other multiples from companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit. Since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of noncontrolling interests, the valuations accordingly incorporate a control premium. For the income approach, estimated future cash flows and terminal value are discounted. Estimated future cash flows are derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for each reporting unit. The applicable discount rate is based on the imputed cost of equity capital appropriate for each reporting unit, which incorporates the risk-free rate of return, the level of non-diversified risk associated with companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit (beta), an entity-specific risk premium and a market equity risk premium. In January 2012, the Federal Reserve announced their expectation for the Federal Funds target rate to remain at currently low levels through late 2014. Given the potential for a continued low interest rate environment, the Corporation determined that an interim goodwill impairment test should be performed in the first quarter 2012. As part of the impairment analysis, the Corporation incorporated the Federal Reserve's expectation of the low Federal Fund target rate level through 2014 in its forecasts. In the first quarter 2012, the Corporation engaged an independent valuation specialist to review its valuation models and assumptions. Based on the results of this review and in light of the current rate environment, the Corporation updated its assumptions, discount factors and control premiums. The updated assumptions included maintaining the low Federal funds target rate through the end of 2014. For the years after 2014, the Corporation developed rate assumptions based on the expectation of modest increases in the Federal Funds target rate, eventually reaching a normal interest rate environment. Increases to the fair value of the reporting units were in part a result of the improvement in the stock price of the Corporation as well as the stock prices of the guideline companies used in the market approach. The first step of the interim goodwill impairment test performed in the first quarter 2012 indicated that the estimated fair values of each of the reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values, including goodwill. The fair value of the Retail Bank exceeded the carrying value by 14 percent. The results of the goodwill impairment test for each reporting unit were subjected to stress testing as appropriate. 63Table of ContentsEconomic conditions impact the assumptions related to interest and growth rates, loss rates and imputed cost of equity capital. The fair value estimates for each reporting unit incorporated current economic and market conditions, including the recent Federal Reserve announcement and the impact of legislative and regulatory changes, to the extent known and as described above. However, further weakening in the economic environment, such as adverse changes in interest rates, a decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below their carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Additionally, new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management's expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Any impairment charge would not affect the Corporation's regulatory capital ratios, tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position.64Table of ContentsSupplemental Financial DataThe following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this financial review with financial measures defined by GAAP.(dollar amounts in millions)March 31, 2012 December 31, 2011Tier 1 Common Capital Ratio:   Tier 1 capital (a) (b)$6,672 $6,582Less:   Trust preferred securities25 25Tier 1 common capital (b)$6,647 $6,557Risk-weighted assets (a) (b)$64,362 $63,244Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio (b)10.37% 10.41%Tier 1 common capital ratio (b)10.33 10.37Tangible Common Equity Ratio:   Common shareholders' equity$6,985 $6,868Less:   Goodwill635 635Other intangible assets30 32Tangible common equity$6,320 $6,201Total assets$62,593 $61,008Less:   Goodwill635 635Other intangible assets30 32Tangible assets$61,928 $60,341Common equity ratio11.16% 11.26%Tangible common equity ratio10.21 10.27Tangible Common Equity per Share of Common Stock:   Common shareholders' equity$6,985 $6,868Tangible common equity6,320 6,201Shares of common stock outstanding (in millions)197 197Common shareholders' equity per share of common stock$35.44 $34.80Tangible common equity per share of common stock32.06 31.42(a)Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as defined by regulation.(b)March 31, 2012 Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets are estimated.The Tier 1 common capital ratio removes qualifying trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations. The tangible common equity ratio removes the effect of intangible assets from capital and the effect of intangible assets from total assets and tangible common equity per share of common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders' equity per share of common stock. The Corporation believes these measurements are meaningful measures of capital adequacy used by investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and to compare against other companies in the industry.ITEM 3.
