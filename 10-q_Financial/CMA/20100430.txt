The Corporation does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect facts, circumstances, assumptions or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made. For any forward-looking statements made in this report, the Corporation claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.   41      Table of Contents   Common Stock Offering and Redemption of Preferred Stock   In the first quarter 2010, the Corporation fully redeemed $2.25 billion of Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (preferred stock) issued in connection with the U.S. Department of Treasury (U.S. Treasury) Capital Purchase Program. The redemption was funded by the net proceeds from an $880 million common stock offering completed in the first quarter 2010 and from excess liquidity at the parent company. At March 31, 2010, after the redemption, the Corporation held $3.8 billion of interest-bearing deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB), representing excess liquidity, which included $665 million of parent company liquid assets. The redemption resulted in a one-time, non-cash redemption charge of $94 million, reflecting the accelerated accretion of the remaining discount, which reduced first quarter 2010 diluted earnings per common share by $0.61. The total impact of the preferred stock, including the redemption charge, cash dividends of $24 million and non-cash discount accretion of $5 million, was a reduction to first quarter 2010 diluted earnings per common share of $0.79. The only significant non-financial impact of the redemption was the removal of executive compensation rules by the U.S. Treasury. The executive and legislative branches of the federal government, as well as our primary regulators, may continue to request supplementary reporting.   Subsequent to the redemption, the Corporation announced its election not to repurchase a related warrant for 11.5 million shares of common stock issued to the U.S. Treasury. On April 12, 2010, the U.S. Treasury announced its intention to sell such warrant pursuant to a public offering process during the second quarter 2010.   Results of Operations   Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2010 was $52 million, an increase of $43 million from $9 million reported for the three months ended March 31, 2009. The increase in net income in the first quarter 2010 compared to the same period in 2009 was primarily due to a $31 million increase in net interest income, a decrease of $28 million in the provision for loan losses and a $27 million gain ($17 million after-tax) from the cash settlement of a note receivable held by the Corporation related to the 2006 sale of an investment advisory subsidiary, recorded in “income from discontinued operations, net of tax” on the consolidated statements of income, partially offset by a $24 million gain in the first quarter 2009 on the termination of certain structured lease transactions. The net loss attributable to common stock was $71 million for the first quarter 2010, compared to $24 million in the same period a year ago. Included in the net loss attributable to common stock were preferred dividends of $123 million and $33 million in the first three months of 2010 and 2009, respectively. Included in the preferred dividends of $123 million, or $0.79 per share, for the first three months of 2010 was the $94 million non-cash redemption charge described above. The diluted net loss per common share was $0.46 in the first quarter 2010, which included the non-cash redemption charge, compared to a diluted net loss per common share of $0.16 for the same period a year ago.   Full-Year 2010 Outlook   For full-year 2010, management expects the following, based on a modestly improving economic environment.   · Management expects low single-digit loan growth from period-end March 31, 2010 to period-end December 31, 2010, based on an increase in unfunded loans in the underwriting process and the timing of increasing loan demand consistent with previous post-recessionary economies. Investment securities are expected to remain at a level similar to March 31, 2010. · Based on no increase in the Federal Funds rate, management expects an average net interest margin between 3.25 percent and 3.35 percent for full-year 2010, reflecting the benefit, compared to 2009, from improved loan pricing, lower funding costs and a lower level of excess liquidity. · Management expects net credit-related charge-offs between $675 million and $725 million for full-year 2010. The provision for credit losses is expected to be consistent with net credit-related charge-offs. · Management expects flat to low single-digit decline in noninterest income compared to 2009, after excluding $243 million of 2009 net securities gains. Included in the outlook is an estimated five percent negative impact on service charge income, beginning in the third quarter 2010, from overdraft policy changes consistent with new regulations issued by the FRB. · Management expects a low single-digit decrease in noninterest expenses compared to 2009. · Management expects income tax expense to approximate 35 percent of income before income taxes less approximately $60 million of permanent differences related to low-income housing and bank-owned life insurance.   42      Table of Contents   Net Interest Income   Net interest income was $415 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010, an increase of $31 million compared to $384 million for the same period in 2009. The increase in net interest income in the first quarter 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, resulted primarily from improved loan spreads, changes in the funding mix, including a continued shift in funding sources toward lower-cost funds, and maturities of higher-cost medium- and long-term debt. The rate-volume analysis in Table I of this financial review details the components of the change in net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis for the three months ended March 31, 2010, compared to the same period in the prior year. On a FTE basis, net interest income increased $30 million to $416 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010, from $386 million for the comparable period in 2009. Average earning assets decreased $8.8 billion, or 14 percent, to $52.9 billion in the first quarter 2010, compared to the first quarter 2009, primarily due to an $8.2 billion, or 17 percent, decrease in average loans to $41.3 billion, partially offset by an increase of $2.3 billion in average interest-bearing deposits with the FRB. The net interest margin (FTE) for the three months ended March 31, 2010 increased 65 basis points to 3.18 percent, from 2.53 percent for the comparable period in 2009, primarily due to the reasons cited for the increase in net interest income discussed above. The net interest margin was reduced by approximately 24 basis points and seven basis points in the first quarter 2010 and first quarter 2009, respectively, from excess liquidity. Excess liquidity was represented by $4.1 billion and $1.8 billion of average balances deposited with the FRB in the first quarter 2010 and first quarter 2009, respectively. The excess liquidity resulted from strong core deposit growth at a time when loan demand remained weak. Refer to the “Supplemental Financial Data” section of this financial review for reconcilements of non-GAAP financial measures.   For further discussion of the effects of market rates on net interest income, refer to “Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in Part I of this financial review.   Based on no increase in the Federal Funds rate, management expects an average net interest margin between 3.25 percent and 3.35 percent for full-year 2010, reflecting the benefit, compared to 2009, from improved loan pricing, lower funding costs and a lower level of excess liquidity.   43      Table of Contents   Quarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume -

Provision for Credit Losses   The provision for credit losses includes both the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The provision for loan losses was $175 million for the first quarter 2010, compared to $203 million for the same period in 2009. The Corporation establishes this provision to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses, which is discussed under the “Credit Risk” subheading in the “Risk Management” section of this financial review. The decrease of $28 million in the provision for loan losses in the three-month period ended March 31, 2010, when compared to the same period in 2009, resulted primarily from broad-based improvements in credit quality metrics over the last two quarters.   Signs of growth in the national economy began in the second half of 2009 and have continued into 2010, as the credit and capital markets began functioning at a more normal level and the housing market started to stabilize. The Michigan economy showed signs of recovering after contracting in the first half of 2009. The average Michigan Business Activity Index compiled by the Corporation for the first two months of 2010 increased 12 percent, compared to the average for the full-year 2009, with particular strength noted in auto and steel production. The Michigan Business Activity index represents nine different measures of Michigan economic activity compiled by the Corporation. The California economy is recovering less quickly than the national economy, due in part to the state’s ongoing budget problems that are more severe than in most other states. However, the California Economic Activity Index compiled by the Corporation is signaling that a gradual recovery is underway. The February 2010 index was up 11 percent from a low reached in March 2009, despite a decline in the job growth component of the index. The California Economic Activity Index equally weights nine, seasonally-adjusted coincident indicators of real economic activity compiled by the Corporation. A wide variety of economic reports indicate that the Texas economy continued to outperform the national economy in early 2010. Forward-looking indicators suggest that economic conditions in the Corporation’s primary geographic markets are likely to strengthen gradually as moderate national and global recoveries continue to develop.   Total net credit-related charge-offs includes net charge-offs on both loans and lending-related commitments. Net loan charge-offs for the first quarter 2010 increased $16 million to $173 million, or 1.68 percent of average total loans, compared to $157 million, or 1.26 percent for the first quarter 2009. The $16 million increase in net loan charge-offs in the first quarter 2010, compared to the first quarter 2009, resulted primarily from increases in net loan charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate ($11 million) and Middle Market ($8 million) loan portfolios. The $11 million increase in net loan charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate loan portfolio was primarily due to an increase in net loan charge-offs in the Texas market, partially offset by a decline in the Western market. Although Commercial Real Estate challenges in the Western market have moderated in the first quarter 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, it remains a significant portion of the Commercial Real Estate provision for loan losses at March 31, 2010. Net loan charge-offs declined in the Global Corporate Banking and Specialty Businesses loan portfolios.   45      Table of Contents   By geographic market, net loan charge-offs increased primarily due to increases in the Texas ($17 million) and Other ($8 million) markets, partially offset by a decline in the Western market ($11 million) in the first quarter 2010, compared to the same period in 2009. Accordingly, the provision for loan losses declined in the first quarter 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to declines in the Western and Florida markets, partially offset by increases in the Texas and Other markets.   The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was a charge of $7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010, compared to a negative provision of $1 million for the same period in 2009. The Corporation establishes this provision to maintain an adequate allowance to cover probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments, which is discussed under the “Credit Risk” subheading in the “Risk Management” section of this financial review. The increase for the three month period ended March 31, 2010, when compared to the same period in 2009, resulted primarily from an increase in specific reserves related to standby letters of credit extended to customers in the Midwest market. There were no lending-related commitment charge-offs in both the first quarter 2010 and 2009.   An analysis of allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets is presented under the “Credit Risk” subheading in the “Risk Management” section of this financial review.   Management expects net credit-related charge-offs between $675 million and $725 million for full-year 2010. The provision for credit losses is expected to be consistent with net credit-related charge-offs.   Noninterest Income   Noninterest income was $194 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010, a decrease of $29 million, or 13 percent, compared to $223 million for the same period in 2009, resulting primarily from a $24 million gain in the first quarter 2009 on the termination of certain structured lease transactions and an $11 million decline in net securities gains, partially offset by a $6 million increase in deferred compensation asset returns.   In November 2009, the FRB issued a final rule under Regulation E which prohibits financial institutions from charging consumers fees for paying overdrafts on automated teller machine and one-time debit card transactions, unless a consumer consents, or opts in, to the overdraft service for those types of transactions, effective in the third quarter 2010.   Management expects flat to low single-digit decline in noninterest income in 2010 compared to 2009, after excluding $243 million of 2009 net securities gains. Included in the outlook is an estimated five percent negative impact on service charge income, beginning in the third quarter 2010, from overdraft policy changes consistent with the new regulations issued by the FRB referred to above.   Noninterest Expenses   Noninterest expenses were $404 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010, an increase of $7 million, or two percent, from $397 million for the comparable period in 2009, resulting primarily from increases in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments ($8 million) and other real estate expenses ($5 million), and nominal increases in several other expense categories, partially offset by a decrease in employee benefits expense ($11 million), resulting primarily from a decline in pension expense. Total salaries expense decreased $2 million, or one percent, in the three months ended March 31, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009. Contributing to the decline in salaries expense was a decrease of approximately 481 full-time equivalent employees, or five percent, from March 31, 2009 to March 31, 2010.   46      Table of Contents   The following table summarizes the various components of salaries and employee benefits expense.

Provision for Income Taxes   The provision for income taxes for the first quarter 2010 was a benefit of $5 million, compared to a benefit of $1 million for the same period a year ago. In the second quarter 2009, the Corporation elected to change the accounting method used to calculate interim period federal income taxes from an estimated annual effective tax rate method to a method which determines taxes based on each discrete quarter’s pre-tax income. The change in method resulted in an increase of approximately $20 million to the income tax benefit recorded in the second quarter 2009, which represented the adjustment necessary to conform the first quarter 2009 tax provision to the new methodology. Had the change in method been implemented in the first quarter 2009, the provision for income taxes would have been a benefit of $21 million. The $16 million decrease in tax benefit in the three months ended March 31, 2010 when compared to the pro-forma benefit of $21 million for the same period in the prior year reflected an increase in income before taxes in the first quarter 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, the reduction of tax interest due to anticipated refunds due from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and a $24 million non-taxable gain on the termination of certain structured lease transactions in the first quarter 2009. For further information on the change in method, refer to Note 11 of these unaudited consolidated financial statements.   Net deferred tax assets were $265 million at March 31, 2010, compared to $158 million at December 31, 2009, an increase of $107 million resulting primarily from a reduction in deferred tax liabilities due to a payment made during the first quarter 2010 and a reclassification of certain deferred tax liabilities to current, both related to structured leasing transactions. A valuation allowance is provided when it is “more-likely-than-not” that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The valuation allowance of $1 million for certain state deferred tax assets was unchanged at March 31, 2010, compared to March 31, 2009. The Corporation determined that a valuation allowance was not needed against the federal deferred tax assets. Management’s determination was based on taxable income in the carry-back period, existing taxable temporary differences and anticipated future events.   Management expects 2010 income tax expense to approximate 35 percent of income before income taxes less approximately $60 million of permanent differences related to low-income housing and bank-owned life insurance.   Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax   Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $17 million for the first three months of 2010, compared to $1 million for the same period in the prior year. The $16 million increase in the first three months of 2010, when compared to the same period in the prior year, resulted from a $17 million after-tax gain from the cash settlement of a note receivable related to the 2006 sale of an investment advisory subsidiary. For further information on the cash settlement of the note and discontinued operations, refer to Note 14 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements.   47      Table of Contents   Business Segments   The Corporation’s operations are strategically aligned into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth & Institutional Management. These business segments are differentiated based on the products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, the Finance Division is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes discontinued operations and items not directly associated with these business segments or the Finance Division. Note 13 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements presents financial results of these business segments for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009. For a description of the business activities of each business segment and the methodologies which form the basis for these results, refer to Note 13 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements and Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report.   The following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.              Three Months Ended March 31,         (dollar amounts in millions)       2010       2009         Business Bank       $   89       96   %   $   56       91   %     Retail Bank       (7   )   (8   )   (7   )   (12   )     Wealth & Institutional Management       11       12       13       21                 93       100   %   62       100   %     Finance       (59   )           (50   )             Other (a)       18               (3   )             Total       $   52               $   9                   (a) Includes discontinued operations and items not directly associated with the three major business segments or the Finance Division.   The Business Bank’s net income of $89 million increased $33 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2009. Net interest income (FTE) was $341 million, an increase of $29 million from the comparable prior year period. The increase in net interest income (FTE) was primarily due to an increase in loan and deposit spreads and a $3.7 billion increase in average deposits, partially offset by a $7.6 billion decrease in average loans. The provision for loan losses of $137 million decreased $40 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a reduction in reserves for the Global Corporate Banking (primarily the Western, Midwest and Other markets), Commercial Real Estate in the Western and Midwest markets, and Specialty Businesses (primarily the Other and Texas markets) loan portfolios, partially offset by increases in reserves for the Middle Market (primarily the Other and Western markets) and Commercial Real Estate in the Texas market loan portfolios. Net credit-related charge-offs of $137 million increased $14 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to increases in charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate and Middle Market loan portfolios, partially offset by decreases in the Specialty Businesses and Global Corporate Banking loan portfolios. Noninterest income of $76 million decreased $17 million from the comparable prior year period, primarily due to a $24 million 2009 gain on the termination of certain structured lease transactions, partially offset by increases in commercial lending fees ($4 million) and letter of credit fees ($3 million). Noninterest expenses of $162 million increased $5 million from the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increases in other real estate expenses ($6 million), the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments ($5 million), and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance expense ($3 million), partially offset by a decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense ($8 million).   The Retail Bank’s net loss was $7 million for both the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009. Net interest income (FTE) of $130 million increased $4 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in loan and deposit spreads, partially offset by decreases in both average loans ($685 million) and average deposits ($673 million). The provision for loan losses increased $8 million from the comparable period in the prior year, due to an increase in reserves for the Personal Banking loan portfolio. Noninterest income of $44 million decreased $2 million from the comparable prior year period. Noninterest expenses of $154 million decreased $7 million from the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in salaries expense.   Wealth & Institutional Management’s net income of $11 million decreased $2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2009. Net interest income (FTE) of $42 million increased $6 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a $362 million increase in average deposits and increases in loan and deposit spreads. The provision for loan losses increased $2 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in reserves for the Private Banking loan portfolio. Noninterest income of $60 million decreased $10 million from the comparable period in the prior year,    48      Table of Contents   primarily due to decreases in fiduciary income ($3 million) and brokerage fees ($3 million), and a decline in gains on the redemption of auction rate securities ($3 million). Noninterest expenses of $73 million decreased $2 million from the same period in the prior year.   The net loss for the Finance Division was $59 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010, compared to a net loss of $50 million for the three months ended March 31, 2009. Contributing to the $9 million increase in net loss was a $6 million decline in net interest income (FTE), primarily due to the Corporation’s internal funds transfer policy. In the current low-rate environment, the Finance Division provided a greater benefit for deposits, particularly noninterest-bearing deposits to the three major business segments in the first three months of 2010 than was actually realized at the corporate level. Noninterest income decreased $8 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a decline in gains from the sale of investment securities. Noninterest expenses decreased $2 million from the comparable period in the prior year.   The Other category’s net income was $18 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010, compared to a net loss of $3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2009. The $21 million increase in net income was primarily due to a $27 million discontinued operations gain ($17 million after-tax) from the cash settlement of a note receivable related to the 2006 sale of an investment advisory subsidiary.   Market Segments   The Corporation’s management accounting system also produces market segment results for the Corporation’s four primary geographic markets: Midwest, Western, Texas and Florida. In addition to the four primary geographic markets, Other Markets and International are also reported as market segments.  Note 13 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements contains a description and presents financial results of these market segments for the three months ended March 31, 2010 and 2009.   The following table presents net income (loss) by market segment.

The Midwest market’s net income decreased $3 million to $26 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2009. Net interest income (FTE) of $205 million increased $11 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in loan and deposit spreads, partially offset by a $2.9 billion decrease in average loans. The provision for loan losses decreased $2 million, as a reduction in reserves for the Commercial Real Estate and Global Corporate Banking loan portfolios were partially offset by increases in reserves for the Private Banking, Personal Banking and Middle Market loan portfolios. Net credit-related charge-offs of $55 million increased $1 million from the comparable period in the prior year. Noninterest income of $102 million decreased $25 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a $24 million first quarter 2009 gain on the termination of certain structured lease transactions. Noninterest expenses of $186 million decreased $8 million from the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense ($9 million) and smaller decreases in several other expense categories, partially offset by an increase in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments ($6 million).   The Western market recorded net income of $22 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010, compared to a net loss of $7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2009.

Noninterest income of $36 million was unchanged from the comparable period in the prior year. Noninterest expenses of $105 million increased $1 million from the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in other real estate expenses ($4 million), which was offset by a decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense ($4 million).   The Texas market’s net income decreased $1 million to $14 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2009. Net interest income (FTE) of $79 million increased $9 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in loan and deposit spreads and the benefit provided by an increase of $759 million in average deposits, partially offset by a $1.1 billion decline in average loans. The provision for loan losses increased $8 million, largely due to an increase in reserves for the Commercial Real Estate loan portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in reserves for the Specialty Businesses loan portfolio (largely Energy). Net credit-related charge-offs of $25 million increased $17 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate loan portfolio. Noninterest income of $20 million decreased $1 million from the same period in the prior year. Noninterest expenses of $60 million increased $2 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in banking center occupancy expenses.

Net interest income (FTE) of $10 million decreased $1 million from the comparable period in the prior year. The provision for loan losses decreased $12 million, to $3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010, when compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a reduction in reserves in the Middle Market and Private Banking loan portfolios. Noninterest income of $3 million was unchanged from the same period in the prior year. Noninterest expenses of $9 million increased $1 million from the same period in the prior year.   The Other Markets’ net income decreased $6 million to $16 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2009. Net interest income (FTE) of $40 million increased $1 million from the comparable period in the prior year. The provision for loan losses increased $8 million, primarily due to an increase in reserves for the Middle Market and Commercial Real Estate loan portfolios, partially offset by a reduction in reserves for the Global Corporate Banking and Specialty Businesses loan portfolios. Noninterest income of $10 million decreased $4 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a decline in gains on the redemption of auction rate securities. Noninterest expenses of $21 million were unchanged from the comparable period in the prior year.   The International market’s net income increased $5 million to $14 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2009. Net interest income (FTE) of $18 million increased $4 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in loan spreads, partially offset by a $482 million decrease in average loans. The provision for loan losses was a negative provision of $3 million for the first quarter 2010, compared to a charge of less than $0.5 million for the same period in 2009. Noninterest income of $9 million increased $1 million from the comparable period in the prior year. Noninterest expenses of $8 million were unchanged from the comparable period in the prior year.   The net loss for Finance & Other Businesses was $41 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010, compared to a net loss of $53 million for the three months ended March 31, 2009. The $12 million decline in net loss was due to the same reasons noted in the Finance Division and Other category discussions under the “Business Segments” heading above.   50      Table of Contents   The following table lists the number of the Corporation’s banking centers by market segment.

Total loans decreased $1.3 billion, or three percent, to $40.8 billion at March 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009. On an average basis, total assets decreased $877 million in the first quarter 2010, compared to the fourth quarter 2009, resulting primarily from a decrease in average total loans of $1.4 billion, or three percent, to $41.3 billion and a decrease in average investment securities available-for-sale of $1.2 billion, partially offset by an increase in average interest-bearing deposits with the FRB ($1.7 billion). The decline in average total loans reflected subdued demand from customers in a modestly recovering economic market.   As shown in the tables below, average loans declined in nearly all business lines and in all geographic markets in the first quarter 2010, compared to the fourth quarter 2009.

N/M - not meaningful   51      Table of Contents   While average loan outstandings declined in the first quarter 2010, the pace of decline continued to slow and the Corporation was encouraged by growth in unfunded loans in the underwriting process.   Management expects low single-digit loan growth from period-end March 31, 2010 to period-end December 31, 2010, based on an increase in unfunded loans in the underwriting process and the timing of increasing loan demand consistent with previous post-recessionary economies. Investment securities are expected to remain at a level similar to March 31, 2010.   Total liabilities decreased $782 million, or one percent, to $51.4 billion at March 31, 2010, from $52.2 billion at December 31, 2009. Total deposits increased $301 million, or one percent, to $40.0 billion at March 31, 2010 from December 31, 2009. Average deposits decreased $214 million in the first quarter 2010, compared to the fourth quarter 2009. Core deposits, which exclude other time deposits and foreign office time deposits, increased $664 million, or two percent, from December 31, 2009 to March 31, 2010. On an average basis, core deposits increased $494 million, or one percent, to $37.2 billion in the first quarter 2010, compared to the fourth quarter 2009. Medium- and long-term debt decreased $1.1 billion to $9.9 billion at March 31, 2010, compared to December 31, 2009, primarily as a result of the maturity of $1.0 billion of Federal Home Loan Bank advances and the redemption of $150 million of subordinated debt in the three months ended March 31, 2010.   In April 2010, the FDIC adopted an interim rule extending the Transaction Account Guarantee Program (TAGP) through December 31, 2010 for financial institutions that desire to continue TAGP participation. The Corporation has notified the FDIC of its decision to opt-out of the FDIC’s TAGP extension, effective July 1, 2010. The impact of such decision on the Corporation’s deposit levels cannot be reliably determined at this time.   Capital   Total shareholders’ equity decreased $1.3 billion to $5.7 billion at March 31, 2010, compared to December 31, 2009, resulting primarily from the first quarter 2010 full redemption of $2.25 billion of preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury, partially funded by the net proceeds from an $880 million common stock offering completed in the first quarter 2010.   Subsequent to the first quarter 2010 preferred stock redemption, the Corporation announced its election not to repurchase a related warrant for 11.5 million shares of common stock issued to the U.S. Treasury. On April 12, 2010, the U.S. Treasury announced its intention to sell such warrant pursuant to a public offering process during the second quarter 2010.   The following table presents a summary of changes in total shareholders’ equity in the three months ended March 31, 2010.              Three Months Ended         (in millions)       March 31, 2010         Balance at beginning of period               $   7,029         Retention of earnings (net income less cash dividends declared)               5         Change in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss):                         Investment securities available-for-sale       $   29                 Cash flow hedges       (1   )             Defined benefit and other postretirement plans       5                 Total change in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)               33         Issuance of common stock               849         Redemption of preferred stock               (2,250   )     Repurchase of common stock under employee stock plans               (2   )     Share-based compensation               4         Balance at end of period               $   5,668                    52      Table of Contents   In November 2007, the Board of Directors of the Corporation authorized the purchase up to 10 million shares of Comerica Incorporated outstanding common stock, in addition to the remaining unfilled portion of the November 2006 authorization. There is no expiration date for the Corporation’s share repurchase program. As shown in the following table, which summarizes the Corporation’s share repurchase activity, there were no shares purchased as part of the Corporation’s publicly announced repurchase program in the first three months of 2010.              Total Number of Shares                                         Purchased as Part of Publicly       Remaining Share       Total Number                         Announced Repurchase Plans       Repurchase       of Shares       Average Price         (shares in thousands)       or Programs       Authorization (a)       Purchased (b)       Paid Per Share         January 2010       —       12,576       38       $   35.59         February 2010       —       12,576       22       34.74         March 2010       —       12,576       —       —         Total first quarter 2010       —       12,576       60       $   35.28           (a) Maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased under the publicly announced plans or programs.

Risk-based regulatory capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in credit risk profiles among bank holding companies and to account for off-balance sheet exposure. Assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with specified risk-weighting factors. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items. As shown in the table below, the tangible common equity and Tier 1 common capital ratios increased primarily from an increase in common shareholders’ equity due to the common stock offering completed in the first quarter 2010. The Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios reflect the full redemption of preferred stock, partially offset by the common stock issuance discussed above.   The Corporation’s capital ratios exceeded minimum regulatory requirements as follows:              March 31, 2010       December 31, 2009         (dollar amounts in millions)       Capital       Ratio       Capital       Ratio         Tier 1 common (a) (b)       $   5,816       9.58   %   $   5,058       8.18   %     Tier 1 risk-based (4.00% - minimum) (b)       6,311       10.40       7,704       12.46         Total risk-based (8.00% - minimum) (b)       9,061       14.93       10,468       16.93         Leverage (3.00% - minimum) (b)       6,311       11.00       7,704       13.25         Tangible common equity (a)       5,511       9.68       4,720       7.99                         (a) See Supplemental Financial Data section for reconcilements of non-GAAP financial measures. (b) March 31, 2010 capital and ratios are estimated.   At March 31, 2010, the Corporation and its U.S. banking subsidiaries exceeded the ratios required for an institution to be considered “well capitalized” (Tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based capital and leverage ratios greater than six percent, 10 percent and five percent, respectively).   53      Table of Contents   Risk Management   The following updated information should be read in conjunction with the “Risk Management” section on pages 38-59 in the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report.   Credit Risk   Allowance for Credit Losses and Nonperforming Assets   The allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The allowance for loan losses represents management’s assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporation’s loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain loans and loan relationships, and allowances for homogeneous pools of loans with similar risk characteristics for the remaining business, consumer and residential mortgage loans. The Corporation defines business loans as those belonging to the commercial, real estate construction, commercial mortgage, lease financing and international loan portfolios.   A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that interest or principal payments will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the original loan agreement. The Corporation performs a detailed credit quality review quarterly on large impaired business and certain large impaired consumer and residential mortgage loans and establishes a specific allowance for such loans, estimated using one of several methods, including the estimated fair value of underlying collateral, observable market value of similar debt or discounted expected future cash flows.   Independent third-party appraisals are obtained prior to the origination of any first mortgage loan. “As developed” collateral values are used at the time of origination of a construction loan, on the assumption that the construction facility provides sufficient funds to complete the project and carry it until it is leased or sold. Credit reviews are performed at least annually on each collateral-dependent loan and, if necessary, adjustments to the original appraisals are made to reflect the most current risk profile of the project. These adjustments may include a revised rental rate or absorption rate, based on the actual conditions at that time. Updated independent third-party appraisals are generally obtained at the time of a refinance or restructure where additional advances are requested or when there is evidence that the physical aspects of the property have deteriorated.   For collateral-dependent impaired loans, updated appraisals are obtained at least annually unless conditions dictate increased frequency. Appraisals on impaired construction loans are generally based on “as is” collateral values. In certain circumstances, the Corporation may believe that the highest and best use of the collateral, and thus the most advantageous exit strategy requires completion of the construction project. In these situations, the Corporation uses an “as-developed” appraisal to evaluate alternatives. However, the “as-developed” collateral value is appropriately adjusted to reflect the cost to complete the construction project and to prepare the property for sale. Between appraisals the Corporation may reduce the collateral value based upon the age of the appraisal and adverse developments in market conditions.   Loans which do not meet the criteria to be evaluated individually are evaluated in homogeneous pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. The allowance for all other business loans is determined by applying standard reserve factors to the pool of business loans within each internal risk rating. Internal risk ratings are assigned to each business loan at the time of approval and are subjected to subsequent periodic reviews by the Corporation’s senior management. Standard reserve factors for the loans within each risk rating are updated quarterly and are based on estimated probabilities of default and loss given default, incorporating factors such as recent charge-off experience, current economic conditions and trends, changes in collateral values of properties securing loans, and trends with respect to past due and nonaccrual amounts. The standard reserve factors are supported by underlying analysis, including information on migration and loss given default studies from each of the three largest domestic geographic markets (Midwest, Western and Texas), as well as mapping to publicly available debt ratings. On a limited basis, the Corporation uses data annually from Standard & Poor’s (S&P) publicly available debt ratings to determine the level of probability of default for loans that are considered to have strong credit quality and are assigned the best internal risk ratings. To ensure the use of probability of default based on S&P debt ratings is appropriate, the Corporation compares the assigned internal risk ratings of borrowers that have public debt outstanding to their publicly available S&P debt rating for consistency. The Corporation has sufficient default experience and is able to generate its own probability of default metrics on the remainder of the loan portfolio. The Corporation uses its own loss given default experience to determine the overall expected loss measure.   54      Table of Contents   The allowance for all other consumer and residential mortgage loans is determined by applying estimated loss rates to various pools of loans within the portfolios with similar risk characteristics. Estimated loss rates for all pools are updated quarterly, incorporating factors such as recent charge-off experience, current economic conditions and trends, changes in collateral values of properties securing loans (using index-based estimates), and trends with respect to past due and nonaccrual amounts.   Actual losses experienced in the future may vary from those estimated. The uncertainty occurs because factors may exist which affect the determination of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and are not necessarily captured by the application of standard reserve factors or identified industry-specific risks. An additional allowance is established to capture these probable losses and reflects management’s view that the allowance should recognize the margin for error inherent in the process of estimating expected loan losses. Factors that were considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the Corporation’s allowance for loan losses included the inherent imprecision in the risk rating system resulting from inaccuracy in assigning risk ratings or stale ratings which may not have been updated for recent negative trends in particular credits. Risk ratings on business loan relationships meeting an internally specified exposure threshold are updated annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of a circumstance that affects the credit risk of the relationship.   The total allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb incurred losses inherent in the total loan portfolio. Unanticipated economic events, including political, economic and regulatory instability in countries where the Corporation has loans, could cause changes in the credit characteristics of the portfolio and result in an unanticipated increase in the allowance. Inclusion of other industry-specific portfolio exposures in the allowance, as well as significant increases in the current portfolio exposures, could also increase the amount of the allowance. Any of these events, or some combination thereof, may result in the need for additional provision for loan losses in order to maintain an allowance that complies with credit risk and accounting policies. The allowance for loan losses was $987 million at March 31, 2010, compared to $985 million at December 31, 2009, an increase of $2 million, or less than one percent. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in individual and industry reserves for the Middle Market (primarily the Midwest, Other and Western markets) loan portfolio, partially offset by declines in the Commercial Real Estate (largely the Western market) and Global Corporate Banking (primarily the International and Western markets) loan portfolios. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total period-end loans was 2.42 percent at March 31, 2010, compared to 2.34 percent at December 31, 2009. Nonperforming loans of $1.2 billion at March 31, 2010 decreased $19 million, or two percent, compared to December 31, 2009. As noted above, all large nonperforming loans are individually reviewed each quarter for potential charge-offs and reserves. Charge-offs are taken as amounts are determined to be uncollectible. A measure of the level of charge-offs already taken on nonperforming loans is the current book balance as a percentage of the contractual amount owed. Nonperforming loans were charged-off to 56 percent of the contractual amount at both March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. This level of write-downs is consistent with losses experienced on defaulted loans in the current quarter and in recent years. The allowance as a percentage of total nonperforming loans, a ratio which results from the actions noted above, was 85 percent at March 31, 2010, compared to 83 percent at December 31, 2009. The Corporation’s loan portfolio is heavily composed of business loans, which, in the event of default, are typically carried on the books at fair value as nonperforming assets for a longer period of time than are consumer loans, which are generally fully charged off when they become nonperforming, resulting in a lower nonperforming loan allowance coverage.   The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in “accrued expenses and other liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets, provides for probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments, including unused commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and financial guarantees. Allowances for lending-related commitments for which it is probable that the commitment will be drawn (or sold) are estimated using the same methods as business loans. In general, the probability of draw for letters of credit is considered certain once the credit is assigned an internal risk rating generally consistent with regulatory defined substandard or doubtful. Other letters of credit, all unfunded commitments and financial guarantees have a lower probability of draw, to which standard loan loss rates are applied.   The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $44 million at March 31, 2010, an increase of $7 million from $37 million at December 31, 2009. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in specific reserves related to standby letters of credit extended to customers in the Midwest market.   55      Table of Contents   Nonperforming assets were $1.3 billion at both March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 and are summarized in the following table.

Loans restructured in troubled debt restructurings bearing market rates of interest at the time of restructuring and performing in compliance with their modified terms (performing restructured loans) are considered impaired in the calendar year of the restructuring. At March 31, 2010, troubled debt restructurings totaled $48 million, of which $8 million were included in performing assets and $40 million were included in nonperforming assets ($23 million nonaccrual loans and $17 million reduced-rate loans).   Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest generally represent loans that are well collateralized and in a continuing process that is expected to result in repayment or restoration to current status. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing decreased $18 million, to $83 million at March 31, 2010, compared to $101 million at December 31, 2009 and are summarized in the following table. Loans past due 30-89 days decreased $66 million to $456 million at March 31, 2010, compared to $522 million at December 31, 2009.

Watch list loans that meet certain criteria are subjected to quarterly credit quality reviews and the allowance for loan losses includes a specific portion for such loans. Consistent with the decrease in total nonaccrual loans from December 31, 2009 to March 31, 2010, total watch list loans decreased.

Of the foreclosed properties with balances greater than $2 million at March 31, 2010, $41 million were in the Commercial Real Estate business line, including $18 million in the Western market. At March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, there were no foreclosed properties with a carrying value greater than $10 million.   Commercial and Residential Real Estate Lending   The Corporation limits risk inherent in its commercial real estate lending activities by limiting exposure to those borrowers directly involved in the commercial real estate markets and adhering to conservative policies on loan-to-value ratios for such loans. Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $13.6 billion at March 31, 2010, of which $4.6 billion, or 34 percent, were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to residential real estate developers. The remaining $9.0 billion, or 66 percent, of commercial real estate loans in other business lines consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans.   59      Table of Contents   The geographic distribution and project type of commercial real estate loans are important factors in diversifying credit risk within the portfolio.

However, the significant and sudden decline in residential real estate activity beginning in late 2008 in the Western, Florida and Midwest markets proved extremely difficult for many of the smaller residential real estate developers. Of the $2.7 billion of real estate construction loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line, $516 million were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2010, including single family projects totaling $215 million (largely in the Western and Florida markets) and residential land development projects totaling $121 million (largely in the Western and Texas markets). Real estate construction loan net charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $70 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010, including $23 million from single family projects (primarily the Western and Other markets), $16 million from multi-use projects (primarily the Texas market) and $14 million from residential land development projects (primarily the Texas market).   The commercial mortgage loan portfolio totaled $10.4 billion at March 31, 2010 and included $8.5 billion of primarily owner-occupied commercial mortgage loans. Commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $1.9 billion and included $105 million of nonaccrual loans at March 31, 2010, which consisted primarily of residential land carry and commercial office and land carry projects ($49 million, $25 million and $24 million, respectively), located primarily in the Western and Midwest markets. Commercial mortgage loan net charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $16 million for the three months ended March 31, 2010, primarily from multi-family and residential land carry projects ($7 million and $6 million, respectively).   Residential real estate loans, which consist of traditional residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit, totaled $3.4 billion at March 31, 2010. Residential mortgages totaled $1.6 billion at March 31, 2010, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. By geographic market, 41 percent of residential mortgage loans outstanding were in the Midwest market, 31 percent in the Western market, 15 percent in the Texas market and 13 percent in the Florida market at March 31, 2010. Of the $1.6 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $58 million were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2010. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.8 billion at March 31, 2010, of which $1.5 billion was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit and $232 million consisted of closed-end home equity loans. By geographic market, 62 percent of home equity loans outstanding were in the Midwest market, 26 percent in the Western market, nine percent in the Texas market and three percent in the Florida market at March 31, 2010. A substantial majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens.   The Corporation rarely originates residential real estate loans with a loan-to-value ratio at origination above 100 percent, has no sub-prime mortgage programs and does not originate payment-option adjustable-rate mortgages or other nontraditional mortgages that allow negative amortization. A significant majority of residential mortgage originations are sold in the secondary market. The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation’s primary geographic markets. The economic recession and significant declines in home values in the Western, Florida and Midwest markets following the financial market turmoil beginning in the fall of 2008 adversely impacted the residential real estate portfolio. At March 31, 2010, the Corporation estimated that, of the $7 million total residential mortgage loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest, less than $2 million exceeded 90 percent of the current value of the underlying collateral, based on S&P/Case-Shiller home price indices. To account for this exposure, the Corporation factors changes in home values into estimated loss ratios for residential real estate loans, using index-based estimates by major metropolitan area, resulting in an increased allowance allocated for residential real estate loans when home values decline. Additionally, to mitigate increasing credit exposure due to depreciating home values, the Corporation periodically reviews home equity lines of credit and makes line reductions or converts outstanding balances at line maturity to closed-end, amortizing loans when necessary.   Shared National Credits   Shared National Credit (SNC) loans are facilities greater than $20 million shared by three or more federally supervised financial institutions that are reviewed by regulatory authorities at the agent bank level. The Corporation generally seeks to obtain ancillary business at the origination of a SNC relationship. Loans classified as SNC loans (approximately 975 borrowers at March 31, 2010) totaled $8.3 billion at March 31, 2010, a decline of $761 million from $9.1 billion at December 31, 2009. SNC loans, diversified by both business line and geographic market, comprised approximately 20 percent of total loans at both March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. SNC loans are held to the same credit underwriting standards as the remainder of the loan portfolio and face similar credit challenges, primarily driven by residential real estate development.   61      Table of Contents   Automotive Lending   Loans to borrowers involved with automotive production totaled approximately $960 million at March 31, 2010, compared to $941 million at December 31, 2009. Loans in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $3.3 billion at both March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. Of the $3.3 billion of outstanding loans in the National Dealer Services business line at March 31, 2010, approximately $2.2 billion, or 68 percent, were to foreign franchises, $650 million, or 20 percent, were to domestic franchises and $416 million, or 12 percent, were to other. Other dealer loans include obligations where a primary franchise was indeterminable, such as loans to large public dealership consolidators and rental car, leasing, heavy truck and recreation vehicle companies.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   Interest Rate Risk   Net interest income is the predominant source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises primarily through the Corporation’s core business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits. The Corporation’s balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating rate commercial loans funded by a combination of core deposits and wholesale borrowings. This creates a natural imbalance between the floating-rate loan portfolio and the more slowly repricing deposit products. The result is that growth and/or contraction in the Corporation’s core businesses will lead to sensitivity to interest rate movements without mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing investment securities, primarily fixed-rate, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, and hedging the sensitivity with interest rate swaps. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk, with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.   The Corporation frequently evaluates net interest income under various balance sheet and interest rate scenarios, looking at both 12 and 24 month time horizons, using simulation modeling analysis as its principal risk management evaluation technique. The results of these analyses provide the information needed to assess the balance sheet structure. Changes in economic activity, whether domestic or international, different from those management included in its simulation analyses could translate into a materially different interest rate environment than currently expected. Management evaluates a base case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment and what is believed to be the most likely balance sheet structure. This base case net interest income is then evaluated against non-parallel interest rate scenarios that gradually increase and decrease rates approximately 200 basis points in a linear fashion from the base case over twelve months (but decrease to no lower than zero percent). Due to the low level of interest rates, both the March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 analyses reflect a declining interest rate scenario of a 25 basis point drop, to zero percent, while the rising interest rate scenario reflects a gradual 200 basis point rise. In addition, consistent with each interest rate scenario, adjustments to asset prepayment levels, yield curves, and overall balance sheet mix and growth assumptions are made. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model may not precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rate, market conditions and management strategies, among other factors. However, the model can indicate the likely direction of change. Existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes are included in these analyses, but no additional hedging is forecasted.   The table below, as of March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above. The change in interest rate sensitivity from December 31, 2009 to March 31, 2010 was primarily driven by changes in anticipated loan growth as well as changes in the funding mix, including the first quarter 2010 full redemption of $2.25 billion of preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury.

The economic value of equity analysis begins with an estimate of the mark-to-market valuation of the Corporation’s balance sheet and then applies the estimated impact of rate movements to the market value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments. The economic value of equity is then calculated as the difference between the estimated market value of assets and liabilities net of the impact of off-balance sheet instruments. As with net interest income shocks, a variety of alternative scenarios are performed to measure the impact on economic value of equity, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve.   The table below, as of March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from a 200 basis point immediate parallel increase or decrease in interest rates (but decrease to no lower than zero percent). Similar to the simulation analysis above, due to the low level of interest rates, both the March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009 economic value of equity analyses below reflect an interest rate scenario of an immediate 25 basis point drop, to zero percent, while the rising interest rate scenario reflects an immediate 200 basis point rise. The change in the sensitivity of the economic value of equity to a 200 basis point parallel increase in rates between December 31, 2009 and March 31, 2010 was primarily driven by changes in the Corporation’s mortgage-backed securities portfolio mix, with recent purchases at lower underlying coupons, putting the securities portfolio closer to the current market and reducing balance sheet sensitivity to rising rates.

At March 31, 2010, the Corporation held excess liquidity, represented by $4.1 billion deposited with the FRB. The Corporation may access the purchased funds market when necessary, which includes certificates of deposit issued to institutional investors in denominations in excess of $100,000 and to retail customers in denominations of less than $100,000 through brokers (“other time deposits” on the consolidated balance sheets), foreign office time deposits and short-term borrowings. Purchased funds totaled $1.7 billion at March 31, 2010, compared to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2009. Capacity for incremental purchased funds at March 31, 2010, consisted largely of federal funds purchased, brokered certificates of deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. In addition, the Corporation is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, Texas (FHLB), which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. The actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. As of March 31, 2010, the Corporation had $5.0 billion of outstanding borrowings from the FHLB with remaining maturities ranging from 6 months to 5 years. Another source of funding, if needed, would be liquid assets, which totaled $8.0 billion at March 31, 2010, compared to $7.7 billion at December 31, 2009, including cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell, interest-bearing deposits with the FRB and other banks, other short-term investments and unencumbered investment securities available-for-sale. Additionally, the Corporation could issue up to $12.8 billion of debt at March 31, 2010 under an existing $15 billion medium-term senior note program which allows its principal banking subsidiary to issue debt with maturities between one and 30 years.   Other Market Risks   Certain components of the Corporation’s noninterest income, primarily fiduciary income, are at risk to fluctuations in the market values of underlying assets, particularly equity and debt securities. Other components of noninterest income, primarily brokerage fees, are at risk to changes in the volume of market activity.   At March 31, 2010, the Corporation had a $57 million portfolio of investments in indirect private equity and venture capital funds, with commitments of $26 million to fund additional investments in future periods. The value of these investments is at risk to changes in equity markets, general economic conditions and a variety of other factors. The majority of these investments are not readily marketable and are included in “accrued income and other assets” on the consolidated balance sheets. The investments are individually reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value.   For further discussion of market risk, see Note 5 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements and pages 52-59 in the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report.   63      Table of Contents   Critical Accounting Policies   The Corporation’s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report, as updated in Note 1 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation’s future financial condition and results of operations. The most critical of these significant accounting policies are the policies related to allowance for credit losses, valuation methodologies, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies are reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages 60-65 in the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report. As of the date of this report, the Corporation does not believe that there has been a material change in the nature or categories of the critical accounting policies or estimates and assumptions from those discussed in the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report.   64      Table of Contents   Supplemental Financial Data   The following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this financial review with financial measures defined by GAAP.

The Tier 1 common capital ratio removes preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations. The tangible common equity ratio removes preferred stock and the effect of intangible assets from capital and the effect of intangible assets from total assets. The Corporation believes these measurements are meaningful measures of capital adequacy used by investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and to compare against other companies in the industry.   65      Table of Contents   The net interest margin (FTE), excluding excess liquidity, removes interest earned on balances deposited with the FRB from net interest income (FTE) and average balances deposited with the FRB from average earning assets from the numerator and denominator of the net interest margin (FTE) ratio, respectively. The Corporation believes this measurement provides meaningful information to investors, regulators, management and others of the impact on net interest income and net interest margin resulting from the Corporation’s short-term investment in low yielding instruments.   ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures   (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Corporation maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Corporation’s management, including the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to evaluate the effectiveness of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report (the “Evaluation Date”). Based on the evaluation, the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.   (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. During the period to which this report relates, there have not been any changes in the Corporation’s internal controls over financial reporting procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, such controls.   66      Table of Contents   PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings   For information regarding the Corporation’s legal proceedings, see “Part I. Item 1. Note 12 — Contingent Liabilities,” which is incorporated herein by reference.   ITEM 1A. Risk Factors   Other than as set forth below, there has been no material change in the Corporation’s risk factors as previously disclosed in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 in response to Part I, Item 1A. of such Form 10-K. Such risk factors are incorporated herein by reference.   Below we amend the following risk factors discussed in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009:   · Recently enacted legislation, actions recently taken by or proposed by the United States Department of Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Bank or other governmental entities, and legislation enacted in the future subject the Corporation to increased regulation, and the impact and expiration of such legislation and regulatory actions may adversely affect the Corporation.   On October 3, 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the “EESA”) was signed into law. Pursuant to the EESA, the U.S. Treasury was granted the authority to take a range of actions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial markets and has proposed several programs, including the purchase by the U.S. Treasury of certain troubled assets from financial institutions and the direct purchase by the U.S. Treasury of equity of financial institutions. Pursuant to the EESA, the U.S. Treasury has the authority to, among other things, purchase up to $700 billion of mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial markets. In connection therewith, the U.S. Treasury introduced the Capital Purchase Program, under which it has purchased approximately $196 billion of preferred stock in eligible institutions, including the Corporation, to increase the flow of financing to U.S. businesses and consumers and to support the U.S. economy. On March 17, 2010, the Corporation fully redeemed the preferred stock previously issued to the U.S. Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program. The EESA also temporarily raised the limit on federal deposit insurance coverage provided by the FDIC from $100,000 to $250,000 per depositor.   On May 20, 2009, the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009, which extended the temporary increase in the standard maximum deposit insurance amount provided by the FDIC to $250,000 per depositor through December 31, 2013, was signed into law. This extension of the temporary $250,000 coverage limit (pursuant to the EESA) became effective immediately upon the President’s signature. The legislation provides that the standard maximum deposit insurance amount provided by the FDIC will return to $100,000 on January 1, 2014.   On October 14, 2008, the FDIC announced the development of a guarantee program under the systemic risk exception to the Federal Deposit Act. As a result of this regulatory initiative, the FDIC implemented the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (“TLGP”) to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system. The TLGP is comprised of the Debt Guarantee Program (“DGP”) and the Transaction Account Guarantee Program (“TAGP”). The DGP guaranteed all newly issued senior unsecured debt (e.g., promissory notes, unsubordinated unsecured notes and commercial paper) up to prescribed limits issued by participating entities beginning on October 14, 2008 and continued through October 31, 2009. For eligible debt issued by that date, the FDIC will provide the guarantee coverage until the earlier of the maturity date of the debt or December 31, 2012 (or June 30, 2012 for debt issued prior to April 1, 2009). As of March 31, 2010, the Corporation had no senior unsecured debt outstanding under the DGP. The TAGP offers full guarantee for noninterest-bearing transaction accounts held at FDIC-insured depository institutions. The unlimited deposit coverage was voluntary for eligible institutions and was in addition to the $250,000 FDIC deposit insurance per account that was included as part of the EESA and the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act, respectively. The limits are presently scheduled to return to $100,000 on January 1, 2014. The TAGP coverage became effective on October 14, 2008 and will continue for the Corporation until June 30, 2010. In April 2010, the FDIC adopted an interim rule extending the TAGP through December 31, 2010 for financial institutions that desire to continue TAGP participation. The Corporation has notified the FDIC of its decision to opt-out of the FDIC’s TAGP extension, effective July 1, 2010. The impact of such decision on the Corporation’s deposit levels cannot be reliably determined at this time.   67      Table of Contents   During the second quarter of 2009, the FDIC levied an industry-wide special assessment charge on insured financial institutions as part of the agency’s efforts to rebuild DIF. In November 2009, the FDIC amended regulations that required insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly risk-based assessments for the fourth quarter of 2009 and for all of 2010-2012. The prepaid assessments will be applied against future quarterly assessments (as they may be so revised) until the prepaid assessment is exhausted or the balance of the prepayment is returned, whichever occurs first. The FDIC is not precluded from changing assessment rates or from further revising the risk-based assessment system during the prepayment period or thereafter. Thus, we may also be required to pay significantly higher FDIC insurance assessments premiums in the future because market developments significantly depleted DIF and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits.   The programs and regulations established or to be established under the EESA and Capital Purchase Program may have adverse effects upon the Corporation. It may face increased regulation of the financial services industry. Compliance with such regulation may increase the Corporation’s costs and limit its ability to pursue business opportunities. Also, participation in specific programs may subject the Corporation to additional restrictions. For example, due to the Corporation’s participation in the Capital Purchase Program, the Corporation issued a warrant to purchase 11,479,592 million of its common shares at an exercise price of $29.40 per share. The potential dilutive impact of the warrant may have an adverse effect on the market price of its common stock. On March 17, 2010, the Corporation fully redeemed the preferred stock previously issued to the U.S. Treasury under the Capital Purchase Program; however, the Corporation elected to not repurchase the warrant. On April 12, 2010, the U.S. Treasury announced its intention to sell such warrant pursuant to a public offering process during the second quarter 2010. The Corporation’s participation in the TAGP will require the payment of additional insurance premiums to the FDIC through June 30, 2010, in addition to the FDIC’s regular and special assessments. The affects of such recently enacted legislation and regulatory actions on the Corporation cannot reliably be determined at this time. Moreover, as some of the legislation and regulatory actions previously implemented in response to the recent financial crisis expire, the impact of the conclusion of these programs on the financial sector and on the economic recovery is unknown. Any delay in the economic recovery or a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could adversely affect the Corporation.   Recently, the Federal Reserve adopted amendments to its Regulation E that will be effective on July 1, 2010. The changes will affect the circumstances when the Corporation will be able to charge its clients overdraft fees.   On January 14, 2010, the current administration announced a proposal to impose a fee (the “Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee”) on those financial institutions that benefited from recent actions taken by the U.S. government to stabilize the financial system. If implemented as initially proposed, the Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee will be applied to firms with over $50 billion in consolidated assets, and, therefore, by its terms would apply to the Corporation. The Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee, if implemented as proposed by the current administration, would go into effect on June 30, 2010 and remain in place for at least ten years.   In addition, there have been a number of recent legislative and regulatory proposals that could have an impact on the operations of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. We can neither predict when or whether regulatory or legislative reforms will be enacted nor what their contents will be. The impact of any future legislation or regulatory actions on the Corporation’s businesses or operations cannot be reliably determined at this time, and such impact may adversely affect The Corporation.   · Management’s ability to retain key officers and employees may change.   The Corporation’s future operating results depend substantially upon the continued service of its executive officers and key personnel. The Corporation’s future operating results also depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain qualified management, financial, technical, marketing, sales and support personnel. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and the Corporation cannot ensure success in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. The Corporation’s ability to retain key officers and employees may be further impacted by legislation and regulation affecting the financial services industry. There may be only a limited number of persons with the requisite skills to serve in these positions, and it may be increasingly difficult for the Corporation to hire personnel over time. The Corporation’s business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of its key employees, or the Corporation’s inability to attract and retain skilled employees.   68      Table of Contents   ITEM 2.
