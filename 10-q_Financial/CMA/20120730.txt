The increase in net income in the three months ended June 30, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, reflected a $44 million increase in net interest income, a $26 million decrease in the provision for credit losses and a $9 million increase in noninterest income, partially offset by increases of $22 million  in noninterest expenses and $9 million in the provision for income taxes. Net income per diluted common share was $0.73 in the three months ended June 30, 2012, compared to $0.53 for the same period one year ago.Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2012 was $274 million, an increase of $75 million from $199 million reported for the six months ended June 30, 2011. The increase in net income in the six months ended June 30, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, reflected a $92 million increase in net interest income, a $50 million decrease in the provision for credit losses and an $8 million increase in noninterest income, offset by increases of $53 million in noninterest expenses and $22 million in the provision for income taxes. Net income per diluted common share was $1.39 in the six months ended June 30, 2012, compared to $1.10 for the same period one year ago. Results for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 include the impact of operations of the former Sterling Bancshares, Inc. (Sterling), acquired by the Corporation on July 28, 2011.Full-Year 2012 Outlook Compared to Full-Year 2011For full-year 2012, management expects the following, compared to full-year 2011, assuming a continuation of the current economic environment.•Average loans increasing 5 percent to 6 percent. •Net interest income increasing 3 percent to 5 percent. •Net credit-related charge-offs and provision for credit losses declining.•Noninterest income increasing 1 percent to 2 percent. •Noninterest expenses increasing or decreasing 1 percent.•Effective tax rate of approximately 26 percent.Net Interest IncomeNet interest income was $435 million for the three months ended June 30, 2012, an increase of $44 million compared to $391 million for the same period in 2011. The increase in net interest income in the second quarter 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, resulted primarily from a $6.5 billion increase in average earning assets, partially offset by a 4 basis point decrease in the net interest margin. The increase in net interest income in the second quarter 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, reflected the benefit from increases in average loans ($36 million) and investment securities ($15 million), accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio ($18 million) and lower deposit rates ($7 million), partially offset by decreased yields on loans ($16 million) and mortgage-backed investment securities ($15 million). The "Quarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent" table of this financial review details the components of the change in net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis for the three months ended June 30, 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year. Average earning assets increased $6.5 billion, or 13 percent, to $56.7 billion for the second quarter 2012, compared to the second quarter 2011, in part due to the acquisition of Sterling and reflected increases of $4.1 billion in average loans and $2.3 billion in average investment securities available-for-sale. The net interest margin (FTE) for the three months ended June 30, 2012 decreased 4 basis points to 3.10 percent, from 3.14 percent for the comparable period in 2011, primarily from decreased yields on loans and mortgage-backed investment securities, partially offset by the benefit from accretion of the purchase discount on the Sterling acquired loan portfolio and lower deposit costs. The lower loan yields reflected a shift in the average loan portfolio mix, largely due to a decrease in average commercial real estate loans and an increase in lower yielding, higher credit quality average commercial loans. Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio increased the net interest margin by 13 basis points in the second quarter 2012. At June 30, 2012, $60 million of purchase discounts remained on acquired loans not deemed credit impaired at acquisition. Net interest income was $878 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012, an increase of $92 million compared to $786 million for the same period in 2011. The increase in net interest income in the six months ended June 30, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, resulted primarily from a $6.7 billion increase in average earning assets and one more day in the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, partially offset by a 5 basis point decrease in the net interest margin. The increase in net interest income in the six months ended June 30, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, reflected the benefit from increases in average loans ($58 million) and investment securities ($34 million), accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio ($43 million), lower deposit rates ($12 million) and one more day in the six months ended June 30, 2012 ($5 million), partially offset by decreased yields on loans ($27 million) and mortgage-backed investment securities ($27 million). The "Year-to-Date Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent" table of this financial review details the components of the change in net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis for the six months ended June 30, 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year. Average earning assets increased $6.7 billion, or 13 percent, to $56.4 billion for 41Table of Contentsthe six months ended June 30, 2012, compared to $49.7 billion for the same period in the prior year, in part due to the acquisition of Sterling and reflected increases of $3.4 billion in average loans, $2.4 billion in average investment securities available-for-sale and $825 million in average interest-bearing deposits with banks. The net interest margin (FTE) for the six months ended June 30, 2012 decreased 5 basis points to 3.14 percent, from 3.19 percent for the comparable period in 2011, primarily due to the same reasons cited in the quarterly discussion above and the impact of higher excess liquidity levels from deposit growth. Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio increased the net interest margin by 15 basis points in the six months ended June 30, 2012, and excess liquidity reduced the net interest margin by approximately 20 basis points and 18 basis points in the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Excess liquidity was represented by $3.6 billion and $2.8 billion of average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) in the first six months of 2012 and 2011, respectively, included in “interest-bearing deposits with banks” on the consolidated balance sheets.

The Corporation performs a detailed credit quality review quarterly to determine the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments and records provisions for each based on the results. For further discussion of both allowances, refer to the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.The provision for loan losses was $8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2012, compared to $47 million for the three months ended June 30, 2011, and was $31 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012, compared to $96 million for the six months ended June 30, 2011. The decreases of $39 million and $65 million in the provision for loan losses in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2011, resulted primarily from continued improvements in credit quality, in part reflecting improvements in the U.S. economy, as discussed below. Improvements in credit quality included a decline of $992 million, to $3.8 billion, in the Corporation's internal watch list loans from June 30, 2011 to June 30, 2012. The Corporation's internal watch list is generally consistent with loans in the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful categories defined by regulatory authorities. Reflected in the decline in watch list loans was a decrease in nonaccrual loans of $222 million from June 30, 2011 to June 30, 2012. Net loan charge-offs decreased $45 million and $101 million in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year.Net loan charge-offs for the second quarter 2012 were $45 million, or 0.42 percent of average total loans, a decrease of $45 million compared to $90 million, or 0.92 percent, for the second quarter 2011. The $45 million decrease in net loan charge-offs in the second quarter 2012, compared to the second quarter 2011, primarily reflected decreases in Middle Market ($29 million) and Small Business Banking ($11 million). By geographic market, the decrease in net loan charge-offs in the second quarter 2012 compared to the second quarter 2011, primarily reflected decreases in the Midwest ($27 million) and Western ($14 million) markets.Net loan charge-offs for the first six months of 2012 decreased $101 million to $90 million, or 0.42 percent of average total loans, compared to $191 million, or 0.97 percent, for the same period in 2011. The $101 million decrease in net loan charge-offs in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, primarily reflected decreases in Middle Market ($78 million), Small Business Banking ($19 million) and Global Corporate Banking ($11 million), partially offset by an increase in Leasing ($10 million). By geographic market, net loan charge-offs decreased in all markets in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011.The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $11 million for the three months ended June 30, 2012, compared to a benefit of $2 million for the comparable period in the prior year, and was a provision of $10 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012, compared to a benefit of $5 million for the comparable period in the prior year. The increases of $13 million and $15 million in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2011, resulted primarily from the establishment of specific reserves in the second quarter 2012 for set aside/bonded stop loss commitments related to residential real estate construction credits in the Western Market and from increased reserves on a standby letter of credit related to a single credit in the Florida market. The Corporation establishes this provision to maintain an appropriate allowance to cover probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments, which is discussed under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review. The Corporation recorded a purchase discount for lending-related commitments acquired from Sterling. 46Table of ContentsNo provision for credit losses was recorded for Sterling lending-related commitments during the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 since the remaining purchase discount exceeded the required allowance. Lending-related commitment charge-offs were insignificant in the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011.The U.S. economy grew at a slow-to-moderate pace through the first half of 2012, showing signs of further slowing through the second quarter. Real gross domestic product (GDP) for the first quarter of 2012 grew at a 1.9 percent annualized rate and is expected to grow at a rate of about 1.7 percent for the second quarter of 2012. The unemployment rate increased slightly from 8.1 percent in April 2012 to 8.2 percent in May 2012, and remained at that level in June 2012. Payroll job growth slowed noticeably in March 2012 to 143,000, after averaging 252,000 new jobs per month from December 2011 through February 2012. Recent payroll job growth data was well below the rate needed for a self-sustaining expansion. The ISM Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing Indexes both decreased slightly in June 2012. The ISM Manufacturing Index fell below 50 in June 2012, indicating a contracting manufacturing sector for the first time since July 2009. The ISM Non-Manufacturing Index declined but remained in positive territory, indicating ongoing expansion, but at a slower rate, for that broad sector of the economy. Automobile sales flattened in the first half of 2012 after growing through 2011. Inflation indicators moderated through the second quarter of 2012 as energy prices fell. Upward pressure on prices is still seen in apartment rental rates and most recently in food prices, due to the expected poor corn harvest. Real GDP is expected to grow at near 2 percent for the second half of 2012. Recession in the Eurozone and slower economic growth in Asia are key risk factors for the U.S. economy for the remainder of the year. Sizeable tax increases and cuts to federal spending, together known as the "Fiscal Cliff," are significant economic risk factors for the first half of 2013. Momentum in the Texas economy remained strong through the first half of 2012. Labor market conditions continued to improve, the energy sector was very active, and residential construction activity increased. A key risk to the Texas economy for the second half of 2012 is lower energy prices. The economy of California remains hindered by a depressed housing market and challenging fiscal conditions. Some parts of the California economy are strong, notably the high tech industries of Silicon Valley. Michigan's economy is being buoyed by a rebounding U.S. automotive industry, however, there is downside risk to Michigan if auto demand eases. An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets is presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.Noninterest IncomeNoninterest income was $211 million for the three months ended June 30, 2012, an increase of $9 million compared to $202 million for the same period in 2011. Service charges on deposit accounts increased $2 million, in part due to the acquisition of Sterling. Commercial lending fees increased $3 million, due primarily to an increase in syndication agent fees, reflecting a higher volume of activity in the three months ended June 30, 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year. Card fees decreased $3 million in the three months ended June 30, 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year, reflecting the impact of regulatory limits on debit card transaction processing fees implemented in the fourth quarter 2011. Net securities gains increased $2 million, primarily from an increase in gains from redemptions of auction-rate securities. Other noninterest income increased $5 million in the three months ended June 30, 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting a $5 million annual incentive bonus received for the first time in the second quarter 2012 from the Corporation's third party credit card provider and a $6 million increase in customer derivative income, partially offset by decreases of $4 million in deferred compensation asset returns and $2 million in income from principal investing and warrants, primarily due to one-time gains recognized in the second quarter 2011. The decrease in deferred compensation asset returns in noninterest income is offset by a decrease in deferred compensation plan expense in noninterest expenses.Noninterest income was $417 million for the first six months of 2012, an increase of $8 million compared to $409 million for the same period in 2011. Service charges on deposit accounts increased $6 million, commercial lending fees increased $7 million, card fees decreased $7 million and net securities gains increased $5 million, all primarily due to the same reasons cited in the quarterly discussion above. Other noninterest income decreased $3 million in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting decreases of $6 million in net income from principal investing and warrants, primarily due to one-time gains recognized in the first six months of 2011, and $5 million in deferred compensation asset returns, partially offset by a $5 million annual incentive bonus received for the first time in the second quarter 2012 from the Corporation's third party credit card provider and an increase of $3 million in customer derivative income.47Table of ContentsThe following table illustrates certain categories included in "other noninterest income" on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

Income earned on these assets is reported in noninterest income and the offsetting increase in liability is reported in salaries expense.Noninterest ExpensesNoninterest expenses were $433 million for the three months ended June 30, 2012, an increase of $22 million compared to $411 million for the same period in 2011. Salaries expense increased $4 million, primarily due to the acquisition of Sterling and annual merit increases, partially offset by a decrease in deferred compensation plan expense. Employee benefits expense increased $11 million, primarily reflecting increased pension expense and the addition of Sterling. Other real estate expense decreased $6 million in the three months ended June 30, 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting an increase in net gains recognized on the sale of foreclosed property. Other noninterest expenses increased $9 million in the three months ended June 30, 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a $7 million increase in litigation-related expenses resulting primarily from developments on certain litigation claims.Noninterest expenses were $882 million for the first six months of 2012, an increase of $53 million compared to $829 million for the comparable period in 2011. Salaries expense increased $17 million and employee benefits expense increased $21 million, primarily for the same reasons cited in the quarterly discussion above. FDIC insurance expense decreased $7 million in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, primarily due to the implementation of changes to the deposit insurance assessment system in the second quarter 2011. Other real estate expense decreased $10 million in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting decreased write-downs and losses on sales of foreclosed property. Other noninterest expenses increased $21 million in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a $17 million increase in litigation-related expenses resulting primarily from the same reasons cited in the quarterly discussion above. Included in noninterest expenses for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2012 and 2011 were merger and restructuring charges of $8 million and $5 million, respectively. Under the restructuring plan, approximately $30 million of expenses remain, substantially all of which is expected to be incurred in the third quarter 2012.Provision for Income Taxes and Tax-Related ItemsThe provision for income taxes for the three months ended June 30, 2012 was $50 million, an increase of $9 million compared to $41 million for the same period in 2011. The increase in the provision for income taxes in the three months ended June 30, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, was due primarily to an increase in income before income taxes during the same period. In addition, the provision for income taxes for the three months ended June 30, 2011 included net after-tax charges of $8 million for various tax items.The provision for income taxes for the first six months of 2012 was $98 million, compared to $76 million for the same period in 2011. The $22 million increase in the provision for income taxes in the first six months of 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, was due primarily to the same reasons cited in the quarterly discussion above.Net deferred tax assets were $282 million at June 30, 2012, compared to $395 million at December 31, 2011, a decrease of $113 million, resulting primarily from the utilization of tax credits, accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio, a decrease in the allowance for loan losses, reversals of deferred tax assets related to expired stock options and an increase in net unrealized gains recognized in other comprehensive income. Deferred tax assets were evaluated for realization and it was determined that no valuation allowance was needed at both June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011. This conclusion was based on available evidence of loss carryback capacity, projected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and assumptions made regarding future events.48Table of ContentsBusiness SegmentsThe Corporation's operations are strategically aligned into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based upon the products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, the Finance Division is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes items not directly associated with these business segments or the Finance Division. The performance of the business segments in not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Note 14 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements presents financial results of these business segments for the six months ended June 30, 2012 and 2011. For a description of the business activities of each business segment and the methodologies which form the basis for these results, refer to Note 14 to these unaudited financial statements and Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation's 2011 Annual Report.The following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.

Net interest income (FTE) of $764 million increased $82 million in the six months ended June 30, 2012, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the benefit provided by an increase of $3.3 billion in average loans, accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired Sterling loan portfolio of $27 million and one more day in the six months ended June 30, 2012, an increase in net funds transfer pricing (FTP) funding credits, primarily due to the benefit provided by an increase of $3.8 billion in average deposits, lower deposit rates and one more day in 2012, partially offset by lower loan yields. The provision for credit losses of $14 million decreased $3 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting a decrease in Middle Market, partially offset by increases in Commercial Real Estate, Leasing and National Dealer Services. Net credit-related charge-offs of $54 million decreased $72 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in net charge-offs in Middle Market. Noninterest income of $164 million increased $8 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to an $8 million increase in commercial lending fees and small increases in several other noninterest income categories, partially offset by a $5 million decrease in warrant income.

Net credit-related charge-offs of $21 million decreased $25 million from the comparable period in the prior year, with broad-based decreases across all major markets and business lines. Noninterest income of $90 million increased $3 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a $5 million annual incentive bonus received in the second quarter 2012 from Comerica's third party credit card provider, a $5 million increase in service charges on deposit accounts and smaller increases in several other noninterest income categories, partially offset by a $10 million decrease in card fees. Noninterest expenses of $361 million increased $36 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to increases in salaries and benefit expense ($16 million), processing charges ($8 million), core deposit intangible amortization ($4 million) and small increases in several other noninterest expense categories, partially offset by a decrease in FDIC insurance expense ($3 million). The increase 49Table of Contentsin salaries and benefit expense was primarily due to the addition of Sterling.

The Finance Division pays the three major business segments for the long-term value of deposits based on their assumed lives. The three major business segments pay the Finance Division for funding based on the pricing and term characteristics of their loans. The increase in net interest expense (FTE) was primarily due to an increase in average deposits in the three major business segments and a decrease in average loans in the Wealth Management business segment. Noninterest income of $30 million decreased $1 million and noninterest expenses of $6 million remained unchanged from the comparable period in the prior year. The benefit for income taxes (FTE) of $111 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012 increased $15 million, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily resulting from an increase in losses before income taxes.The net loss in the Other category of $19 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012 increased $16 million from the comparable period in the prior year. The increase in net loss primarily reflected a $27 million increase in noninterest expenses, partially offset by a decrease of $13 million in the provision for income taxes (FTE). The increase in noninterest expenses primarily reflected increases in litigation and legal expenses as well as merger and restructuring charges. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was primarily due to an increase in losses before income taxes.Market SegmentsMarket segment results are provided for the Corporation's four primary geographic markets: Midwest, Western, Texas and Florida.

The capital plan provides for up to $375 million in equity repurchases for the five-quarter period ending March 31, 2013. The capital plan further contemplated a 50 percent increase in the quarterly dividend, from 10 cents per share to 15 cents per share, which was approved by the Board of Directors on April 24, 2012. In addition, the capital plan included the authority to redeem the remaining $25 million of trust preferred securities outstanding as of March 31, 2012, which were redeemed effective June 15, 2012. In November 2010, the Board of Directors of the Corporation authorized the repurchase of up to 12.6 million shares of Comerica Incorporated outstanding common stock and authorized the purchase of up to all 11.5 million of the Corporation's original outstanding warrants.

Assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with specified risk-weighting factors. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items. As shown in the table below, the Tier 1 common capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital ratios decreased from December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2012, while the leverage and tangible common equity ratios remained unchanged in the same period. 54Table of ContentsThe Corporation's capital ratios exceeded minimum regulatory requirements as follows: June 30, 2012 December 31, 2011(dollar amounts in millions)Capital Ratio Capital RatioTier 1 common (a) (b)$6,676 10.32% $6,557 10.37%Tier 1 risk-based (4.00% - minimum) (b)6,676 10.32 6,582 10.41Total risk-based (8.00% - minimum) (b)8,938 13.82 9,015 14.25Leverage (3.00% - minimum) (b)6,676 10.92 6,582 10.92Tangible common equity (a)6,365 10.27 6,201 10.27(a)See Supplemental Financial Data section for reconcilements of non-GAAP financial measures.(b)June 30, 2012 capital and ratios are estimated.In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee) issued a framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation (Basel III). In June 2012, U.S. banking regulators issued proposed rules for the U.S. adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework. The proposed regulatory framework includes a more conservative definition of capital, two new capital buffers - a conservation buffer and a countercyclical buffer, new and more stringent risk weight categories for assets and off-balance sheet items, and a supplemental leverage ratio. Rules are expected to be implemented between 2013 and 2019.According to the proposed rules, the Corporation will be subject to the capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses. However, the rules as proposed would not subject the Corporation to the capital countercyclical buffer of up to 2.5 percent or the supplemental leverage ratio. The Corporation currently estimates that its June 30, 2012 capital ratios would be in compliance with the fully phased-in Basel III capital rules as proposed. Under the proposed rules, the Corporation estimates the June 30, 2012 Tier 1 risk-based ratio would be 90 basis points to 100 basis points lower than the ratio calculated under the existing rules, as presented in the table above. The Basel III liquidity framework, which was not included in the June 2012 proposed rules, includes two minimum liquidity measures. The Liquidity Coverage Ratio requires a financial institution to hold a buffer of high-quality, liquid assets to fully cover net cash outflows under a 30-day systematic liquidity stress scenario. The Net Stable Funding Ratio requires the amount of available longer-term, stable sources of funding to be at least 100 percent of the required amount of longer-term stable funding over a one-year period. The Corporation's liquidity position is strong, but if subject to the Basel III liquidity framework as currently proposed, the Corporation may decide to consider additional liquidity management initiatives. While uncertainty exists in both the final form of the U.S. rules implementing the Basel III liquidity framework and whether or not the Corporation will be subject to the full requirements, the Corporation is closely monitoring the development of the rules. We expect to meet the final requirements adopted by U.S. banking regulators within regulatory timelines.55Table of ContentsRisk ManagementThe following updated information should be read in conjunction with the "Risk Management" section on pages F-23 through F-42 in the Corporation's 2011 Annual Report.Credit RiskAllowance for Credit Losses and Nonperforming AssetsThe allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The allowance for loan losses represents management's assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporation's loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in "accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets, provides for probable losses inherent in lending-related commitments, including unused commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.The Corporation disaggregates the loan portfolio into segments for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses. These segments are based on the level at which the Corporation develops, documents and applies a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The Corporation's portfolio segments are business loans and retail loans. Business loans are defined as those belonging to the commercial, real estate construction, commercial mortgage, lease financing and international loan portfolios. Retail loans consist of traditional residential mortgage, home equity and other consumer loans.The allowance for loan losses includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain loans, and allowances for homogeneous pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. In the first quarter 2012, the Corporation implemented enhancements to the methodology used for determining the allowance for loan losses for business loans. The enhancements included expanding the historical borrower rating migration and loss experience periods and estimating probability of default and loss given default from a national perspective, in addition to a market-by-market basis.The allowance for loan losses was $667 million at June 30, 2012, compared to $726 million at December 31, 2011, a decrease of $59 million, or 8 percent. The decrease resulted primarily from improvements in credit quality, partially offset by increased loan volumes and an increase in the allowance for loan losses resulting from the methodology enhancements described above. Improvements in credit quality included a decline of $632 million in the Corporation's internal watch list loans from December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2012, a decrease in the inflow to nonaccrual (based on an analysis of nonaccrual loans with balances greater than $2 million) of $183 million and a decrease in net credit-related charge-offs of $101 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2011. The $59 million decrease in the allowance for loan losses primarily reflected decreases in Commercial Real Estate, Middle Market and Small Business Banking. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total period-end loans was 1.52 percent at June 30, 2012, compared to 1.70 percent at December 31, 2011. Nonperforming loans of $747 million at June 30, 2012 decreased $140 million, compared to December 31, 2011. Loan charge-offs are taken as amounts are determined to be uncollectible. A measure of the level of charge-offs already taken on nonaccrual loans is the current book balance as a percentage of the contractual amount owed. At both June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, nonaccrual loans were charged-off to approximately 60 percent of the contractual amount. This level of write-downs is consistent with losses experienced on loan defaults in the first six months of 2012 and in recent years. The allowance as a percentage of total nonperforming loans was 89 percent at June 30, 2012, compared to 82 percent at December 31, 2011. The Corporation's loan portfolio is primarily composed of business loans, which, in the event of default, are typically carried on the books at fair value as nonperforming assets for a longer period of time than are consumer loans, which are generally fully charged off when they become nonperforming, resulting in a lower nonperforming loan allowance coverage when compared to banking organizations with higher concentrations of consumer loans.Loans acquired from Sterling were initially recorded at fair value, which included an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans, and therefore no corresponding allowance for loan losses was recorded for these loans at acquisition. Methods utilized to estimate the required allowance for loan losses for acquired loans not deemed credit-impaired at acquisition are similar to originated loans; however, the estimate of loss is based on the unpaid principal balance less the remaining purchase discount. At June 30, 2012, $60 million of purchase discount remained, compared to $96 million of purchase discounts at December 31, 2011. Purchased credit impaired (PCI) loans are not considered nonperforming loans.The total allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb incurred losses inherent in the total loan portfolio. Unanticipated economic events, including political, economic and regulatory instability could cause changes in the credit characteristics of the portfolio and result in an unanticipated increase in the allowance. Inclusion of other industry-specific portfolio exposures in the allowance, as well as significant increases in the current portfolio exposures, could also increase the amount of the allowance. Any of these events, or some combination thereof, may result in the need for additional provision for loan losses in order to maintain an allowance that complies with credit risk and accounting policies. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain letters of credit in a manner consistent with business loans, and allowances based on the pool of the remaining letters of credit and all unused commitments to extend credit within each internal risk rating.56Table of ContentsThe allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $36 million at June 30, 2012, an increase of $10 million from $26 million at December 31, 2011. The $10 million increase in the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments resulted primarily from the establishment of specific reserves in the second quarter 2012 for set aside/bonded stop loss commitments related to residential real estate construction credits in the Western Market and from increased reserves on a standby letter of credit related to a single credit in the Florida market. An allowance for credit losses will be recorded on Sterling lending-related commitments only to the extent that the required allowance exceeds the remaining purchase discount. At both June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, no allowance was recorded for Sterling lending-related commitments and $3 million of purchase discount for lending-related commitments acquired from Sterling remained.Nonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, troubled debt restructured loans (TDRs) which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans) and real estate which has been acquired through foreclosure and is awaiting disposition (foreclosed property). Nonperforming assets do not include PCI loans. Nonperforming assets decreased $167 million to $814 million at June 30, 2012, from $981 million at December 31, 2011.

Of the transfers to nonaccrual in the second quarter 2012, $35 million were from Middle Market, $10 million were from Private Banking and $2 million were from Global Corporate Banking. There was one borrower with a balance greater than $10 million, totaling $18 million, transferred to nonaccrual in the second quarter 2012. 58Table of ContentsThe following table presents a summary of nonaccrual loans at June 30, 2012 and loans transferred to nonaccrual and net loan charge-offs for the three months ended June 30, 2012, based primarily on Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) industry categories.

The primary driver of when the principal amount of a business loan should be fully or partially charged off is based on a qualitative assessment of the recoverability of the principal amount from collateral and other cash flow sources. In the second quarter 2012, the Corporation modified its residential mortgage and home equity nonaccrual policy. Under the new policy, residential mortgage and home equity loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status once they become 90 days past due (previously no later than 180 days past due) and are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell no later than 180 days past due. In addition, certain current junior lien home equity loans in which the Corporation holds and services the senior position are placed on nonaccrual status when full collection of the senior position is in doubt. The changes in policy resulted in increases of $14 million and $5 million of nonaccrual residential mortgage and home equity loans, respectively, at June 30, 2012. Other consumer loans are generally not placed on nonaccrual status and are charged off at no later than 120 days past due. Loan amounts in excess of probable future cash collections are charged off to an amount that management ultimately expects to collect. At the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, interest previously accrued but not collected is charged against current income. Income on such loans is then recognized only to the extent that cash is received and the future collection of principal is probable. Generally, a loan may be returned to accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest have been received and the Corporation expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest, generally based on a period of sustained payment performance, normally at least six months, or when the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection. Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation's 2011 Annual Report for further information regarding impaired loans.  At June 30, 2012, TDRs totaled $312 million, of which $216 million were nonperforming ($188 million nonaccrual TDRs and $28 million reduced-rate TDRs) and $96 million were considered performing. Performing TDRs included $61 million of commercial loans (primarily in Middle Market, Global Corporate Banking and Private Banking) and $35 million of commercial mortgage loans (primarily in Middle Market and National Dealer Services) at June 30, 2012. At December 31, 2011, TDRs totaled $331 million, including $206 million nonaccrual TDRs, $27 million reduced-rate TDRs and $98 million TDRs considered performing. The $19 million decrease in total TDR's was the result of payment and payoff activity, as well as loan sales, and primarily reflected decreases in Commercial Real Estate, Middle Market and Technology and Life Sciences, partially offset by increases in Global Corporate Banking and Private Banking.59Table of ContentsLoans past due 30-89 days decreased $5 million to $270 million at June 30, 2012, compared to $275 million at December 31, 2011. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest generally represent loans that are well collateralized and in a continuing process of collection. Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing are summarized in the following table. The decrease in residential mortgage and consumer loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest from December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2012 in the table below was primarily due to the change in nonaccrual policy discussed above.(in millions)June 30, 2012 December 31, 2011Business loans:   Commercial$11 $8Real estate construction— 1Commercial mortgage26 32Total business loans37 41Retail loans:   Residential mortgage— 6Consumer6 11Total retail loans6 17Total loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing$43 $58The following table presents a summary of total internal watch list loans.

Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $11.2 billion at June 30, 2012, of which $3.3 billion, or 30 percent, were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to residential real estate investors and developers. The remaining $7.9 billion, or 70 percent, of commercial real estate loans in other business lines consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans. The real estate construction loan portfolio totaled $1.4 billion at June 30, 2012. The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-time customers with satisfactory completion experience. Of the $991 million of real estate construction loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line, $60 million were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2012. Real estate construction loan charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012.The commercial mortgage loan portfolio totaled $9.8 billion at June 30, 2012 and included $2.3 billion in the Commercial Real Estate business line and $7.5 billion in other business lines. Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Of the $2.3 billion of commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line, $155 million were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2012. Commercial mortgage loan charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $29 million for the six months ended June 30, 2012. 61Table of ContentsThe geographic distribution and project type of commercial real estate loans are important factors in diversifying credit risk within the portfolio.

Residential mortgages totaled $1.5 billion at June 30, 2012, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.5 billion of residential 62Table of Contentsmortgage loans outstanding, $76 million were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2012. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.6 billion at June 30, 2012, of which $1.4 billion was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit and $175 million consisted of closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.6 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $16 million were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2012. A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at June 30, 2012. The Corporation rarely originates residential real estate loans with loan-to-value ratios above 100 percent at origination, has no sub-prime mortgage programs and does not originate payment-option adjustable-rate mortgages or other nontraditional mortgages that allow negative amortization. A significant majority of residential mortgage originations are sold in the secondary market. Since 2008, the Corporation has used a third party to originate, document and underwrite residential mortgage loans on behalf of the Corporation. Under this arrangement, the third party assumes repurchase liability for the loans it originates. The Corporation has repurchase liability exposure for residential mortgage loans originated prior to 2008, however based on historical experience, the Corporation believes such exposure, which could be triggered by underwriting discrepancies, is minimal. The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation's primary geographic markets. The economic recession and significant declines in home values in the Western, Florida and Midwest markets following the financial market turmoil beginning in the fall of 2008 adversely impacted the residential real estate portfolio. At June 30, 2012, all residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more were placed on nonaccrual status. Such loans are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell no later than 180 days past due. In addition, effective second quarter 2012, certain current junior lien home equity loans in which the Corporation holds and services the senior position are placed on nonaccrual status when full collection of the senior position is in doubt. Shared National CreditsShared National Credit (SNC) loans are facilities greater than $20 million shared by three or more federally supervised financial institutions that are reviewed annually by regulatory authorities at the agent bank level. The Corporation generally seeks to obtain ancillary business at the origination of a SNC relationship. Loans classified as SNC loans (approximately 900 borrowers at June 30, 2012) totaled $9.2 billion at June 30, 2012, compared to $8.4 billion at December 31, 2011. SNC net loan charge-offs totaled $4 million and $18 million for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2012, respectively, compared to $13 million and $14 million for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011. SNC loans, diversified by both business line and geographic market, comprised approximately 21 percent and 20 percent of total loans at June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively. SNC loans are held to the same credit underwriting and pricing standards as the remainder of the loan portfolio. Energy LendingThe Corporation has a portfolio of energy-related loans that are included primarily in "commercial loans" in the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation has over 30 years of experience in energy lending, with a focus on middle market companies. Average loans in the Energy business line for the three months ended June 30, 2012 were $2.5 billion, or 6 percent of total average loans, compared to $1.9 billion, or 5 percent of total average loans, for the three months ended December 31, 2011. Approximately 80 percent of the Energy portfolio is secured. Energy loans are diverse in nature, with outstanding balances by customer market segment distributed approximately as follows: 60 percent Exploration and Production (comprised of approximately 40 percent natural gas, 30 percent oil and 30 percent mixed), 20 percent Midstream and 20 percent Energy Services.Automotive LendingSubstantially all dealer loans are in the National Dealer Services business line. Loans in the National Dealer Services business line include floor plan financing and other loans to automotive dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in “commercial loans” in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $2.4 billion at June 30, 2012, an increase of $584 million compared to $1.8 billion at December 31, 2011, primarily reflecting the resumption of seasonal inventory patterns in the industry that were prevalent before the economic crises and Japanese earthquake and tsunami impacts of recent years. At June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $2.0 billion, including $1.4 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans, and $1.9 billion, including $1.4 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans, respectively. Automotive lending also includes loans to borrowers involved with automotive production, primarily Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers. Loans to borrowers involved with automotive production totaled approximately $1.1 billion at June 30, 2012, compared to $931 million at December 31, 2011.63Table of ContentsState and Local MunicipalitiesIn the normal course of business, the Corporation serves the needs of state and local municipalities in multiple capacities, including traditional banking products such as deposit services, loans and letters of credit, investment banking services such as bond underwriting and private placements, and by investing in municipal securities. The following table summarizes the Corporation's direct exposure to state and local municipalities as of June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011.

Additionally, the Corporation is exposed to Automated Clearing House (ACH) transaction risk for those municipalities utilizing this electronic payment and/or deposit method and similar products in their cash flow management. The Corporation sets limits on ACH activity during the underwriting process.Extensions of credit to state and local municipalities are subjected to the same underwriting standards as other business loans. At June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, all outstanding municipal loans and leases were performing according to contractual terms and none were included in the Corporation's internal watch list. Municipal leases are secured by the underlying equipment, and a substantial majority of the leases are fully defeased with AAA-rated U.S. government securities. Substantially all municipal investment securities available-for sale are auction-rate securities. All auction-rate securities are reviewed quarterly for other-than-temporary impairment. All auction-rate municipal securities were rated investment grade, and all auction-rate preferred securities collateralized by municipal securities were rated AAA or the equivalent and were adequately collateralized at both June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011. Municipal securities are held in the trading account for resale to customers. In addition, Comerica Securities, a broker-dealer subsidiary of Comerica Bank, underwrites bonds issued by municipalities. All bonds underwritten by Comerica Securities are sold to third party investors. 64Table of ContentsEuropean ExposureThe Corporation does not hold any sovereign exposure to Europe. The Corporation's international strategy as it pertains to Europe is to focus on European corporations doing business in North America, with an emphasis on the major geographic markets.

Interest rate risk arises primarily through the Corporation's core business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by a combination of core deposits and wholesale borrowings. Approximately 85 percent of the Corporation's loans were floating at June 30, 2012, of which approximately 75 percent were based on LIBOR and 25 percent were based on Prime. This creates a natural imbalance between the floating-rate loan portfolio and the more slowly repricing deposit products. The result is that growth and/or contraction in the Corporation's core businesses may lead to sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing investment securities, primarily fixed-rate, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, and hedging the sensitivity with interest rate swaps. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk, with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.65Table of ContentsThe Corporation frequently evaluates net interest income under various balance sheet and interest rate scenarios, looking at a 12-month time horizon, using simulation modeling analysis as its principal risk management evaluation technique. The results of this analysis provides the information needed to assess the balance sheet structure. Changes in economic activity, whether domestic or international, different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis could translate into a materially different interest rate environment than currently expected. Management evaluates a base case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment and what is believed to be the most likely balance sheet structure. This base case net interest income is then evaluated against non-parallel interest rate scenarios that increase and decrease 200 basis points in a linear fashion from the base case over 12 months, resulting in an average change in interest rates of 100 basis points over the period. Due to the current low level of interest rates, the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of a 25 basis point drop, to zero percent. In addition, consistent with each interest rate scenario, adjustments to asset prepayment levels, yield curves, and overall balance sheet mix and growth assumptions are made. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model may not precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income. Additionally, the estimated impact on net interest income over the 12-month time horizon is generally not linear relative to other time horizons. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions and management strategies, among other factors. However, the model can indicate the likely direction of change. Existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes are included in the analysis, but no additional hedging is forecasted. The table below, as of June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above. The sensitivity from December 31, 2011 to June 30, 2012 increased primarily due to growth in core deposits, though risk to declining interest rates is limited by the current low level of rates.

The economic value of equity analysis begins with an estimate of the economic value of the financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments on the Corporation's balance sheet, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period. Next, the estimated impact of rate movements is applied to the economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments. The economic value of equity is then calculated as the difference between the estimated market value of assets and liabilities net of the impact of off-balance sheet instruments. As with net interest income simulation analysis, a variety of alternative scenarios are performed to measure the impact on economic value of equity, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve.The table below, as of June 30, 2012 and December 31, 2011, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from a 200 basis point immediate parallel increase or decrease in interest rates. Similar to the simulation analysis above, due to the current low level of interest rates, the economic value of equity analyses below reflect an interest rate scenario of an immediate 25 basis point drop, to zero percent, while the rising interest rate scenario reflects an immediate 200 basis point rise. The change in the sensitivity of the economic value of equity to a 200 basis point parallel increase in rates between December 31, 2011 and June 30, 2012 was primarily driven by changes in market interest rates, increases in noninterest-bearing and lower cost deposits, and forecasted prepayments on the Corporation's mortgage-backed securities portfolio.

Liquid assets, which totaled $11.3 billion at June 30, 2012, compared to $11.2 billion at December 31, 2011, provide a reservoir of liquidity. Liquid assets include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits with banks, other short-term investments and unencumbered investment securities available-for-sale. At June 30, 2012, the Corporation held excess liquidity, represented by $3.0 billion deposited with the FRB, compared to $2.5 billion at December 31, 2011.The Corporation may access the purchased funds market when necessary, which includes foreign office time deposits and short-term borrowings. Capacity for incremental purchased funds at June 30, 2012 included the ability to purchase federal 66Table of Contentsfunds, sell securities under agreements to repurchase, as well as issue deposits to institutional investors and issue certificates of deposit through brokers. Purchased funds totaled $459 million at June 30, 2012, compared to $418 million at December 31, 2011. The Corporation is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, Texas (FHLB), which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. The actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. As of June 30, 2012, the Corporation had $2.0 billion of outstanding borrowings from the FHLB with remaining maturities ranging from May 2013 to May 2014. Additionally, the Bank had the ability to issue up to $15.0 billion of debt at June 30, 2012 under an existing $15 billion medium-term senior note program which allows the issuance of debt with maturities between three months and 30 years. The Corporation also maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and/or equity securities. The ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise funds at competitive rates is impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings of the Corporation and the Bank. As of June 30, 2012, the four major rating agencies had assigned the following ratings to long-term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.June 30, 2012Comerica Incorporated Comerica BankStandard and Poor’sA- AMoody’s Investors ServiceA3 A2Fitch RatingsA ADBRSA A (High)Other Market RisksMarket risk related to the Corporation's trading instruments is not significant, as trading activities are limited. Certain components of the Corporation's noninterest income, primarily fiduciary income, are at risk to fluctuations in the market values of underlying assets, particularly equity and debt securities. Other components of noninterest income, primarily brokerage fees, are at risk to changes in the volume of market activity. At June 30, 2012 , the Corporation had a $14 million portfolio of investments in indirect private equity and venture capital funds, with commitments of $8 million to fund additional investments in future periods, compared to a portfolio of $15 million, with commitments of $9 million, at December 31, 2011. The value of these investments is at risk to changes in equity markets, general economic conditions and a variety of other factors. The majority of these investments are not readily marketable and are included in “accrued income and other assets” on the consolidated balance sheets. The investments are individually reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value.For further discussion of market risk, see Note 6 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements and pages F-36 through F-41 in the Corporation's 2011 Annual Report.Critical Accounting PoliciesThe Corporation’s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation’s 2011 Annual Report. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation’s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2011, the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to the allowance for credit losses, valuation methodologies, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages F-43 through F-48 in the Corporation’s 2011 Annual Report.The following is the critical accounting policy for goodwill reflecting the results of the most recent impairment test performed in the first quarter 2012. As of the date of this report, the Corporation does not believe there are any other material changes in the nature or categories of the critical accounting policies or estimates and assumptions from those discussed in the Corporation’s 2011 Annual Report.GoodwillGoodwill is the value attributed to unidentifiable intangible elements in acquired businesses. Goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level, equivalent to a business segment or one level below. The Corporation has three reporting units: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. At June 30, 2012, March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $635 million, including $380 million allocated to the Business Bank, $194 million allocated to the Retail Bank and $61 million allocated to Wealth Management. 67Table of ContentsThe Corporation performs its annual evaluation of goodwill impairment in the third quarter of each year and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests suggest additional testing may be warranted to determine if goodwill might be impaired. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step test. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of identified reporting units with their carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. Estimating the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process involving the use of estimates and judgments related to the selection of inputs such as future cash flows, discount rates, comparable public company multiples, applicable control premiums and economic expectations used in determining the interest rate environment. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are determined using a blend of two commonly used valuation techniques: the market approach and the income approach. For the market approach, valuations of reporting units consider a combination of earnings, equity and other multiples from companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit. Since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of noncontrolling interests, the valuations accordingly incorporate a control premium. For the income approach, estimated future cash flows and terminal value are discounted. Estimated future cash flows are derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for each reporting unit. The applicable discount rate is based on the imputed cost of equity capital appropriate for each reporting unit, which incorporates the risk-free rate of return, the level of non-diversified risk associated with companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit (beta), an entity-specific risk premium and a market equity risk premium. In January 2012, the Federal Reserve announced their expectation for the Federal Funds target rate to remain at currently low levels through late 2014. Given the potential for a continued low interest rate environment, the Corporation determined that an interim goodwill impairment test should be performed in the first quarter 2012. As part of the impairment analysis, the Corporation incorporated the Federal Reserve's expectation of the low Federal Fund target rate level through 2014 in its forecasts. In the first quarter 2012, the Corporation engaged an independent valuation specialist to review its valuation models and assumptions. Based on the results of this review and in light of the current rate environment, the Corporation updated its assumptions, discount factors and control premiums. The updated assumptions included maintaining the low Federal funds target rate through the end of 2014. For the years after 2014, the Corporation developed rate assumptions based on the expectation of modest increases in the Federal Funds target rate, eventually reaching a normal interest rate environment. Increases to the fair value of the reporting units were in part a result of the improvement in the stock price of the Corporation as well as the stock prices of the guideline companies used in the market approach. The first step of the interim goodwill impairment test performed in the first quarter 2012 indicated that the estimated fair values of each of the reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values, including goodwill. The fair value of the Retail Bank exceeded the carrying value by 14 percent. The results of the goodwill impairment test for each reporting unit were subjected to stress testing as appropriate. Economic conditions impact the assumptions related to interest and growth rates, loss rates and imputed cost of equity capital. The fair value estimates for each reporting unit incorporated current economic and market conditions, including the recent Federal Reserve announcement and the impact of legislative and regulatory changes, to the extent known and as described above. However, further weakening in the economic environment, such as adverse changes in interest rates, a decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below their carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Additionally, new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management's expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Any impairment charge would not affect the Corporation's regulatory capital ratios, tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position.68Table of ContentsSupplemental Financial DataThe following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this financial review with financial measures defined by GAAP.(dollar amounts in millions)June 30, 2012 December 31, 2011Tier 1 Common Capital Ratio:   Tier 1 capital (a) (b)$6,676 $6,582Less:   Trust preferred securities— 25Tier 1 common capital (b)$6,676 $6,557Risk-weighted assets (a) (b)$64,691 $63,244Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio (b)10.32% 10.41%Tier 1 common capital ratio (b)10.32 10.37Tangible Common Equity Ratio:   Common shareholders' equity$7,028 $6,868Less:   Goodwill635 635Other intangible assets28 32Tangible common equity$6,365 $6,201Total assets$62,650 $61,008Less:   Goodwill635 635Other intangible assets28 32Tangible assets$61,987 $60,341Common equity ratio11.22% 11.26%Tangible common equity ratio10.27 10.27Tangible Common Equity per Share of Common Stock:   Common shareholders' equity$7,028 $6,868Tangible common equity6,365 6,201Shares of common stock outstanding (in millions)194 197Common shareholders' equity per share of common stock$36.18 $34.80Tangible common equity per share of common stock32.76 31.42(a)Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as defined by regulation.(b)June 30, 2012 Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets are estimated.The Tier 1 common capital ratio removes qualifying trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations.
