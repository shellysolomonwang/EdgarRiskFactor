The increase in net income in the third quarter 2010 compared to the same period in 2009, was primarily due to a $197 million decrease in the provision for credit losses ($189 million decrease in the provision for loan losses and a $8 million decrease in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments) and a $19 million increase in net interest income, partially offset by decreases of $107 million in net securities gains and $8 million in service charges on deposit accounts and an increase of $16 million in salaries expense. Net income attributable to common shares was $59 million for the third quarter 2010, compared to a net loss attributable to common shares of $16 million for the same period one year ago. There were no preferred stock dividends included in net income attributable to common shares for the three months ended September 30, 2010, compared to $34 million of preferred stock dividends included in the net loss attributable to common shares for the same period one year ago. Diluted net income per common share was $0.33 in the third quarter 2010, compared to a diluted net loss per common share of $0.10 for the same period one year ago.   Net income for the nine months ended 2010 was $181 million, an increase of $135 million from $46 million reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. The increase in net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 from the comparable 2009 period resulted primarily from a $399 million decrease in the provision for credit losses ($403 million decrease in the provision for loan losses, partially offset by a $4 million increase in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments), a $70 million increase in net interest income, a decrease of $28 million in FDIC insurance expense, and a $17 million after-tax gain recognized in “income from discontinued operations” in the first quarter 2010. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $230 million in net securities gains and $13 million in service charges on deposit accounts. The nine-month period ended September 30, 2009 included a reduction of accrued tax interest as a result of offsetting anticipated refunds against estimated amounts due to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and a $24 million non-taxable gain on the termination of certain leveraged leases which, in addition to the impact of the increase in pre-tax income, resulted in a $114 million increase in the provision for income taxes in the nine months ended September 30, 2010, compared to the comparable 2009 period. After preferred dividends of $123 million, net income attributable to common shares was $58 million for the first nine months of 2010, compared to a net loss attributable to common shares of $56 million, after preferred dividends of $101 million, in the same period one year ago. Diluted net income per common share, which included a $94 million charge related to the redemption of preferred stock, discussed in the “Capital” section of this financial review, was $0.34 for the first nine months of 2010, compared to a diluted net loss per common share of $0.37 for the comparable 2009 period.   Fourth Quarter 2010 Outlook   For the fourth quarter 2010, management expects:   · Average earning assets of approximately $48 billion in the fourth quarter 2010, largely reflecting a decline in average excess liquidity from $3.0 billion in the third quarter 2010 to approximately $1 billion in the fourth quarter 2010. Excess liquidity is expected to decline primarily due to debt maturities and the redemption of the trust preferred securities. · An average net interest margin between 3.30 percent and 3.35 percent primarily based on a decline in excess liquidity. · Fourth quarter 2010 net credit-related charge-offs similar to third quarter 2010. The provision for credit losses is expected to be below net credit-related charge-offs. · A low single-digit decline in noninterest income compared to the third quarter 2010. Included in the outlook is the incremental negative impact of overdraft policy changes implemented in the third quarter 2010 in response to new regulations issued by the Federal Reserve. Market-related fees are expected to be lower as customers remain cautious in a sluggish and still uncertain economic environment. · A low single-digit increase in noninterest expenses compared to the third quarter 2010. Included in the outlook is an estimated $5 million negative impact reflecting accelerated accretion of the remaining original issuance discount on the redemption of trust preferred securities.   42      Table of Contents   Net Interest Income   Net interest income was $404 million for the three months ended September 30, 2010, an increase of $19 million compared to $385 million for the same period in 2009. The increase in net interest income in the third quarter 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, resulted primarily from changes in the funding mix, including a continued shift in funding sources toward lower-cost funds, maturities of higher-cost medium and long-term debt and improved loan spreads. The “Quarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume — Fully Taxable Equivalent” table of this financial review details the components of the change in net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent (FTE) basis for the three months ended September 30, 2010, compared to the same period in the prior year. On a FTE basis, net interest income increased $18 million to $405 million for the three months ended September 30, 2010, from $387 million for the comparable period in 2009. Average earning assets decreased $7.3 billion, or 13 percent, to $50.2 billion in the third quarter 2010, compared to $57.5 billion in the third quarter 2009, due to decreases of $4.7 billion, or 10 percent, in average loans, $2.2 billion, or 24 percent, in average investment securities available-for-sale, and $491 million, or 14 percent, in average interest-bearing deposits with banks. The net interest margin (FTE) for the three months ended September 30, 2010 increased 55 basis points to 3.23 percent, from 2.68 percent for the comparable period in 2009, primarily due to the reasons cited for the increase in net interest income discussed above. The net interest margin was reduced by approximately 19 basis points and 16 basis points in the third quarters of 2010 and 2009, respectively, from excess liquidity. Excess liquidity was represented by $3.0 billion and $3.5 billion of average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB), included in interest-bearing deposits with banks in the consolidated balance sheets, in the third quarters of 2010 and 2009, respectively.   Net interest income was $1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, an increase of $70 million compared to the same period in 2009. The increase in net interest income in the nine months ended 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, was primarily due to the same reasons cited in the quarterly discussion above. The “Year-to-date Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume — Fully Taxable Equivalent” table provides an analysis of net interest income for the first nine months of 2010 on a FTE basis, compared to the same period in the prior year. On a FTE basis, net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 was $1.2 billion, an increase of $68 million compared the same period in 2009. Average earning assets decreased $7.9 billion, or 13 percent, to $51.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, compared to the same period in the prior year, due to a $6.6 billion, or 14 percent, decrease in average loans, to $40.7 billion, and a $2.5 billion decrease in average investment securities available-for-sale, partially offset by an increase of $1.2 billion in average interest-bearing deposits with banks. The net interest margin (FTE) for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 increased 58 basis points to 3.23 percent, from 2.65 percent for the same period in 2009, primarily due to the same reasons cited in the quarterly discussion above. The impact of excess liquidity, as defined above, was a reduction of approximately 22 basis points and 10 basis points to the net interest margin (FTE) for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

For further discussion of the effects of market rates on net interest income, refer to the “Market Risk” section of this financial review.   For the fourth quarter 2010, management expects an average net interest margin between 3.30 percent and 3.35 percent primarily based on a decline in excess liquidity.   43      Table of Contents   Quarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume -

Excess liquidity, represented by average balances deposited with the FRB, reduced the net interest margin by 22 basis points and 10 basis points year-to-date in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Excluding excess liquidity, the net interest margin would have been 3.45% and 2.75% in each respective period.

Provision for Credit Losses   The provision for credit losses includes both the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The provision for loan losses was $122 million for the third quarter 2010, compared to $311 million for the same period in 2009. The provision for loan losses for the first nine months of 2010 was $423 million, compared to $826 million for the same period in 2009. The Corporation establishes this provision to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses, which is discussed under the “Credit Risk” subheading in the “Risk Management” section of this financial review. The decreases of $189 million and $403 million in the provision for loan losses in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010, respectively, when compared to the same periods in 2009, resulted primarily from improvements in credit quality. Improvements in credit quality included a decline of $1.6 billion in the Corporation’s watch list loans — generally consistent with regulatory defined special mention, substandard and doubtful (nonaccrual) loans — from December 31, 2009 to September 30, 2010, compared to an increase of $2.5 billion in the same period in 2009. Additional indicators of improved credit quality included decreases in the inflow to nonaccrual (based on an analysis of nonaccrual loans with book balances greater than $2 million) of $67 million and $285 million and decreases in net credit-related charge-offs of $107 million and $193 million in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year.   The national economy was recovering moderately from mid 2009 until the middle of the second quarter 2010, when economic indicators began showing signs of weaker growth. The initial recovery was spurred by the revival of credit and capital markets and massive monetary and budget stimuli. In early 2010, the private sector began to take the lead as reflected in renewed growth in private payrolls and notable strength in the manufacturing sector. The Michigan economy showed signs of recovering somewhat more slowly than the nation with strength concentrated in manufacturing. The average Michigan Business Activity Index for the first eight months of 2010 increased 14 percent from the average for full-year 2009. The Michigan Business Activity index represents nine different measures of economic activity compiled by the Corporation. The California economy also appears to be lagging the national recovery. California nonfarm payrolls through August were rising at an annual rate of less than one percent, and homebuilding and consumer spending were weak. The average California Economic Activity Index compiled by the Corporation for the first eight months of 2010 increased three percent from the average for full-year 2009. The California Economic Activity Index equally weights nine, seasonally-adjusted, coincident measures of economic activity. Texas continued to outperform the national economy in 2010, with notable strength in manufacturing and energy exploration. Reflecting the broadening recovery in Texas, nonfarm payrolls increased at a two percent annual rate over the first eight months of the year, compared to slightly below one percent increase nationally. Forward-looking indicators suggest that economic conditions in the Corporation’s primary geographic markets are likely to continue to strengthen gradually against a background of moderate national and global expansions.   47      Table of Contents   Total net credit-related charge-offs include net charge-offs on both loans and lending-related commitments. Net loan charge-offs for the third quarter 2010 decreased $107 million to $132 million, or 1.32 percent of average total loans, compared to $239 million, or 2.14 percent for the third quarter 2009. The decrease in net loan charge-offs in the third quarter 2010, compared to the third quarter 2009, reflected decreases in net loan charge-offs in nearly all business lines. Decreases in net loan charge-offs included the Commercial Real Estate ($32 million), Middle Market ($32 million), Global Corporate Banking ($23 million) and Small Business Banking ($12 million) business lines. The $32 million decrease in net loan charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line primarily reflected a decrease in the Western market. By geographic market, net loan charge-offs decreased in all markets in the third quarter 2010, compared to the same period in 2009.   Net loan charge-offs for the first nine months of 2010 were $451 million, compared to $644 million for the same period in 2009. The $193 million decrease in net loan charge-offs for the first nine months of 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, consisted primarily of decreases in net loan charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate ($93 million), Specialty Businesses ($42 million), Global Corporate Banking ($40 million) and Small Business Banking ($22 million) business lines, partially offset by an increase in the Private Banking ($8 million) business line. The Specialty Businesses business line includes Energy Lending, Leasing, Technology and Life Sciences, Mortgage Banker Finance, Entertainment Lending and the Financial Services Division. The $93 million decrease in net loan charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line reflected decreases in all markets, with the exception of Texas. By geographic market, net loan charge-offs decreased in all markets for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009.   The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was a negative provision of $6 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2010, compared to a provision of $2 million for the comparable period in 2009. The decrease for the three-month period ended September 30, 2010, when compared to the same period in 2009, resulted primarily from improved credit quality in unfunded commitments in the Midwest market. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was a provision of $1 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2010, compared to a negative provision of $3 million for the comparable period in 2009. The increase for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010, when compared to the same period in 2009, resulted primarily from an increase in reserves on standby letters of credit in both the Midwest and Western markets. The Corporation establishes this provision to maintain an adequate allowance to cover probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments, which is discussed under the “Credit Risk” subheading in the “Risk Management” section of this financial review. There were less than $0.5 million in lending-related commitment charge-offs in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010 and 2009.   An analysis of allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets is presented under the “Credit Risk” subheading in the “Risk Management” section of this financial review.   Management expects fourth quarter 2010 net credit-related charge-offs similar to third quarter 2010. The provision for credit losses is expected to be below net credit-related charge-offs.   Noninterest Income   Noninterest income was $186 million for the three months ended September 30, 2010, a decrease of $129 million, or 41 percent, compared to $315 million for the same period in 2009, resulting primarily from declines of $107 million in net securities gains and $8 million in service charges on deposit accounts, and a $7 million third quarter 2009 gain on the repurchase of debt. Net securities gains in the third quarter 2009 included $102 million of gains on the sale of mortgage-backed government agency securities.   Noninterest income was $574 million for the first nine months of 2010, a decrease of $262 million, or 31 percent, compared to the same period in 2009, primarily due to decreases of $230 million in net securities gains, $13 million in service charges on deposit accounts, $8 million in fiduciary income and $6 million in brokerage fees, partially offset by increases of $8 million in commercial lending fees, $6 million in letter of credit fees and $6 million in card fees. The first nine months of 2009 also included $8 million of net gains from the termination of certain leveraged leases and a $7 million gain on the repurchase of debt. Net securities gains in the first nine months of 2009 included $220 million of gains on the sale of mortgage-backed government agency securities.   For the fourth quarter 2010, management expects a low single-digit decline in noninterest income compared to the third quarter 2010. Included in the outlook is the incremental negative impact of overdraft policy changes implemented in the third quarter 2010 in response to new regulations issued by the Federal Reserve. Market-related fees are expected to be lower as customers remain cautious in a sluggish and still uncertain economic environment.   48      Table of Contents   Noninterest Expenses   Noninterest expenses of $402 million for the three months ended September 30, 2010, increased only $3 million, or one percent, from $399 million for the comparable period in 2009. The increase in noninterest expenses was primarily due to an increase in salaries expense ($16 million) reflecting annual merit increases and increased share-based compensation expense due to third quarter 2010 stock grants, partially offset by decreases in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments ($8 million) and employee benefits expense ($4 million). The number of full-time equivalent employees declined by approximately 300, or three percent, from September 30, 2009 to September 30, 2010.   Noninterest expenses decreased $22 million, or 2 percent, to $1.2 billion for the first nine months of 2010. The decrease in noninterest expense resulted primarily from decreases in FDIC insurance expense ($28 million), primarily reflecting the 2009 industry-wide special assessment charge, and employee benefits expense ($23 million), resulting primarily from a decline in defined benefit pension expense, partially offset by an increase in salaries expense ($22 million).   The following table summarizes salaries and employee benefits expense.              Three Months Ended       Nine Months Ended                 September 30,       September 30,         (in millions)       2010       2009       2010       2009                                                   Salaries       $   187       $   171       $   535       $   513         Employee benefits                                         Defined benefit pension expense       10       14       23       44         Other employee benefits       37       37       113       115         Total employee benefits       47       51       136       159         Total salaries and employee benefits       $   234       $   222       $   671       $   672          For the fourth quarter 2010, management expects a low single-digit increase in noninterest expenses compared to the third quarter 2010. Included in the outlook is an estimated $5 million negative impact reflecting accelerated accretion of the remaining original issuance discount on the redemption of trust preferred securities.   Provision for Income Taxes   The provision for income taxes for the third quarter 2010 was $7 million, compared to a benefit of $29 million for the same period in 2009. For the nine months ended September 30, 2010, the provision for income taxes was $25 million, compared to a benefit of $89 million for the same period in 2009. The $36 million increase in the provision for income taxes in the three-month period ended September 30, 2010, compared to the same period in 2009, reflected an increase in income before income taxes and the reduction of accrued tax interest in 2009 as a result of offsetting anticipated refunds against estimated amounts due to the IRS. The $114 million increase in the provision for income taxes in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010, compared to the same period in the prior year, reflected an increase in income before income taxes, a non-taxable gain on the termination of certain structured lease transactions in the first quarter 2009 and the reduction of tax interest in 2009 as discussed above. For further information on income taxes, refer to Note 11 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements.   Net deferred tax assets were $234 million at September 30, 2010, compared to $158 million at December 31, 2009, an increase of $76 million, primarily due to a reduction in deferred tax liabilities resulting from payments made to the IRS in 2010 for structured leasing transactions, partially offset by increased deferred tax liabilities resulting from unrealized gains recognized in other comprehensive income at September 30, 2010. A valuation allowance is provided when it is “more-likely-than-not” that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The valuation allowance of $1 million for certain state deferred tax assets was unchanged at September 30, 2010, compared to December 31, 2009. The Corporation determined that a valuation allowance was not needed against the federal deferred tax assets. Management’s determination was based on taxable income in the carry-back period, existing taxable temporary differences and anticipated future events.   49      Table of Contents   Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax   Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $17 million for the first nine months of 2010, compared to $1 million for the same period in the prior year. The $16 million increase in the first nine months of 2010, when compared to the same period in the prior year, resulted primarily from a $17 million after-tax gain in the first quarter 2010 from the cash settlement of a note receivable related to the 2006 sale of an investment advisory subsidiary. For further information on the cash settlement of the note and discontinued operations, refer to Note 14 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements.   Business Segments   The Corporation’s operations are strategically aligned into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth & Institutional Management. These business segments are differentiated based on the products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, the Finance Division is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes discontinued operations and items not directly associated with these business segments or the Finance Division. Note 13 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements presents financial results of these business segments for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009. For a description of the business activities of each business segment and the methodologies which form the basis for these results, refer to Note 13 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements and Note 24 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report.   The following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.

The Business Bank’s net income of $355 million increased $272 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2009. Net interest income (FTE) was $1 billion, an increase of $44 million from the comparable prior year period. The increase in net interest income (FTE) was primarily due to an increase in loan and deposit spreads and the benefit provided by a $3.8 billion increase in average deposits, partially offset by a $6.1 billion decrease in average loans. The provision for loan losses of $277 million decreased $404 million from the comparable period in the prior year, reflecting decreases in the Commercial Real Estate (with decreases in all markets, except Texas), Global Corporate Banking and Middle Market (primarily in the Midwest market) business lines. Net credit-related charge-offs of $351 million decreased $178 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to decreases in charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate and Global Corporate Banking business lines. Noninterest income of $222 million increased $8 million from the comparable prior year period, primarily due to increases in commercial lending fees ($8 million), letter of credit fees ($6 million) and foreign exchange income ($5 million), partially offset by an $8 million 2009 gain on the termination of certain leveraged leases and a decline in service charges on deposits ($4 million). Noninterest expenses of $475 million increased $2 million from the same period in the prior year, primarily due to increases in allocated corporate overhead expenses ($22 million) and salaries expense ($8 million), partially offset by decreases in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments ($8 million), FDIC insurance expense ($4 million), primarily reflecting the 2009 industry-wide special assessment charge, and employee benefits expense ($4 million), and nominal decreases in other noninterest expense categories. The provision for income taxes (FTE) of $144 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2010, increased $182 million, compared to a benefit for income taxes (FTE) of $38 million for the comparable period the prior year, primarily resulting from an increase in income before income taxes.   The net loss for the Retail Bank was $17 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, compared to a net loss of $37 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. Net interest income (FTE) of $397 million increased $17 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in loan and   50      Table of Contents   deposit spreads, partially offset by decreases in average deposits ($666 million) and average loans ($647 million). The provision for loan losses decreased $32 million from the comparable period in the prior year, reflecting decreases in the Small Business Banking and Personal Banking business lines. Net credit-related charge-offs of $66 million decreased $23 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in charge-offs in the Small Business Banking business line. Noninterest income of $131 million decreased $11 million from the comparable prior year period, primarily due to an $8 million decline in service charges on deposits. Noninterest expenses of $480 million decreased $2 million from the same period in the prior year, primarily due to decreases in FDIC insurance expense ($11 million), primarily reflecting the 2009 industry-wide special assessment charge, and employee benefit expense ($4 million), partially offset by an increase in allocated net corporate overhead expenses ($12 million).   Wealth & Institutional Management’s net income of $7 million decreased $31 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2009. Net interest income (FTE) of $128 million increased $9 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to the benefit provided by an increase in average deposits ($184 million) and increases in loan and deposit spreads. The provision for loan losses increased $25 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting an increase in the Midwest and Western markets. Net credit-related charge-offs of $34 million increased $8 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to increases in the Western and Midwest markets. Noninterest income of $181 million decreased $28 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to decreases in fiduciary income ($8 million), brokerage fees ($7 million), lower gains on auction rate securities ($6 million) and a 2009 gain related to the sale of the defined contribution plan recordkeeping business ($6 million). Noninterest expenses of $230 million increased $5 million, due to increases in allocated net corporate overhead expense ($7 million) and salaries expense ($4 million), partially offset by a decrease in outside processing expenses ($4 million). The 2009 sale of the defined contribution plan recordkeeping business was the primary reason for the decreases in fiduciary income and outside processing expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, compared to same period in the prior year.   The net loss for the Finance Division was $175 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, compared to a net loss of $48 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. Net interest expense (FTE) decreased $23 million. Net interest expense (FTE) in the Finance Division is primarily impacted by the Corporation’s internal funds transfer methodology. The methodology provides a long-term value based upon assumed deposit lives. This value is paid by the Finance Division to the three major business segments to incent deposit growth in all rate environments. Noninterest income decreased $229 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a decline in net securities gains. Noninterest expenses decreased $8 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a decline in FDIC insurance ($8 million), primarily reflecting the 2009 industry-wide special assessment charge.   The Other category’s net income was $11 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, compared to $10 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. The net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 reflected a $17 million after-tax discontinued operations gain recognized in the first quarter 2010, partially offset by timing differences between when corporate expenses are reflected as a consolidated expense and when the expenses are allocated to the business segments.   Market Segments   The Corporation’s management accounting system also produces market segment results for the Corporation’s four primary geographic markets: Midwest, Western, Texas and Florida. In addition to the four primary geographic markets, Other Markets and International are also reported as market segments.  Note 13 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements contains a description and presents financial results of these market segments for the nine months ended September 30, 2010 and 2009.   51      Table of Contents   The following table presents net income (loss) by market segment.

N/M - not meaningful   Management expects average earning assets of approximately $48 billion in the fourth quarter 2010, largely reflecting a decline in average excess liquidity from $3.0 billion in the third quarter 2010 to approximately $1 billion in the fourth quarter 2010. Excess liquidity is expected to decline primarily due to debt maturities and the redemption of the trust preferred securities discussed below.   Total liabilities decreased $3.1 billion, or six percent, to $49.1 billion at September 30, 2010, compared to $52.2 billion at December 31, 2009, primarily due to a $3.8 billion decrease in medium- and long-term debt, partially offset by a $966 million increase in total deposits. The $3.8 billion decrease in medium- and long-term debt to $7.2 billion at September 30, 2010, compared to December 31, 2009, resulted primarily from the third quarter 2010 early redemption of $2.0 billion of floating-rate Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances at par due in 2012 and 2013 and the maturity of $1.0 billion of FHLB advances and $950 million of medium-term notes during the period, partially offset by the issuance of $300 million of medium-term senior notes in the third quarter 2010. On an average basis, deposits increased $545 million in the third quarter 2010, compared to the fourth quarter 2009,   54      Table of Contents   resulting primarily from an increase in core deposits, partially offset by a decrease in other time deposits. Average core deposits, which exclude other time deposits and foreign office time deposits, increased $2.0 billion, or six percent, from the fourth quarter 2009 to the third quarter 2010, reflecting increases of $2.6 billion in money market and NOW deposits and $490 million in noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by a $1.0 billion decrease in customer certificates of deposit. Average other time deposits decreased $1.4 billion to $65 million in the third quarter 2010, compared to the fourth quarter 2009, primarily due to the maturity of retail brokered certificates of deposit.   On October 1, 2010, the Corporation redeemed $515 million of 6.576% subordinated notes due 2037 at par and recognized a pre-tax charge of $5 million in the fourth quarter 2010 resulting from the accelerated accretion of the original issuance discount. The notes relate to trust preferred securities issued by an unconsolidated subsidiary, which were concurrently redeemed. For further information regarding the redemption of trust preferred securities, refer to the “Capital” section of this financial review and Note 7 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements.   In April 2010, the FDIC adopted an interim rule extending the Transaction Account Guarantee Program (TAGP) through December 31, 2010 for financial institutions that desire to continue TAGP participation. The Corporation elected to opt-out of the FDIC’s TAGP extension, effective July 1, 2010. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Financial Reform Act”) reinstated, for all financial institutions, unlimited deposit insurance on noninterest-bearing accounts for the period from December 31, 2010 through December 31, 2012. For further discussion of the Financial Reform Act, refer to “The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act” section of this financial review.   Capital   In the first quarter 2010, the Corporation fully redeemed $2.25 billion of Fixed Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (preferred stock) issued in connection with the U.S. Department of Treasury (U.S. Treasury) Capital Purchase Program. The redemption was funded by the net proceeds from an $880 million common stock offering completed in the first quarter 2010 and from excess liquidity at the parent company. The redemption resulted in a one-time, non-cash redemption charge of $94 million in the first quarter 2010, reflecting the accelerated accretion of the remaining discount, which reduced diluted earnings per common share by $0.55 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010. The total impact of the preferred stock, including the redemption charge, cash dividends of $24 million and non-cash discount accretion of $5 million, was a reduction to diluted earnings per common share of $0.71 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010. Upon redemption of the preferred stock, related U.S. Treasury Capital Purchase Program restrictions on the Corporation’s ability to declare dividends or repurchase stock ceased, and the Corporation was not required to comply going forward with the U.S. Treasury’s standards for executive compensation and corporate governance.   In the second quarter 2010, the U.S. Treasury sold the related 11.5 million warrants, which granted the right to purchase an equal amount of shares of the Corporation’s common stock at $29.40 per share. The sale of the warrants by the U.S. Treasury had no impact on the Corporation’s equity. The warrants remained outstanding at September 30, 2010 and were included in “capital surplus” on the consolidated statements of changes in shareholders’ equity at their original fair value of $124 million.   Total shareholders’ equity decreased $1.2 billion to $5.9 billion at September 30, 2010, compared to December 31, 2009, resulting primarily from the first quarter 2010 full redemption of $2.25 billion of preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury, partially offset by the net proceeds from the $880 million common stock offering completed in the first quarter 2010.   55      Table of Contents   The following table presents a summary of changes in total shareholders’ equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2010.

Risk-based regulatory capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in credit risk profiles among banking institutions and to account for off-balance sheet exposure. Assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with specified risk-weighting factors. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items. As shown in the table below, the tangible common equity and Tier 1 common capital ratios increased from December 31, 2009 to September 30, 2010, primarily due to the common stock offering completed in the first quarter 2010. The Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios decreased reflecting the redemption of preferred stock and trust preferred securities, partially offset by the common stock issuance discussed above.   In July 2010, the Financial Reform Act was signed into law, which prohibits holding companies with more than $15 billion in assets from including trust preferred securities in Tier 1 capital, with a phase-in period of three years, beginning in January 2013. As discussed in the “Financial Condition” section above, on October 1, 2010, the Corporation fully redeemed $500 million of trust preferred securities. Subsequent to the redemption, no additional trust preferred securities remained outstanding. The $500 million of trust preferred securities outstanding at September 30, 2010 were excluded from Tier 1 and total capital in the computation of risk-based capital ratios as of September 30, 2010. For further discussion of the Financial Reform Act, refer to “The Dodd-Frank Wall Street   56      Table of Contents   Reform and Consumer Protection Act” section of this financial review. For a further discussion on the redemption of the trust preferred securities, refer to Note 7 to these consolidated financial statements.   In December 2009, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee) released proposed Basel III guidance on bank capital and liquidity. In September 2010, the Basel Committee proposed higher global minimum capital standards, including a minimum Tier 1 common capital ratio and additional capital and liquidity requirements, with rules expected to be implemented between 2013 and 2019. Adoption in the U.S. is expected to occur over a similar timeframe, but the final form of the U.S. rules is uncertain. The Corporation believes that the expected impacts from changes in the components of capital and the calculation of risk-weighted assets would not be material. A higher degree of uncertainty exists regarding the implementation and interpretation of the liquidity rules. The Corporation expects the liquidity requirements to be manageable. While uncertainty exists in both the final form of the Basel III guidance and whether or not the Corporation will be required to adopt the guidelines, the Corporation is closely monitoring the development of the guidance.   The Corporation’s capital ratios exceeded minimum regulatory requirements as follows:              September 30, 2010       December 31, 2009         (dollar amounts in millions)       Capital       Ratio       Capital       Ratio         Tier 1 common (a) (b)       $   5,939       9.97   %   $   5,058       8.18   %     Tier 1 risk-based (4.00% - minimum) (b)       5,939       9.97       7,704       12.46         Total risk-based (8.00% - minimum) (b)       8,565       14.38       10,468       16.93         Leverage (3.00% - minimum) (b)       5,939       10.90       7,704       13.25         Tangible common equity (a)       5,701       10.39       4,720       7.99                         (a) See Supplemental Financial Data section for reconcilements of non-GAAP financial measures. (b) September 30, 2010 capital and ratios are estimated.   At September 30, 2010, the Corporation and its U.S. banking subsidiaries exceeded the ratios required for an institution to be considered “well capitalized” (Tier 1 risk-based capital, total risk-based capital and leverage ratios greater than six percent, 10 percent and five percent, respectively).   Risk Management   The following updated information should be read in conjunction with the “Risk Management” section on pages 38-59 in the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report.   Credit Risk   Allowance for Credit Losses and Nonperforming Assets   The allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The allowance for loan losses represents management’s assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporation’s loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain loans and loan relationships, and allowances for homogeneous pools of loans with similar risk characteristics for the remaining business, consumer and residential mortgage loans. The Corporation defines business loans as those belonging to the commercial, real estate construction, commercial mortgage, lease financing and international loan portfolios.   A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that interest or principal payments will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the original loan agreement. The Corporation performs a detailed credit quality review quarterly on large impaired business loans, loans restructured in troubled debt restructurings, and certain large impaired consumer and residential mortgage loans, and establishes a specific allowance for such loans, estimated using one of several methods, including the estimated fair value of underlying collateral, observable market value of similar debt or discounted expected future cash flows.   Independent third-party appraisals are obtained prior to the origination of any first mortgage loan. “As developed” collateral values are used at the time of origination of a construction loan, on the assumption that the construction facility provides sufficient funds to complete the project and carry it until it is leased or sold. Credit reviews are performed at least annually on each collateral-dependent loan and, if necessary, adjustments to the original appraisals are made to reflect the most current risk profile of the project. These adjustments may include a   57      Table of Contents   revised rental rate or absorption rate, based on the actual conditions at that time. Updated independent third-party appraisals are generally obtained at the time of a refinance or restructure where additional advances are requested or when there is evidence that the physical aspects of the property have deteriorated.   For collateral-dependent impaired loans, updated appraisals are obtained at least annually unless conditions dictate increased frequency. Appraisals on impaired construction loans are generally based on “as is” collateral values. In certain circumstances, the Corporation may believe that the highest and best use of the collateral, and thus the most advantageous exit strategy, requires completion of the construction project. In these situations, the Corporation uses an “as-developed” appraisal to evaluate alternatives. However, the “as-developed” collateral value is appropriately adjusted to reflect the cost to complete the construction project and to prepare the property for sale. Between appraisals the Corporation may reduce the collateral value based upon the age of the appraisal and adverse developments in market conditions.   Loans which do not meet the criteria to be evaluated individually are evaluated in homogeneous pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. The allowance for all other business loans is determined by applying standard reserve factors to the pool of business loans within each internal risk rating. Internal risk ratings are assigned to each business loan at the time of approval and are subjected to subsequent periodic reviews by the Corporation’s senior management. Standard reserve factors for the loans within each risk rating are updated quarterly and are based on estimated probabilities of default and loss given default, incorporating factors such as recent charge-off experience, current economic conditions and trends, changes in collateral values of properties securing loans, and trends with respect to past due and nonaccrual amounts. The standard reserve factors are supported by underlying analysis, including information on migration and loss given default studies from each of the three largest domestic geographic markets (Midwest, Western and Texas), as well as mapping to publicly available debt ratings. Incremental reserves may be established to cover losses in industries and/or portfolios experiencing elevated loss levels. On a limited basis, the Corporation uses data annually from Standard & Poor’s (S&P) publicly available debt ratings to determine the level of probability of default for loans that are considered to have strong credit quality and are assigned the best internal risk ratings. To ensure the use of probability of default based on S&P debt ratings is appropriate, the Corporation compares the assigned internal risk ratings of borrowers that have public debt outstanding to their publicly available S&P debt rating for consistency. The Corporation has sufficient default experience and is able to generate its own probability of default metrics on the remainder of the loan portfolio. The Corporation uses its own loss given default experience to determine the overall expected loss measure.   The allowance for all other consumer and residential mortgage loans is determined by applying estimated loss rates to various pools of loans within the portfolios with similar risk characteristics. Estimated loss rates for all pools are updated quarterly, incorporating factors such as recent charge-off experience, current economic conditions and trends, changes in collateral values of properties securing loans using index-based estimates, and trends with respect to past due and nonaccrual amounts.   Actual losses experienced in the future may vary from those estimated. The uncertainty occurs because factors may exist which affect the determination of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and are not necessarily captured by the application of standard reserve factors or identified industry-specific risks. An additional allowance is established to capture these probable losses and reflects management’s view that the allowance should recognize the margin for error inherent in the process of estimating expected loan losses. Factors that were considered in the evaluation of the adequacy of the Corporation’s allowance for loan losses included the inherent imprecision in the risk rating system resulting from inaccuracy in assigning risk ratings or stale ratings which may not have been updated for recent negative trends in particular credits. Risk ratings on business loan relationships meeting an internally specified exposure threshold are updated annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of a circumstance that affects the credit risk of the relationship.   The total allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb incurred losses inherent in the total loan portfolio. Unanticipated economic events, including political, economic and regulatory instability in countries where the Corporation has loans, could cause changes in the credit characteristics of the portfolio and result in an unanticipated increase in the allowance. Inclusion of other industry-specific portfolio exposures in the allowance, as well as significant increases in the current portfolio exposures, could also increase the amount of the allowance. Any of these events, or some combination thereof, may result in the need for additional provision for loan losses in order to maintain an allowance that complies with credit risk and accounting policies. The allowance for loan losses was $957 million at September 30, 2010, compared to $985 million at December 31, 2009, a decrease of $28 million, or three percent. The decrease resulted primarily from improvements in credit quality including a decline of $1.6 billion in the Corporation’s watch list loans - generally consistent with regulatory defined special mention, substandard and doubtful (nonaccrual) loans - from December 31, 2009 to September 30, 2010. Additional indicators of improved credit quality included a decrease in the inflow to nonaccrual (based on an analysis of   58      Table of Contents   nonaccrual loans with book balances greater than $2 million) of $285 million and a decrease in net credit-related charge-offs of $193 million in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010, compared to the same period in the prior year. The decreases in the allowance for loan losses consisted of decreases in the Commercial Real Estate (primarily the Western, Midwest and Texas markets) and Global Corporate Banking business lines, partially offset by an increase in industry specific allowances for customers in the Private Banking business line (primarily Midwest, Florida and Western market). The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total period-end loans was 2.38 percent at September 30, 2010, compared to 2.34 percent at December 31, 2009. Nonperforming loans of $1.2 billion at September 30, 2010 modestly increased $10 million, compared to December 31, 2009. All large nonperforming loans are individually reviewed each quarter for potential charge-offs and reserves. Charge-offs are taken as amounts are determined to be uncollectible. A measure of the level of charge-offs already taken on nonperforming loans is the current book balance as a percentage of the contractual amount owed. At September 30, 2010, nonperforming loans were charged-off to 55 percent of the contractual amount, compared to 56 percent at December 31, 2009. This level of write-downs is consistent with losses experienced on defaulted loans in the first nine months of 2010 and in recent years. The allowance as a percentage of total nonperforming loans, a ratio which results from the actions noted above, was 80 percent at September 30, 2010, compared to 83 percent at December 31, 2009. The Corporation’s loan portfolio is heavily composed of collateral dependent business loans, which, in the event of default, are typically carried on the books at fair value as nonperforming assets for a longer period of time than are consumer loans, which are generally fully charged off when they become nonperforming, resulting in a lower nonperforming loan allowance coverage.   The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in “accrued expenses and other liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets, provides for probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments, including unused commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and financial guarantees. Allowances for lending-related commitments for which it is probable that the commitment will be drawn (or sold) are estimated using the same methods as business loans. In general, the probability of draw for letters of credit is considered certain once the credit is assigned an internal risk rating generally consistent with regulatory defined substandard or doubtful. A standard reserve factor is applied or a specific reserve is established for these letters of credit. Other letters of credit, all unfunded commitments and financial guarantees have a lower probability of draw, to which standard reserve factors are applied.   The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $38 million at September 30, 2010, an increase of $1 million from $37 million at December 31, 2009.   59      Table of Contents   Nonperforming assets were $1.3 billion at September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, and are summarized in the following table.

Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $12.6 billion at September 30, 2010, of which $4.1 billion, or 33 percent, were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to residential real estate investors and developers. The remaining $8.5 billion, or 67 percent, of commercial real estate loans in other business lines consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans.   The geographic distribution and project type of commercial real estate loans are important factors in diversifying credit risk within the portfolio. The following table reflects real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line by project type and location of property.

However, the significant and sudden decline in residential real estate activity that began in late 2008 in the Western, Florida and Midwest markets proved extremely difficult for many of the smaller residential real estate developers. Of the $2.0 billion of real estate construction loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line, $362 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2010, including single family projects totaling $109 million (primarily in the Western and Florida markets), multi-use projects totaling $76 million (primarily in the Western market) and residential land development projects totaling $73 million (primarily in the Western market). Real estate construction loan net charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $134 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, including $48 million from single family projects (mostly the Western market), $34 million from residential land development projects, $24 million from multi-use projects (primarily the Texas and Western markets) and $21 million from retail projects (primarily the Western and Midwest markets).   The commercial mortgage loan portfolio totaled $10.2 billion at September 30, 2010 and included $8.1 billion of primarily owner-occupied commercial mortgage loans. Of the $2.1 billion of commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line, $153 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2010, including residential land carry projects totaling $36 million (primarily in the Midwest and Western markets), single family projects totaling $25 million, nonresidential land carry projects totaling $23 million and office projects totaling $22 million (primarily in the Western market). Commercial mortgage loan net charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $43 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2010, including $13 million, $9 million, $8 million and $7 million, from residential land carry, commercial land carry, multi-family and office projects, respectively.   Residential real estate loans, which consist of traditional residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit, totaled $3.3 billion at September 30, 2010. Residential mortgages totaled $1.6 billion at September 30, 2010, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.6 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $59 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2010. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.7 billion at September 30, 2010, of which $1.5 billion was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit and $221 million consisted of closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.7 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $4 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2010. A substantial majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens. Given the size and make-up of the residential real estate portfolio, the Corporation believes that any impact from current industry foreclosure issues will be minimal.   The following table summarizes the Corporation’s residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolio by geographic market as of September 30, 2010.              September 30, 2010                 Residential       % of       Home       % of         (dollar amounts in millions)       Mortgage Loans       Total       Equity Loans       Total         Geographic market:                                         Midwest       $   619       39   %   $   1,071       62   %     Western       513       32       459       26         Texas       236       15       155       9         Florida       217       14       48       3         Other Markets       1       —       3       —         Total       $   1,586       100   %   $   1,736       100   %      The Corporation rarely originates residential real estate loans with a loan-to-value ratio above 100 percent at origination, has no sub-prime mortgage programs and does not originate payment-option adjustable-rate mortgages or other nontraditional mortgages that allow negative amortization. A significant majority of residential mortgage originations are sold in the secondary market. The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation’s primary geographic markets. The economic recession and significant declines in home values in the Western, Florida and Midwest markets following the financial market turmoil beginning in the fall of 2008 adversely impacted the residential real estate portfolio. At September 30, 2010, the Corporation estimated that, of the $8 million total residential mortgage loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest, approximately $2 million exceeded 90 percent of the current value of the underlying collateral, based on S&P/Case-Shiller home price indices. To account for this exposure, the Corporation factors changes in home values into estimated loss ratios for residential real estate loans, using index-based estimates by major metropolitan area, resulting in an increased allowance allocated for residential real estate loans when home values decline.   65      Table of Contents   Additionally, to mitigate increasing credit exposure due to depreciating home values, the Corporation periodically reviews home equity lines of credit and makes line reductions or converts outstanding balances at line maturity to closed-end, amortizing loans when necessary.   Shared National Credits   Shared National Credit (SNC) loans are facilities greater than $20 million shared by three or more federally supervised financial institutions that are reviewed by regulatory authorities at the agent bank level. The Corporation generally seeks to obtain ancillary business at the origination of a SNC relationship. Loans classified as SNC loans (approximately 950 borrowers at September 30, 2010) totaled $7.4 billion at September 30, 2010, a decline of $1.7 billion from $9.1 billion at December 31, 2009. SNC net loan charge-offs totaled $13 million and $75 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010, respectively. Nonaccrual SNC loans increased $44 million to $338 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2010, from $294 million at December 31, 2009. SNC loans, diversified by both business line and geographic market, comprised approximately 20 percent of total loans at both September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009. SNC loans are held to the same credit underwriting standards as the remainder of the loan portfolio and face similar credit challenges, primarily driven by residential real estate development.   Automotive Lending   Loans to borrowers involved with automotive production totaled approximately $805 million at September 30, 2010, compared to $941 million at December 31, 2009. Loans in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $3.7 billion and $3.3 billion at September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. Of the $3.7 billion of outstanding loans in the National Dealer Services business line at September 30, 2010, approximately $2.4 billion, or 64 percent, were to foreign franchises, $841 million, or 23 percent, were to domestic franchises and $474 million, or 13 percent, were to other. Other dealer loans include obligations where a primary franchise was indeterminable, such as loans to large public dealership consolidators and rental car, leasing, heavy truck and recreation vehicle companies.   For further discussion of credit risk, see the “Credit Risk” section on pages 38-51 in the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report.   Market Risk   Interest Rate Risk   Net interest income is the predominant source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises primarily through the Corporation’s core business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits. The Corporation’s balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating rate commercial loans funded by a combination of core deposits and wholesale borrowings. This creates a natural imbalance between the floating-rate loan portfolio and the more slowly repricing deposit products. The result is that growth and/or contraction in the Corporation’s core businesses will lead to sensitivity to interest rate movements without mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing investment securities, primarily fixed-rate, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, and hedging the sensitivity with interest rate swaps. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk, with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.   The Corporation frequently evaluates net interest income under various balance sheet and interest rate scenarios, looking at both 12 and 24 month time horizons, using simulation modeling analysis as its principal risk management evaluation technique. The results of these analyses provide the information needed to assess the balance sheet structure. Changes in economic activity, whether domestic or international, different from those management included in its simulation analyses could translate into a materially different interest rate environment than currently expected. Management evaluates a base case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment and what is believed to be the most likely balance sheet structure. This base case net interest income is then evaluated against non-parallel interest rate scenarios that gradually increase and decrease rates approximately 200 basis points in a linear fashion from the base case over twelve months (but decrease to no lower than zero percent). Due to the current low level of interest rates, the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of a 25 basis point drop, to zero percent, while the rising interest rate scenario reflects a gradual 200 basis point rise. In addition, consistent with each interest rate scenario, adjustments to asset prepayment levels, yield curves, and overall balance sheet mix and growth assumptions are made. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model may not precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income. Actual results   66      Table of Contents   may differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions and management strategies, among other factors. However, the model can indicate the likely direction of change. Existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes are included in these analyses, but no additional hedging is forecasted.   The table below, as of September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above. The sensitivity from December 31, 2009 to September 30, 2010 increased with growth in core deposits, though risk to declining interest rates is limited by the current low level of rates.

The economic value of equity analysis begins with an estimate of the economic value of the financial assets and liabilities on the Corporation’s balance sheet, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period, and then applies the estimated impact of rate movements to the economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments. The economic value of equity is then calculated as the difference between the estimated market value of assets and liabilities net of the impact of off-balance sheet instruments. As with net interest income shocks, a variety of alternative scenarios are performed to measure the impact on economic value of equity, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve.   The table below, as of September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2009, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from a 200 basis point immediate parallel increase or decrease in interest rates (but decrease to no lower than zero percent). Similar to the simulation analysis above, due to the current low level of interest rates, the economic value of equity analyses below reflect an interest rate scenario of an immediate 25 basis point drop, to zero percent, while the rising interest rate scenario reflects an immediate 200 basis point rise. The change in the sensitivity of the economic value of equity to a 200 basis point parallel increase in rates between December 31, 2009 and September 30, 2010 was primarily driven by changes in market interest rates, deposit growth, and the Corporation’s mortgage-backed securities portfolio’s forecasted prepayments.

At September 30, 2010, the Corporation held excess liquidity, represented by $3.0 billion deposited with the FRB, compared to $4.8 billion at December 31, 2009. The decrease in excess liquidity resulted from the third quarter 2010 early redemption of $2.0 billion of FHLB advances originally scheduled to mature in late 2012 and early 2013, and the maturity of $1.0 billion of FHLB advances and $950 million of medium-term notes during the period, partially offset by the issuance of $300 million medium-term senior notes in the third quarter 2010. The Corporation may access the purchased funds market when necessary, which includes certificates of deposit issued to institutional investors in denominations in excess of $100,000 and to retail customers in denominations of less than $100,000 through brokers (“other time deposits” on the consolidated balance sheets), foreign office time deposits and short-term borrowings. Purchased funds totaled $673 million at September 30, 2010, compared to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2009. Capacity for incremental purchased funds at September 30, 2010, consisted largely of federal funds purchased, brokered certificates of deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. In addition, the Corporation is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, Texas (FHLB), which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. The actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. As of September 30, 2010, the Corporation had $3.0 billion of outstanding borrowings from the FHLB with remaining maturities ranging from October 2010 to May 2014. Another source of funding, if needed,   67      Table of Contents   would be liquid assets, which totaled $8.8 billion at September 30, 2010, compared to $7.7 billion at December 31, 2009, including cash and due from banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell, interest-bearing deposits with banks, other short-term investments and unencumbered investment securities available-for-sale. Additionally, the Corporation could issue up to $13.6 billion of debt at September 30, 2010 under an existing $15 billion medium-term senior note program which allows its principal banking subsidiary to issue debt with maturities between one and 30 years.   A portion of the September 30, 2010 excess liquidity was used to early redeem all $500 million of trust preferred securities and fund $500 million of maturing FHLB advances on October 1, 2010. Strong capital and liquidity positions enabled the Corporation to redeem these higher-cost securities in the fourth quarter 2010, which will result in significant interest savings. For further information regarding the redemption of trust preferred securities, refer to the “Capital” section of this financial review and Note 7 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements.   Other Market Risks   Certain components of the Corporation’s noninterest income, primarily fiduciary income, are at risk to fluctuations in the market values of underlying assets, particularly equity and debt securities. Other components of noninterest income, primarily brokerage fees, are at risk to changes in the volume of market activity.   At September 30, 2010, the Corporation had a $52 million portfolio of investments in indirect private equity and venture capital funds, with commitments of $23 million to fund additional investments in future periods. The value of these investments is at risk to changes in equity markets, general economic conditions and a variety of other factors. The majority of these investments are not readily marketable and are included in “accrued income and other assets” on the consolidated balance sheets. The investments are individually reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis by comparing the carrying value to the estimated fair value.   For further discussion of market risk, see Note 5 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements and pages 52-59 in the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report.   The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act   On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Financial Reform Act”) was signed into law. The Financial Reform Act provides for, among other matters, increased regulatory supervision and examination of financial institutions, the imposition of more stringent capital requirements on financial institutions and increased regulation of derivatives and hedging transactions. Provided below is an overview of key elements of the Financial Reform Act relevant to the Corporation. Most of the provisions contained in the Financial Reform Act will be effective immediately upon enactment; however, many have delayed effective dates. Implementation of the Financial Reform Act will require many new mandatory and discretionary rules to be made by federal regulatory agencies over the next several years. The estimates of the impact on the Corporation discussed below are based on the limited information currently available and, given the uncertainty of the timing and scope of the impact, are subject to change until final rulemaking is complete.   · Interest on Demand Deposits: Allows interest on commercial demand deposits, which could lead to increased cost of commercial demand deposits, depending on the interplay of interest, deposit credits and service charges.   · TAG Extension: Provides unlimited deposit insurance on noninterest-bearing accounts from December 31, 2010 to December 31, 2012. Assuming the same assessment rate as the current program, applied to second quarter 2010 deposit levels, the estimated annual cost is approximately $14 million.   · Deposit Insurance: Changes the definition of assessment base from domestic deposits to net assets (average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity), increases the deposit insurance fund’s minimum reserve ratio and permanently increases general deposit insurance coverage from $100,000 to $250,000. Assuming no change to the current assessment rate, applied to second quarter 2010 net assets, the estimated increase in annual FDIC fees is approximately $15 million.   · Derivatives: Allows continued trading of foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives. Requires banks to shift energy, uncleared commodities and agriculture derivatives to a separately capitalized subsidiary within their holding company. Directly impacts client-driven energy derivatives business (approximately $1 million in annual revenue, based on full-year 2010 estimates).   68      Table of Contents   · Interchange Fee: Limits debit card transaction processing fees that card issuers can charge to merchants. Current estimated annual revenue from debit card PIN and signature-based interchange fees of approximately $8 million and $31 million, respectively, could decrease.   · Trust Preferred Securities: Prohibits holding companies with more than $15 billion in assets from including trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital, and allows for a phase-in period of three years, beginning on January 1, 2013. As of June 30, 2010, the Corporation had $500 million of trust preferred securities outstanding that added 83 basis points to the Corporation’s Tier 1 capital ratio. On October 1, 2010, the Corporation redeemed all $500 million of its 6.576 percent subordinated notes due 2037. As a result, these notes, which relate to trust preferred securities issued by an unconsolidated subsidiary which were concurrently redeemed, are excluded from all risk-based capital calculations at September 30, 2010.   Critical Accounting Policies   The Corporation’s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report, as updated in Note 1 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation’s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2009, the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to allowance for credit losses, valuation methodologies, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages 60-65 in the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report.   The Corporation has concluded that the accounting policy related to goodwill requires classification as a critical accounting policy, effective July 2010, due to the uncertainty in the economic environment, and as a result of the potential impact from changes in legislation and regulations. As of the date of this report, the Corporation does not believe there are any other material changes in the nature or categories of the critical accounting policies or estimates and assumptions from those discussed in the Corporation’s 2009 Annual Report. The following is a description of our critical accounting policy for goodwill reflecting the results of the most recent annual test performed in the third quarter 2010.   Goodwill   Goodwill is the value attributed to unidentifiable intangible elements in acquired businesses. Goodwill is initially recorded at fair value and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment. The Corporation conducts its evaluation of goodwill impairment in the third quarter each year and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate the assets might be impaired. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level, equivalent to a business segment or one level below. During the third quarter 2010, the Corporation announced that the Retail Bank and Wealth & Institutional Management business segments would report to a single individual. As a result of these changes, the Corporation reassessed its reporting units and concluded that under the new reporting structure the Corporation has three reporting units: Business Bank, Retail Bank and Wealth & Institutional Management. These changes to the reporting units did not affect the amount of goodwill previously allocated and did not impact the results of previous or current goodwill impairment tests.   The goodwill impairment test is a two-step test. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the Corporation’s identified reporting units with their carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and the amount of goodwill impairment, if any.   Estimating the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process involving the use of estimates and judgments, particularly related to future cash flows of the reporting units, discount rates (including market risk premiums) and market multiples. Material assumptions used in the valuation models included the comparable public company price multiples used in the terminal value, future cash flows and the market risk premium component of the discount rate. The fair values of the reporting units were determined using a blend of two commonly used valuation techniques, the market approach and the income approach. The Corporation gives consideration to both valuation techniques, as either technique can be an indicator of value. For the market approach, valuations of reporting units were based on an analysis of relevant price multiples in market trades in companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit. For the income approach, estimated future cash flows   69      Table of Contents   (derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for each reporting unit) and terminal value (value at the end of the cash flow period, based on price multiples) were discounted. The discount rate was based on the imputed cost of equity capital appropriate for each reporting unit.   As of September 30, 2010, the Business Bank had goodwill of approximately $90 million, the Retail Bank approximately $47 million and the remaining goodwill balance of approximately $13 million of the Corporation’s consolidated goodwill of $150 million was associated with the Wealth and Institutional Management reporting unit. At the conclusion of the first step of the goodwill impairment test performed in the third quarter 2010, the estimated fair values of all reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts, including goodwill. The results of the goodwill impairment test for each reporting unit were subjected to stress testing, which consisted of reducing expected future net income by 10 percent, reducing comparable multiples by 10 percent and increasing the discount rate by 200 basis points. The fair values of all reporting units calculated under the stressed environment exceeded their carrying value, including goodwill. Forecasted cash flows for each of the reporting units improved from the prior year primarily as a result of improvements in credit metrics and increases in deposits, including a favorable change in the deposit mix. Additionally, the estimated future cash flows of the Retail Bank reflected management’s assumptions regarding the impact of the Financial Reform Act.   Economic conditions impact the assumptions related to imputed cost of equity capital, loss rates, interest and growth rates. Adverse changes in the economic environment, a decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors could cause the fair value of the reporting units to fall below their carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Additionally, if the actual impact of legislative and regulatory changes is significantly different than management’s expectations, the fair value of the reporting units may fall below the carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Any impairment charge would not affect the Corporation’s regulatory capital ratios, tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position.   70      Table of Contents   Supplemental Financial Data   The following tables provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this financial review with financial measures defined by GAAP.

(b) Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as defined by regulation. (c) September 30, 2010 Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets are estimated.   The net interest margin (FTE), excluding excess liquidity, removes interest earned on balances deposited with the FRB from net interest income (FTE) and average balances deposited with the FRB from average earning assets from the numerator and denominator of the net interest margin (FTE) ratio, respectively. The Corporation believes this measurement provides meaningful information to investors, regulators, management and others of the impact on net interest income and net interest margin resulting from the Corporation’s short-term investment in low yielding instruments.   71      Table of Contents   The Tier 1 common capital ratio removes preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations. The tangible common equity ratio removes preferred stock and the effect of intangible assets from capital and the effect of intangible assets from total assets. The Corporation believes these measurements are meaningful measures of capital adequacy used by investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and to compare against other companies in the industry.   ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   Quantitative and qualitative disclosures for the current period can be found in the “Market Risk” section of “Item 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”   ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures   (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Corporation maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Corporation’s management, including the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management has evaluated, with the participation of the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report (the “Evaluation Date”). Based on the evaluation, the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.   (b) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. During the period to which this report relates, there have not been any changes in the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, such controls.
