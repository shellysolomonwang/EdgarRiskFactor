Net income per diluted common share for the same respective periods was $1.86 compared to $1.26. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 was $925 million, an increase of $294 million from $631 million reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. Net income per diluted common share for the same respective periods was $5.32 compared to $3.50. Management of loan and deposit pricing in a rising rate environment, improved credit quality, successful execution of GEAR Up initiatives and a decrease in the federal statutory tax rate in 2018 resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act contributed to the increase in net income. The following table lists certain items impacting net income and earnings per share for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.

The impact of increases in short-term rates and the execution of certain GEAR Up initiatives helped lower the efficiency ratio to 52.9 percent and 54.1 percent for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018, respectively, and increase return on equity to 16.2 percent and 15.6 percent for the same periods, respectively. The Corporation anticipates cumulative benefits to pre-tax income from GEAR Up initiatives of approximately $270 million and $305 million for full-year 2018 and 2019, respectively, relative to when the initiative was announced.Total pre-tax restructuring charges for 2018 are expected to range from $47 million to $52 million including $39 million recognized in the nine months ended September 30, 2018. No restructuring charges are anticipated beyond 2018. Cumulative restructuring charges from inception of GEAR Up through 2018 are expected to range from $185 million to $190 million. Fourth Quarter 2018 OutlookFor the fourth quarter 2018 compared to the third quarter 2018, management expects the following, assuming a continuation of the current economic and rate environment as well as the benefits from the GEAR Up initiative:•Average loans stable with a positive trend, reflecting increases in most lines of business and a seasonal increase in National Dealer Services, mostly offset by a seasonal decrease in Mortgage Banker Finance. •Continued growth in net interest income from the net benefit due to rising short-term interest rates and repositioning the securities portfolio, partially offset by higher average debt as well as lower interest recoveries and loan fees.•Provision for credit losses of $10 million to $20 million and net charge-offs to remain low.•Relatively stable noninterest income, excluding securities losses, bank-owned life insurance and deferred compensation asset returns.◦Levels of customer derivative and investment banking income may not repeat. ◦GEAR Up initiatives continue to help drive growth in card fees and fiduciary income.•Noninterest expenses modestly higher, excluding approximately $10 million of restructuring charges.◦GEAR Up savings remain on track.◦Continued higher outside processing and technology expenditures.◦Seasonal and typical inflationary pressures.•Income tax expense to be approximately 23 percent of pre-tax income, excluding any tax impact from employee stock transactions.40Table of ContentsNet Interest IncomeQuarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume Three Months Ended September 30, 2018 September 30, 2017(dollar amounts in millions)AverageBalanceInterestAverageRate AverageBalanceInterestAverageRateCommercial loans$30,371$3654.74% $30,603$3124.05%Real estate construction loans3,198435.38 2,933334.36Commercial mortgage loans9,0841104.84 8,977954.20Lease financing46443.69 47033.34International loans1,072134.99 1,156124.13Residential mortgage loans1,962183.71 2,005203.95Consumer loans2,433284.49 2,519253.84Total loans48,5845814.74 48,6635004.08        Mortgage-backed securities9,063542.30 9,361512.17Other investment securities2,698121.72 2,883121.67Total investment securities 11,761662.17 12,244632.05        Interest-bearing deposits with banks5,362282.03 5,086161.26Other short-term investments135—1.04 91—0.72Total earning assets65,8426754.05 66,0845793.48        Cash and due from banks1,107   1,234  Allowance for loan losses(681)   (718)  Accrued income and other assets4,942   4,651  Total assets$71,210   $71,251          Money market and interest-bearing checking deposits$22,573320.56 $20,81990.15Savings deposits2,20810.05 2,152—0.02Customer certificates of deposit2,09420.48 2,39020.36Foreign office time deposits25—1.25 75—0.66Total interest-bearing deposits26,900350.51 25,436110.16        Short-term borrowings8511.95 81531.15Medium- and long-term debt6,153402.55 4,936191.60Total interest-bearing sources33,138760.90 31,187330.42        Noninterest-bearing deposits29,193   31,057  Accrued expenses and other liabilities1,062   999  Total shareholders’ equity7,817   8,008  Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity$71,210   $71,251          Net interest income/rate spread $5993.15  $5463.06        Impact of net noninterest-bearing sources of funds  0.45   0.22Net interest margin (as a percentage of average earning assets)  3.60%   3.28%41Table of ContentsQuarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume (continued) Three Months Ended September 30, 2018/September 30, 2017(in millions)IncreaseDue to RateIncrease(Decrease)Due to Volume (a)NetIncrease (Decrease)Interest Income:      Loans$81 $— $81 Investment securities3 — 3 Interest-bearing deposits with banks11 1 12  Total interest income95 1 96 Interest Expense:      Interest-bearing deposits22 2 24 Short-term borrowings2 (4) (2) Medium- and long-term debt14 7 21  Total interest expense38 5 43  Net interest income$57 $(4) $53 (a)Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume.Net interest income was $599 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, an increase of $53 million compared to $546 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017. The increase in net interest income primarily reflected the net benefit from higher rates and a $730 million decrease in short-term borrowings, partially offset by a $13 million decrease in interest recoveries from elevated third quarter 2017 levels and the impact of a $1.2 billion increase in average debt. The net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2018 increased 32 basis points to 3.60 percent, from 3.28 percent for the comparable period in 2017, reflecting the net benefit from higher rates, partially offset by the decrease in interest recoveries, higher average debt and the increase in lower-yielding average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB).42Table of ContentsYear-to-Date Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018 September 30, 2017(dollar amounts in millions)AverageBalanceInterestAverageRate AverageBalanceInterestAverageRateCommercial loans$30,494$1,0374.54% $30,313$8513.76%Real estate construction loans3,1521205.08 2,934904.09Commercial mortgage loans9,1583154.61 8,9882653.94Lease financing462133.85 52292.40International loans1,017374.88 1,168353.96Residential mortgage loans1,988563.76 1,981553.71Consumer loans2,473804.32 2,525693.63Total loans48,7441,6584.55 48,4311,3743.79        Mortgage-backed securities9,1091582.25 9,3351502.16Other investment securities2,714361.72 2,890361.66Total investment securities 11,8231942.13 12,2251862.04        Interest-bearing deposits with banks4,625631.82 5,598441.03Other short-term investments134—0.90 92—0.66Total earning assets65,3261,9153.90 66,3461,6043.23        Cash and due from banks1,200   1,187  Allowance for loan losses(702)   (728)  Accrued income and other assets4,865   4,665  Total assets$70,689   $71,470          Money market and interest-bearing checking deposits$22,219720.43 $21,645230.14Savings deposits2,20510.04 2,127—0.02Customer certificates of deposit2,09360.40 2,54360.37Foreign office time deposits30—1.17 59—0.60Total interest-bearing deposits26,547790.40 26,374290.15        Short-term borrowings5911.79 33131.14Medium- and long-term debt5,647972.27 5,084561.46Total interest-bearing sources32,2531770.73 31,789880.37        Noninterest-bearing deposits29,457   30,754  Accrued expenses and other liabilities1,072   988  Total shareholders’ equity7,907   7,939  Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity$70,689   $71,470          Net interest income/rate spread $1,7383.17  $1,5162.86        Impact of net noninterest-bearing sources of funds  0.37   0.19Net interest margin (as a percentage of average earning assets)  3.54%   3.05%43Table of ContentsYear-to-Date Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume (continued) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2018/September 30, 2017 (in millions)IncreaseDue to RateIncrease(Decrease)Due to Volume (a)NetIncrease (Decrease) Interest Income:      Loans$273 $11 $284  Investment securities9 (1) 8  Interest-bearing deposits with banks32 (13) 19   Total interest income314 (3) 311  Interest Expense:      Interest-bearing deposits49 1 50  Short-term borrowings2 (4) (2) Medium- and long-term debt35 6 41   Total interest expense86 3 89   Net interest income$228 $(6) $222  (a)Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume.Net interest income was $1.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, an increase of $222 million, compared to $1.5 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The increase in net interest income primarily reflected the net benefit from higher rates. The impact of a $973 million decrease in interest-bearing deposits with banks, primarily FRB deposits, and a $563 million increase in medium- and long-term debt were partially offset by the benefit from a $313 million increase in average loans and a $272 million decrease in short-term borrowings. The net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased 49 basis points to 3.54 percent, from 3.05 percent for the comparable period in 2017, reflecting the net benefit from higher rates and the decrease in lower-yielding average balances deposited with the FRB.For further discussion of the effects of market rates on net interest income, refer to the "Market and Liquidity Risk" section of this financial review.Provision for Credit LossesThere was no provision for credit losses for the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to a provision of $24 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017. The provision for credit losses was a $17 million benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to a provision expense of $57 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The provision for credit losses includes both the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The provision for loan losses is recorded to maintain the allowance for loan losses at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio and includes qualitative adjustments for factors that have not been fully accounted for in the quantitative reserve calculations. For example, a qualitative reserve has been established for risks associated with recently imposed tariffs and ongoing trade negotiations.The provision for loan losses decreased $30 million to $1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to $31 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017. The decrease in the provision primarily reflected improved credit quality in most lines of business driven by lower net charge-offs and criticized loans. Net loan charge-offs decreased $10 million to $15 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to net loan charge-offs of $25 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017. The decrease in net charge-offs was primarily driven by Energy. The provision for loan losses decreased $65 million from a provision expense of $57 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 to a benefit of $8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The decrease in the provision was driven by the same reasons discussed above. Net loan charge-offs decreased $36 million to $40 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to net loan charge-offs of $76 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The decrease in net charge-offs was driven by decreases in Energy and Technology and Life Sciences.The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments is recorded to maintain the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments increased $6 million, from a benefit of $7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 to a benefit of $1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018. The decrease in benefit primarily reflected credit quality improvements in the letter of credit and commercial commitments portfolio recognized in the three months ended September 30, 2017. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was a benefit of $9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to no provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The increase in the provision benefit primarily reflected a decrease in commercial commitments, primarily 44Table of Contentsin Energy. There were no lending-related commitment charge-offs for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets is presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.Presentation Changes Noninterest income and noninterest expenses for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 reflect certain presentation changes resulting from the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," (Topic 606), effective January 1, 2018. These changes primarily impacted card fees and service charges on deposit accounts in noninterest income, fully offset by the impact to outside processing fee expense in noninterest expenses. See note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the adoption of Topic 606. The table below summarizes the proforma effects to the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017.

The decrease included a $20 million loss on sale of securities from repositioning $1.3 billion of treasury securities by purchasing securities yielding approximately $4 million additional interest per quarter. Excluding the net losses due to repositioning the securities portfolio in the three months ended September 30, 2018 and $30 million proforma effect of Topic 606 for the same period in 2017, noninterest income increased $9 million. Increases of $5 million in card fees (proforma), $3 million in fiduciary income and smaller increases in other categories of noninterest income were partially offset by a $3 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts (proforma). Noninterest income decreased $96 million to $726 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to $822 million for the same period in the prior year. Excluding $20 million of net losses due to repositioning the securities portfolio in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and the $84 million proforma effect of Topic 606 for the same period in 2017, noninterest income increased $8 million, primarily reflecting increases of $18 million in card fees (proforma) and $7 million in fiduciary income, partially offset by decreases of $8 million in 45Table of Contentsservice charges on deposit accounts (proforma), $4 million in letter of credit fees and $5 million in other noninterest income due to the wind down of a retirement savings program .

Excluding the $30 million proforma effect of Topic 606 to the three months ended September 30, 2017, noninterest expenses increased $19 million, primarily reflecting increases of $17 million in salaries and benefits expense, $5 million in restructuring charges and $3 million in outside processing fee expense (proforma), partially offset by decreases of $3 million in software expense and $2 million in FDIC insurance expense. The increase in salaries and benefits expense primarily reflected higher share-based and incentive compensation tied to financial performance as well as merit increases, partially offset by a decrease in workforce.Noninterest expenses decreased $31 million to $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to $1.4 billion for the same period in 2017. Excluding the $84 million proforma effect of Topic 606 to the nine months ended September 30, 2017, noninterest expenses increased $53 million, reflecting increases of $46 million in salaries and benefits expense and $7 million each in outside processing fee expense (proforma) and restructuring charges, partially offset by a $5 million business tax refund included in other noninterest expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2018. The increase in salaries and benefits expense was primarily due to the same reasons as discussed above. For further information about restructuring charges associated with the GEAR Up initiative, see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.46Table of ContentsProvision for Income TaxesThe provision for income taxes decreased $45 million to $63 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to $108 million for the same period in 2017, and decreased $63 million to $210 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to $273 million for the same period in 2017. The decreases were primarily due to decreases in the statutory tax rate in 2018 resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as well as discrete tax benefits resulting from a review of certain tax capitalization and recovery positions related to software and fixed assets included in the 2017 tax return, partially offset by lower tax benefits from employee stock transactions and higher pre-tax income. These discrete tax benefits were $23 million and $48 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018, respectively, compared to $2 million and $31 million for the same periods in 2017. STRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESSThe Corporation has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, the Finance division is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes items not directly associated with these business segments or the Finance segment. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Market segment results are also provided for the Corporation's three primary geographic markets: Michigan, California and Texas. In addition to the three primary geographic markets, Other Markets is also reported as a market segment. Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of these business and market segments for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.The Corporation's management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. These methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines. During the third quarter 2018, the Small Business component was reclassified from Retail Bank to Business Bank. Results in all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the change in organizational structure. Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation's 2017 Annual Report describes the Corporation's segment reporting methodology.Net interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities plus the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing (FTP). The FTP methodology allocates each business segment credits for deposits and other funds provided and charges each business segment for loans and other assets being funded. FTP crediting rates for deposits and other funds provided reflect the long-term value of deposits and other funding sources, based on their implied maturities. FTP charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost of funds based on the pricing and duration characteristics of the assets. Therefore, net interest income for each segment primarily reflects the volume and associated FTP impacts of loan and deposit levels. FTP crediting rates on deposits were higher in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 than in the same period in the prior year, and as a result, net interest income for deposit-providing business segments has been positively impacted during the current year. As overall market rates increased, FTP charges for funding loans increased for asset-generating business segments in the nine months ended September 30, 2018, compared to the same period in the prior year.The following sections present a summary of the performance of each of the Corporation's business and market segments for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year. The proforma effect of Topic 606 to the nine months ended September 30, 2017, reducing both noninterest income and noninterest expenses by $84 million, primarily impacted the Business Bank and Other Markets segments.47Table of ContentsBusiness SegmentsThe following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.

Average loans increased $471 million and average deposits decreased $1.8 billion. Net interest income increased $81 million to $1.2 billion. An increase in loan income of $260 million was mostly offset by a $25 million increase in deposit costs and a $156 million increase in allocated net FTP charges. The FTP allocation reflected an increase in funding charges as well as increases in crediting rates on deposits as a result of higher short-term rates. The provision for credit losses decreased $61 million to a benefit of $9 million, primarily reflecting decreases in Technology and Life Sciences as well as Corporate Banking. Net credit-related charge-offs decreased $39 million to $40 million, primarily reflected decreases in Energy, Technology and Life Sciences and Small Business. Excluding the $74 million proforma effect to the prior year of Topic 606, noninterest income increased $4 million, and noninterest expenses increased $30 million.

EGRRCPA also revised the definition of High Volatility Commercial Real Estate (HVCRE) exposure for regulatory capital calculations. The Corporation adopted the revised HVCRE definition effective September 30, 2018. The resulting change in regulatory capital ratios was not significant.The Corporation expects to continue to return excess capital to shareholders with a target of reaching a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 9.5 percent to 10 percent by the end of 2019. The timing and ultimate amount of future distributions will be subject to various factors including financial performance, capital position and market conditions. On July 24, 2018, the Board approved a plan to repurchase up to $500 million in common shares in the third quarter as well as a 26-cent increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.60 per share, effective for the dividend paid on October 1, 2018. During the third quarter 2018, the Corporation completed the repurchase of 5.1 million common shares for $500 million through an Accelerated Share Repurchase transaction (ASR).The Corporation announced plans to repurchase up to $500 million of common shares in the fourth quarter of 2018, under the Corporation's equity repurchase program and entered into an ASR to facilitate the repurchase. Under the terms of the ASR agreement, the Corporation received an initial delivery of common shares representing approximately 80% of the expected total to be repurchased. Subject to certain adjustments pursuant to the ASR agreement, the final number of shares repurchased and delivered under the ASR agreement will be based on the volume-weighted average share price of the Corporation's common stock during the term of the repurchase agreement, which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2018. Authorization to repurchase up to an additional 10 million shares of Comerica Incorporated outstanding common stock was announced by the Board on July 24, 2018. This is in addition to the 6.2 million shares and 800 thousand warrants remaining at June 30, 2018 under the Board's prior authorizations for the equity repurchase program initially approved in November 2010. Including the July 24, 2018 authorization, a total of 65.2 million shares and 14.1 million warrants (12.1 million share-equivalents) have been authorized for repurchase under the equity repurchase program since its inception in 2010. There is no expiration date for the Corporation's equity repurchase program. 51Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes the Corporation's repurchase activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.(shares in thousands)Total Number of Shares and Warrants Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Repurchase Plans or Programs (a) RemainingRepurchaseAuthorization (b) Total Numberof Shares and WarrantsPurchased (c) Average PricePaid Per ShareTotal first quarter 20181,565 8,714 1,674 $95.16Total second quarter 20181,755 6,952 1,759 96.32July 20184,140 12,791(d)4,142 97.32August 2018— 12,744 — —September 2018997 11,706 1,001 97.31Total third quarter 20185,137 11,706 5,143 97.32Total 2018 year-to-date8,457 11,706 8,576 96.69(a)The Corporation made no repurchases of warrants under the repurchase program during the nine months ended September 30, 2018. Upon exercise of a warrant, the number of shares with a value equal to the aggregate exercise price is withheld from an exercising warrant holder as payment (known as a "net exercise provision"). During the nine months ended September 30, 2018, Comerica withheld the equivalent of approximately 67,000 shares to cover an aggregate $2 million in exercise price and issued approximately 157,000 shares to the exercising warrant holders. Shares withheld in connection with the net exercise provision are not included in the total number of shares or warrants purchased in the above table.(b)Maximum number of shares and warrants that may yet be purchased under the publicly announced plans or programs.(c)Includes approximately 119,000 shares purchased pursuant to deferred compensation plans and shares purchased from employees to pay for taxes related to restricted stock vesting under the terms of an employee share-based compensation plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2018.

The allowance for loan losses represents management's assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent 52Table of Contentsin the Corporation's loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, provides for probable losses inherent in lending-related commitments, including unused commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.The allowance for loan losses was $664 million at September 30, 2018, compared to $712 million at December 31, 2017, a decrease of $48 million, or 7 percent. As a percentage of total loans, the allowance for loan losses was 1.35 percent at September 30, 2018, compared to 1.45 percent at December 31, 2017. The decrease in the allowance for loan losses reflected continued improvement in credit quality of the portfolio, including a $561 million decline in criticized loans and lower levels of net loan charge-offs.The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain letters of credit in a manner consistent with business loans, and allowances based on the pool of the remaining letters of credit and all unused commitments to extend credit within each internal risk rating. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $33 million and $42 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The decrease in the allowance reflected decreases in commercial commitments, primarily related to Energy.For additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses, refer to page F-34 in the "Critical Accounting Policies" section and pages F-50 and F-52 in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation's 2017 Annual Report.Nonperforming AssetsNonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, troubled debt restructured loans (TDRs) which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans) and foreclosed property.

Credit quality in the real estate construction loan portfolio was strong, with criticized loans of $31 million and $4 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, and no real estate construction loan charge-offs in either of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Criticized commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line totaled $62 million and $72 million at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. In other business lines, $215 million and $229 million of commercial mortgage loans were criticized at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Commercial mortgage loan net recoveries were $1 million and $5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Residential Real Estate LendingThe following table summarizes the Corporation's residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios by geographic market.

The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation's primary geographic markets. Substantially all residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more are placed on nonaccrual status, and substantially all junior lien home equity loans that are current or less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status if full collection of the senior position is in doubt. At no later than 180 days past due, such loans are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell.Residential mortgages totaled $1.9 billion at September 30, 2018 and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.9 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $34 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2018. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.7 billion at September 30, 2018, of which $1.6 billion was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit, $130 million were on amortizing status and $37 million were closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.7 billion of home equity 56Table of Contentsloans outstanding, $19 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2018. A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at September 30, 2018. Energy LendingThe Corporation has a portfolio of Energy loans that is included primarily in commercial loans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Customers in the Corporation's Energy line of business (approximately 160 relationships) are engaged in three segments of the oil and gas business: exploration and production (E&P), midstream and energy services. E&P generally includes such activities as searching for potential oil and gas fields, drilling exploratory wells and operating active wells. Commitments to E&P borrowers are generally subject to semi-annual borrowing base re-determinations based on a variety of factors including updated pricing (reflecting market and competitive conditions), energy reserve levels and the impact of hedging. The midstream sector is generally involved in the transportation, storage and marketing of crude and/or refined oil and gas products. The Corporation's energy services customers provide products and services primarily to the E&P segment.The following table summarizes information about the Corporation's portfolio of Energy loans.

Total exposure, including unused commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, was approximately $4 billion at both September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.The Corporation's allowance methodology considers the various risk elements within the loan portfolio. The Corporation continued to incorporate a qualitative reserve component for Energy loans at September 30, 2018. There were $3 million and $7 million in net credit-related charge-offs for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018, respectively compared to $9 million and $24 million for the same periods in 2017.Automotive LendingSubstantially all dealer loans are in the National Dealer Services business line. Loans in the National Dealer Services business line primarily include floor plan financing and other loans to automotive dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in commercial loans, totaled $3.7 billion at September 30, 2018, a decrease of $615 million compared to $4.4 billion at December 31, 2017. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, including $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Automotive lending also includes loans to borrowers involved with automotive production, primarily Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers. Loans to borrowers involved with automotive production totaled $1.4 billion at September 30, 2018, compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2017.For further discussion of credit risk, see the "Credit Risk" section of pages F-20 through F-28 in the Corporation's 2017 Annual Report.Market and Liquidity RiskMarket risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse movements in market rates or prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. Liquidity risk represents the failure to meet financial obligations coming due, resulting from an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding, and the inability to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significant changes in pricing, due to inadequate market depth or market disruptions.The Asset and Liability Policy Committee (ALCO) of the Corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities. ALCO meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies, and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit gathering and risk management. The Treasury department mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of ALCO through the actions it takes to manage the Corporation's market, liquidity and capital positions.In addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis, Corporate Treasury also monitors the parent company's liquidity and has established limits for the minimum number of months into the future in which the parent company can meet 57Table of Contentsexisting and forecasted obligations without the support of additional dividends from subsidiaries. ALCO's liquidity policy requires the parent company to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet expected capital and debt obligations with a target of 24 months but no less than 18 months.Corporate Treasury supports ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk and, in coordination with Enterprise Risk, managing all other market risks. Key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analysis of the Corporation's balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks; (ii) monitoring and reporting of the Corporation's positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines; (iii) developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions; (iv) reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval; and (v) monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks.Interest Rate RiskNet interest income is the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities, primarily through the Corporation's core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by core deposits. The Corporation's loan composition at September 30, 2018 was 62 percent 30-day LIBOR, 12 percent other LIBOR (primarily 60-day), 17 percent prime and 9 percent fixed rate. This creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the floating-rate loan portfolio and more slowly repricing deposit products. In addition, the growth and/or contraction in the Corporation's loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing fixed-rate investment securities, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, as well as hedging with interest rate swaps. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.Since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives, a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk. These techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses. Simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors, including, but not limited to, the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, regulatory impacts and management strategies.Sensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest RatesThe analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is management's principal risk management technique. Management models a base case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment. Existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes are included in the analysis, but no additional hedging is currently forecasted. These derivative instruments currently comprise interest rate swaps that convert fixed-rate long-term debt to variable rates. This base case net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which rates rise or decline in a linear, non-parallel fashion from the base case over 12 months. One scenario presented increases short-term interest rates 200 basis points, resulting in an average increase in short-term interest rates of 100 basis points over the period (+200 scenario). The other scenario decreases short-term interest rates 200 basis points (but not to less than zero), resulting in an average decrease in short-term rates of 100 basis points over the period (-200 scenario).Each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth, investment security prepayment levels, depositor behavior, yield curve changes, loan and deposit pricing, and overall balance sheet mix and growth. In this low rate environment, depositors have maintained a higher level of liquidity and their historical behavior may be less indicative of future trends. As a result, the +200 scenario reflects a greater decrease in deposits than we have experienced historically as rates begin to rise. Changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis.The table below, as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above. Estimated Annual Change September 30, 2018 December 31, 2017(in millions)Amount % Amount %Change in Interest Rates:       Rising 200 basis points$181 8 % $197 9 %Declining 200 basis points(321) (13) (283) (13)58Table of ContentsSensitivity to rising rates changed modestly from December 31, 2017 to September 30, 2018, primarily due to balance sheet changes. The December 31, 2017 risk to declining interest rates is impacted by an assumed floor on interest rates of zero percent, and therefore simulates a decline of 150 basis points while the September 30, 2018 sensitivity reflects a decline of 200 basis points due to higher short-term rates. Sensitivity of Economic Value of Equity to Changes in Interest RatesIn addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income, an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position. The economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the Corporation's financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements. The Corporation primarily monitors the percentage change on the base case economic value of equity. The economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel 200 basis point increase. The declining interest rate scenarios are based on decreases of 200 basis points and 150 basis points in interest rates at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.The table below, as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above. September 30, 2018 December 31, 2017(in millions)Amount % Amount %Change in Interest Rates:       Rising 200 basis points$856 6 % $1,188 9 %Declining 200 basis points(2,761) (20) (2,635) (20)The sensitivity of the economic value of equity to a 200 basis point parallel increase in rates declined between December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2018 due to an increase in the modeled base case economic value of equity, which was driven by balance sheet changes. The percentage change in sensitivity of the economic value of equity to a parallel decrease in rates to zero during the same period was stable.Wholesale FundingThe Corporation may access the purchased funds market when necessary, which includes a variety of funding sources. Capacity for incremental purchased funds at September 30, 2018 included short-term FHLB advances, the ability to purchase federal funds, sell securities under agreements to repurchase, as well as issue deposits through brokers. Purchased funds increased to $97 million at September 30, 2018, compared to $25 million at December 31, 2017. At September 30, 2018, the Bank had pledged loans totaling $21.9 billion which provided for up to $18.1 billion of available collateralized borrowing with the FRB.The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Dallas, Texas, which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. At September 30, 2018, $15.9 billion of real estate-related loans were pledged to the FHLB as blanket collateral for current and potential future borrowings. The Corporation had $3.8 billion of outstanding borrowings maturing between 2026 and 2028 and capacity for potential future borrowings of approximately $5.2 billion.On July 31, 2018, the Corporation issued $850 million of 3.70% senior notes maturing in 2023, swapped to floating rate at 30-day LIBOR plus 80 basis points. Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, investments in or advances to existing or future subsidiaries, and repurchases, maturities and redemptions of other outstanding securities. Pending such use, the net proceeds will be invested for the short term.Additionally, as of September 30, 2018 the Bank had the ability to issue up to $14 billion of debt under an existing $15 billion note program which allows the issuance of debt with maturities between three months and 30 years. The Corporation also maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and/or equity securities.The ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise funds at competitive rates is impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings of the Corporation and the Bank. As of September 30, 2018, the three major rating agencies had assigned the following ratings to long-term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Liquid assets totaled $17.5 billion at September 30, 2018, compared to $17.4 billion at December 31, 2017. Liquid assets include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits with banks, other short-term investments and unencumbered investment securities. The Corporation performs monthly liquidity stress testing to evaluate its ability to meet funding needs in hypothetical stressed environments. Such environments cover a series of broad events, distinguished in terms of duration and severity. The evaluation as of September 30, 2018 projected sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events.60Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe Corporation’s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation's 2017 Annual Report. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation’s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2017, the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to the allowance for credit losses, fair value measurement, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages F-34 through F-37 in the Corporation's 2017 Annual Report. As of the date of this report, there have been no significant changes to the Corporation's critical accounting policies or estimates, except as discussed below.GoodwillGoodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level, equivalent to a business segment or one level below. The Corporation has three reporting units: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. At December 31, 2017, goodwill totaled $635 million, including $380 million allocated to the Business Bank, $194 million allocated to the Retail Bank and $61 million allocated to Wealth Management.The annual test of goodwill impairment was performed as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2018. The Corporation first assessed qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. Qualitative factors included economic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, regulatory developments and performance of the Corporation’s stock, among other events and circumstances. At the conclusion of the qualitative assessment in the third quarter 2018, the Corporation determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.Subsequent to the date of the annual impairment test, the Corporation reorganized certain reporting structures. As a result, Small Business Banking, formerly a component of the Retail Bank, became a component of the Business Bank. Accordingly, the Corporation reallocated $93 million of goodwill from the Retail Bank to the Business Bank. At September 30, 2018, goodwill totaled $635 million, including $473 million allocated to the Business Bank, $101 million allocated to the Retail Bank and $61 million allocated to Wealth Management. The Corporation subsequently performed an additional qualitative impairment analysis and again determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and that performing a quantitative impairment test was not necessary.Qualitative factors considered in the analysis of each reporting unit incorporated current economic and market conditions, including the recent Federal Reserve announcements and the impact of legislative and regulatory changes, to the extent known. However, further weakening in the economic environment, such as adverse changes in interest rates, a decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below their carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Additionally, new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management's expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Any impairment charge would not affect the Corporation's regulatory capital ratios, tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position. 61Table of ContentsSUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATAThe Corporation believes non-GAAP measures are meaningful because they reflect adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and our performance trends. Tangible common equity is used by Comerica to measure the quality of capital and the return relative to balance sheet risk.
