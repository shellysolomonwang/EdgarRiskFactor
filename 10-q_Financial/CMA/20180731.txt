Item 1A. Risk Factors” beginning on page 11 of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. The Corporation does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect facts, circumstances, assumptions or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made. For any forward-looking statements made in this report or in any documents, the Corporation claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.38Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSNet income for the three months ended June 30, 2018 was $326 million, an increase of $123 million from $203 million reported for the three months ended June 30, 2017. Net income per diluted common share for the same respective periods was $1.87 compared to $1.13. Management of loan and deposit pricing in a rising rate environment, improved credit quality, successful execution of GEAR Up initiatives and a decrease in the federal statutory tax rate in 2018 resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act contributed to the increase in net income. Net income included tax benefits from employee stock transactions of $3 million (2 cents per share) and $5 million (3 cents per share) for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. After-tax restructuring charges were $9 million (5 cents per share) in both periods.Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2018 was $607 million, an increase of $202 million from $405 million reported for the six months ended June 30, 2017. Net income per diluted common share for the same respective periods was $3.46 compared to $2.24. Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2018 included $22 million of tax benefits from employee stock transactions (13 cents per share), $21 million of restructuring charges, after-tax, (12 cents per share) and a $3 million deferred tax benefit resulting from the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (1 cent per share). Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2017 included tax benefits from employee stock transactions of $29 million (16 cents per share) and a $16 million after-tax impact from restructuring charges (9 cents per share).Growth in Efficiency and Revenue InitiativeSince the GEAR Up initiative was launched in 2016, the Corporation has consolidated 38 banking centers, implemented a new retirement program resulting in a significant reduction in retirement plan expense and reduced the number of full-time equivalent employees by over 900, including a reduction of approximately 100 in the first six months of 2018, among other initiatives. The impact of increases in short-term rates and the execution of certain GEAR Up initiatives helped lower the efficiency ratio to 53.2 percent and 54.7 percent for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018, respectively, and increase return on equity to 16.4 percent and 15.4 percent for the same periods, respectively. The Corporation anticipates cumulative benefits to pre-tax income from GEAR Up initiatives of approximately $270 million and $305 million for full-year 2018 and 2019, respectively, relative to when the initiative was announced. For further details on anticipated additional benefits, refer to page F-5 of the Corporation's 2017 Annual Report.Total pre-tax restructuring charges for 2018 are expected to range from $47 million to $52 million with no restructuring charges anticipated beyond 2018. Cumulative restructuring charges from inception of GEAR Up through 2018 are expected to range from $185 million to $190 million. For additional information regarding restructuring charges, refer to note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.2018 Second-Half OutlookFor the second half of 2018, management expects the following, assuming a continuation of the current economic and rate environment as well as the benefits from the GEAR Up initiative:•Moderate growth in average loans◦Growth in most lines of business with a slower pace in general Middle Market, National Dealer Services and Mortgage Banker Finance due to seasonality.◦Energy and Corporate Banking to remain stable. •Net interest income higher, reflecting recent rate increases, loan growth and three additional days.◦Full-year 2018 net benefit of $70 million from the first quarter 2018 rate increase and $35 million to $40 million from the second quarter 2018 rate increase.◦Elevated interest recoveries not expected to repeat ($11 million in second quarter 2018).•Provision for credit losses of $10 million to $20 million per quarter and net charge-offs to remain low.•Noninterest income growth trend to continue benefiting from the execution of GEAR Up initiatives to help drive growth in treasury management income, card fees and fiduciary income.•Noninterest expenses modestly higher (excluding restructuring charges) primarily due to additional days.◦GEAR Up savings remain on track.◦Continued higher technology expenditures.◦Seasonal and typical inflationary pressures leading to higher occupancy and advertising expenses.◦Restructuring charges of $20 million to $25 million.•Income tax expense to be approximately 23 percent of pre-tax income, excluding any tax impact from employee stock transactions..39Table of ContentsNet Interest IncomeQuarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume Three Months Ended June 30, 2018 June 30, 2017(dollar amounts in millions)AverageBalanceInterestAverageRate AverageBalanceInterestAverageRateCommercial loans$30,966$3574.64% $30,632$2833.71%Real estate construction loans3,189415.12 2,910294.08Commercial mortgage loans9,1741074.65 9,012873.88Lease financing45743.65 52610.60International loans981135.02 1,139123.99Residential mortgage loans1,993203.88 1,975183.61Consumer loans2,465264.35 2,529233.62Total loans49,2255684.63 48,7234533.73        Mortgage-backed securities9,098522.25 9,336502.17Other investment securities2,701121.71 2,896121.67Total investment securities 11,799642.12 12,232622.05        Interest-bearing deposits with banks3,957181.82 5,263141.03Other short-term investments133—0.94 92—0.58Total earning assets65,1146503.98 66,3105293.21        Cash and due from banks1,235   1,148  Allowance for loan losses(708)   (726)  Accrued income and other assets4,879   4,614  Total assets$70,520   $71,346          Money market and interest-bearing checking deposits$22,187260.47 $21,66170.13Savings deposits2,231—0.04 2,142—0.02Customer certificates of deposit2,06320.38 2,52720.36Foreign office time deposits33—1.13 57—0.60Total interest-bearing deposits26,514280.42 26,38790.15        Short-term borrowings56—1.74 147—1.12Medium- and long-term debt5,584322.24 5,161201.48Total interest-bearing sources32,154600.74 31,695290.37        Noninterest-bearing deposits29,316   30,741  Accrued expenses and other liabilities1,073   966  Total shareholders’ equity7,977   7,944  Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity$70,520   $71,346          Net interest income/rate spread $5903.24  $5002.84        Impact of net noninterest-bearing sources of funds  0.38   0.19Net interest margin (as a percentage of average earning assets)  3.62%   3.03%40Table of ContentsQuarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume (continued) Three Months Ended June 30, 2018/June 30, 2017(in millions)IncreaseDue to RateIncrease(Decrease)Due to Volume (a)NetIncreaseInterest Income:      Loans$108 $7 $115 Investment securities2 — 2 Interest-bearing deposits with banks10 (6) 4  Total interest income120 1 121 Interest Expense:      Interest-bearing deposits20 (1) 19 Medium- and long-term debt11 1 12 Total interest expense31 — 31  Net interest income$89 $1 $90 (a)Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume.Net interest income was $590 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, an increase of $90 million compared to $500 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The increase in net interest income reflected the net benefit from higher rates. The impact of a $502 million increase in average loans was largely offset by a $1.3 billion decrease in interest-bearing deposits with banks, primarily Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) deposits. The net interest margin for the three months ended June 30, 2018 increased 59 basis points to 3.62 percent, from 3.03 percent for the comparable period in 2017, reflecting the net benefit from higher rates and the decrease in lower-yielding average balances deposited with the FRB.41Table of ContentsYear-to-Date Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume Six Months Ended June 30, 2018 June 30, 2017(dollar amounts in millions)AverageBalanceInterestAverageRate AverageBalanceInterestAverageRateCommercial loans$30,556$6724.44% $30,166$5393.61%Real estate construction loans3,129774.93 2,934573.95Commercial mortgage loans9,1952054.49 8,9941703.81Lease financing46193.93 54862.00International loans989244.81 1,174233.88Residential mortgage loans2,002383.78 1,969353.59Consumer loans2,493524.24 2,528443.52Total loans48,8251,0774.45 48,3138743.65        Mortgage-backed securities9,1331042.23 9,321992.16Other investment securities2,722241.71 2,894241.63Total investment securities 11,8551282.11 12,2151232.03        Interest-bearing deposits with banks4,251351.68 5,857280.92Other short-term investments132—0.84 92—0.63Total earning assets65,0631,2403.83 66,4771,0253.11        Cash and due from banks1,248   1,164  Allowance for loan losses(713)   (733)  Accrued income and other assets4,825   4,673  Total assets$70,423   $71,581          Money market and interest-bearing checking deposits$22,039400.37 $22,066140.13Savings deposits2,205—0.03 2,114—0.02Customer certificates of deposit2,09240.36 2,62140.37Foreign office time deposits32—1.13 50—0.55Total interest-bearing deposits26,368440.34 26,851180.14        Short-term borrowings45—1.63 85—1.07Medium- and long-term debt5,390572.11 5,159371.39Total interest-bearing sources31,8031010.64 32,095550.35        Noninterest-bearing deposits29,591   30,601  Accrued expenses and other liabilities1,077   980  Total shareholders’ equity7,952   7,905  Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity$70,423   $71,581          Net interest income/rate spread $1,1393.19  $9702.76        Impact of net noninterest-bearing sources of funds  0.33   0.18Net interest margin (as a percentage of average earning assets)  3.52%   2.94%42Table of ContentsYear-to-Date Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume (continued) Six Months Ended June 30, 2018/June 30, 2017 (in millions)IncreaseDue to RateIncrease(Decrease)Due to Volume (a)NetIncrease Interest Income:      Loans$191 $12 $203  Investment securities5 — 5  Interest-bearing deposits with banks21 (14) 7   Total interest income217 (2) 215  Interest Expense:      Interest-bearing deposits27 (1) 26  Medium- and long-term debt21 (1) 20  Total interest expense48 (2) 46   Net interest income$169 $— $169  (a)Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume.Net interest income was $1.1 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2018, an increase of $169 million compared to $970 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017. The increase in net interest income primarily reflected the net benefit from higher rates. The impact of a $1.6 billion decrease in interest-bearing deposits with banks, primarily FRB deposits, was mostly offset by a $512 million increase in average loans. The net interest margin for the six months ended June 30, 2018 increased 58 basis points to 3.52 percent, from 2.94 percent for the comparable period in 2017, reflecting the net benefit from higher rates and the decrease in lower-yielding average balances deposited with the FRB.For further discussion of the effects of market rates on net interest income, refer to the "Market and Liquidity Risk" section of this financial review.Provision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses was a benefit of $29 million and $17 million for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to a provision expense of $17 million and $33 million for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2017, respectively. The provision for credit losses includes both the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The provision for loan losses is recorded to maintain the allowance for loan losses at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio. The provision for loan losses decreased $38 million from a provision expense of $15 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 to a benefit of $23 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. The decrease in the provision primarily reflected improved credit quality in most lines of business with the largest decreases in general Middle Market and Small Business. Gross charge-offs decreased $19 million to $20 million, and recoveries increased $2 million to $23 million, resulting in net loan recoveries of $3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018 compared to net loan charge-offs of $18 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The decrease in net charge-offs was driven by decreases in general Middle Market and Small Business. The provision for loan losses decreased $35 million from a provision expense of $26 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 to a benefit of $9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The decrease in the provision primarily reflected improved credit quality in Technology and Life Sciences as well as Small Business. Gross charge-offs decreased $26 million to $57 million, and recoveries were unchanged at $32 million, resulting in net loan charge-offs of $25 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to net loan charge-offs of $51 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017. The decrease in net charge-offs was driven by decreases in Technology and Life Sciences, Energy, Small Business and Corporate Banking, partially offset by an increase in general Middle Market.The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments is recorded to maintain the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments decreased $8 million from a provision expense of $2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 to a benefit of $6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments decreased $15 million from a provision expense of $7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 to a benefit of $8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018. The decrease in the provision reflected decreases in commercial commitments, primarily in Energy. There were no lending-related commitment charge-offs for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets is presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.43Table of ContentsPresentation Changes Noninterest income and noninterest expenses for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 reflect certain presentation changes resulting from the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," (Topic 606), effective January 1, 2018. These changes primarily impacted card fees and service charges on deposit accounts in noninterest income, fully offset by the impact to outside processing fee expense in noninterest expenses. See note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the adoption of Topic 606. The table below summarizes the proforma effects to the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2017.

Excluding the $28 million proforma effect of Topic 606 to the three months ended June 30, 2017, noninterest income was unchanged at $248 million. Increases of $6 million in card fees (proforma) and $1 million in fiduciary income were offset by decreases of $3 million in warrant income and $2 million each in service charges on deposit accounts (proforma) and customer derivative income. Noninterest income decreased $55 million to $492 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $547 million for the same period in the prior year. Excluding the $54 million proforma effect of Topic 606 to the six months ended June 30, 2017, noninterest income decreased $1 million, primarily reflecting decreases of $4 million each in service charges on deposit accounts (proforma) and customer derivative income, $3 million each in warrant income and deferred compensation asset returns as well as smaller decreases in various other categories, mostly offset by increases of $13 million in card fees (proforma) and $4 million in fiduciary income.44Table of ContentsThe following table illustrates certain categories included in other noninterest income on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

Income earned on these assets is reported in noninterest income and the resulting change in deferred compensation plan liabilities is reported in salaries and benefits expense. Changes in income earned on deferred compensation assets are substantially offset by changes in deferred compensation plan expense.Noninterest Expenses Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30,(in millions)2018 2017 2018 2017Salaries and benefits expense$250 $231 $505 $476Outside processing fee expense64 88 125 175Net occupancy expense37 38 75 76Equipment expense11 11 22 22Restructuring charges11 14 27 25Software expense32 31 63 60FDIC insurance expense12 12 25 25Advertising expense8 7 14 11Litigation-related expense— — — (2)Other noninterest expenses23 25 38 46Total noninterest expenses$448 $457 $894 $914Noninterest expenses decreased $9 million to $448 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $457 million for the same period in 2017. Excluding the $28 million proforma effect of Topic 606 to the three months ended June 30, 2017, noninterest expenses increased $19 million, primarily reflecting increases of $19 million in salaries and benefits expense and $4 million in outside processing fee expense (proforma), partially offset by a $3 million decrease in restructuring charges. The increase in salaries and benefits expense primarily reflected higher share-based and incentive compensation tied to financial performance as well as merit increases.Noninterest expenses decreased $20 million to $894 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $914 million for the same period in 2017. Excluding the $54 million proforma effect of Topic 606 to the six months ended June 30, 2017, noninterest expenses increased $34 million, reflecting increases of $29 million in salaries and benefits expense, $4 million in outside processing fee expense (proforma), $3 million each in software and advertising expense and smaller increases in various other categories, partially offset by a $5 million business tax refund included in other noninterest expenses in the six months ended June 30, 2018. The increase in salaries and benefits expense was primarily due to the same reasons as discussed above. For further information about restructuring charges associated with the GEAR Up initiative, see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements.Provision for Income TaxesThe provision for income taxes decreased $6 million to $93 million for the three months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $99 million for the same period in 2017, and decreased $18 million to $147 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to $165 million for the same period in 2017. The decreases were primarily due to the decrease in the statutory tax rate in 2018 resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, partially offset by higher pre-tax income and lower tax benefits from employee stock transactions. Income tax benefits from employee stock transactions were $3 million and $22 million for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018, respectively, compared to $5 million and $29 million for the same periods in 2017.STRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESSThe Corporation has strategically aligned its operations into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, the Finance division is also reported as a segment. The 45Table of ContentsOther category includes items not directly associated with these business segments or the Finance segment. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Market segment results are also provided for the Corporation's three primary geographic markets: Michigan, California and Texas. In addition to the three primary geographic markets, Other Markets is also reported as a market segment. Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of these business and market segments for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.The Corporation's management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. These methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines. Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation's 2017 Annual Report describes the Corporation's segment reporting methodology.Net interest income for each segment reflects the interest income generated by earning assets less interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities plus the net impact from associated internal funds transfer pricing (FTP). The FTP methodology allocates each business segment credits for deposits and other funds provided and charges each business segment for loans and other assets being funded. FTP crediting rates for deposits and other funds provided reflect the long-term value of deposits and other funding sources, based on their implied maturities. FTP charge rates for funding loans and other assets reflect a matched cost of funds based on the pricing and duration characteristics of the assets. Therefore, net interest income for each segment primarily reflects the volume and associated FTP impacts of loan and deposit levels. FTP crediting rates on deposits were higher in the six months ended June 30, 2018 than in the same period in the prior year, and as a result, net interest income for deposit-providing business segments has been positively impacted during the current year. As overall market rates increased, FTP charges for funding loans increased for asset-generating business segments in the six months ended June 30, 2018, compared to the same period in the prior year.The following sections present a summary of the performance of each of the Corporation's business and market segments for the six months ended June 30, 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year. The proforma effect of Topic 606 to the six months ended June 30, 2017, reducing both noninterest income and noninterest expenses by $54 million, primarily impacted the Business Bank and Other Markets segments.Business SegmentsThe following table presents net income (loss) by business segment. Six Months Ended June 30,(dollar amounts in millions)2018 2017Business Bank$432 80% $357 83%Retail Bank52 10 27 6Wealth Management55 10 46 11 539 100% 430 100%Finance45   (56)  Other (a)23   31  Total$607   $405  (a)Included tax benefits from employee stock transactions of $22 million and $29 million for the six months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and items not directly associated with the three major business segments or the Finance Division.The Business Bank's net income increased $75 million to $432 million. Average loans increased $684 million and average deposits decreased $2.3 billion. Net interest income increased $3 million to $671 million. An increase in loan income of $173 million was mostly offset by a $12 million increase in deposit costs and a $159 million increase in allocated net FTP charges. The FTP allocation reflected an increase in funding charges as well as increases in crediting rates on deposits as a result of higher short-term rates. The decline in deposit balances resulted in a decrease in FTP deposit credits. The provision for credit losses decreased $29 million to a benefit of $7 million, primarily reflecting decreases in Technology and Life Sciences and Corporate Banking, partially offset by an increase in Commercial Real Estate. Net credit-related charge-offs decreased $22 million to $18 million, primarily reflected decreases in Technology and Life Sciences and Energy. Excluding the $48 million proforma effect to the prior year of Topic 606, noninterest income decreased $1 million, and noninterest expenses increased $21 million. Noninterest income was primarily impacted by decreases of $7 million in customer derivative income, $3 million in letter of credit fees and smaller decreases in several other categories of noninterest income, partially offset by a $12 million increase in card fees (proforma). The increase in noninterest expenses primarily reflected increases of $6 million in outside processing fee expense (proforma), $5 million in corporate overhead and $3 million in salaries and benefits expense and smaller increases in other categories of noninterest income.46Table of ContentsThe Retail Bank's net income increased $25 million to $52 million. Average deposits increased $246 million. Net interest income increased $12 million to $334 million. An increase in loan income of $19 million was partially offset by a $5 million increase in deposit costs and a $2 million increase in allocated net FTP charges. The FTP allocation reflected an increase in funding charges as well as increases in crediting rates on deposits as a result of higher short-term rates. Higher deposit balances resulted in an increase in FTP deposit credits. The provision for credit losses decreased $22 million to a benefit of $5 million, primarily reflecting a decrease in Small Business. Net credit-related charge-offs decreased $6 million to $8 million, due to a decrease in Small Business. Excluding the $6 million proforma effect to the prior year of Topic 606, noninterest income decreased $6 million and noninterest expenses increased $2 million. Noninterest income was primarily impacted by decreases of $3 million in service charges on deposit accounts (proforma), $3 million in revenue related to a retirement savings program being wound down and smaller decreases in other categories of noninterest income, partially offset by a $3 million increase in card fees (proforma). Noninterest expenses was primarily impacted by increases of $6 million in salaries and benefits expense and $4 million in corporate overhead, partially offset by a decrease of $4 million in outside processing fee expense (proforma), $3 million of which was due to the wind-down of a retirement savings program, and smaller decreases in other categories of noninterest expenses.Wealth Management's net income increased $9 million to $55 million. Net interest income decreased $2 million to $81 million. The provision for credit losses was unchanged at a benefit of $3 million. Net credit-related recoveries decreased $2 million to $1 million. Noninterest income increased $7 million to $135 million, primarily reflecting a $5 million increase in fiduciary income. Noninterest expenses increased $6 million to $147 million, primarily reflecting increases of $4 million in salaries and benefits expense and $3 million in corporate overhead, partially offset by smaller decreases in other categories of noninterest expenses. Net income in the Finance segment was $45 million compared to a net loss of $56 million. Net interest income increased $147 million to $27 million, primarily reflecting a increase in net FTP revenue as a result of higher rates charged to the business segments under the Corporation's internal FTP methodology.Market SegmentsThe following table presents net income (loss) by market segment.

As such, at its meeting on July 24, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the Board) approved capital actions aimed at increasing shareholder returns while continuing to appropriately manage its capital base as well as support growth and investment in its business. The Board approved a 26-cent increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.60 per share, effective for the dividend payable October 1, 2018, as well as the repurchase of $500 million of outstanding common stock during third quarter 2018. The timing and ultimate amount of future distributions will be subject to various factors including financial performance, capital position and market conditions.49Table of ContentsAlso on July 24, 2018, the Board announced the authorization to repurchase of up to an additional 10 million shares of Comerica Incorporated outstanding common stock, in addition to the 6.2 million shares and 800 thousand warrants remaining at June 30, 2018 under the Board's prior authorizations for the equity repurchase program initially approved in November 2010. Including the July 24, 2018 authorization, a total of 65.2 million shares and 14.1 million warrants (12.1 million share-equivalents) have been authorized for repurchase under the equity repurchase program since its inception in 2010. There is no expiration date for the Corporation's equity repurchase program.

Upon exercise of a warrant, the number of shares with a value equal to the aggregate exercise price is withheld from an exercising warrant holder as payment (known as a "net exercise provision"). During the six months ended June 30, 2018, Comerica withheld the equivalent of approximately 34,000 shares to cover an aggregate $1 million in exercise price and issued approximately 81,000 shares to the exercising warrant holders. Shares withheld in connection with the net exercise provision are not included in the total number of shares or warrants purchased in the above table.(b)Maximum number of shares and warrants that may yet be purchased under the publicly announced plans or programs.(c)Includes approximately 113,000 shares purchased pursuant to deferred compensation plans and shares purchased from employees to pay for taxes related to restricted stock vesting under the terms of an employee share-based compensation plan during the six months ended June 30, 2018. These transactions are not considered part of the Corporation's repurchase program.On July 6, 2018, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System issued a statement announcing that, consistent with the recently enacted Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (EGRRCPA), bank holding companies with less than $100 billion in total assets are no longer subject to certain regulations and reporting requirements, such as Dodd-Frank Act stress testing, CCAR and the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, effective immediately. The Corporation is in the process of evaluating the full benefits of these changes.In November 2017, U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule that suspended the full transition for certain deductions and adjustments to regulatory capital calculations effective January 1, 2018 to remain at current levels and issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) intended to simplify certain aspects of the Basel III regulatory capital framework. The Corporation does not expect the proposed rule to have a significant impact on its capital ratios.The following table presents the minimum ratios required to be considered "adequately capitalized".Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets4.500%Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets6.000Total capital to risk-weighted assets8.000Capital conservation buffer (a)1.875Tier 1 capital to adjusted average assets (leverage ratio)4.000(a)In addition to the minimum risk-based capital requirements, the Corporation is required to maintain a minimum capital conservation buffer, in the form of common equity, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses. The required amount of the capital conservation buffer is being phased in and ultimately increases to 2.5% on January 1, 2019.

The allowance for loan losses represents management's assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporation's loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, provides for probable losses inherent in lending-related commitments, including unused commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.The allowance for loan losses was $677 million at June 30, 2018, compared to $712 million at December 31, 2017, a $35 million, or 5 percent, decrease. As a percentage of total loans, the allowance for loan losses was 1.36 percent at June 30, 2018, compared to 1.45 percent at December 31, 2017. The decrease in the allowance for loan losses reflected continued improvement in credit quality of the portfolio, including a $466 million decline in criticized loans and low net loan charge-offs.The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain letters of credit in a manner consistent with business loans, and allowances based on the pool of the remaining letters of credit and all unused commitments to extend credit within each internal risk rating. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $34 million and $42 million at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. The decrease in the allowance reflected decreases in commercial commitments, primarily related to Energy.For additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses, refer to page F-34 in the "Critical Accounting Policies" section and pages F-50 and F-52 in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation's 2017 Annual Report.Nonperforming AssetsNonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, troubled debt restructured loans (TDRs) which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans) and foreclosed property.

The home equity portfolio totaled $1.7 billion at June 30, 2018, of which $1.6 billion was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit, $132 million were on amortizing status and $40 million were closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.7 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $19 million were on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2018. A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at June 30, 2018. Energy LendingThe Corporation has a portfolio of Energy loans that is included primarily in commercial loans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Customers in the Corporation's Energy line of business (approximately 160 relationships) are engaged in three segments of the oil and gas business: exploration and production (E&P), midstream and energy services. E&P generally includes such activities as searching for potential oil and gas fields, drilling exploratory wells and operating active wells. Commitments to E&P borrowers are generally subject to semi-annual borrowing base re-determinations based on a variety of factors including updated pricing (reflecting market and competitive conditions), energy reserve levels and the impact of hedging. The midstream sector is generally involved in the transportation, storage and marketing of crude and/or refined oil and gas products. The Corporation's energy services customers provide products and services primarily to the E&P segment.The following table summarizes information about the Corporation's portfolio of Energy loans.

Total exposure, including unused commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, was approximately $4 billion at both June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.The Corporation's allowance methodology considers the various risk elements within the loan portfolio. The Corporation continued to incorporate a qualitative reserve component for Energy loans at June 30, 2018. There were $4 million net credit-related charge-offs for both the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2018 compared to $2 million and $15 million for the same periods in 2017.Automotive LendingSubstantially all dealer loans are in the National Dealer Services business line. Loans in the National Dealer Services business line primarily include floor plan financing and other loans to automotive dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in commercial loans, totaled $4.2 billion at June 30, 2018, a decrease of $120 million compared to $4.4 billion at December 31, 2017. At June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, including $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Automotive lending also includes loans to borrowers involved with automotive production, primarily Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers. Loans to borrowers involved with automotive production totaled $1.4 billion at June 30, 2018, compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2017.For further discussion of credit risk, see the "Credit Risk" section of pages F-20 through F-28 in the Corporation's 2017 Annual Report.Market and Liquidity RiskMarket risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse movements in market rates or prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. Liquidity risk represents the failure to meet financial obligations coming due, resulting from an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding, and the inability to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significant changes in pricing, due to inadequate market depth or market disruptions.54Table of ContentsThe Asset and Liability Policy Committee (ALCO) of the Corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities. ALCO meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies, and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit gathering and risk management. The Treasury department mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of ALCO through the actions it takes to manage the Corporation's market, liquidity and capital positions.Corporate Treasury supports ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk and, in coordination with Enterprise Risk, managing all other market risks. Key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analysis of the Corporation's balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks; (ii) monitoring and reporting of the Corporation's positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines; (iii) developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions; (iv) reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval; (v) monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market and liquidity risks; and (vi) developing and monitoring the interest rate risk economic capital estimate.Interest Rate RiskNet interest income is the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities, primarily through the Corporation's core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by core deposits. The Corporation's loan composition at June 30, 2018 was 63 percent 30-day LIBOR, 10 percent other LIBOR (primarily 60-day), 17 percent prime and 10 percent fixed rate. This creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the floating-rate loan portfolio and more slowly repricing deposit products. In addition, the growth and/or contraction in the Corporation's loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing fixed-rate investment securities, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, as well as hedging with interest rate swaps. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.Since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives, a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk. These techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve utilizing multiple simulation analyses. Simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors, including, but not limited to, the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, regulatory impacts and management strategiesSensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest RatesThe analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is management's principal risk management technique. Management models a base case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment. Existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes are included in the analysis, but no additional hedging is currently forecasted. These derivative instruments currently comprise interest rate swaps that convert fixed-rate long-term debt to variable rates. This base case net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which rates rise or decline in a linear, non-parallel fashion from the base case over 12 months. In the scenarios presented, short-term interest rates increase 200 basis points, resulting in an average increase in short-term interest rates of 100 basis points over the period (+200 scenario).  Each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth, investment security prepayment levels, depositor behavior, yield curve changes, loan and deposit pricing, and overall balance sheet mix and growth. In this low rate environment, depositors have maintained a higher level of liquidity and their historical behavior may be less indicative of future trends. As a result, the +200 scenario reflects a greater decrease in deposits than we have experienced historically as rates begin to rise. Changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis.55Table of ContentsThe table below, as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above. Estimated Annual Change June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017(in millions)Amount % Amount %Change in Interest Rates:       Rising 200 basis points$190 8 % $197 9 %Declining to zero percent(323) (14) (283) (13)Sensitivity to rising rates was relatively stable from December 31, 2017 to June 30, 2018. The risk to declining interest rates is impacted by an assumed floor on interest rates of zero percent, and therefore the December 31, 2017 sensitivity simulates a decline of 150 basis points while the June 30, 2018 sensitivity reflects a decline of 200 basis points due to higher short term rates. Sensitivity of Economic Value of Equity to Changes in Interest RatesIn addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income, an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position. The economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the Corporation's financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements. The economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel 200 basis point increase. The declining interest rate scenarios are based on decreases of 200 basis points and 150 basis points in interest rates at June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.The table below, as of June 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above. June 30, 2018 December 31, 2017(in millions)Amount % Amount %Change in Interest Rates:       Rising 200 basis points$1,009 7 % $1,188 9 %Declining to zero percent(2,893) (21) (2,635) (20)The sensitivity of the economic value of equity to a 200 basis point parallel increase in rates declined slightly between December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2018. The change in sensitivity of the economic value of equity to a parallel decrease in rates to zero during the same period was primarily driven by the increase in short-term rates between the periods, allowing for an additional 50 basis point decrease from December 31, 2017 to the June 30, 2018 scenario.Wholesale FundingThe Corporation may access the purchased funds market when necessary, which includes a variety of funding sources. Capacity for incremental purchased funds at June 30, 2018 included FHLB advances, the ability to purchase federal funds, sell securities under agreements to repurchase, as well as issue deposits through brokers. Purchased funds increased to $92 million at June 30, 2018, compared to $25 million at December 31, 2017. At June 30, 2018, the Bank had pledged loans totaling $22.1 billion which provided for up to $18.0 billion of available collateralized borrowing with the FRB.The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Dallas, Texas, which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. At June 30, 2018, $16.0 billion of real estate-related loans were pledged to the FHLB as blanket collateral for current and potential future borrowings. The Corporation had $3.8 billion of outstanding borrowings, including $1.0 billion borrowed in February 2018, maturing between 2026 and 2028 and capacity for potential future borrowings of approximately $5.5 billion.On July 31, 2018, the Corporation issued $850 million of 3.70% senior notes maturing in 2023, swapped to floating rate at 30-day LIBOR plus 80 basis points. Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital, investments in or advances to existing or future subsidiaries, and repurchases, maturities and redemptions of other outstanding securities. Pending such use, the net proceeds will be invested for the short term. Additionally, as of June 30, 2018 the Bank had the ability to issue up to $14 billion of debt under an existing $15 billion note program which allows the issuance of debt with maturities between three months and 30 years. The Corporation also maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and/or equity securities.56Table of ContentsThe ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise funds at competitive rates is impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings of the Corporation and the Bank. As of June 30, 2018, the three major rating agencies had assigned the following ratings to long-term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation’s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2017, the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to the allowance for credit losses, fair value measurement, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages F-34 through F-37 in the Corporation's 2017 Annual Report. As of the date of this report, there have been no significant changes to the Corporation's critical accounting policies or estimates.SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATAThe Corporation believes non-GAAP measures are meaningful because they reflect adjustments commonly made by management, investors, regulators and analysts to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and our performance trends. Tangible common equity is used by Comerica to measure the quality of capital and the return relative to balance sheet risk.

OTHER INFORMATIONITEM 1. Legal ProceedingsFor information regarding the Corporation's legal proceedings, see "Part I. Item 1. Note 12 – Contingent Liabilities," which is incorporated herein by reference.ITEM 1A. Risk FactorsOther than as set forth below, there has been no material change in the Corporation’s risk factors as previously disclosed in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 in response to Part I, Item 1A. of such Form 10-K. Such risk factors are incorporated herein by reference. Below we amend the following risk factors in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017:•General political, economic or industry conditions, either domestically or internationally, may be less favorable than expected.Local, domestic, and international events including economic, financial market, political and industry specific conditions affect the financial services industry, directly and indirectly. Conditions such as or related to inflation, recession, unemployment, volatile interest rates, international conflicts, changes in trade policies and other factors, such as real estate values, energy prices, state and local municipal budget deficits, government spending and the U.S. national debt, outside of our control may, directly and indirectly, adversely affect Comerica.•Changes in customer behavior may adversely impact Comerica's business, financial condition and results of operations.Comerica uses a variety of financial tools, models and other methods to anticipate customer behavior as a part of its strategic planning and to meet certain regulatory requirements. Individual, economic, political, industry-specific conditions and other factors outside of Comerica's control, such as fuel prices, energy costs, tariffs, real estate values or other factors that affect customer income levels, could alter predicted customer borrowing, repayment, investment and deposit practices. Such a change in these practices could materially adversely affect Comerica's ability to anticipate business needs and meet regulatory requirements.Further, difficult economic conditions may negatively affect consumer confidence levels. A decrease in consumer confidence levels would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on Comerica, Comerica's customers and others in the financial institutions industry.ITEM 2.
