The increase in net income in the three months ended September 30, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, reflected an increase of $17 million in noninterest income and decreases of $32 million in noninterest expenses and $14 million in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a decrease of $15 million in net interest income and an increase of $18 million in the provision for income taxes. Net income per diluted common share was $0.78 for the three months ended September 30, 2013, compared to $0.61 for the same period one year ago. Average diluted common shares were 187 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013, compared to 191 million for the same period in the prior year.Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 was $424 million, an increase of $33 million from $391 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2012. The increase in net income in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, reflected an $8 million increase in noninterest income and decreases of $81 million in noninterest expenses and $26 million in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a decrease of $62 million in net interest income and an increase of $20 million in the provision for income taxes. Net income per diluted common share was $2.23 for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, compared to $2.00 for the same period one year ago. Average diluted common shares were 187 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, compared to 194 million for the same period in the prior year.Full-Year and Fourth Quarter 2013 OutlookManagement expectations for full-year 2013 compared to full-year 2012 have not changed from the previously provided outlook, with the exception of customer-driven fees, which are expected to be modestly higher based on strong third quarter results.For fourth quarter 2013, management expects the following, assuming a continuation of the current slow growing economic environment:•Average loans for the fourth quarter 2013 are expected to be stable compared to third quarter 2013, reflecting auto-dealer floor plan loans rebounding from a seasonal low along with a continued decline in mortgage warehouse lending and economic uncertainty impacting demand.•Net interest income is expected to be lower for the fourth quarter 2013, compared to third quarter 2013, due to the continued impact from the low rate environment and a decrease in purchase accounting accretion.•The provision for credit losses for the fourth quarter 2013 is expected to remain low, similar to the levels in previous 2013 quarters.•Customer-driven noninterest income for the fourth quarter 2013 is expected to be relatively stable compared to third quarter 2013, while noncustomer-driven noninterest income is expected to be lower.•Fourth quarter 2013 noninterest expense is expected to be slightly lower compared to third quarter 2013, reflecting continued tight expense control.38Table of ContentsNet Interest IncomeQuarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume -

The decrease in net interest income in the three months ended September 30, 2013, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2012, resulted primarily from a decrease in yields and a $7 million decrease in the accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio, partially offset by an increase in average earning assets and a decrease in funding costs. Average earning assets increased $1.1 billion, or 2 percent, to $58.9 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2013, compared to $57.8 billion for the same period in 2012. The increase in average earning assets primarily reflected increases of $497 million in average loans and $1.0 billion in average interest-bearing deposits with banks, partially offset by a decrease of $411 million in average investment securities available-for-sale. The net interest margin (FTE) for the three months ended September 30, 2013 decreased 17 basis points to 2.79% percent, from 2.96% percent for the comparable period in 2012, primarily from decreased yields on loans and mortgage-backed investment securities, a decrease in accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio and an increase in excess liquidity, partially offset by lower deposit rates. The decrease in loan yields reflected a shift in the average loan portfolio mix, largely due to volume shifts in business mix, as well as lower LIBOR rates, positive credit quality migration throughout the portfolio, an increase in lower-yielding average commercial loans and a decrease in higher-yielding commercial mortgage loans. Yields on mortgage-backed investment securities decreased as a result of prepayments on higher-yielding securities and new investments in lower-yielding securities impacted by the lower rate environment. Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio increased the net interest margin by 5 basis points in the three months ended September 30, 2013, compared to 10 basis points in the same period in 2012, and excess liquidity reduced the net interest margin by approximately 24 basis points and 21 basis points in the three-month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Excess liquidity was represented by $5.2 billion and $4.2 billion of average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) in the three months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively, included in “interest-bearing deposits with banks” on the consolidated balance sheets.

The decrease in net interest income in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, resulted primarily from a decrease in yields and a $32 million decrease in the accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio, partially offset by an increase in average earning assets and lower funding costs. Average earning assets increased $1.9 billion, or 3 percent, to $58.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, compared to $56.9 billion for the same period in 2012. The increase in average earning assets primarily reflected increases of $1.5 billion in average loans and $525 million in average interest-bearing deposits with banks. The net interest margin (FTE) for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 decreased 25 basis points to 2.83 percent, from 3.08 percent for the comparable period in 2012, primarily due to the reasons cited in the quarterly discussion above. Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio increased the net interest margin by 6 basis points in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, compared to 14 basis points in the same period in 2012, and excess liquidity reduced the net interest margin by approximately 20 basis points for both the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2012. Excess liquidity was represented by $4.3 billion and $3.8 billion of average balances deposited with the FRB in first nine months of 2013 and 2012, respectively, included in “interest-bearing deposits with banks” on the consolidated balance sheets. The "Year-to-Date Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent" table above provides an analysis of net interest income (FTE) for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012 and details the components of the change in net interest income on a FTE basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year.For further discussion of the effects of market rates on net interest income, refer to the "Market and Liquidity Risk" section of this financial review.Provision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses was $8 million and $22 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013, and 2012, respectively, and $37 million and $63 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, and 2012, respectively. The provision for credit losses includes both the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The provision for loan losses is recorded to maintain the allowance for loan losses at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio. For a discussion of the allowance for loan losses and the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for loan losses, refer to the "Credit Risk" and "Critical Accounting Policies" sections of this financial review. The provision for loan losses was $10 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013, compared to $23 million for the three months ended September 30, 2012, and was $35 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, compared to $54 million for the same period in the prior year. Credit quality in the loan portfolio continued to improve in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, compared to the same periods in the prior year, in part reflecting improvements in the U.S. economy. Improvements in credit quality included a decline of $977 million in the Corporation's internal watch list loans from September 30, 2012 to September 30, 2013. Reflected in the decline in watch list loans was a decrease in nonaccrual loans of $228 million. The Corporation's internal watch list is generally consistent with loans in the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful categories defined by regulatory authorities.42Table of ContentsNet loan charge-offs in the three months ended September 30, 2013 decreased $24 million to $19 million, or 0.18 percent of average total loans, compared to $43 million, or 0.39 percent, for the three months ended September 30, 2012. Net loan charge-offs in the first nine months of 2013 decreased $73 million to $60 million, or 0.18 percent of average total loans, compared to $133 million, or 0.41 percent, for the same period in 2012. The $24 million decrease in net loan charge-offs in the three months ended September 30, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, and the $73 million decrease in net loan charge-offs in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, reflected decreases in all geographic markets and across most business lines. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments is recorded to maintain the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was a benefit of $2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2013, a decrease of $1 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2012, and was a provision of $2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, a decrease of $7 million compared to $9 million for the comparable period in prior year. The $7 million decrease in the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments in the first nine months of 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, resulted primarily from the reduction of specific reserves established in 2012 for set aside/bonded stop loss commitments related to residential real estate construction credits in the California market. The reserves for set aside/bonded stop loss commitments were reduced in 2013 as the underlying commitments were funded and simultaneously charged-off against the allowance for loan losses. Lending-related commitment charge-offs were insignificant for the three months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012.An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets is presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.Noninterest Income Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30,(in millions)2013 2012 2013 2012Customer-driven income:       Service charges on deposit accounts$53 $53 $161 $162Fiduciary income41 39 128 116Commercial lending fees28 22 71 71Letter of credit fees17 19 49 54Card fees (a)20 16 55 48Foreign exchange income9 9 27 29Brokerage fees5 5 14 14Other customer-driven income (b)22 21 66 64Total customer-driven noninterest income195 184 571 558Noncustomer-driven income:       Bank-owned life insurance12 10 31 30Net securities gains (losses) 1 — (1) 11Other noncustomer-driven income (b)6 3 21 15Total noninterest income$214 $197 $622 $614(a)In the third quarter 2013, the Corporation reclassified PIN-based interchange and certain other similar fees to "card fees" from "other noninterest income." Prior period amounts reclassified to conform to current presentation were $5 million each for second and first quarter 2013, and $4 million, $5 million and $4 million for the third, second and first quarters 2012, respectively. In addition, $5 million was reclassified for fourth quarter 2012.(b)The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income.Noninterest income was $214 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013, an increase of $17 million compared to $197 million for the same period in 2012. Commercial lending fees increased $6 million  in the three months ended September 30, 2013 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2012, primarily due to an increase in syndication agent fees. Card fees increased $4 million, primarily reflecting volume-driven increases in commercial charge card and debit card interchange revenue. Other noninterest income increased $4 million, primarily from a $7 million increase in income from principal investing and warrants, partially offset by a $3 million decrease in deferred compensation asset returns in the three months ended September 30, 2013, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2012. The decrease in deferred compensation asset returns in noninterest income is offset by an decrease in deferred compensation plan expense in noninterest expenses.Noninterest income was $622 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, an increase of $8 million compared to $614 million for the same period in 2012. Fiduciary income increased $12 million, primarily reflecting an increase in personal trust fees, largely driven by an increase in the volume of fiduciary services sold and increases in market value. In addition, card fees increased $7 million, primarily for the same reasons described in the quarterly discussion above. Net securities gains (losses) decreased $12 million, primarily reflecting an $11 million decrease in gains from the redemption of auction-rate securities in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012. 43Table of Contents The following table illustrates certain categories included in "other noninterest income" on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

There were no merger and restructuring charges in the three months ended September 30, 2013, compared to $25 million in the same period in 2012. Other noninterest expenses decreased $9 million, primarily reflecting a $12 million decrease in legal and litigation-related expenses, partially offset by the impact of $6 million of large gains recognized on the sale of assets included in other noninterest expenses in the third quarter 2012. Salaries expense increased $4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2013, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a year-to-date adjustment to senior officer incentive compensation in the three months ended September 30, 2013, based on favorable performance relative to peers, and an increase in business unit incentives, partially offset by a $3 million decrease in deferred compensation plan expense. Outside processing fee expense increased $4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2013, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2012, primarily due to increased activity tied to fee-based revenue growth, transactional costs related to increased volume and outsourcing of certain operational functions.Noninterest expenses were $1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, a decrease of $81 million compared to $1.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2012. There were no merger and restructuring charges in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, compared to $33 million in the same period in 2012. Other noninterest expenses decreased $29 million, primarily reflecting a $31 million decrease in legal and litigation-related expenses, as well as small decreases in several other categories of other noninterest expense, partially offset by the impact of $8 million of large gains recognized on the sale of assets 44Table of Contentsin the nine months ended September 30, 2012, and a $5 million loss on the sale of other foreclosed assets in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. Salaries expense decreased $16 million, primarily reflecting a decrease in executive incentive compensation and reduced staffing levels, partially offset by an increase in business unit incentives. Employee benefits expense increased $4 million, primarily due to an increase in pension expense, and outside processing fee expense increased $10 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily for the same reasons cited in the quarterly discussion above. Provision for Income TaxesThe provision for income taxes was $54 million for the three months ended September 30, 2013, compared to $36 million for the same period in 2012. The $18 million increase in the provision for income taxes in the three months ended September 30, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, was primarily due to an increase in pretax income during the same period, partially offset by a $4 million benefit related to an interest refund received from the Internal Revenue Service in the third quarter 2012. The provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 was $154 million, compared to $134 million for the same period in 2012. The $20 million increase in the provision for income taxes in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, was primarily due to the reasons cited in the quarterly discussion above.45Table of ContentsSTRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESSThe Corporation's management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. These methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines.In the first quarter 2013, the Corporation changed the method of assigning the allowance for loan losses to each segment. In 2012, national probability of default and loss given default statistics were incorporated into the Corporation's allowance methodology. Each segment was assigned an allowance for loan losses based on market-specific standard reserve factors applied to the loans in each segment, and the difference between the total allowance required on a national basis and the market-specific allowances was allocated based on the relative loan balances in each segment. Effective first quarter 2013, each segment is assigned an allowance for loan losses by applying national standard reserve factors to the loan balances in each segment by risk rating distribution. For comparability purposes, amounts in all periods are based on segments and methodologies in effect at September 30, 2013. Also in the first quarter 2013, the Corporation changed the method of allocating to the segments certain noninterest income and expense associated with commercial charge cards. The change did not have a material impact on segment operating results. For further information regarding the Corporation's segment methodologies, refer to page F-13 of the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report.Business SegmentsThe Corporation's operations are strategically aligned into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based upon the products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, Finance is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes discontinued operations and items not directly associated with these business segments or the Finance segment. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of these business segments for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012.The following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.

On an average basis, total liabilities decreased $458 million in the third quarter 2013, compared to the fourth quarter 2012, primarily due to decreases of $1.1 billion in medium- and long-term debt and $379 million in noninterest-bearing deposits, partially offset by an increase of $962 million in interest-bearing deposits. The decrease in medium- and long-term debt primarily reflected the May 2013 maturity of $1 billion of Federal Home Loan Bank advances.

Assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with specified risk-weighting factors. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items. As shown in the table below, the Corporation's capital ratios increased from December 31, 2012 to September 30, 2013.The Corporation's capital ratios exceeded minimum regulatory requirements as follows: September 30, 2013 December 31, 2012(dollar amounts in millions)Capital Ratio Capital RatioTier 1 common (a) (b)$6,863 10.74% $6,705 10.14%Tier 1 risk-based (4.00% - minimum) (b)6,863 10.74 6,705 10.14Total risk-based (8.00% - minimum) (b)8,593 13.44 8,695 13.15Leverage (3.00% - minimum) (b)6,863 10.88 6,705 10.57Tangible common equity (a)6,316 9.87 6,285 9.76(a)See Supplemental Financial Data section for reconcilements of non-GAAP financial measures.(b)September 30, 2013 capital and ratios are estimated.In July 2013, U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule for the U.S. adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework. The regulatory framework includes a more conservative definition of capital, two new capital buffers - a conservation buffer and a countercyclical buffer, new and more stringent risk weight categories for assets and off-balance sheet items, and a supplemental leverage ratio. As a banking organization subject to the standardized approach, the rules will be effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2015, with certain transition provisions fully phased in on January 1, 2018.According to the rule, the Corporation will be subject to the capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent, when fully phased in, to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses. However, the rules do not subject the Corporation to the capital countercyclical buffer of up to 2.5 percent or the supplemental leverage ratio. The Corporation estimates the September 30, 2013 Tier 1 and Tier 1 common risk-based ratio would be 10.4 percent if calculated under the final rule, excluding most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income from regulatory capital. The Corporation's September 30, 2013 estimated Tier 1 common and Tier 1 capital ratios exceed the minimum required by the final rule (7 percent and 8.5 percent, respectively, including the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer). For a reconcilement of these non-GAAP financial measures, refer to the "Supplemental Financial Data" section of this financial review.On October 24, 2013, U.S. banking regulators issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would implement a quantitative liquidity requirement in the U.S. (the proposed rule) generally consistent with the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) minimum liquidity measure established under the Basel III liquidity framework. Under the proposed rule, the Corporation would be subject to a modified LCR standard, which requires a financial institution to hold a buffer of high-quality, liquid assets to fully cover net cash outflows under a 21-day systematic liquidity stress scenario. Under the proposal, the LCR rules would be fully phased in on January 1, 2017, with a transition period beginning January 1, 2015. The Corporation is currently evaluating the potential impact of the proposed rule; however, we expect to meet the final requirements adopted by U.S. banking regulators within the required timetable. While the Corporation's liquidity position is currently strong, balance sheet dynamics may vary in the future and as a 52Table of Contentsresult the Corporation may decide to consider additional liquidity management initiatives if subject to the modified LCR as currently proposed. The Basel III liquidity framework includes a second minimum liquidity measure, the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), which requires the amount of available longer-term, stable sources of funding to be at least 100 percent of the required amount of longer-term stable funding over a one-year period. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is in the process of reviewing the proposed NSFR standard and evaluating its impact on the banking system. U.S. banking regulators have announced that they expect to issue proposed rulemaking to implement the NFSR in advance of its scheduled global implementation in 2018. While uncertainty exists in the final form and timing of the U.S. rule implementing the NSFR and whether or not the Corporation will be subject to the full requirements, the Corporation is closely monitoring the development of the rule. 53Table of ContentsRISK MANAGEMENTThe following updated information should be read in conjunction with the "Risk Management" section on pages F-23 through F-41 in the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report.Credit RiskAllowance for Credit LossesThe allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The allowance for loan losses represents management's assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporation's loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in "accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets, provides for probable losses inherent in lending-related commitments, including unused commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.The Corporation disaggregates the loan portfolio into segments for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses. These segments are based on the level at which the Corporation develops, documents and applies a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The Corporation's portfolio segments are business loans and retail loans. Business loans are defined as those belonging to the commercial, real estate construction, commercial mortgage, lease financing and international loan portfolios. Retail loans consist of traditional residential mortgage, home equity and other consumer loans.The allowance for loan losses includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain loans, and allowances for homogeneous pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. In the first quarter 2013, the Corporation implemented enhancements to the approach utilized for determining standard reserve factors for business loans not individually evaluated by changing from a dollar-based migration method for developing probability of default statistics to a count-based method. Under the dollar-based method, each dollar that moved to default received equal weight in the determination of standard reserve factors for each internal risk rating. As a result, the movement of larger loans impacted standard reserve factors more than the movement of smaller loans. By moving to a count-based approach, where each loan that moves to default receives equal weighting, unusually large or small loans will not have a disproportionate influence on the standard reserve factors. The change resulted in a $40 million increase to the allowance for loan losses at March 31, 2013. While the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio continued to improve in the third quarter 2013, ongoing economic uncertainty continued to be a consideration when determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses. Recent economic data provided mixed results. Positive factors included increased personal and real disposable income figures, a decrease in initial unemployment claims in September, an increase in new home sales and better-than-expected manufacturing data. However, consumer spending has been weak to moderate. Federal spending continued to be suppressed as a result of the budget sequester that took effect at the end of March. In addition, the Federal Reserve continued its program of asset purchases through September, signaling ongoing economic uncertainty. The recent federal government shutdown of non-essential services and the showdown over raising the debt ceiling amplified ongoing concerns about fiscal and monetary policy.The allowance for loan losses was $604 million at September 30, 2013, compared to $629 million at December 31, 2012, a decrease of $25 million, or 4 percent. The decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in specific reserves, the elimination and reductions of certain incremental industry reserves, primarily due to lower levels of gross charge-offs in those industries, and lower loan balances, partially offset by an increase in the allowance for loan losses resulting from the enhancements to the approach utilized for determining standard reserve factors described above and an increase in qualitative factors that indicate overall economic uncertainty. The $25 million decrease in the allowance for loan losses primarily reflected decreased reserves in Commercial Real Estate, Corporate Banking, general Middle Market and Private Banking, partially offset by increased reserves in Technology and Life Sciences and Energy. By market, reserves decreased in Michigan, California and Other Markets and increased in Texas (primarily Energy).Acquired loans were initially recorded at fair value, which included an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans, and therefore no corresponding allowance for loan losses was recorded for these loans at acquisition. Methods utilized to estimate the required allowance for loan losses for acquired loans not deemed credit-impaired at acquisition are similar to originated loans; however, the estimate of loss is based on the unpaid principal balance less the remaining purchase discount, either on an individually evaluated basis or based on the pool of acquired loans not deemed credit-impaired at acquisition within each risk rating, as applicable. At September 30, 2013, there was no allowance for loan losses on acquired loans, and $24 million of purchase discount remained, compared to a $3 million allowance for loan losses and $41 million of remaining purchase discount at December 31, 2012.The total allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb incurred losses inherent in the total loan portfolio. Unanticipated economic events, including political, economic and regulatory instability could cause changes in the credit characteristics of the portfolio and result in an unanticipated increase in the allowance. Inclusion of other industry-specific portfolio exposures in the allowance, as well as significant increases in the current portfolio exposures, could also increase the amount of the allowance. 54Table of ContentsAny of these events, or some combination thereof, may result in the need for additional provision for loan losses in order to maintain an allowance that complies with credit risk and accounting policies. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain letters of credit in a manner consistent with business loans, and allowances based on the pool of the remaining letters of credit and all unused commitments to extend credit within each internal risk rating.The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $34 million at September 30, 2013 compared to $32 million at December 31, 2012. The $2 million increase in the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments resulted primarily from an increase in reserves for unused commitments to extend credit in the first nine months of 2013. An allowance for credit losses will be recorded on acquired lending-related commitments only to the extent that the required allowance exceeds the remaining purchase discount. The purchase discount remaining for acquired lending-related commitments was $1 million and $2 million at September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. No allowance was recorded on acquired lending-related commitments at September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012. For additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses, refer to the "Critical Accounting Policies" section of this financial review and Notes 1 and 4 to these unaudited consolidated financial statements.Nonperforming AssetsNonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, troubled debt restructured loans (TDRs) which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans) and foreclosed property. TDRs include performing and nonperforming loans. Nonperforming TDRs are either on nonaccrual or reduced-rate status. Nonperforming assets do not include purchased credit impaired (PCI) loans.The following table presents a summary of nonperforming assets and past due loans.(dollar amounts in millions)September 30, 2013 December 31, 2012Nonaccrual loans:   Business loans:   Commercial$107 $103Real estate construction:   Commercial Real Estate business line (a)24 30Other business lines (b)1 3Total real estate construction25 33Commercial mortgage:   Commercial Real Estate business line (a)67 94Other business lines (b)139 181Total commercial mortgage206 275Lease financing— 3Total nonaccrual business loans338 414Retail loans:   Residential mortgage63 70Consumer:   Home equity34 31Other consumer2 4Total consumer36 35Total nonaccrual retail loans99 105Total nonaccrual loans437 519Reduced-rate loans22 22Total nonperforming loans459 541Foreclosed property19 54Total nonperforming assets$478 $595Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans1.04% 1.17%Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and foreclosed property1.08 1.29Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total nonperforming loans131 116Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing$25 $23Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing as a percentage of total loans0.06% 0.05%(a)Primarily loans to real estate developers.(b)Primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate.55Table of ContentsNonperforming assets decreased $117 million to $478 million at September 30, 2013, from $595 million at December 31, 2012. The decrease in nonperforming assets primarily reflected decreases in nonaccrual commercial mortgage loans ($69 million) and foreclosed property ($35 million). Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and foreclosed property was 1.08 percent at September 30, 2013, compared to 1.29 percent at December 31, 2012.The following table presents a summary of changes in nonaccrual loans.

Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $10.3 billion at September 30, 2013, of which $2.9 billion, or 28 percent, were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to real estate developers. The remaining $7.4 billion, or 72 percent, of commercial real estate loans in other business lines consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans. The real estate construction loan portfolio totaled $1.6 billion at September 30, 2013. The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-time customers with satisfactory completion experience. Of the $1.3 billion of 58Table of Contentsreal estate construction loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line, $24 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2013 and net recoveries were $1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013. In other business lines, $1 million of real estate construction loans were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2013. The commercial mortgage loan portfolio totaled $8.7 billion at September 30, 2013 and included $1.6 billion in the Commercial Real Estate business line and $7.1 billion in other business lines. Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Of the $1.6 billion of commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line, $67 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2013. Commercial mortgage loan net charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line were $7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013. In other business lines, $139 million of commercial mortgage loans were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2013, and net charge-offs were $9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013. The geographic distribution and project type of commercial real estate loans are important factors in diversifying credit risk within the portfolio.

Residential mortgages totaled $1.7 billion at September 30, 2013, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.7 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $63 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2013. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.5 billion at September 30, 2013, of which $1.4 billion was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit and $114 million were closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.5 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $34 million were on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2013. A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at September 30, 2013. The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation's primary geographic markets. Substantially all residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more are placed on nonaccrual status, and substantially all junior lien home equity loans that are current or less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status if full collection of the senior position is in doubt. Such loans are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell no later than 180 days past due.Shared National CreditsShared National Credit (SNC) loans are facilities greater than $20 million shared by three or more federally supervised financial institutions that are reviewed annually by regulatory authorities at the agent bank level. The Corporation generally seeks to obtain ancillary business at the origination of a SNC relationship. Loans classified as SNC loans (approximately 870 borrowers at September 30, 2013) were $9.2 billion and $9.4 billion at September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. Comerica Bank (the Bank) was the agent for $1.6 billion of the SNC loans outstanding at both September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012. SNC net loan charge-offs totaled zero and $8 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, respectively, compared to $2 million and $20 million for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012, respectively. Nonaccrual SNC loans decreased $13 million to $11 million at September 30, 2013, compared to $24 million at December 31, 2012. SNC loans, diversified by both business line and geographic market, comprised approximately 20 percent of total loans at both September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012. SNC loans are held to the same credit underwriting and pricing standards as the remainder of the loan portfolio. Energy LendingThe Corporation has a portfolio of energy-related loans that are included primarily in "commercial loans" in the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation has over 30 years of experience in energy lending, with a focus on middle market companies. Loans in the Middle Market - Energy business line were $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion at September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively, or approximately 6 percent of total loans each period. Nonaccrual Middle Market - Energy loans totaled $1 million and $3 million at September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. Middle Market - Energy net loan charge-offs were zero for both the three-month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2012 and totaled $2 million for both the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2012. Energy loans are diverse in nature, with outstanding balances by customer market segment distributed approximately as follows at September 30, 2013: 72 percent exploration and production (comprised of approximately 49 percent oil, 29 percent mixed and 22 percent natural gas), 13 percent midstream and 15 percent energy services.Automotive LendingSubstantially all dealer loans are in the National Dealer Services business line. Loans in the National Dealer Services business line include floor plan financing and other loans to automotive dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in “commercial loans” in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $2.9 billion at September 30, 2013, a decrease of $94 million compared to December 31, 2012. At September 30, 2013, other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $2.0 billion, including $1.4 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans, compared to $2.2 billion of other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Service line, including $1.5 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans, at December 31, 2012. Automotive lending also includes loans to borrowers involved with automotive production, primarily Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers. Loans to borrowers involved with automotive production totaled approximately $1.2 billion at both September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012.60Table of ContentsState and Local MunicipalitiesIn the normal course of business, the Corporation serves the needs of state and local municipalities in multiple capacities, including traditional banking products such as deposit services, loans and letters of credit, investment banking services such as bond underwriting and private placements, and by investing in municipal securities.The following table summarizes the Corporation's direct exposure to state and local municipalities as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012.(in millions)September 30, 2013 December 31, 2012Loans outstanding$52 $53Lease financing339 359Investment securities available-for-sale25 23Trading account securities2 19Standby letters of credit98 108Unused commitments to extend credit13 24Total direct exposure to state and local municipalities$529 $586Indirect exposure comprised $114 million in auction-rate preferred securities collateralized by municipal securities at September 30, 2013, compared to $127 million at December 31, 2012. Additionally, the Corporation is exposed to Automated Clearing House (ACH) transaction risk for those municipalities utilizing this electronic payment and/or deposit method and similar products in their cash flow management. The Corporation sets limits on ACH activity during the underwriting process.Extensions of credit to state and local municipalities are subjected to the same underwriting standards as other business loans. At both September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, all outstanding municipal loans and leases were performing according to contractual terms, and one municipal lease was included in the Corporation's internal watch list. Municipal leases are secured by the underlying equipment, and a substantial majority of the leases are fully defeased with AAA-rated U.S. government securities. Substantially all municipal investment securities available-for sale are auction-rate securities. All auction-rate securities are reviewed quarterly for other-than-temporary impairment. All auction-rate municipal securities were rated investment grade, and all auction-rate preferred securities collateralized by municipal securities were rated investment grade and were adequately collateralized at both September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012. Municipal securities are held in the trading account for resale to customers. In addition, Comerica Securities, a broker-dealer subsidiary of the Bank, underwrites bonds issued by municipalities. All bonds underwritten by Comerica Securities are sold to third party investors. On July 18, 2013, the city of Detroit filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection in federal court. The Corporation's direct exposure to the city of Detroit is insignificant. International ExposureInternational assets are subject to general risks inherent in the conduct of business in foreign countries, including economic uncertainties and each foreign government's regulations. Risk management practices minimize the risk inherent in international lending arrangements. These practices include structuring bilateral agreements or participating in bank facilities, which secure repayment from sources external to the borrower's country. Accordingly, such international outstandings are excluded from the cross-border risk of that country. 61Table of ContentsThe Corporation does not hold any sovereign exposure to Europe. The Corporation's international strategy as it pertains to Europe is to focus on European companies doing business in North America, with an emphasis on the Corporation's primary geographic markets. The following table summarizes cross-border exposure to entities domiciled in European countries at September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012.

Liquidity risk represents the failure to meet financial obligations coming due resulting from an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding, and the inability to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significant changes in pricing, due to inadequate market depth or market disruptions.The Asset and Liability Policy Committee (ALCO) of the Corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities. ALCO meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies, and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit gathering and risk management. The Corporation's Treasury Department supports ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate, liquidity and coordination of all other market risks. The area's key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analysis of the Corporation's balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate, liquidity and all other market risks; (ii) monitoring and reporting of the Corporation's positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines; (iii) development and presentation of analysis and strategies to adjust risk positions; (iv) review and presentation of policies and authorizations for approval; (v) monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate, liquidity and all other market risks; (vi) developing and monitoring the interest rate risk economic capital estimate; and (vii) monitoring of capital adequacy in accordance with the Capital Management Policy.62Table of ContentsInterest Rate RiskNet interest income is the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises primarily through the Corporation's core business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by a combination of core deposits and wholesale borrowings. Approximately 85 percent of the Corporation's loans were floating at September 30, 2013, of which approximately 75 percent were based on LIBOR and 25 percent were based on Prime. This creates a natural imbalance between the floating-rate loan portfolio and the more slowly repricing deposit products. The result is that growth and/or contraction in the Corporation's core businesses may lead to sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing investment securities, primarily fixed-rate, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, and hedging the sensitivity with interest rate swaps. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk, with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.The Corporation frequently evaluates net interest income under various balance sheet and interest rate scenarios, looking at a 12-month time horizon, using simulation modeling analysis as its principal risk management evaluation technique. The results of this analysis provides the information needed to assess the balance sheet structure. Changes in economic activity, whether domestic or international, different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis could translate into a materially different interest rate environment than currently expected. Management evaluates a base case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment and what is believed to be the most likely balance sheet structure. This base case net interest income is then evaluated against non-parallel interest rate scenarios that increase and decrease 200 basis points in a linear fashion from the base case over 12 months, resulting in an average change in interest rates of 100 basis points over the period. Due to the current low level of interest rates, the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of a 25 basis point drop, to zero percent. In addition, consistent with each interest rate scenario, adjustments are made to assumptions regarding asset prepayment levels, yield curves, and overall balance sheet mix and growth. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model may not precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions and management strategies, among other factors. However, the model can indicate the likely direction of change. Existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes are included in the analysis, but no additional hedging is forecasted.The table below, as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above. The sensitivity increased from December 31, 2012 to September 30, 2013 primarily due to higher forecasted core deposits, which generate higher forecasted excess reserves and, therefore, increased sensitivity. The risk to declining interest rates is limited as a result of the inability of the current low level of rates to fall significantly.Sensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest Rates September 30, 2013 December 31, 2012(in millions)Amount % Amount %Change in Interest Rates:       +200 basis points$210 13 % $178 11 %-25 basis points (to zero percent)(32) (2) (23) (1)Corporate policy limits adverse change to no more than four percent of management's base case net interest income forecast, and the Corporation was within this policy guideline at September 30, 2013. Interest rate risk is actively managed principally through the use of either on-balance sheet financial instruments or interest rate derivatives to achieve the desired risk profile.In addition to the simulation analysis, an economic value of equity analysis is performed for a longer term view of the interest rate risk position. The economic value of equity analysis begins with an estimate of the economic value of the financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments on the Corporation's balance sheet, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period. Next, the estimated impact of rate movements is applied to the economic value of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments. The economic value of equity is then calculated as the difference between the estimated market value of assets and liabilities net of the impact of off-balance sheet instruments. As with net interest income simulation analysis, a variety of alternative scenarios are performed to measure the impact on economic value of equity, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve.63Table of ContentsThe table below, as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from a 200 basis point immediate parallel increase or decrease in interest rates. Similar to the simulation analysis above, due to the current low level of interest rates, the economic value of equity analyses below reflect an interest rate scenario of an immediate 25 basis point drop, to zero percent, while the rising interest rate scenario reflects an immediate 200 basis point rise. The change in the sensitivity of the economic value of equity to a 200 basis point parallel increase in rates between December 31, 2012 and September 30, 2013 was primarily driven by changes in market interest rates at the middle to long end of the curve, which most significantly impact the value of deposits without a stated maturity. Additionally, a decrease in the Corporation's mortgage-backed securities portfolio reduced the level of fixed-rate securities that would decline in value when interest rates move higher.

Capacity for incremental purchased funds at September 30, 2013 included the ability to purchase federal funds, sell securities under agreements to repurchase, as well as issue deposits to institutional investors and issue certificates of deposit through brokers. Purchased funds totaled $717 million at September 30, 2013, compared to $612 million at December 31, 2012.The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, Texas (FHLB), which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. At September 30, 2013, $13 billion of real estate-related loans were pledged to the FHLB as blanket collateral for current and potential future borrowings. As of September 30, 2013, the Corporation had $1.0 billion of outstanding borrowings from the FHLB maturing in May 2014. Additionally, the Bank had the ability to issue up to $15.0 billion of debt at September 30, 2013 under an existing $15 billion medium-term senior note program which allows the issuance of debt with maturities between three months and 30 years. The Corporation also maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and/or equity securities.The ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise funds at competitive rates is impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings of the Corporation and the Bank. As of September 30, 2013, the four major rating agencies had assigned the following ratings to long-term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Liquid assets, which totaled $13.8 billion at September 30, 2013, compared to $12.1 billion at December 31, 2012, provide a reservoir of liquidity. Liquid assets include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits with banks, other short-term investments and unencumbered investment securities available-for-sale. At September 30, 2013, the Corporation held excess liquidity, represented by $5.6 billion deposited with the FRB, compared to $2.9 billion at December 31, 2012.64Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe Corporation’s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation’s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2012, the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to the allowance for credit losses, valuation methodologies, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages F-42 through F-47 in the Corporation's 2012 Annual Report. As of the date of this report, there have been no significant changes to the Corporation's critical accounting policies, except as discussed below.Allowance for Credit LossesThe allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments.The allowance for loan losses represents management’s assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporation’s loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain loans, and allowances for homogeneous pools of loans with similar risk characteristics.The allowance for business loans which do not meet the criteria to be evaluated individually is determined by applying standard reserve factors to the pool of business loans within each internal risk rating. In the first quarter 2013, the Corporation enhanced the approach utilized for determining standard reserve factors by changing from a dollar-based migration method for developing probability of default statistics to a count-based method. Under the dollar-based method, each dollar that moved to default received equal weight in the determination of standard reserve factors for each internal risk rating. Under the count-based approach, each loan that moves to default receives equal weighting. The change resulted in a $40 million increase to the allowance for loan losses at March 31, 2013.For further discussion of the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for credit losses, refer to the “Allowance for Credit Losses” section in this financial review and Note 1 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.GoodwillGoodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level, equivalent to a business segment or one level below. The Corporation has three reporting units: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. At September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012, goodwill totaled $635 million, including $380 million allocated to the Business Bank, $194 million allocated to the Retail Bank and $61 million allocated to Wealth Management. The Corporation performs its annual evaluation of goodwill impairment in the third quarter of each year and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests suggest additional testing may be warranted to determine if goodwill might be impaired. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step test. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of identified reporting units with their carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. In performing the annual impairment test, the carrying value of each reporting unit is the greater of economic or regulatory capital. The Corporation assigns economic capital using internal management methodologies on the basis of each reporting unit's credit, operational and interest rate risks, as well as goodwill. To determine regulatory capital, each reporting unit is assigned sufficient capital such that their respective Tier 1 ratio, based on allocated risk-weighted assets, is the same as that of the Corporation. Using this two-pronged approach, the Corporation's equity is fully allocated to its reporting units except for capital held primarily for the risk associated with the securities portfolio which is assigned to the Finance segment of the Corporation. Determining the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process involving the use of estimates and judgments related to the selection of inputs such as future cash flows, discount rates, comparable public company multiples, applicable control premiums and economic expectations used in determining the interest rate environment. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are determined using a blend of two commonly used valuation techniques: the market approach and the income approach. For the market approach, valuations of reporting units consider a combination of earnings, equity and other multiples from companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit. Since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of noncontrolling interests, the valuations accordingly incorporate a control premium. For the income approach, 65Table of Contentsestimated future cash flows and terminal value are discounted. Estimated future cash flows are derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for each reporting unit which incorporate uncertainty factors inherent to long-term projections. The applicable discount rate is based on the imputed cost of equity capital appropriate for each reporting unit, which incorporates the risk-free rate of return, the level of non-diversified risk associated with companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit, a size risk premium and a market equity risk premium. The annual test of goodwill impairment was performed as of the beginning of the third quarter 2013. The Corporation's assumptions included maintaining the low Federal funds target rate through mid-2015 with modest increases thereafter until eventually reaching a normal interest rate environment. At the conclusion of the first step of the annual goodwill impairment tests performed in the third quarter 2013, the estimated fair values of all reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying amounts, including goodwill. The results of the annual test of the goodwill impairment test for each reporting unit were subjected to stress testing as appropriate. Economic conditions impact the assumptions related to interest and growth rates, loss rates and imputed cost of equity capital. The fair value estimates for each reporting unit incorporated current economic and market conditions, including the recent Federal Reserve announcements and the impact of legislative and regulatory changes, to the extent known and as described above. However, further weakening in the economic environment, such as adverse changes in interest rates, a decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below their carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Additionally, new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management's expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Any impairment charge would not affect the Corporation's regulatory capital ratios, tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position.66Table of ContentsSUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATAThe following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this financial review with financial measures defined by GAAP.(dollar amounts in millions)September 30, 2013 December 31, 2012Tier 1 Common Capital Ratio:   Tier 1 and Tier 1 common capital (a) (b)$6,863 $6,705Risk-weighted assets (a) (b)63,917 66,115Tier 1 and Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio (b)10.74% 10.14%Basel III Tier 1 Common Capital Ratio:   Tier 1 and Tier 1 common capital (b)$6,863 $6,705Basel III adjustments (c)— (39)Basel III Tier 1 and Tier 1 common capital (c)$6,863 $6,253Risk-weighted assets (a) (b)$63,917 $66,115Basel III adjustments (c)2,295 1,854Basel III risk-weighted assets (c)$66,212 $67,969Tier 1 and Tier 1 common capital ratio (b)10.7% 10.1%Basel III Tier 1 and Tier 1 common capital ratio (c)10.4 9.8Tangible Common Equity Ratio:   Common shareholders' equity$6,969 $6,942Less:   Goodwill635 635Other intangible assets18 22Tangible common equity$6,316 $6,285Total assets$64,670 $65,069Less:   Goodwill635 635Other intangible assets18 22Tangible assets$64,017 $64,412Common equity ratio10.78% 10.67%Tangible common equity ratio9.87 9.76Tangible Common Equity per Share of Common Stock:   Common shareholders' equity$6,969 $6,942Tangible common equity6,316 6,285Shares of common stock outstanding (in millions)184 188Common shareholders' equity per share of common stock$37.94 $36.87Tangible common equity per share of common stock34.38 33.38(a)Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as defined by regulation.(b)September 30, 2013 Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted-assets are estimated.(c)Estimated ratios based on the standardized approach in the final rule for the U.S. adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework, excluding most elements of AOCI.The Tier 1 common capital ratio removes preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations. The Basel III Tier 1 common capital ratio further adjusts Tier 1 common capital and risk-weighted assets to account for the final rule approved by U.S. banking regulators in July 2013 for the U.S. adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework. The final Basel III capital rules are effective January 1, 2015 for banking organizations subject to the standardized approach. The tangible common equity ratio removes preferred stock and the effect of intangible assets from capital and the effect of intangible assets from total assets and tangible common equity per share of common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders' equity per share of common stock. The Corporation believes these measurements are meaningful measures of capital adequacy used by investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and to compare against other companies in the industry.67Table of ContentsITEM 3.
