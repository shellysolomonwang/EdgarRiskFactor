Item 1A. Risk Factors” beginning on page 12 of Comerica's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. The Corporation does not undertake to update forward-looking statements to reflect facts, circumstances, assumptions or events that occur after the date the forward-looking statements are made. For any forward-looking statements made in this report or in any documents, the Corporation claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.38Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONSNet income for the three months ended March 31, 2014 was $139 million, an increase of $5 million from $134 million  reported for the three months ended March 31, 2013. This increase was primarily the result of decreases of $10 million in noninterest expenses and $7 million in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by decreases of $6 million in net interest income and $5 million in noninterest income. Net income per diluted common share was $0.73 for the three months ended March 31, 2014, compared to $0.70 for the same period one year ago. Average diluted common shares were 187 million for both the three-month periods ended March 31, 2014 and 2013.Full-Year 2014 Outlook Compared to Full-Year 2013Management expectations for full-year 2014 compared to 2013, assuming a continuation of the current economic and low rate environment, are as follows:•Average loan growth consistent with 3 percent growth achieved in 2013, reflecting stabilization in Mortgage Banker Finance near average fourth quarter 2013 level and continued focus on pricing and structure discipline.•Net interest income modestly lower, reflecting a decline in purchase accounting accretion, to $20 million to $30 million, and the effect of continued pressure from the low rate environment, partially offset by loan growth.•Provision for credit losses and net charge-offs stable. Increases to the allowance for credit losses due to loan growth offset by continued strong credit quality.•Noninterest income modestly lower, reflecting stable customer-driven fee income and lower noncustomer-driven income. Growth in fiduciary income and card fees offset by lower capital market activity.•Noninterest expenses lower, reflecting lower litigation-related expenses and a more than 50 percent decrease in pension expense, to $35 million to $40 million.•Income tax expense to approximate 32 percent of pre-tax income, reflecting the change in accounting for affordable housing projects that qualify for the low-income housing tax credit described below. The impact of the increase in the effective tax rate is fully offset by a related increase in noninterest income, resulting in no impact to net income.The Corporation early adopted an amendment to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles in the first quarter 2014 related to the accounting for affordable housing projects that qualify for the low-income housing tax credit. Amortization of the initial investment cost of qualifying projects is now recorded in the provision for income taxes together with the tax credits and benefits received. Previously, the amortization was recorded as a reduction to other noninterest income. All prior period amounts in this financial review have been restated to reflect the adoption of the amendment, which resulted in offsetting increases to other noninterest income and the provision for income taxes of $13 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013 ($56 million for full-year 2013). The adoption had no impact on net income for any period presented.Net Interest IncomeNet interest income was $410 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014, a decrease of $6 million compared to $416 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013. The decrease in net interest income resulted primarily from a decrease in yields on earning assets, partially offset by a the benefit provided by a decrease in funding costs and an increase in average earning assets. Average earning assets increased $1.3 billion, or 2 percent, to $59.9 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2014, compared to $58.6 billion for the same period in 2013. The increase in average earning assets primarily reflected increases of $1.6 billion in average interest-bearing deposits with banks and $458 million in average loans, partially offset by a decrease of $739 million in average investment securities available-for-sale. The net interest margin (FTE) for the three months ended March 31, 2014 decreased 11 basis points to 2.77 percent, from 2.88 percent for the comparable period in 2013, primarily from decreased yields on loans and the impact of an increase in excess liquidity, partially offset by lower deposit rates and improved yields on mortgage-backed investment securities. The decrease in loan yields was primarily the result of the impact of a lower rate environment, repayments on higher-yielding loans, positive credit quality migration throughout the portfolio and shifts in the average loan portfolio mix. Yields on mortgage-backed investment securities increased primarily due to decreased premium amortization resulting from slower prepayment speeds, largely reflecting the cumulative impact of a retrospective adjustment made in the three months ended March 31, 2014. Excess liquidity reduced the net interest margin by approximately 24 basis points and 17 basis points in the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Excess liquidity was represented by $5.3 billion and $3.7 billion of average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) in the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, included in “interest-bearing deposits with banks” on the consolidated balance sheets. The "Quarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent" table above provides an analysis of net interest income (FTE) for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 and details the components of the change in net interest income on a FTE basis for the three months ended March 31, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year.For further discussion of the effects of market rates on net interest income, refer to the "Market and Liquidity Risk" section of this financial review.39Table of ContentsQuarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent (FTE) Three Months Ended March 31, 2014 March 31, 2013(dollar amounts in millions)AverageBalanceInterestAverageRate AverageBalanceInterestAverageRateCommercial loans$28,362$2213.17% $28,056$2293.31%Real estate construction loans1,827153.40 1,314134.15Commercial mortgage loans8,770863.97 9,398954.08Lease financing84894.07 85773.23International loans1,301123.68 1,282113.62Residential mortgage loans1,724173.86 1,556174.39Consumer loans2,243173.16 2,154183.36Total loans (a)45,0753773.39 44,6173903.54        Mortgage-backed securities available-for-sale8,911552.42 9,635532.25Other investment securities available-for-sale371—0.43 386—0.50Total investment securities available-for-sale9,282552.34 10,021532.17        Interest-bearing deposits with banks (b)5,44840.26 3,85220.27Other short-term investments111—0.66 11712.30Total earning assets59,9164362.94 58,6074463.09        Cash and due from banks913   979  Allowance for loan losses(603)   (633)  Accrued income and other assets4,482   4,498  Total assets$64,708   $63,451          Money market and interest-bearing checking deposits$22,26160.11 $21,29470.14Savings deposits1,700—0.03 1,623—0.03Customer certificates of deposit5,10950.36 5,74470.47Foreign office time deposits464—0.42 52510.55Total interest-bearing deposits29,534110.15 29,186150.21Short-term borrowings185—0.03 123—0.11Medium- and long-term debt3,545141.53 4,707151.32Total interest-bearing sources33,264250.30 34,016300.36        Noninterest-bearing deposits23,236   21,506  Accrued expenses and other liabilities979   973  Total shareholders’ equity7,229   6,956  Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity$64,708   $63,451          Net interest income/rate spread (FTE) $4112.64  $4162.73        FTE adjustment $1   $—         Impact of net noninterest-bearing sources of funds  0.13   0.15Net interest margin (as a percentage of average earning assets) (FTE) (a) (b)  2.77%   2.88%(a)Accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio of $12 million and $11 million increased the net interest margin by 8 basis points for both the three-month periods ended March 31, 2014 and 2013.(b)Excess liquidity, represented by average balances deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank, reduced the net interest margin by 24 basis points and 17 basis points in the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.40Table of ContentsQuarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income & Rate/Volume - Fully Taxable Equivalent (FTE) (continued) Three Months Ended March 31, 2014/March 31, 2013(in millions)Increase(Decrease)Due to RateIncrease(Decrease)Due to Volume (a)NetIncrease(Decrease)Interest Income (FTE):      Loans$(16) $3 $(13) Investment securities available-for-sale5 (3) 2 Interest-bearing deposits with banks— 2 2 Other short-term investments(1) — (1) Total interest income (FTE)(12) 2 (10)        Interest Expense:      Interest-bearing deposits(3) (1) (4) Medium- and long-term debt3 (4) (1) Total interest expense— (5) (5) Net interest income (FTE)$(12) $7 $(5) (a)Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume.Provision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses was $9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014, compared to $16 million for the same period in 2013. The provision for credit losses includes both the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The provision for loan losses is recorded to maintain the allowance for loan losses at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio. For a discussion of the allowance for loan losses and the methodology used in the determination of the allowance for loan losses, refer to the "Credit Risk" and "Critical Accounting Policies" sections of this financial review. The provision for loan losses was $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014, compared to $12 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013. Credit quality in the loan portfolio continued to improve in the three months ended March 31, 2014, compared to the same period in the prior year. Improvements in credit quality included a decline of $755 million in the Corporation's criticized loan list from March 31, 2013 to March 31, 2014. Reflected in the decline in criticized loans was a decrease in nonaccrual loans of $177 million. The Corporation's criticized loan list is consistent with loans in the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful categories defined by regulatory authorities.Net loan charge-offs in the three months ended March 31, 2014 decreased $12 million to $12 million, or 0.10 percent of average total loans, compared to $24 million, or 0.21 percent, for the three months ended March 31, 2013. The $12 million decrease in net loan charge-offs in the three months ended March 31, 2014, compared to the same period in 2013, reflected decreases in most business lines, with the largest decreases in general Middle Market and Small Business, partially offset by increases in Technology and Life Sciences and Commercial Real Estate.The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments is recorded to maintain the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $1 million in the three months ended March 31, 2014, compared to $4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2013. The $3 million decrease reflected a $4 million decrease in the provision for unfunded commitments, partially offset by a $1 million increase in the provision for letters of credit. Lending-related commitment charge-offs were insignificant for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013.An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets is presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.41Table of ContentsNoninterest Income Three Months Ended March 31,(in millions)2014 2013Customer-driven income:   Service charges on deposit accounts$54 $55Fiduciary income44 43Commercial lending fees20 21Card fees19 17Letter of credit fees14 16Foreign exchange income9 9Brokerage fees5 5Other customer-driven income (a)19 20Total customer-driven noninterest income184 186Noncustomer-driven income:   Bank-owned life insurance9 9Net securities gains (losses) 1 —Other noncustomer-driven income (a)14 18Total noninterest income$208 $213(a)The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income.Noninterest income was $208 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014, a decrease of $5 million compared to $213 million for the same period in 2013. The decrease primarily reflected a $4 million decrease in securities trading income, as shown in the following table, which illustrates certain categories included in "other noninterest income" on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.

The decrease primarily reflected a $4 million decrease in salaries and 42Table of Contentsbenefits expense and small decreases in several other categories of noninterest expense. Salaries and benefits expense decreased primarily due to a decrease in pension expense, partially offset by increases in payroll taxes and share-based compensation expense. STRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESSThe Corporation's management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. These methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines.Business SegmentsThe Corporation's operations are strategically aligned into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based upon the products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, Finance is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes items not directly associated with these business segments or the Finance segment. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of these business segments for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013.The following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.

Net interest income (FTE) of $371 million decreased $4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2014, primarily due to lower loan yields, partially offset by an increase in accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio, the benefit provided by an increase of $174 million in average loans and a decrease in net funds transfer pricing (FTP) charges. Average deposits increased $1.5 billion. The provision for credit losses decreased $4 million to $16 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to improved credit quality. Net credit-related charge-offs of $11 million decreased $5 million in the three months ended March 31, 2014, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2013, primarily reflecting a decrease in general Middle Market, partially offset by increases in Technology and Life Sciences and Commercial Real Estate. Noninterest income of $87 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 decreased $3 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to small decreases in several noninterest income categories. Noninterest expenses of $146 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 were unchanged compared to the same period in the prior year, as a decrease in salaries and benefits expense of $3 million and smaller decreases in several other categories of noninterest expenses were offset by an increase in corporate overhead expense of $4 million.Net income for the Retail Bank of $9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 decreased $1 million, compared to $10 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013. Net interest income (FTE) of $146 million decreased $9 million in the three months ended March 31, 2014, primarily due to a decrease in net FTP credits, lower loan yields and a decrease in accretion of the purchase discount on the acquired loan portfolio, partially offset the benefit provided by a $105 million increase in average loans and lower deposit rates. The provision for credit losses of $2 million and net credit-related charge-offs of $4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 each decreased $4 million from the comparable period in the prior year, both primarily reflecting a decrease in Small Business. Noninterest income of $41 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 was unchanged compared to the three months ended March 31, 2013. Noninterest expenses of $171 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 decreased $4 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in salaries and benefits expense of $2 million and small decreases in several other noninterest expense categories.Wealth Management's net income of $26 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 increased $1 million, compared to $25 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013.

The benefit provided by a $179 43Table of Contentsmillion increase in average loans was offset by a decline in loan yields. The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014, compared to a benefit of $6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013, primarily due to improvements in credit quality. Net credit-related recoveries were $3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014, compared to an insignificant amount for the three months ended March 31, 2013. Noninterest income of $64 million decreased $1 million from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting a $2 million decrease in securities trading income and smaller decreases in several other noninterest income categories, partially offset by a $2 million increase in fiduciary income. Noninterest expenses of $78 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 decreased $1 million from the three months ended March 31, 2013, primarily due to a $3 million decrease in salaries and benefits expense, partially offset by small increases in several other noninterest expense categories.The net loss in the Finance segment was $92 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014, compared to a net loss of $98 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013. Net interest expense (FTE) of $158 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014 decreased $9 million, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2013, primarily reflecting a decrease in net FTP expense as a result of lower net rates paid to the business segments under the Corporation's internal FTP methodology as well as an increase in interest earned on the Corporation's mortgage-backed investment securities. Market SegmentsMarket segment results are provided for the Corporation's three largest geographic markets: Michigan, California and Texas. In addition to the three largest geographic markets, Other Markets is also reported as a market segment. The Finance & Other category includes the Finance segment and the Other category as previously described in the "Business Segments" section of this financial review.

The $679 million increase in average commercial loans primarily reflected an increase in Middle Market ($707 million), partially offset by a decrease in Mortgage Banker Finance ($223 million). The decline in Mortgage Banker Finance, which provides mortgage warehousing lines, primarily reflected a decline in residential mortgage activity. The increase in Middle Market primarily reflected increases in general Middle Market ($284 million), Energy ($224 million) and Technology and Life Sciences ($202 million), partially offset by a decrease in Entertainment ($117 million). In general, Middle Market serves customers with annual revenue between $20 million and $500 million; while Corporate serves customers with revenue over $500 million. Changes in average total loans by geographic market is provided in the table above. Investment securities available-for-sale increased $180 million to $9.5 billion at March 31, 2014, from $9.3 billion at December 31, 2013, primarily reflecting an increase in the pace of purchases replacing paydowns on residential mortgage-backed investment securities in the first quarter of 2014 as well as a $93 million decrease in net unrealized losses, to a net unrealized loss 46Table of Contentsof $14 million at March 31, 2014, compared to a net unrealized loss of $107 million at December 31, 2013. On an average basis, investment securities available-for-sale decreased $83 million in the first quarter 2014, compared to the fourth quarter 2013. Average unrealized losses increased $32 million in the first quarter 2014, compared to the fourth quarter 2013.Total liabilities increased $324 million to $58.4 billion at March 31, 2014, compared to $58.1 billion at December 31, 2013, primarily due to an increase of $378 million in interest-bearing deposits. On an average basis, total liabilities decreased $116 million in the first quarter 2014, compared to the fourth quarter 2013, primarily due to decreases of $296 million in noninterest-bearing deposits and $94 million in short-term borrowings, partially offset by an increase of $297 million in interest-bearing deposits. The decrease in average noninterest-bearing deposits primarily reflected decreases in Corporate Banking ($540 million) and Private Banking ($126 million), partially offset by an increase Middle Market ($389 million). The increase in Middle Market was driven by an increase in balances in Technology and Life Sciences ($531 million). The increase in average interest-bearing deposits primarily reflected increases of $231 million in money market and interest-bearing checking deposits, largely the result of an increase in Corporate Banking ($232 million), and $31 million in customer certificates of deposit. By geographic market, average total deposits increased in Texas ($339 million) and Michigan ($141 million) and decreased in California ($437 million) and Other Markets ($87 million).CapitalTotal shareholders' equity increased $133 million to $7.3 billion at March 31, 2014, compared to December 31, 2013.

These stress tests are a regular part of the Corporation's overall risk management and capital planning process. The same forecasting process is also used by the Corporation to conduct the stress test that was part of the Federal Reserve's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). For additional information about risk management processes, refer to the "Risk Management" section of this financial review.The Federal Reserve completed its 2014 CCAR review in March 2014 and did not object to Comerica's capital plan and capital distributions contemplated in the plan. Comerica's capital plan provides for up to $236 million in share repurchases for the four-quarter period ending March 31, 2015, as well as the authority to fully redeem $150 million par value of subordinated notes due 2024. The notes are callable at par on or after July 15, 2014 and were recorded at a carrying value of $183 million at March 31, 2014. Due to the lack of certainty about the possible execution and timing of the call, the impact of the call is not reflected in the outlook for 2014. Comerica's capital plan further included a 1-cent increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.20 per common share. The dividend proposal was approved by the Board of Directors on April 22, 2014.On April 22, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Corporation authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 2.0 million shares of Comerica Incorporated outstanding common stock, in addition to the 5.1 million shares remaining at March 31, 2014 under the Board's prior authorizations for the share repurchase program initially approved in November 2010. Including the April 22, 2014 authorization, a total of 30.3 million shares has been authorized for repurchase under the share repurchase program since its inception in 2010. In November 2010, the Board authorized the purchase of up to all 11.5 million of the Corporation's original outstanding warrants. There is no expiration date for the Corporation's share repurchase program. 47Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes the Corporation's repurchase activity during the three months ended March 31, 2014.(shares in thousands)Total Number of Shares and Warrants Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Repurchase Plans or Programs RemainingRepurchaseAuthorization (a) Total Numberof SharesPurchased (b) Average PricePaid Per Share Average Price Paid Per Warrant (c)January 2014578 17,549 756 $47.12 $—February 2014599 16,950 601 46.35 —March 2014346 16,604 346 48.89 —Total first quarter 20141,523 16,604 1,703 $47.21 $—(a)Maximum number of shares and warrants that may yet be purchased under the publicly announced plans or programs.

These transactions are not considered part of the Corporation's repurchase program.(c)The Corporation made no repurchases of warrants under the repurchase program during the three months ended March 31, 2014. Upon exercise of a warrant, the number of shares with a value equal to the aggregate exercise price is withheld from an exercising warrant holder as payment (known as a "net exercise provision"). During the three months ended March 31, 2014, the Corporation withheld the equivalent of approximately 8,000 shares to cover an aggregate of $235,000 in exercise price and issued approximately 5,000 shares to the exercising warrant holders. Shares withheld in connection with the net exercise provision are not included in the total number of shares or warrants purchased in the above table.Risk-based regulatory capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in credit risk profiles among banking institutions and to account for off-balance sheet exposure. Assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with specified risk-weighting factors. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items.The Corporation's capital ratios exceeded minimum regulatory requirements as follows: March 31, 2014 December 31, 2013(dollar amounts in millions)Capital Ratio Capital RatioTier 1 common (a) (b)$6,961 10.54% $6,895 10.64%Tier 1 risk-based (4.00% - minimum) (b)6,961 10.54 6,895 10.64Total risk-based (8.00% - minimum) (b)8,554 12.95 8,491 13.10Leverage (3.00% - minimum) (b)6,961 10.85 6,895 10.77Tangible common equity (a)6,632 10.20 6,501 10.07(a)See Supplemental Financial Data section for reconcilements of non-GAAP financial measures.(b)March 31, 2014 capital and ratios are estimated.In July 2013, U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule for the U.S. adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework. The regulatory framework includes a more conservative definition of capital, two new capital buffers - a conservation buffer and a countercyclical buffer, new and more stringent risk weight categories for assets and off-balance sheet items, and a supplemental leverage ratio. As a banking organization subject to the standardized approach, the rules will be effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2015, with certain transition provisions fully phased in on January 1, 2018.According to the rule, the Corporation will be subject to the capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent, when fully phased in, to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses. However, the rules do not subject the Corporation to the capital countercyclical buffer of up to 2.5 percent or the supplemental leverage ratio. The Corporation estimates the March 31, 2014 common equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 risk-based ratio would be 10.3 percent if calculated under the final rule, excluding most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income from regulatory capital. The Corporation's March 31, 2014 estimated common equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 capital ratios exceed the minimum required by the final rule (7 percent and 8.5 percent, respectively, including the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer). For a reconcilement of these non-GAAP financial measures, refer to the "Supplemental Financial Data" section of this financial review.The Corporation expects that U.S. banking regulators will establish an additional capital buffer for banking organizations deemed systemically important to the U.S. financial system (Domestic Systemically Important Banks, or "D-SIB"). If designated as a D-SIB by the U.S. banking regulators, the Corporation would be subject to the additional buffer. While the level and timing of a D-SIB buffer is not currently known, the Corporation expects to exceed all required capital levels within regulatory timelines.On October 24, 2013, U.S. banking regulators issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would implement a quantitative liquidity requirement in the U.S. (the proposed rule) generally consistent with the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) minimum liquidity measure established under the Basel III liquidity framework. Under the proposed rule, the Corporation would be subject 48Table of Contentsto a modified LCR standard, which requires a financial institution to hold a buffer of high-quality, liquid assets to fully cover net cash outflows under a 21-day systematic liquidity stress scenario. Under the proposal, the LCR rules would be fully phased in on January 1, 2017, with a transition period beginning January 1, 2015. The Corporation is currently evaluating the potential impact of the proposed rule; however, we expect to meet the final requirements adopted by U.S. banking regulators within the required timetable. Uncertainty exists as to the final form and timing of the proposed rule, and balance sheet dynamics may vary in the future. As a result the Corporation may decide to consider additional liquidity management initiatives. The Basel III liquidity framework includes a second minimum liquidity measure, the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), which requires the amount of available longer-term, stable sources of funding to be at least 100 percent of the required amount of longer-term stable funding over a one-year period. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is in the process of reviewing the proposed NSFR standard and evaluating its impact on the banking system. U.S. banking regulators have announced that they expect to issue proposed rulemaking to implement the NFSR in advance of its scheduled global implementation in 2018. While uncertainty exists in the final form and timing of the U.S. rule implementing the NSFR and whether or not the Corporation will be subject to the full requirements, the Corporation is closely monitoring the development of the rule. RISK MANAGEMENTThe following updated information should be read in conjunction with the "Risk Management" section on pages F-23 through F-40 in the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report.Credit RiskAllowance for Credit LossesThe allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The allowance for loan losses represents management's assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporation's loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in "accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets, provides for probable losses inherent in lending-related commitments, including unused commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.The Corporation disaggregates the loan portfolio into segments for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses. These segments are based on the level at which the Corporation develops, documents and applies a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The Corporation's portfolio segments are business loans and retail loans. Business loans are defined as those belonging to the commercial, real estate construction, commercial mortgage, lease financing and international loan portfolios. Retail loans consist of traditional residential mortgage, home equity and other consumer loans. The allowance for loan losses includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain loans, and allowances for homogeneous pools of loans with similar risk characteristics.While the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio was strong in the first quarter 2014, economic uncertainty continued to be a consideration when determining the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses. Events such as the widespread bad weather in the U.S. in the first quarter 2014 and the volatile geopolitical situation in Eastern Europe added uncertainty, while the U.S. economic outlook appeared to be relatively more favorable.The allowance for loan losses was $594 million at March 31, 2014, compared to $598 million at December 31, 2013, a decrease of $4 million, or 1 percent. The decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in specific reserves and a decrease in retail reserves, partially offset by higher loan balances. Acquired loans were initially recorded at fair value, which included an estimate of credit losses expected to be realized over the remaining lives of the loans, and therefore no corresponding allowance for loan losses was recorded for these loans at acquisition. Methods utilized to estimate the required allowance for loan losses for acquired loans not deemed credit-impaired at acquisition are similar to originated loans; however, the estimate of loss is based on the unpaid principal balance less the remaining purchase discount, either on an individually evaluated basis or based on the pool of acquired loans not deemed credit-impaired at acquisition within each risk rating, as applicable. At March 31, 2014, there was $17 million of purchase discount remaining, compared to $21 million of purchase discount remaining at December 31, 2013. No allowance for loan losses was required on acquired loans for either period.The total allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb incurred losses inherent in the total loan portfolio. Unanticipated economic events, including political, economic and regulatory instability could cause changes in the credit characteristics of the portfolio and result in an unanticipated increase in the allowance. Loss emergence periods, which are used to determine the most appropriate default horizon associated with the calculation of probabilities of default, tend to lengthen during benign economic periods and shorten during periods of economic distress. Considered in isolation, lengthening the loss emergence period assumption would result in an increase to the allowance for loan losses. In addition, inclusion of other industry-specific portfolio exposures in the allowance, as well as significant increases in the current portfolio exposures, could also increase the amount of the allowance. Any of these events, or some combination thereof, may result in the need for additional provision for loan losses in order to maintain an allowance that complies with credit risk and accounting policies. 49Table of ContentsThe allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain letters of credit in a manner consistent with business loans, and allowances based on the pool of the remaining letters of credit and all unused commitments to extend credit within each internal risk rating.The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments was $37 million at March 31, 2014 compared to $36 million at December 31, 2013. The $1 million increase in the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments resulted primarily from an increase of $4 million in reserves for standby letters of credit, partially offset by a decrease of $3 million in reserves for unused commitments to extend credit. Nonperforming AssetsNonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, troubled debt restructured loans (TDRs) which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans) and foreclosed property. TDRs include performing and nonperforming loans. Nonperforming TDRs are either on nonaccrual or reduced-rate status. Nonperforming assets do not include purchased credit impaired (PCI) loans.The following table presents a summary of nonperforming assets and past due loans.(dollar amounts in millions)March 31, 2014 December 31, 2013Nonaccrual loans:   Business loans:   Commercial$54 $81Real estate construction:   Commercial Real Estate business line (a)18 20Other business lines (b)1 1Total real estate construction19 21Commercial mortgage:   Commercial Real Estate business line (a)58 51Other business lines (b)104 105Total commercial mortgage162 156International— 4Total nonaccrual business loans235 262Retail loans:   Residential mortgage48 53Consumer:   Home equity32 33Other consumer2 2Total consumer34 35Total nonaccrual retail loans82 88Total nonaccrual loans317 350Reduced-rate loans21 24Total nonperforming loans338 374Foreclosed property14 9Total nonperforming assets$352 $383Nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans0.73% 0.82%Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and foreclosed property0.76 0.84Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total nonperforming loans176 160Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing$10 $16Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing as a percentage of total loans0.02% 0.03%(a)Primarily loans to real estate developers.(b)Primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate.Nonperforming assets decreased $31 million to $352 million at March 31, 2014, from $383 million at December 31, 2013. The decrease in nonperforming assets primarily reflected decreases in nonaccrual commercial loans ($27 million), nonaccrual residential mortgage loans ($5 million) and foreclosed property ($5 million), partially offset by an increase in nonaccrual commercial real estate loans ($7 million). Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and foreclosed property was 0.76 percent at March 31, 2014, compared to 0.84 percent at December 31, 2013.50Table of ContentsThe following table presents a summary of changes in nonaccrual loans.

Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled $10.6 billion at March 31, 2014, of which $3.3 billion, or 31 percent, were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to real estate developers. The remaining $7.3 billion, or 69 percent, of commercial real estate loans in other business lines consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans. The real estate construction loan portfolio totaled $1.8 billion at March 31, 2014. The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-time customers with satisfactory completion experience. Of the $1.5 billion of real estate construction loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line, $18 million were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2014. In other business lines, $1 million of real estate construction loans were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2014. The commercial mortgage loan portfolio totaled $8.8 billion at March 31, 2014 and included $1.8 billion in the Commercial Real Estate business line and $7.0 billion in other business lines. Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Of the $1.8 billion of commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line, $58 53Table of Contentsmillion were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2014. Commercial mortgage loan net charge-offs in the Commercial Real Estate business line were $5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014. In other business lines, $104 million of commercial mortgage loans were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2014, and net charge-offs were insignificant for the three months ended March 31, 2014.The geographic distribution and project type of commercial real estate loans are important factors in diversifying credit risk within the portfolio.

Residential mortgages totaled $1.8 billion at March 31, 2014, and were primarily larger, variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the $1.8 billion of residential mortgage loans outstanding, $48 million were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2014. The home equity portfolio totaled $1.5 billion at March 31, 2014, of which $1.4 billion was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit and $97 million were closed-end home equity loans. Of the $1.5 billion of home equity loans outstanding, $32 million were on nonaccrual status at March 31, 2014. A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at March 31, 2014. The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation's primary geographic markets. Substantially all residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more are placed on nonaccrual status, and substantially all junior lien home equity loans that are current or less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status if full collection of the senior position is in doubt. Such loans are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell no later than 180 days past due.Shared National CreditsSNCs are defined by banking regulators as facilities of more than $20 million shared by three or more federally supervised financial institutions that are selectively reviewed on an annual basis by regulatory authorities at the agent bank level. The Corporation generally seeks to obtain ancillary business at the origination of a SNC relationship. Loans classified as SNC loans totaled $10.1 billion at March 31, 2014 (approximately 865 borrowers), compared to $9.4 billion (approximately 860 borrowers) at December 31, 2013. SNC loans are held to the same credit underwriting and pricing standards as the remainder of the loan portfolio. Comerica Bank (the Bank) was the agent for $1.5 billion of the SNC loans outstanding at both March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. Nonaccrual SNC loans decreased $2 million to $9 million at March 31, 2014, compared to $11 million at December 31, 2013. SNC net loan recoveries totaled $2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2014, compared to net charge-offs of $3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2013.Energy LendingThe Corporation has a portfolio of energy-related loans that are included primarily in "commercial loans" in the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation has over 30 years of experience in energy lending, with a focus on middle market companies. Loans in the Middle Market - Energy business line were $3.1 billion, or approximately 7 percent of total loans, at March 31, 2014, compared to $2.8 billion, or approximately 6 percent of total loans, at December 31, 2013. Nonaccrual Middle Market - Energy loans totaled $1 million at both March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. Middle Market - Energy net loan charge-offs were zero for both the three months ended March 31, 2014 and the three months ended December 31, 2013. Energy loans are diverse in nature, with outstanding balances by customer market segment distributed approximately as follows at March 31, 2014: 74 percent exploration and production (comprised of approximately 56 percent oil, 24 percent mixed and 20 percent natural gas), 11 percent midstream and 15 percent energy services.State and Local MunicipalitiesIn the normal course of business, the Corporation serves the needs of state and local municipalities in multiple capacities, including traditional banking products such as deposit services, loans and letters of credit, investment banking services such as bond underwriting and private placements, and by investing in municipal securities.The following table summarizes the Corporation's direct exposure to state and local municipalities as of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.(in millions)March 31, 2014 December 31, 2013Loans outstanding$23 $39Lease financing330 330Investment securities available-for-sale23 22Trading account securities1 3Standby letters of credit96 97Unused commitments to extend credit31 20Total direct exposure to state and local municipalities$504 $511Indirect exposure comprised $104 million in auction-rate preferred securities collateralized by municipal securities at March 31, 2014, compared to $109 million at December 31, 2013. Additionally, the Corporation is exposed to Automated Clearing House (ACH) transaction risk for those municipalities utilizing this electronic payment and/or deposit method and similar products in their cash flow management. The Corporation sets limits on ACH activity during the underwriting process.Extensions of credit to state and local municipalities are subjected to the same underwriting standards as other business loans. At both March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, all outstanding municipal loans and leases were performing according to contractual terms, and one municipal lease was included in the Corporation's criticized loan list. Municipal leases are secured by the underlying equipment, and a substantial majority of the leases are fully defeased with AAA-rated U.S. government securities. Substantially all municipal investment securities available-for sale are auction-rate securities. All auction-rate securities are reviewed quarterly for other-than-temporary impairment. All auction-rate municipal securities were rated investment grade, and 55Table of Contentsall auction-rate preferred securities collateralized by municipal securities were rated investment grade and were adequately collateralized at both March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. Municipal securities are held in the trading account for resale to customers. In addition, Comerica Securities, a broker-dealer subsidiary of the Bank, underwrites bonds issued by municipalities. All bonds underwritten by Comerica Securities are sold to third party investors. On July 18, 2013, the city of Detroit filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection in federal court. The Corporation's direct exposure to the city of Detroit is insignificant.Automotive LendingSubstantially all dealer loans are in the National Dealer Services business line. Loans in the National Dealer Services business line include floor plan financing and other loans to automotive dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in “commercial loans” in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled $3.4 billion at March 31, 2014, a decrease of $67 million compared to December 31, 2013. At March 31, 2014, other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Services business line totaled $2.1 billion, including $1.4 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans, compared to $2.4 billion of other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Service line, including $1.4 billion of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans, at December 31, 2013. Automotive lending also includes loans to borrowers involved with automotive production, primarily Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers. Loans to borrowers involved with automotive production totaled approximately $1.3 billion at both March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.International ExposureInternational assets are subject to general risks inherent in the conduct of business in foreign countries, including economic uncertainties and each foreign government's regulations. Risk management practices minimize the risk inherent in international lending arrangements. These practices include structuring bilateral agreements or participating in bank facilities, which secure repayment from sources external to the borrower's country. Accordingly, such international outstandings are excluded from the cross-border risk of that country. The Corporation does not hold any sovereign exposure to Europe. The Corporation's international strategy as it pertains to Europe is to focus on European companies doing business in North America, with an emphasis on the Corporation's primary geographic markets. The following table summarizes cross-border exposure to entities domiciled in European countries at March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.

Liquidity risk represents the failure to meet financial obligations coming due resulting from an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding, and the inability to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significant changes in pricing, due to inadequate market depth or market disruptions.The Asset and Liability Policy Committee (ALCO) of the Corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities. ALCO meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies, and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit gathering and risk management. The Corporation's Treasury and Enterprise Risk Departments supports ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate, liquidity and coordination of all other market risks. Key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analysis of the Corporation's balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate, liquidity and all other market risks; (ii) monitoring and reporting of the Corporation's positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines; (iii) developing and presenting analysis and strategies to adjust risk positions; (iv) reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval; (v) monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate, liquidity and all other market risks; and (vi) developing and monitoring the interest rate risk economic capital estimate.Interest Rate RiskNet interest income is the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities, primarily through the Corporation's core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by a combination of core deposits and wholesale borrowings. Approximately 85 percent of the Corporation's loans were floating at March 31, 2014, of which approximately 75 percent were based on LIBOR and 25 percent were based on Prime. This creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the floating-rate loan portfolio and the more slowly repricing deposit products. In addition, growth and/or contraction in the Corporation's loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing investment securities, primarily fixed-rate, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, and hedging the sensitivity with interest rate swaps. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk, with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity. Since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives, a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk. These techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve, utilizing multiple simulation analyses. Simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income, as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors, including, but not limited to, the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, regulatory impacts and management strategies.Sensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest RatesThe analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is management's principal risk management technique. Management models a base case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment and what is believed to be the most likely balance sheet structure. Existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes are included in the analysis, but no additional hedging is currently forecasted. These derivative instruments currently comprise interest rate swaps that convert fixed-rate long term debt to variable rates. This base case net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which rates rise or decline in a linear, non-parallel fashion from the base case over 12 months. In the scenarios presented, short-term interest rates increase 200 basis points, resulting in an average increase in short-term interest rates of 100 basis points over the period (+200 scenario). Due to the current low level of interest rates, the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of a 25 basis point drop in short-term interest rates, to zero percent.Each interest rate scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth, investment security prepayment levels, depositor behavior, yield curves, loan and deposit pricing, and overall balance sheet mix and growth. In the + 200 scenario, assumptions related to loan growth and deposit run-off are based on historical experience, resulting in a modest increase in loans and a modest decrease in deposits from the base case. No changes are modeled to investment securities beyond the replacement of prepayments, and expected funding maturities are included. As a result of the modeled balance sheet movement, excess reserves diminish. In addition, the model reflects deposit pricing based on historical price movements with short-term interest rates. Changes in economic activity, whether domestic or international, may result in a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management 57Table of Contentsincluded in its simulation analysis and may translate into a materially different interest rate environment than those presented. For example, deposit balances have grown significantly over the past several years, creating uncertainty regarding future deposit balance levels. A decline in deposit balances beyond historical experience would reduce the estimated increase in net interest income in the +200 scenario.The table below, as of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above. Estimated Annual Change March 31, 2014 December 31, 2013(in millions)Amount % Amount %Change in Interest Rates:       +200 basis points$213 13 % $210 13 %-25 basis points (to zero percent)(29) (2) (30) (2)Sensitivity increased slightly from December 31, 2013 to March 31, 2014 primarily due to modest changes in forecasted balance sheet mix. The risk to declining interest rates is limited as a result of the inability of the current low level of rates to fall significantly.The table below, as of March 31, 2014, illustrates the estimated sensitivity of the above results to a change in deposit balance assumptions in the +200 scenario, with all other assumptions held constant. In this analysis, average noninterest-bearing deposit run-off in the 12-month period has been increased by $1 billion and $3 billion from the historical run-off experience included in the standard +200 scenario presented above and assumes the deposit run-off reduces excess reserves. The analysis is provided as an indicator of the sensitivity of net interest income to the modeled deposit run-off assumption. It is not meant to reflect management's expectation or best estimate. Actual run-off results may vary from those reflected. The analysis also does not capture possible regulatory impacts, including proposed liquidity requirements, which could impact pricing and deposit products offered and how interest rate risk is managed. +200 Basis Points(in millions)Estimated Annual ChangeMarch 31, 2014Amount %Incremental Average Decrease in Noninterest-bearing Deposit Balances:   $1 billion$202 12%$3 billion180 11Sensitivity of Economic Value of Equity to Changes in Interest RatesIn addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income, an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position. The economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the Corporation's financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements. The economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel 200 basis point increase and 25 basis point decrease in interest rates.The table below, as of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above.

Capacity for incremental purchased funds at March 31, 2014 included the ability to purchase federal funds, sell securities under agreements to repurchase, as well as issue deposits to institutional investors and issue certificates of 58Table of Contentsdeposit through brokers. Purchased funds totaled $629 million at March 31, 2014, compared to $602 million at December 31, 2013. At March 31, 2014, the Bank had pledged loans totaling $25 billion which provided for up to $20 billion of available collateralized borrowing with the FRB.The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas, Texas (FHLB), which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. At March 31, 2014, $14 billion of real estate-related loans were pledged to the FHLB as blanket collateral for current and potential future borrowings. As of March 31, 2014, the Corporation had $1.0 billion of outstanding borrowings from the FHLB maturing in May 2014. Additionally, the Bank had the ability to issue up to $15.0 billion of debt at March 31, 2014 under an existing $15 billion medium-term senior note program which allows the issuance of debt with maturities between three months and 30 years. The Corporation also maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and/or equity securities.The Federal Reserve completed its 2014 CCAR review in March 2014 and did not object to Comerica's capital plan and capital distributions contemplated in the plan. Comerica's capital plan includes the authority to fully redeem $150 million par value of subordinated notes due 2024. The notes are callable at par on or after July 15, 2014 and were recorded at a carrying value of $183 million at March 31, 2014. Further information regarding the Corporation's medium- and long-term debt is provided in Note 7 to these unaudited financial statements.The ability of the Corporation and the Bank to raise funds at competitive rates is impacted by rating agencies' views of the credit quality, liquidity, capital and earnings of the Corporation and the Bank. As of March 31, 2014, the four major rating agencies had assigned the following ratings to long-term senior unsecured obligations of the Corporation and the Bank. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Liquid assets, which totaled $11.9 billion at March 31, 2014, compared to $12.6 billion at December 31, 2013, provide a reservoir of liquidity. Liquid assets include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits with banks, other short-term investments and unencumbered investment securities available-for-sale. At March 31, 2014, the Corporation held excess liquidity, represented by $4.3 billion deposited with the FRB, compared to $5.2 billion at December 31, 2013.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESThe Corporation’s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation’s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2013, the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to the allowance for credit losses, valuation methodologies, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation’s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages F-41 through F-46 in the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report. As of the date of this report, the Corporation does not believe there are any material changes in the nature or categories of the critical accounting policies or estimates and assumptions from those discussed in the Corporation's 2013 Annual Report.59Table of ContentsSUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATAThe following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this financial review with financial measures defined by GAAP.(dollar amounts in millions)March 31, 2014 December 31, 2013Tier 1 Common Capital Ratio:   Tier 1 and Tier 1 common capital (a) (b)$6,961 $6,895Risk-weighted assets (a) (b)66,051 64,825Tier 1 and Tier 1 common risk-based capital ratio (b)10.54% 10.64%Basel III Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio:   Tier 1 common capital (b)$6,961 $6,895Basel III adjustments (c)(3) (6)Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital (c)$6,958 $6,889Risk-weighted assets (a) (b)$66,051 $64,825Basel III adjustments (c)1,603 1,754Basel III risk-weighted assets (c)$67,654 $66,579Tier 1 common capital ratio (b)10.5% 10.6%Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio (c)10.3 10.3Tangible Common Equity Ratio:   Common shareholders' equity$7,283 $7,153Less:   Goodwill635 635Other intangible assets16 17Tangible common equity$6,632 $6,501Total assets$65,681 $65,227Less:   Goodwill635 635Other intangible assets16 17Tangible assets$65,030 $64,575Common equity ratio11.09% 10.97%Tangible common equity ratio10.20 10.07Tangible Common Equity per Share of Common Stock:   Common shareholders' equity$7,283 $7,153Tangible common equity6,632 6,501Shares of common stock outstanding (in millions)182 182Common shareholders' equity per share of common stock$40.09 $39.23Tangible common equity per share of common stock36.50 35.65(a)Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets as defined by regulation.(b)March 31, 2014 Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted-assets are estimated.(c)Estimated ratios based on the standardized approach in the final rule for the U.S. adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework, excluding most elements of AOCI.The Tier 1 common capital ratio removes preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital as defined by and calculated in conformity with bank regulations. The Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio further adjusts Tier 1 common capital and risk-weighted assets to account for the final rule approved by U.S. banking regulators in July 2013 for the U.S. adoption of the Basel III regulatory capital framework. The final Basel III capital rules are effective January 1, 2015 for banking organizations subject to the standardized approach. The tangible common equity ratio removes preferred stock and the effect of intangible assets from capital and the effect of intangible assets from total assets and tangible common equity per share of common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders' equity per share of common stock. The Corporation believes these measurements are meaningful measures of capital adequacy used by investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and to compare against other companies in the industry.60Table of ContentsITEM 3.
