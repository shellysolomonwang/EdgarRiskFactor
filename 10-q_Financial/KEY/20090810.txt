Item 1A.   Risk Factors    An investment in KeyCorp common shares is subject to risks inherent to KeyCorp and its subsidiaries’ (“Key’s”) business, its industry and ownership of its equity securities. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below relating to recent developments and the risk factors included in Key’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008, and its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2009, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. The risks and uncertainties that management has identified below are material. Although Key has significant risk management policies, procedures and verification processes in place, additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of, or focused on, or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair its business operations. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors. This report also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.  IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS ACTUALLY OCCUR, KEY’S BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND/OR ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY AND/OR CREDIT COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED (“MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON KEY”). IF THIS WERE TO HAPPEN, THE VALUE OF KEYCORP’S SECURITIES — COMMON SHARES, NONCUMULATIVE PERPETUAL CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES A (“SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK”), FIXED-RATE CUMULATIVE PERPETUAL PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES B (“SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK”) AND KEYCORP’S CAPITAL SECURITIES — COULD DECLINE, PERHAPS SIGNIFICANTLY, AND YOU COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT.  Risks Associated with Recent Developments  The United States Department of the Treasury (the “U.S. Treasury”) may require Key to raise additional capital that would likely be dilutive to its common shares.  In Key’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008, it reported that under the U.S. Treasury’s Capital Assessment Program (“CAP”) Key was required to participate in the  110    Table of Contents  Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (“SCAP”) to determine whether it would be required to raise additional capital. As announced on May 7, 2009, under the SCAP assessment, Key is required to increase the amount of its Tier 1 common equity by $1.8 billion within six months. As of July 6, 2009, Key believes that it has generated in excess of the $1.8 billion required by the SCAP results. Although Key believes that it has now fulfilled the requirement to generate $1.8 billion of additional Tier 1 common equity pursuant to the SCAP, there can be no assurance that its regulators, including the U.S. Treasury and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (“Federal Reserve”), will not conduct additional “stress test” capital assessments, such as the SCAP, and/or require Key to generate additional capital, including Tier 1 common equity, in the future in light of changing economic circumstances. Any additional capital Key generates in the future, whether through exchange offers, underwritten offerings of common shares, or other public or private transactions, or through the conversion of KeyCorp Series B Preferred Stock issued under the Capital Purchase Program (“CPP”) to mandatory convertible preferred shares under the CAP and the issuance of warrants to the U.S. Treasury, would likely be dilutive to common shareholders and may reduce the market price of KeyCorp common shares.  If so required by its regulators to raise additional capital, Key may not be able to raise private (i.e., nongovernmental) capital in the amount required or at all, in which event Key may be required to raise additional capital through the U.S. Treasury’s CAP.  There can be no assurance that private capital will be available to Key on acceptable terms or at all, or that sufficient holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, capital securities or other debt securities will be willing to exchange such securities for KeyCorp common shares. If Key is unable to raise such amount of additional capital required to be raised through private capital transactions, Key may be required to obtain capital from the U.S. Treasury by converting KeyCorp Series B Preferred Stock issued under the CPP to mandatory convertible preferred shares under the CAP. To view the standard CAP term sheet, including a summary of the terms of the securities that the U.S. Treasury receives in connection with any CAP issuance, see www.financialstability.gov.  The issuance of mandatory convertible preferred shares under the CAP would likely impose additional conditions and limitations related to executive compensation and corporate governance upon Key as well as new public reporting obligations. Many of Key’s competitors would not be subject to these restrictions and would therefore gain a competitive advantage.  Furthermore, the CAP mandatory convertible preferred shares would accrue cumulative dividends at a rate of 9% per annum until their mandatory conversion to common shares after seven years or prior redemption. This would represent an increase in dividend payments over the current CPP rate of 5% per annum (for the first five years), which could adversely impact Key’s liquidity, limit its ability to return capital to shareholders and have a material adverse effect on it.  Converting a large amount of KeyCorp Series B Preferred Stock issued under the CPP to mandatory convertible preferred shares issued under the CAP could result in the U.S. Treasury becoming a significant shareholder of Key. Even if the U.S. Treasury does not control a majority of voting power, it may be able to exert significant influence on matters submitted to shareholders for approval, including the election of directors and certain transactions. The U.S. Treasury may also transfer all, or a portion, of its shares to another person or entity and, in the event of such a transfer, that person or entity could become a significant shareholder of Key. In addition, any issuance of a large amount of common equity or equity convertible into common equity to a private investor or group of investors may pose similar risks.  Having a significant shareholder may make some future transactions more difficult or perhaps impossible to complete without the support of such shareholder. The interests of the significant shareholder may not coincide with Key’s interests or the interests of other shareholders. There can be no assurance that any significant shareholder will exercise its influence in Key’s best interests as opposed to its best interests as a significant shareholder. A significant shareholder may make it difficult to approve certain transactions even if they are supported by the other shareholders, which may have an adverse effect on the market price of KeyCorp common shares.  111    Table of Contents  Should Key decide to increase further its Tier 1 common equity, future issuances of common shares will result in significant dilution to holders of KeyCorp common shares.  Although not currently contemplated, Key may elect in the future to increase further its Tier 1 common equity by exchanging (with the approval of the U.S. Treasury) a number of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock Key issued to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP for shares of mandatory convertible preferred stock issued under the CAP, or for common shares or another common equivalent security that the U.S. Treasury otherwise agrees to purchase, directly or indirectly. Such an exchange could also involve the issuance of a warrant to the U.S. Treasury to purchase additional common shares as contemplated by the published terms of the CAP. In addition, in connection with purchasing the Series B Preferred Stock, pursuant to a Letter Agreement dated November 14, 2008, and the Securities Purchase Agreement—Standard Terms attached thereto, the U.S. Treasury received a warrant to purchase 35,244,361 KeyCorp common shares at an initial per share exercise price of $10.64, subject to adjustment, which expires ten years from the issuance date, and KeyCorp has agreed to provide the U.S. Treasury with registration rights covering the warrant and the underlying common shares. Even if KeyCorp were to redeem the Series B Preferred Stock there is no assurance that this warrant will be fully retired, and therefore that it will not be exercised, prior to its expiration date. The issuance of additional common shares or common equivalent securities in future equity offerings to the U.S. Treasury under the SCAP or otherwise, or as a result of the exercise of the warrant the U.S. Treasury holds, will dilute the ownership interest of KeyCorp’s existing common shareholders.  In addition, the terms of the warrant KeyCorp issued to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP provides that, if KeyCorp issues common shares or securities convertible or exercisable into, or exchangeable for, common shares at a price that is less than 90% of the market price of such shares on the last trading day preceding the date of the agreement to sell such shares, the number and the per share price of common shares to be purchased pursuant to the warrant will be adjusted pursuant to its terms. KeyCorp may also choose to issue securities convertible into or exercisable for its common shares and such securities may themselves contain anti-dilution provisions. Such anti-dilution adjustment provisions may have a further dilutive effect on other holders of KeyCorp common shares.  There can be no assurances that KeyCorp will not in the future determine that it is advisable, or that KeyCorp will not encounter circumstances where it determines that it is necessary, to issue additional common shares, securities convertible into or exchangeable for common shares or common-equivalent securities to fund strategic initiatives or other business needs or to build additional capital. The market price of KeyCorp common shares could decline as a result of such exchange offerings, as well as other sales of a large block of KeyCorp common shares or similar securities in the market thereafter, or the perception that such sales could occur.  KeyCorp may not be permitted to repurchase the U.S. Treasury’s Troubled Asset Relief Program (“TARP”) CPP investment if and when it requests approval to do so.  Although KeyCorp believes that it has generated in excess of the $1.8 billion in additional Tier 1 common equity required by the SCAP, it has not currently requested the approval of the U.S. Treasury to repurchase the Series B Preferred Stock and warrant issued to the U.S. Treasury under the TARP CPP. In order to repurchase one or both of such securities, in whole or in part, KeyCorp must establish that it has satisfied all of the conditions to repurchase and must obtain the approval of the U.S. Treasury. There can be no assurance that KeyCorp will be able to repurchase the U.S. Treasury’s TARP investment.  You may not receive dividends on the common shares.  Holders of KeyCorp common shares are only entitled to receive such dividends as the Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Furthermore, KeyCorp’s common shareholders are subject to the prior dividend rights of any holders of its preferred stock or depositary  112    Table of Contents  shares representing such preferred stock then outstanding. As of July 6, 2009, there were 2,904,839 shares of KeyCorp’s Series A Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $100 per share issued and outstanding and 25,000 shares of the Series B Preferred Stock, with a liquidation preference of $100,000 per share, issued and outstanding.  In July 2009, KeyCorp reduced its quarterly dividend on its common shares to $0.01 per share and does not expect to increase the quarterly dividend above $0.01 for the foreseeable future. KeyCorp could determine to eliminate its common shares dividend altogether. Furthermore, as long as the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series B Preferred Stock are outstanding, dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions relating to certain equity securities, including its common shares, are prohibited until all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on such preferred stock, subject to certain limited exceptions. In addition, prior to November 14, 2011, unless KeyCorp has redeemed all of its Series B Preferred Stock or the U.S. Treasury has transferred all of the Series B Preferred Stock to third parties, the consent of the U.S. Treasury will be required for KeyCorp to, among other things, increase its common shares dividend above $.1875 except in limited circumstances. This could adversely affect the market price of its common shares. Also, KeyCorp is a bank holding company and its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding capital adequacy and dividends.  In addition, terms of Key’s outstanding junior subordinated debt securities prohibit it from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on its capital stock, including its common shares, or purchasing, acquiring, or making a liquidation payment on such stock, if an event of default has occurred and is continuing under the applicable indenture, if Key is in default with respect to a guarantee payment under the guarantee of the related capital securities or if Key has given notice of its election to defer interest payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing.  The credit ratings of KeyCorp and KeyBank are important in order to maintain liquidity.  Although Key’s long-term debt is currently rated investment-grade by the major rating agencies, the ratings of Key’s long-term debt (including capital securities) have been downgraded and/or put on negative watch by those major rating agencies. These rating agencies regularly evaluate the securities of KeyCorp and KeyBank, and their ratings of our long-term debt and other securities are based on a number of factors, including Key’s financial strength, ability to generate earnings, and other factors, some of which are not entirely within Key’s control, such as conditions affecting the financial services industry and the economy. In light of the difficulties in the financial services industry, the financial markets and the economy, there can be no assurance that Key will maintain its current ratings.  If the securities of KeyCorp and/or KeyBank suffer additional ratings downgrades, such downgrades could adversely affect access to liquidity and could significantly increase Key’s cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to Key, thereby curtailing its business operations and reducing its ability to generate income. Further downgrades of the credit ratings of Key’s securities, particularly if they are below investment-grade, could have a Material Adverse Effect on Key.  113    Table of Contents             Item 4.
