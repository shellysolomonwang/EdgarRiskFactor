Item 1A: Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009.    Any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of subsequent events or circumstances. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider all risks and uncertainties disclosed in our SEC filings, including our reports on Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q and our registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, all of which are accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and at www.Key.com/IR.     Long-term goals  Our long-term financial goals are as follows:     ♦   Continue to achieve a loan to core deposit ratio range of 90% to 100%.      ♦   Return to a moderate risk profile by targeting a net charge-off ratio range of 40 to 50 basis points.      ♦   Grow high quality and diverse revenue streams by targeting a net interest margin in excess of 3.50% and maintain noninterest income to total revenue of greater than 40%.      ♦   Create positive operating leverage and complete Keyvolution run-rate savings goal of $300 million to $375 million by the end of 2012.      ♦   Achieve a return on average assets in the range of 1.00% to 1.25%.    62    Table of Contents     Figure 1 shows the evaluation of our long-term goals for the second quarter of 2010.

Strategic developments  We initiated the following actions during 2009 and 2010 to support our corporate strategy described in the “Introduction” section under the “Corporate Strategy” heading on page 16 of our 2009 annual report.     ♦   We established long-term benchmark metrics for success for our loan to deposit ratio, net charge-offs to average loans, net interest margin, noninterest income to total revenue ratio, return on average assets and our efficiency/expense control initiative (Keyvolution) during the first quarter of 2010.      ♦   During the first six months of 2010, we have opened 18 new branches, and we expect to open an additional 22 branches during the remainder of 2010. During 2009, we opened 38 new branches in eight markets, and we have completed renovations on 192 branches over the past two and a half years.      ♦   During 2009, we settled all outstanding federal income tax issues with the IRS for the tax years 1997-2006, including all outstanding leveraged lease tax issues for all open tax years.      ♦   During the third quarter of 2009, we decided to exit the government-guaranteed education lending business, following earlier actions taken in the third quarter of 2008 to cease private student lending. As a result of this decision, we have accounted for the education lending business as a discontinued operation. Additionally, we ceased conducting business in both the commercial vehicle and office equipment leasing markets.      ♦   During the second quarter of 2009, we decided to wind down the operations of Austin, a subsidiary that specialized in managing hedge fund investments for institutional customers. As a result of this decision, we have accounted for this business as a discontinued operation.    63    Table of Contents        Economic overview  During the second quarter of 2010, concerns emerged that the pace of the U.S. economic recovery was slowing. A reluctance by employers to add employees to payrolls, slowing of growth in housing and consumer spending, and the European sovereign debt crisis each cast doubt on the sustainability of economic growth and the recovery. U.S. payrolls increased by 524,000 during the second quarter of 2010 compared to a 261,000 increase in the first quarter of 2010; however, a large part of this improvement was due to temporary government census hiring. Private payrolls did increase by 323,000 compared to a 236,000 increase the prior quarter. Prior to 2010, over 8 million Americans had lost their jobs during the recession that began in December 2007. The average unemployment rate for the second quarter of 2010 remained at the first quarter average of 9.7%. This compares to a 9.3% average rate for all of 2009 and a 10 year average rate of 5.8%.  U.S. household spending slowed during the second quarter of 2010. The average monthly rate of consumer spending was unchanged for the second quarter of 2010 compared to an average monthly increase of 0.4% in the first quarter of 2010 and an average monthly increase of 0.3% for all of 2009. Measures of inflation continued to remain under control as prices for consumer goods and services increased a modest 1.1% in June 2010 from June 2009, compared to an annual increase of 2.3% in March 2010 and a 2.7% increase for all of 2009.  The homebuyer tax credit, offered as part of “The Worker, Homeownership and Business Assistance Act of 2009,” contributed to an improvement in the housing market to begin the second quarter of 2010. Home buying activity increased early in the quarter as home buyers rushed to beat the April 2010 tax credit expiration, but activity weakened following the expiration. In June 2010, new home sales decreased by 14% from March 2010. As a result, new home prices fell and building activity plummeted towards the end of the quarter. In June 2010, median prices for new homes fell 5% from March 2010 and residential housing starts decreased by 13% over the same period. Existing home sales rose by 0.2% in June 2010 from March 2010 while median prices for existing homes rose 8% over the same period. Existing home prices may have been supported by slowing foreclosures which fell 14% in June 2010 from March 2010.  Business spending continued to support economic activity in the second quarter of 2010 as companies continued to rebuild inventory levels and make investments in capital goods. Factory production continued to show improvement and resource utilization levels continued to increase from their lows in mid-2009.  The uncertainties surrounding a stalling economic recovery and sovereign debt instabilities renewed fears in the financial markets. A reemergence of a flight to quality causing increased demand for government securities sent the benchmark two-year Treasury yield down to the lowest levels seen during this recession, falling 0.41% from 1.02% at March 31, 2010 to 0.61% at June 30, 2010. The ten-year Treasury yield, which began the quarter at 3.83%, declined 0.90% to close the quarter at 2.93%. While there were sharp declines in Treasury yields during the quarter, the concern over the creditworthiness of financial institutions resulted in an increase in short-term interbank lending rates by as much as 0.25%. As credit concerns once again heightened, credit spreads for banks’ and financial firms’ debt obligations widened. Acknowledging the fragility of the economy and financial markets, the Federal Reserve held the federal funds target rate near zero during the first half of 2010 and maintained its stance that rates would stay at exceptionally low levels for an extended period. The Federal Reserve also reestablished the Central Bank Liquidity Swap Program to improve liquidity conditions in U.S. dollar funding markets abroad.     Regulatory Reform Developments  On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act into law. The Dodd-Frank Act is intended to address perceived deficiencies and gaps in the regulatory framework for financial services in the United States, reduce the risks of bank failures and better equip the nation’s regulators to guard against or mitigate any future financial crises, and manage systemic risk through increased supervision of systemically important financial companies (including nonbank financial companies). The Dodd-Frank  64    Table of Contents  Act implements numerous and far-reaching changes across the financial landscape affecting financial companies, including banks and bank holding companies such as Key, by, among other things:     ♦   Requiring regulation and oversight on large, systemically important financial institutions by establishing an interagency council on systemic risk and implementation of heightened prudential standards and regulation by the Federal Reserve for systemically important financial institutions (including nonbank financial companies), as well as the implementation of FDIC resolution procedures for liquidation of large financial companies to avoid market disruption;      ♦   Applying the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies, savings and loan holding companies and systemically important nonbank financial companies;      ♦   Limiting the Federal Reserve’s emergency authority to lend to nondepository institutions to facilities with broad-based eligibility, and authorizing the FDIC to establish an emergency financial stabilization fund for solvent depository institutions and their holding companies, subject to the approval of Congress, the U.S. Treasury Secretary and the Federal Reserve;      ♦   Centralizing responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a consumer protection bureau, with responsibility for implementing, enforcing and examining for compliance with federal consumer financial laws;      ♦   Creating regimes for regulation of over-the-counter derivatives and non-admitted property and casualty insurers and reinsurers;      ♦   Requiring any interchange transaction fee charged for a debit transaction be “reasonable” and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer for the transaction, the Federal Reserve to prescribe new regulations establishing such fee standards, and eliminating exclusivity arrangement between issuers and networks for debit card transactions and limits restrictions on merchant discounting for use of certain payment forms and minimum or maximum amount thresholds as a condition for acceptance of credit cards.      ♦   Implementing regulation of hedge fund and private equity advisers by requiring such advisers to register with the SEC (should they manage $150 million or more in assets);      ♦   Requiring issuers of asset-backed securities to retain some of the risk associated with the offered securities;      ♦   Providing for the implementation of corporate governance provisions for all public companies concerning proxy access and executive compensation;      ♦   Increasing the FDIC’s deposit insurance limits permanently to $250,000 for non-transaction accounts, providing for unlimited federal deposit insurance on non-interest bearing demand transaction accounts at all insured depository institutions effective December 31, 2010 through January 1, 2013 and changing the assessment base as well as increasing the reserve ratio for the DIF to ensure the future strength of the DIF; and      ♦   Reforming regulation of credit rating agencies.    The above list of reforms implemented as part of the Dodd-Frank Act is only an overview. For further information on the Dodd-Frank Act see the summary provided in the House-Senate conference report, House Report 111-517, as published in the Congressional Record of June 29, 2010.     Interchange Fees  Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will require additional studies and new regulations to be completed before they take effect. One area that has received considerable discussion is the potential impact on interchange revenues. In total, on an annualized basis, Key derives approximately $75 million  65    Table of Contents  in revenue from debit interchange; until the regulations are proposed and ultimately finalized we will not know the impact on this revenue stream.     Regulation E pursuant to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978  The Federal Reserve finalized rules regarding Regulation E, which is designed to protect consumers by prohibiting unfair practices and improving disclosures to consumers. Regulation E became effective July 1, 2010, and among other items, prohibits financial institutions from charging overdraft fees to a client without receiving consent from the client to “opt-in” to the financial institutions overdraft services for ATM and everyday debit card transactions.  Once fully in effect, based on the number of clients whom have opted-in through July 30, 2010, we anticipate these rules to reduce our deposit service charge income by approximately $40 million annually. This amount is subject to change as additional clients opt-in.     Demographics  We have two major business groups: Community Banking and National Banking. The effect on our business of continued volatility and weakness in the housing market varies with the state of the economy in the regions in which these business groups operate.  The Community Banking group serves consumers and small to mid-sized businesses by offering a variety of deposit, investment, lending and wealth management products and services. These products and services are provided through a 14-state branch network organized into three internally defined geographic regions: Rocky Mountains and Northwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast. The National Banking group includes those corporate and consumer business units that operate nationally, within and beyond our 14-state branch network, as well as internationally. The specific products and services offered by the Community and National Banking groups are described in Note 3.  Figure 2 shows the geographic diversity of our Community Banking group’s average core deposits, commercial loans and home equity loans.  Figure 2.

Figure 17, which appears later in this report in the “Loans and loans held for sale” section, shows the diversity of our commercial real estate lending business based on industry type and location. Deteriorating market conditions in the residential properties segment of the commercial real estate construction portfolio, principally in Florida and southern California, caused nonperforming loans and net charge-offs to increase significantly beginning in mid-2007. As previously reported, we have ceased all new lending to homebuilders and, since December 31, 2007, we have reduced outstanding balances in the residential properties segment of the commercial real estate construction loan portfolio by $2.8 billion, or 79%, to $752 million. Additional information about loan sales is included in the “Credit risk management” section.  Elevated vacancy rates, reduced cash flows and reduced real estate values have continued to adversely affect commercial real estate on a national basis due to weak economic conditions. While remaining stressed, market conditions for commercial real estate showed some improvement in the second quarter  66    Table of Contents  of 2010 with cash flows stabilizing and better market liquidity. As a result, we experienced a decline in delinquencies, nonperforming loans and charge-offs during the second quarter of 2010 when compared to the prior quarter.  Since the beginning of the financial crisis, results for the National Banking group have also been affected adversely by increasing credit costs and volatility in the capital markets, which have led to declines in the market values of assets under management and the market values at which we record certain assets (primarily commercial real estate loans and securities held for sale or trading).  During the first quarter of 2009, we determined that the estimated fair value of the National Banking reporting unit was less than the carrying amount. As a result, we recorded an after-tax noncash accounting charge of $187 million. As a result of this charge and a similar after-tax charge of $420 million recorded during the fourth quarter of 2008, we have written off all of the goodwill that had been assigned to our National Banking reporting unit.     Critical accounting policies and estimates  Our business is dynamic and complex. Consequently, we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies. These choices are critical: not only are they necessary to comply with GAAP, they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance. All accounting policies are important, and all policies described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) on page 79 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance.  In our opinion, some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility. These policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance, or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. Because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances, they may prove to be inaccurate, or we may find it necessary to change them.  We rely heavily on the use of judgment, assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions, including accounting for the allowance for loan losses; contingent liabilities, guarantees and income taxes; derivatives and related hedging activities; and assets and liabilities that involve valuation methodologies. A brief discussion of each of these areas appears on pages 19 through 21 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders.  At June 30, 2010, $23.4 billion, or 25%, of our total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Approximately 95% of these assets were classified as Level 1 or Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. At June 30, 2010, $2.5 billion, or 3%, of our total liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Substantially all of these liabilities were classified as Level 1 or Level 2.  At June 30, 2010, $606 million, or 1%, of our total assets were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Approximately 8% of these assets were classified as Level 1 or Level 2. At June 30, 2010, there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  In addition, with the consolidation of the education lending securitization trusts on January 1, 2010, assets and liabilities at fair value of $3.3 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, were included on the balance sheet at June 30, 2010, in the discontinued assets and liabilities line items.  During the first six months of 2010, we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates.  67    Table of Contents     Highlights of Our Performance  Financial performance  For the second quarter of 2010, we announced net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $56 million, or $.06 per common share. These results compare to a net loss from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $394 million, or $.68 per common share, for the second quarter of 2009. Second quarter net income attributable to Key common shareholders was $29 million compared to a net loss attributable to Key common shareholders of $390 million for the second quarter of 2009. Net loss attributable to Key common shareholders for the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 was $67 million compared to a net loss attributable to Key common shareholders of $926 million for the same period one year ago.  The second quarter earnings improvement resulted from a lower provision for loan losses, higher fee income, and well-controlled expenses when compared to the first quarter of 2010. Credit quality also continued to improve across the majority of the loan portfolios in both Community Banking and National Banking.  For the first six months of 2010, the net loss from continuing operations attributable to Key common shares was $42 million, or $.05 per common share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $901 million, or $1.68 per common share, for the same period last year.  The net interest margin was 3.17% for the second quarter of 2010. This was a decrease of 2 basis points from the first quarter of 2010 and an increase of 47 basis points from the year-ago quarter. The decrease from the first quarter of 2010 was due to pay downs of loan balances which resulted in higher levels of short-term liquidity. This liquidity was redeployed into the investment portfolio during the second quarter and earns a lower yield than our loan portfolio, placing pressure on the net interest margin. Also, the benefit from re-pricing maturing certificates of deposit in the second quarter was more heavily weighted to the last half of the quarter which will benefit the net interest margin in the third quarter. Given the impact of certificate of deposit re-pricing from the second quarter and additional re-pricing of higher costing maturing certificates of deposit in the third quarter, we expect the net interest margin to expand by approximately 10 to 15 basis points during the third quarter of 2010 compared to the second quarter.  Net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2010 were $435 million, a decline of $87 million from the first quarter of 2010. In total, commercial loan net charge-offs decreased by $59 million, primarily driven by lower charge-offs from the commercial real estate construction portfolio. We also experienced improvement across all of our consumer portfolios in the second quarter. During the second quarter, nonperforming loans decreased by $362 million from $2.1 billion at March 31, 2010 to $1.7 billion at June 30, 2010. This decrease was primarily attributable to continued stabilization in the commercial loan portfolio.  Our Tier 1 common equity and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios remain strong at 8.07% and 13.62%, respectively.  Our allowance for loan losses decreased to $2.2 billion from $2.3 billion from a year-ago. At June 30, 2010, our allowance represented 4.16% of total loans compared to 3.48% at June 30, 2009 and 130% of nonperforming loans at the end of the second quarter of 2010 compared to 107% at the end of the year-ago quarter. One of our primary areas of focus has been to reduce our exposure to the higher risk segments of our commercial real estate portfolio through loan restructuring, refinancing, discounted pay-offs and liquidations. Further information pertaining to our progress in reducing our commercial real estate exposure and our exit loan portfolio is presented in the section entitled “Credit risk management.”  We made significant progress strengthening our liquidity and funding positions in the midst of weak loan demand and a soft economy. Our consolidated loan to deposit ratio was 93% for the second quarter 2010 compared to 107% for the second quarter of 2009. This improvement was accomplished by reducing our reliance on wholesale funding, exiting nonrelationship businesses and increasing the portion of our earning assets invested in highly liquid securities. During the first six months of 2010, we originated approximately $12.9 billion in new or renewed lending commitments.  68    Table of Contents  During the first six months of 2010, we continued our investment in our Community Banking 14-state branch network by opening 18 new branches, with an additional 22 branches slated to be opened during the remainder of 2010. In addition, we also continue with our plans to further modernize our existing branches. These investments enable our customers to utilize the full breadth of solutions, expertise, products and services we have to offer.  We continue to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our organization. Over the past two years, we have reduced our staff by more than 2,500 average full-time equivalent employees and implemented ongoing initiatives that will better align our cost structure with our relationship-focused business strategies. We want to ensure that we have effective business models that are sustainable and flexible.  Finally, we remain steadfast in our actions of reducing risk exposure, concentrating on core relationship businesses, and maintaining strong capital, liquidity and reserve levels as we emerge from this extraordinary credit cycle as a strong, competitive company.

In April 2009, we decided to wind down the operations of Austin, a subsidiary that specialized in managing hedge fund investments for institutional customers. As a result of these decisions, we have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations. The loss from discontinued operations for the six-month period ended June 30, 2010, was primarily attributable to fair value adjustments related to the education lending securitization trusts. Included in the loss from discontinued operations for the six-month period ended June 30, 2009, is a charge for intangible assets impairment related to Austin.

unit of KeyBank. In April 2009, we decided to wind down the operations of Austin, a subsidiary that specialized in managing hedge fund investments for institutional customers.   70    Table of Contents  Figure 5 presents certain financial measures related to “tangible common equity” and “Tier 1 common equity.” The tangible common equity ratio has been a focus of some investors. We believe this ratio may assist investors in analyzing our capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. Since the SCAP in early 2009, the Federal Reserve has focused its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 capital known as Tier 1 common equity. Because the Federal Reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders’ equity (essentially Tier 1 capital less preferred stock, qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in Tier 1 capital, this focus on Tier 1 common equity is consistent with existing capital adequacy guidelines. The recently enacted Dodd-Frank Act will change the regulatory capital standards that apply to bank holding companies by phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities (excluding TARP CPP preferred stock issued to the United States or its agencies or instrumentalities before October 4, 2010) being treated as Tier 1 eligible capital. This three year phase-out period which commences January 1, 2013, may affect Key capital securities and ultimately result in our capital securities being treated only as Tier 2 capital.  Tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by GAAP nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations; this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity and Tier 1 common equity, we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases. Figure 5 also reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures.  Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.  71    Table of Contents  Figure 5.

During the first quarter of 2010, we re-aligned our reporting structure for our business groups. Prior to 2010, Consumer Finance consisted mainly of portfolios which were identified as exit or run-off portfolios and were included in our National Banking segment. Effective for all periods presented, we are reflecting the results of these exit portfolios in Other Segments. The automobile dealer floor-plan business, previously included in Consumer Finance, has been re-aligned with the Commercial Banking line of business within the Community Banking segment. In addition, other previously identified exit portfolios included in the National Banking segment have been moved to Other Segments. Note 3 (“Line of Business Results”) describes the products and services offered by each of these business groups, provides more detailed financial information pertaining to the groups and their respective lines of business, and explains “Other Segments” and “Reconciling Items.”  Figure 6 summarizes the contribution made by each major business group to our “taxable-equivalent revenue from continuing operations” and “income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Key” for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 and 2009.

(b)   Reconciling Items for the second quarter of 2009 include a $32 million ($20 million after-tax) gain from the sale of Key’s claim associated with the Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy.   73    Table of Contents     Community Banking summary of operations  As shown in Figure 7, Community Banking recorded net income attributable to Key of $32 million for the second quarter of 2010, compared to a net loss attributable to Key of $30 million for the year-ago quarter. Decreases in the provision for loan losses and noninterest expense were the primary drivers of the improvement in the second quarter of 2010.  Taxable-equivalent net interest income declined by $29 million, or 7%, from the second quarter of 2009, due to declines in average earning assets and average deposits. Average earning assets decreased $3 billion, or 10%, from the year-ago quarter, reflecting reductions in the commercial loan and home equity loan portfolios. Average deposits declined by $2 billion, or 5%. The mix of deposits continues to change as higher-costing certificates of deposit originated in years prior to 2009 mature, partially offset by growth in noninterest-bearing deposits and NOW and money market deposit accounts.  Noninterest income increased by $6 million, or 3%, from the year-ago quarter, due to higher income from trust and investment services, electronic banking fees, and a reduction in the provision for credit losses from client derivatives. The increase in trust and investment services income reflects increased performance in our Key Private Bank, as well as growth in our branch based investment services. These factors were partially offset by lower service charges on deposits, increased net losses on securities from a Community Development lending investment, and decreases in various other components of noninterest income.  The provision for loan losses declined by $78 million, or 39%, compared to the second quarter of 2009 due to the improved economic conditions.  Noninterest expense declined by $41 million, or 8%, from the year-ago quarter. In the second quarter of 2009, the FDIC imposed a special assessment on all FDIC insured institutions to replenish the insurance fund. As a result, our FDIC insurance assessment declined $29 million in the current quarter, compared to the same period one year ago. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2010, the provision for losses on lending-related commitments was a credit of $4 million, compared to a charge of $4 million recorded in the second quarter of 2009. These expense reductions were partially offset by increases in personnel expense and professional fees.  Figure 7.

This improvement in the second quarter of 2010 was a result of a substantial decrease in the provision for loan losses.  Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $35 million, or 15%, from the second quarter of 2009, primarily due to lower earning assets, partially offset by improved earning asset yields. Average earning assets decreased by $8 billion, or 26%, from the year-ago quarter.  Noninterest income declined $1 million from the second quarter of 2009. Investment banking and capital markets income increased $18 million, and net gains from loan sales were $9 million, compared to net losses from loan sales of $7 million for the same period one year ago. These gains were offset by decreases in brokerage commissions and fee income of $13 million, operating lease revenue of $8 million, and various other miscellaneous income items from the second quarter of 2009.  The provision for loan losses in the second quarter of 2010 was $99 million compared to $494 million for the same period one year ago. National Banking continued to experience improved asset quality for the third quarter in a row.  Noninterest expense decreased by $33 million, or 11%, from the second quarter of 2009 as a result of a credit of $6 million to the provision for losses on lending-related commitments compared to a charge of $13 million in the year-ago quarter. Operating lease expense, the provision for losses on LIHTC guaranteed funds, and FDIC deposit insurance premiums also declined from the second quarter of 2009. These improvements were partially offset by an increase in personnel costs and higher costs associated with OREO.  75    Table of Contents  Figure 8.

These exit portfolios were moved to Other Segments during the first quarter of 2010. Prior periods have been adjusted to conform with the current reporting of the financial information for each segment. Other Segments generated net income attributable to Key of $29 million for the second quarter of 2010, compared to net income attributable to Key of $8 million for the same period last year. These results reflect an increase in net interest income from the second quarter of 2009 as well as a decrease in the provision for loan losses. In addition, net gains from principal investing attributable to Key were $12 million during the current quarter, compared to net losses of $10 million in the year-ago quarter.  76    Table of Contents     Results of Operations     Net interest income  One of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets (such as loans and securities) and loan-related fee income, and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. There are several factors that affect net interest income, including:     ♦   the volume, pricing, mix and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities;      ♦   the volume and value of net free funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and equity capital;      ♦   the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk;      ♦   interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace; and      ♦   asset quality.    To make it easier to compare results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets (some taxable, some not), we present net interest income in this discussion on a “taxable-equivalent basis” (i.e., as if it were all taxable and at the same rate). For example, $100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as $154, an amount that — if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% — would yield $100.  Figure 9 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense, and their respective yields or rates over the past five quarters. This figure also presents a reconciliation of taxable-equivalent net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with GAAP for each of those quarters. The net interest margin, which is an indicator of the profitability of the earning assets portfolio, is calculated by dividing net interest income by average earning assets.  Taxable-equivalent net interest income for the second quarter of 2010 was $623 million, and the net interest margin was 3.17%. These results compare to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $575 million and a net interest margin of 2.70% for the second quarter of 2009. The increase in the net interest margin is primarily attributable to lower funding costs. We continue to experience an improvement in the mix of deposits by reducing the level of higher costing certificates of deposit and increasing lower costing transaction accounts. We expect this change in funding mix to continue through the second half of 2010 as certificates of deposit mature and re-price to lower current market rates. Over the past year, funding costs were also reduced by maturities of long-term debt and the 2009 exchanges of capital securities for Key common shares. We also experienced improved pricing on loan renewals.  In addition, during the second quarter of 2009, we terminated certain leveraged lease financing arrangements, which reduced net interest income by $16 million and lowered the net interest margin by approximately 7 basis points.  Compared to the first quarter of 2010, taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $9 million, and the net interest margin fell by two basis points. Although there was a benefit from the improvement in the mix of deposits, the decline in the net interest margin was largely the result of funds from loan pay downs being reinvested in lower yielding investment securities and interest rate swap maturities.  Additionally, we estimate the negative impact to the net interest margin as a result of having elevated levels of nonperforming assets to be approximately 5 to 8 basis points.  Average earning assets for the second quarter of 2010 totaled $79.1 billion, which was $6.5 billion, or 8%, lower than the second quarter of 2009. This reduction reflects a $13.9 billion decrease in loans caused by soft demand for both consumer and commercial credit due to the uncertain economic environment and the run-off in our exit portfolios and net charge-offs. The decline in loans was partially offset by increases of  77    Table of Contents  $8.9 billion in securities available for sale due to our emphasis on building liquidity and investing excess cash flows from loan repayments.  Since January 1, 2009, the size and composition of our loan portfolios have been affected by the following actions:     ♦   During the first six months of 2010, we sold $1.3 billion in total loans, excluding $487 million of education loans that relate to our discontinued operations of the education lending business. The largest portion of loans sold, $676 million, were residential real estate loans.      ♦   In the fourth quarter of 2009, we transferred loans with a fair value of $82 million from held-for-sale status to the held-to-maturity portfolio as a result of current market conditions and our related plans to restructure the terms of these loans.      ♦   In late September 2009, we transferred $193 million of loans ($248 million, net of $55 million in net charge-offs) from the held-to-maturity loan portfolio to held-for-sale status in conjunction with additional actions taken to reduce our exposure in the commercial real estate and institutional portfolios through the sale of selected assets. Most of these loans were sold during October 2009.      ♦   We sold $1.3 billion of commercial real estate loans during 2009. Since some of these loans have been sold with limited recourse (i.e., there is a risk that we will be held accountable for certain events or representations made in the sales agreements), we established and have maintained a loss reserve in an amount that we believe is appropriate. More information about the related recourse agreement is provided in Note 13 (“Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) under the heading “Recourse agreement with FNMA.”      ♦   In late September 2009, we decided to exit the government-guaranteed education lending business and have applied discontinued operations accounting to the education lending business for all periods presented in this report. We sold $474 million of education loans (included in “discontinued assets” on the balance sheet) during 2009.      ♦   In addition to the sales of commercial real estate loans discussed above, we sold other loans totaling $1.8 billion (including $1.5 billion of residential real estate loans) during 2009.    78    Table of Contents     Figure 9.

For the first six months of the year, noninterest income was $942 million, representing a decrease of $242 million, or 20%, from the first half of 2009.  As shown in Figure 11, the second quarter of 2009 included a $125 million net gain from the sale of collateralized mortgage obligations, a $95 million gain related to the exchange of common shares for capital securities, and a $32 million gain from the sale of Key’s claim associated with the Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy. Additionally, net gains on leased equipment during the second quarter of 2010 declined by $34 million from the year-ago quarter. Partially offsetting this decline in noninterest income were net gains of $25 million from loan sales, and net gains of $17 million from principal investing (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) in the second quarter of 2010, compared to net losses of $3 million and $6 million for the same period last year, as well as an increase in investment banking and capital markets income of $17 million during the second quarter of 2010.  For the year-to-date period, the decrease in noninterest income was largely attributable to a reduction of net gains from our security portfolio due to a repositioning of the portfolio in the second quarter of 2009, a reduction of net gains from leased equipment and lower income from operating leases. Also contributing to the decline was a $9 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts, and a $3 million decrease in trust and investment services income. The decreases were offset in part by a $132 million increase in net gains from principal investing, a $25 million increase in net gains from loan sales, a $9 million increase in income from investment banking and capital markets activities, and increases in income from electronic  81    Table of Contents  banking fees and insurance income. Additionally, Key recorded a $105 million gain from the sale of Visa Inc. shares during the first quarter of 2009 contributing to the decrease in noninterest income from the first six months of 2009.

Trust and investment services income. Trust and investment services are our largest source of noninterest income. The primary components of revenue generated by these services are shown in Figure 12. The second quarter of 2010 decrease of $7 million, or 6%, is attributable to lower income from brokerage commissions and fees.  Figure 12. Trust and Investment Services Income                                                                              Three months ended June 30,     Change     Six months ended June 30,     Change     dollars in millions   2010     2009     Amount     Percent     2010     2009     Amount     Percent       Brokerage commissions and fee income   $ 35     $ 45     $ (10 )     (22.2 ) %   $ 68     $ 83     $ (15 )     (18.1 ) %   Personal asset management and custody fees     37       36       1       2.8       74       69       5       7.2     Institutional asset management and custody fees     40       38       2       5.3       84       77       7       9.1         Total trust and investment services income   $ 112     $ 119     $ (7 )     (5.9 ) %   $ 226     $ 229     $ (3 )     (1.3 ) %                                                                 A significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management. At June 30, 2010, our bank, trust and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of $58.9 billion, compared to $63.4 billion at June 30, 2009. As shown in Figure 13, most of the decrease was attributable to decreases in the money market and securities lending portfolios, offset in part by market appreciation in the equity portfolio. The value of the money market portfolio declined because of general economic conditions. The decline in the securities lending portfolio was due in part to actions taken to maintain liquidity, client departures and increased volatility in the fixed income markets. When clients’ securities are lent out, the borrower must provide us with cash collateral, which is invested during the term of the loan. The difference between the revenue generated from the investment and the cost of the collateral is shared with the lending client. This business, although profitable, generates a significantly lower rate of return (commensurate with the lower level of risk) than other types of assets under management. The decrease in the value of our portfolio of hedge funds is attributable in part to our second quarter 2009 decision to wind down the operations of Austin.  82    Table of Contents  Figure 13.

Service charges on deposit accounts. The decrease in service charges on deposit accounts during the first six months of 2010 is due primarily to changing client behaviors resulting in lower transaction volume, which generated fewer overdraft fees. Additionally, because of the prevailing low interest rates and unlimited FDIC insurance, our corporate clients have been maintaining larger amounts on deposit, which has the effect of reducing their transaction service charges on their noninterest-bearing deposit accounts.     Operating lease income. Reduced originations of operating leases due to the related economics resulted in decreases of $16 million and $30 million in our second quarter of 2010 and first six months of 2010, respectively, in the Equipment Finance line of business. Accordingly, as shown in Figure 15, operating lease expense also declined.     Net gains (losses) from loan sales. We sell loans to achieve desired interest rate and credit risk profiles of the overall loan portfolio. During the first six months of 2010, we recorded $29 million of net gains from loan sales, compared to net gains of $4 million during the first half of 2009.     Net gains (losses) from principal investing. Principal investments consist of direct and indirect investments in predominantly privately-held companies. Our principal investing income is susceptible to volatility since most of it is derived from mezzanine debt and equity investments in small to medium-sized businesses. These investments are carried on the balance sheet at fair value ($950 million at June 30, 2010 compared to $1 billion at December 31, 2009, and $930 million at June 30, 2009). The net gains (losses) presented in Figure 11 derive from changes in fair values as well as sales of principal investments.     Investment banking and capital markets income (loss). As shown in Figure 14, income from investment banking and capital markets activities increased from the year-ago quarter and year-to-date periods. Dealer trading and derivatives income increased by $6 million from the year-ago quarter due largely to a $23 million decrease in the provision for losses related to customer derivatives. Additionally, other investment income increased $9 million resulting from lower negative marks in our Funds Management Group within our Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services line of business in National Banking. This increase was offset by a $2 million decrease in foreign exchange income.  83    Table of Contents  Figure 14.

For the first six months of the year, noninterest expense was $1.6 billion representing a decrease of $228 million, or 13%, from the first six months of 2009.  As shown in Figure 15, FDIC deposit insurance premiums decreased by $37 million from the second quarter of 2009 as a result of a special assessment imposed during that time period. We also recorded a credit of $10 million to the provision for losses on lending-related commitments during the second quarter of 2010, compared to a charge to the provision of $11 million in the year-ago quarter. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2009, we recognized a $16 million charge to the provision for losses on LIHTC guaranteed funds and incurred $14 million more in operating lease expense than in the current quarter. Further information regarding the LIHTC guaranteed funds is included in Note 7 (“Variable Interest Entities”), under the heading “LIHTC guaranteed funds”, and in Note 13 (“Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) under the heading “Return guarantee agreement with LIHTC investors”.  For the year-to-date period, personnel expense increased by $13 million. Excluding the intangible assets impairment charge of $196 million recorded in the first quarter of 2009, nonpersonnel expense was down $45 million, or 5%, due primarily to a $30 million decrease in the FDIC deposit insurance assessment, a $25 million decrease in operating lease expense and a $12 million credit for losses on lending-related commitments recorded during the current year, compared to a $11 million provision recorded for the first six months of 2009.  The quarterly and year-to-date decreases in total noninterest expense were moderated by increases in OREO related expenses.  84    Table of Contents  Figure 15.

The following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest expense and the factors that caused those elements to change.     Personnel. As shown in Figure 16, personnel expense, the largest category of our noninterest expense, increased by $13 million, or 2%, from the first six months of 2009. The increase was due primarily to incentive compensation accruals on improved profitability. The increases were offset in part by lower costs associated with severance and employee benefits, as compared to the same period last year. As previously reported, we amended our pension plans to freeze all benefit accruals as of December 2009. For more information related to our pension plans, see Note 11 (“Employee Benefits”).

During the first quarter of 2009, we determined that the estimated fair value of our National Banking reporting unit was less than the carrying amount. As a result, we recorded a noncash accounting charge of $223 million, $27 million of which relates to the discontinued operations of Austin. With this charge, we have written off all of the goodwill that had been assigned to our National Banking reporting unit.     Operating lease expense. The decrease in operating lease expense compared to both the quarterly and year-to-date periods is attributable to a lower volume of activity in the Equipment Finance line of business. Income related to the rental of leased equipment is presented in Figure 11 as “operating lease income.”     Professional fees. The decrease in professional fees for both the quarterly and year-to-date periods is due to increased collection efforts on loans, business services and other corporate initiatives.  85    Table of Contents     Corporate-wide efficiency initiative (Keyvolution). In late 2008, we began a corporate-wide initiative designed to build a consistently superior experience for our clients, simplify processes, improve speed to market, and enhance our ability to seize growth and profit opportunities. As of June 30, 2010, we have implemented $197 million of the targeted run-rate savings toward our goal of achieving $300 million to $375 million by the end of 2012. Over the past two years, we have been exiting certain noncore businesses, such as retail marine and education lending, and in February 2009, we completed the implementation of new teller platform technology throughout our branches. As a result of these and other efforts, over the last two years, we have reduced our workforce by 2,500 average full-time equivalent employees.     Income taxes  We recorded tax expense from continuing operations of $11 million for the second quarter 2010, compared to a tax benefit of $82 million for first quarter 2010 and $176 million for second quarter 2009. For the first six months of 2010, we recorded a tax benefit from continuing operations of $71 million, compared to a benefit of $414 million for the same period last year.  The tax benefit recorded is largely attributable to the before tax net loss resulting from continuation of an uncertain economic environment and recognition of tax credits arising from investments in low income housing projects. During the first quarter of 2009, our results from continuing operations included a $196 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets, of which $110 million is not deductible for tax purposes.  Our federal tax (benefit) expense differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate, primarily because we generate income from investments in tax-advantaged assets, such as corporate-owned life insurance, earn credits associated with investments in low-income housing projects, and make periodic adjustments to our tax reserves.  Additional information pertaining to how our tax (benefit) expense and the resulting effective tax rates were derived are included in Note 18 (“Income Taxes”) on page 117 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders.  86    Table of Contents     Financial Condition     Loans and loans held for sale  At June 30, 2010, total loans outstanding from continuing operations were $53.3 billion, compared to $58.8 billion at December 31, 2009 and $67.2 billion at June 30, 2009. Loans related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business, which are excluded from total loans at June 30, 2010, December 31, 2009, and June 30, 2009, totaled $6.6 billion, $3.5 billion, and $3.6 billion, respectively. The decrease in our loans from continuing operations over the past twelve months reflects reductions in most of our portfolios, with the largest decline experienced in the commercial portfolio. For more information on balance sheet carrying value, see Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the headings “Loans” and “Loans Held for Sale” on page 81 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders.     Commercial loan portfolio  Commercial loans outstanding decreased by $12.6 billion, or 25%, since June 30, 2009, as a result of continued soft demand for credit due to the uncertain economic conditions, accelerated paydowns on our portfolios as commercial clients continue to de-leverage, the run-off in our exit loan portfolio and elevated net charge-offs.     Commercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans represent approximately 25% of our total loan portfolio. These loans include both owner and nonowner-occupied properties and constitute approximately 36% of our commercial loan portfolio. As shown in figure 17, at June 30, 2010, our commercial real estate portfolio included mortgage loans of $10 billion and construction loans of $3.4 billion representing 19% and 6% respectively, of our total loans. Nonowner-occupied loans represent 17% of our total loans and owner-occupied loans represent 8% of our total loans. The average mortgage loan originated during the second quarter of 2010 was $2 million, and our largest mortgage loan at June 30, 2010, had a balance of $123 million. At June 30, 2010, our average construction loan commitment was $3 million. Our largest construction loan commitment was $65 million, $60 million of which was outstanding.  Our commercial real estate lending business is conducted through two primary sources: our 14-state banking franchise, and Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services, a national line of business that cultivates relationships both within and beyond the branch system. This line of business deals primarily with nonowner-occupied properties (generally properties for which at least 50% of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties) and accounted for approximately 61% of our commercial real estate loans during the second quarter of 2010, compared to 58% in the year-ago quarter. Our commercial real estate business generally focuses on larger real estate developers and owners, as shown in Figure 17, and is diversified by both industry type and geographic location of the underlying collateral. Figure 17 includes commercial mortgage and construction loans in both the Community Banking and National Banking groups.  87    Table of Contents  Figure 17.

As previously reported, we undertook a process to reduce our exposure in the residential properties segment of our construction loan portfolio through the sale of certain loans by ceasing lending to homebuilders and the transfer of a net $384 million ($719 million, net of $335 million in net charge-offs) of commercial real estate loans from the held-to-maturity portfolio to the held-for-sale portfolio in June 2008. The balance of this portfolio has been reduced to $25 million at June 30, 2010, primarily as a result of cash proceeds from loan sales, transfers to OREO, and both realized and unrealized losses. We will continue to pursue the sale or foreclosure of the remaining loans, all of which are on nonperforming status.  The secondary market for income property loans was severely constrained for the past two years and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. In prior years, we have not provided permanent financing for our clients upon the completion of their construction projects; permanent financing had been provided by the commercial mortgage-backed securities market or other lenders. With other sources of permanent commercial mortgage financing constrained, we are currently providing interim financing for certain of our relationship clients upon completion of their commercial real estate construction projects. During 2009 and the first six months of 2010, we extended the maturities, for up to five years, of certain existing loans to commercial real estate relationship clients with projects at or near completion. We applied normal customary underwriting standards to these longer-term extensions and generally received market rates of interest and additional fees, offering permanent market proxy fixed rates where appropriate, to mitigate the potential impact of rising interest rates. In cases where the terms were at less than normal market rates for similar lending arrangements, we have transferred these loans to the Asset Recovery Group for resolution. In the second quarter of 2010, there were $56 million of new restructured loans included in nonperforming loans of which $31 million related to commercial real estate.  88    Table of Contents  As shown in Figure 17, at June 30, 2010, 70% of our commercial real estate loans were for nonowner-occupied properties compared to 71% at June 30, 2009. Approximately 33% and 45% of these loans were construction loans at June 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Typically, these properties are not fully leased at the origination of the loan. The borrower relies upon additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide the cash flow necessary to support debt service payments. Uncertain economic conditions generally slow the execution of new leases and may also lead to the turnover of existing leases, driving rental rates down. As we have experienced during the first six months of 2010, we expect vacancy rates for retail, office and industrial space to remain elevated and may even further increase through 2010.  Commercial real estate fundamentals continue to deteriorate, although at a moderating pace. Through the second quarter of 2010, vacancies rose further and rents declined in office and retail properties. Vacancies are expected to peak this year, with rent levels bottoming in 2011. Net operating income should trough around the same time as rents, with the exception of the lagging office sector. The apartment sector appears to be stabilizing, with vacancies actually falling in the second quarter (after a flat reading in the first quarter of 2010) and rents growing modestly. With the labor market stalling, however, the apartment market may take a step back again before moving toward recovery. This data appears to suggest further softening in commercial real estate, with vacancies rising and rents falling over the next few months, although the pace of decline is moderating. If the upward trend in vacancies continues, any resulting effect would likely be most noticeable in the nonowner-occupied properties segment of our commercial real estate loan portfolio, particularly in the retail properties and office buildings components, which comprise 26% of our commercial real estate loans.  Commercial property values peaked in the fall of 2007, having experienced increases of approximately 30% since 2005 and 90% since 2001. The most recent Moody’s Real Estate Analytics, LLC Commercial Property Price Index shows a 41% decrease in values from its peak and a 16% decrease from the end of the second quarter of 2009 to the end of the second quarter of 2010. As of April 2010, prices were up a modest 2% over the prior month, after two consecutive months of slight declines. While prices may be reaching a bottom, a significant volume of distressed properties entering the market remains a risk and would result in further price declines. In addition, prices are likely to stall before gaining any real upward momentum, reflecting the high level of uncertainty in the market and slow growth outlook. The majority of economists, however, still believe the overall decline in values from their peak could reach approximately 50%. If the factors described above result in further weakening in the fundamentals underlying the commercial real estate market (i.e., vacancy rates, the stability of rental income and asset values), and lead to reduced cash flow to support debt service payments, our ability to collect such payments and the strength of our commercial real estate loan portfolio could be adversely affected.     Commercial lease financing. We conduct financing arrangements through our Equipment Finance line of business and have both the scale and array of products to compete in the equipment lease financing business. Commercial lease financing receivables represented 18% of commercial loans at June 30, 2010, and 17% at June 30, 2009. As previously reported, we ceased conducting business in both the commercial vehicle and office equipment leasing markets during the second half of 2009.  89    Table of Contents     Consumer loan portfolio  Consumer loans outstanding decreased by $1.3 billion, or 7%, from one year ago. As shown in Figure 34 in the “Credit risk management” section, the majority of the reduction came from our exit loan portfolio. Most of the decrease is attributable to the marine segment.  The home equity portfolio is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio. A significant amount of this portfolio (93% at June 30, 2010) is derived primarily from the Regional Banking line of business within our Community Banking group. The remainder of the portfolio, which has been in an exit mode since the fourth quarter of 2007, was originated from the Consumer Finance line of business and is now included in Other Segments. Home equity loans within the Community Banking group decreased by $475 million, or less than 5%, over the past twelve months.  Figure 18 summarizes our home equity loan portfolio by source at the end of the last five quarters, as well as certain asset quality statistics and yields on the portfolio as a whole.  Figure 18.

As previously reported, we have experienced a decrease in our consumer loan portfolio and continue to expect the portfolio to decrease in future periods as a result of our actions to exit dealer-originated home equity loans, indirect retail lending for marine and recreational vehicle products, and discontinue the education lending business. We ceased originating new education loans effective December 5, 2009 and account for this business in discontinued operations.     Loans held for sale  As shown in Note 5 (“Loans and Loans Held for Sale”), our loans held for sale increased to $699 million at June 30, 2010 from $443 million at December 31, 2009 and totaled $761 million at June 30, 2009. Loans held for sale related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business, which are excluded from total loans held for sale at June 30, 2010, December 31, 2009 and June 30, 2009, totaled $92 million, $434 million, and $148 million, respectively.  At June 30, 2010, loans held for sale included $235 million of commercial mortgages which represents a decrease of $53 million from June 30, 2009, and $81 million of residential mortgage loans which decreased $164 million from June 30, 2009.  90    Table of Contents     Loan sales  As shown in Figure 19, during the first six months of 2010, we sold $494 million of commercial real estate loans, $676 million of residential real estate loans and $94 million of commercial loans. Most of these sales came from the held-for-sale portfolio. Additionally, we sold $487 million of education loans (included in “discontinued assets” on the balance sheet), which are excluded from Figure 19. See Note 16 (“Discontinued Operations”) for additional information related to education lending.  Figure 19 summarizes our loan sales for the first six months of 2010 and all of 2009.  Figure 19.

(b)   We adopted new accounting guidance on January 1, 2010, which required us to consolidate our education loan securitization trusts and resulted in the addition of $2.6 billion of education loans at fair value which are included in “discontinued assets” on the balance sheet.   In the event of default by a borrower, we are subject to recourse with respect to approximately $707 million of the $121.4 billion of loans administered or serviced at June 30, 2010. Additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in Note 13 (“Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) under the heading “Recourse agreement with FNMA.”  91    Table of Contents  We derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold. We earn noninterest income (recorded as “other income”) from fees for servicing or administering loans. This fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets. In addition, we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing of commercial real estate loans.  92    Table of Contents     Securities  Our securities portfolio totaled $19.8 billion at June 30, 2010, compared to $16.7 billion at December 31, 2009, and $12.0 billion at June 30, 2009. At each of these dates, most of our securities consisted of securities available for sale, with the remainder consisting of held-to-maturity securities of less than $25 million.     Securities available for sale. The majority of our securities available-for-sale portfolio consists of CMOs, which are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities. CMOs generate interest income and serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements. At June 30, 2010, we had $19.6 billion invested in CMOs and other mortgage-backed securities in the available-for-sale portfolio, compared to $16.4 billion at December 31, 2009, and $10.1 billion at June 30, 2009.  As shown in Figure 21, all of our mortgage-backed securities are issued by government-sponsored enterprises or GNMA, and are traded in highly liquid secondary markets and recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. See Note 21 (“Fair Value Measurements”) under the heading “Qualitative Disclosures of Valuation Techniques” on page 128 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders.  Figure 21. Mortgage-Backed Securities by Issuer                                      June 30,     December 31,     June 30,     in millions   2010     2009     2009           FHLMC   $ 9,307     $ 7,485     $ 5,421     FNMA     5,920       4,433       2,643     GNMA     4,346       4,516       2,058         Total   $ 19,573     $ 16,434     $ 10,122                                 During the first six months of 2010, we had net gains of $380 million from CMOs and other mortgage-backed securities, all of which were unrealized. The net unrealized gains resulted from a decrease in market interest rates and were recorded in the AOCI component of shareholders’ equity. We continue to maintain a moderate asset-sensitive exposure to near-term changes in interest rates.  We periodically evaluate our securities available-for-sale portfolio in light of established A/LM objectives, changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio, and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. These evaluations may cause us to take steps to improve our overall balance sheet positioning.  In addition, the size and composition of our securities available-for-sale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required (or elect) to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits. Although we generally use debt securities for this purpose, other assets, such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit, are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles.  During the second quarter of 2010, our investing activities continue to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs. We purchased $3.8 billion in CMOs, and had maturities and cash flows of $881 million. The purchases were in CMOs issued by government-sponsored entities. We are able to either pledge these securities to the Federal Reserve or Federal Home Loan Bank for secured borrowing arrangements, sell them or use them in connection with repurchase agreements should alternate sources of liquidity be required in the future.  Figure 22 shows the composition, yields and remaining maturities of our securities available for sale.

(b)   Excludes $5 million of securities at June 30, 2010, that have no stated yield.   94    Table of Contents     Other investments  Principal investments ¾ investments in equity and mezzanine instruments made by our Principal Investing unit ¾ represented 67% of other investments at June 30, 2010. They include direct investments (investments made in a particular company) as well as indirect investments (investments made through funds that include other investors). Principal investments are predominantly made in privately held companies and are carried at fair value ($950 million at June 30, 2010, $1.0 billion at December 31, 2009, and $930 million at June 30, 2009).  In addition to principal investments, “other investments” include other equity and mezzanine instruments, such as certain real estate-related investments that are carried at fair value, as well as other types of investments that generally are carried at cost.  Most of our other investments are not traded on an active market. We determine the fair value at which these investments should be recorded based on the nature of the specific investment and all available relevant information. Among other things, our review may encompass such factors as the issuer’s past financial performance and future potential, the values of public companies in comparable businesses, the risks associated with the particular business or investment type, current market conditions, the nature and duration of resale restrictions, the issuer’s payment history, our knowledge of the industry and third party data. During the first six months of 2010, net gains from our principal investing activities (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) totaled $54 million, which includes $39 million of net unrealized gains. These net gains are recorded as “net gains (losses) from principal investing” on the income statement.     Deposits and other sources of funds  Domestic deposits are our primary source of funding. During the second quarter of 2010, these deposits averaged $63.6 billion and represented 80% of the funds we used to support loans and other earning assets, compared to $66.8 billion and 78% during the same quarter in 2009. The composition of our average deposits is shown in Figure 9 in the section entitled “Net interest income.”  The decrease in average domestic deposits compared to the second quarter of 2009 was due to a decline in certificates of deposit ( $100,000 or more) and other time deposits. This decline was offset by an increase in NOW and money market deposit accounts, and noninterest-bearing deposits. The mix of deposits continues to change as higher-costing certificates of deposit mature and reprice to current market rates and clients move their balances to transaction deposit accounts, such as NOW and money market savings accounts, or look for other alternatives for investing in the current low-rate environment.  Wholesale funds, consisting of deposits in our foreign office and short-term borrowings, averaged $3.2 billion during the second quarter of 2010, compared to $4.0 billion during the year-ago quarter. The reduction from the second quarter of 2009 resulted from a $1.3 billion decline in bank notes and other short-term borrowings, which was offset partially by a $239 million increase in foreign office deposits, and a $214 million increase in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. During the second quarter of 2010 and 2009, we reduced our reliance on wholesale funding, which was facilitated by improved liquidity for borrowers in the commercial paper market and a reduction in the demand for commercial lines of credit.  95    Table of Contents  Substantially all of our domestic deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. Accordingly, we are subject to deposit insurance premium assessments by the FDIC. On November 17, 2009, the FDIC published a final rule to announce an amended DIF restoration plan requiring depository institutions, such as KeyBank, to prepay, on December 30, 2009, their estimated quarterly risk-based assessments for the third and fourth quarters of 2009 and for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012. On that date, KeyBank paid the FDIC $539 million to cover the insurance assessments for those time periods. For the three-months ended June 30, 2010, our FDIC insurance assessment was $29 million and we had other FDIC assessments of $4 million. At the end of the second quarter of 2010, we had $442 million of prepaid FDIC insurance assessments recorded on our balance sheet.  The FDIC announced on April 13, 2010 that its Board of Directors’ approval of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Assessments. The proposed revisions to the assessment system would be applicable to large institutions with more than $10 billion in assets, such as KeyBank. According to the FDIC, the proposed revisions would better capture risk at the time an institution assumes the risk, better differentiate institutions during periods of good economic and banking conditions based on how they would fare during periods of stress or economic downturns, and would also take into account the losses that the FDIC may incur if an institution fails. The proposal was published in the Federal Register on May 3, 2010, and the comment period for the proposal expired on July 2, 2010.  96    Table of Contents     Capital  At June 30, 2010, our shareholders’ equity was $10.8 billion, up $157 million from December 31, 2009. Following are certain factors that contributed to the change in our shareholders’ equity. For other factors that contributed to the change, see the Statement of Changes in Equity.     Adoption of new accounting guidance  Effective January 1, 2010, we adopted new consolidation accounting guidance which required us to consolidate our education loan securitization trusts (classified as discontinued assets and liabilities), thereby adding $2.8 billion in assets and liabilities to our balance sheet. As a result of adopting this new guidance, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment (after-tax) of $45 million to beginning retained earnings on January 1, 2010.     Dividends  During the first six months, we made two quarterly dividend payments of $31 million to the U.S. Treasury on our Series B Preferred Stock as a participant in the U.S. Treasury’s CPP.  On March 15, 2010, and June 15, 2010, we made quarterly dividend payments of $1.9375 per share or $6 million per quarter, on our Series A Preferred Stock.  Additionally, on March 15, 2010 and June 15, 2010, we made a quarterly dividend payment of $.01 per share, or $9 million per quarter, on our Common Shares.     Common shares outstanding  Our common shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol KEY. At June 30, 2010 our book value per common share was $9.19 based on 880.5 million shares at June 30, 2010 compared to $9.04 based on 878.5 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2009, and $10.21 based on 797.2 million shares outstanding at June 30, 2009.  Figure 24 shows activities that caused the change in outstanding common shares over the past five quarters.  97    Table of Contents  Figure 24.

At June 30, 2010, we had 65.8 million treasury shares, compared to 67.8 million treasury shares at December 31, 2009 and 67.8 million at June 30, 2009. During the second quarter of 2010, we reissued treasury shares in conjunction with our employee benefit plans. Going forward we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stock-based compensation awards and for other corporate purposes.  We repurchase common shares periodically in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions under a repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors. The program does not have an expiration date, and we have outstanding Board authority to repurchase 14.0 million shares. We did not repurchase any common shares during the first six months of 2010 or 2009. Further, in accordance with the terms of our participation in the CPP, until the earlier of three years after the issuance of, or such time as the U.S. Treasury no longer holds, any Series B Preferred Stock issued by us under that program, we will not be able to repurchase any of our common shares without the approval of the U.S. Treasury, subject to certain limited exceptions (e.g., for purchases in connection with benefit plans).     Capital availability and management  As a result of market disruptions in previous periods, the availability of capital (principally to financial services companies) remains restricted. While we have been successful in raising additional capital, lower market prices per share have increased the dilution of our per common share results. We cannot predict when or if the markets will return to more favorable conditions.  We determine how capital is to be strategically allocated among our businesses to maximize returns within acceptable risk parameters and strengthen core relationship businesses. In that regard, we will continue to emphasize our client relationship strategy.     Capital adequacy  Capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance. All of our capital ratios remain strong at June 30, 2010. This, along with our improved liquidity, positions us well to weather the current credit cycle and to continue to serve our clients’ needs as well as to adjust to the application of any new regulatory capital standards due to or promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act. Our Key shareholders’ equity to assets ratio was 11.49% at June 30, 2010, compared to 11.43% at December 31, 2009 and 11.10% at June 30, 2009. Our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 7.65% at June 30, 2010, compared to 7.56% at December 31, 2009 and 7.35% at June 30, 2009.  Banking industry regulators prescribe minimum capital ratios for bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries. Risk-based capital guidelines require a minimum level of capital as a percent of “risk-weighted assets.” Risk-weighted assets consist of total assets plus certain off-balance sheet and market items, subject to adjustment for predefined credit risk factors. Currently, banks and bank holding companies must maintain, at a minimum, Tier 1 capital as a percent of risk-weighted assets of 4.00% and total capital as a percent of risk-weighted assets of 8.00%. As of June 30, 2010, our Tier 1 risk-based  98    Table of Contents  capital ratio increased 87 basis points from the fourth quarter 2009 to 13.62%, and our total risk-based capital ratio increased 85 basis points from the fourth quarter 2009 to 17.80%.  Another indicator of capital adequacy, the leverage ratio, is defined as Tier 1 capital as a percentage of average quarterly tangible assets. Leverage ratio requirements vary with the condition of the financial institution. Bank holding companies that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the Federal Reserve’s risk-adjusted measure for market risk — as we have — must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 3.00%. All other bank holding companies must maintain a minimum ratio of 4.00%. As of June 30, 2010, our leverage ratio declined by 37 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2009 to 12.09%.  The recently enacted Dodd-Frank Act will change the regulatory capital standards that apply to bank holding companies by phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities (excluding TARP CPP preferred stock issued to the United States or its agencies or instrumentalities before October 4, 2010) being Tier 1 eligible capital. This three year phase-out period which commences January 1, 2013 will ultimately result in our capital securities being treated only as Tier 2 capital. These changes in effect apply the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to depository institutions to bank holding companies, savings and loan holding companies, and nonbank financial companies identified as systemically important.  As of June 30, 2010, our Tier 1 capital ratio, leverage ratio, and total capital ratios represented 13.62%, 12.09%, and 17.80%, respectively. The trust preferred securities issued by the KeyCorp and Union State Bank capital trusts contribute $1.8 billion or 220, 195, and 220 basis points to our Tier 1 capital ratio, leverage ratio, and total capital ratio, respectively, as of June 30, 2010.  Under current regulatory capital guidelines, Federal bank regulators group FDIC-insured depository institutions into five categories, ranging from “well capitalized” to “critically undercapitalized.” A “well capitalized” institution must exceed the prescribed thresholds of 6.00% for Tier 1 capital ratio, 5.00% for the leverage ratio and 10.00% for total capital ratio. If these provisions applied to bank holding companies, we would qualify as “well capitalized” at June 30, 2010. Analysis on a pro forma basis, accounting for the phase-out of our trust preferred securities as Tier 1 eligible (and therefore as Tier 2 instead) as of June 30, 2010, also determines that we would qualify as “well capitalized” under current regulatory guidelines, with the pro forma Tier 1 capital, pro forma leverage ratio, and pro forma total capital ratio being 11.42%, 10.14%, and 17.80%, respectively. The FDIC-defined capital categories serve a limited supervisory function. Investors should not treat them as a representation of the overall financial condition of or prospects of KeyCorp or KeyBank.  Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. As a result of the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has intensified its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 capital, known as Tier 1 common equity, and its review of the consolidated capitalization of systemically important financial companies, including KeyCorp. Because the Federal Reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders’ equity (essentially Tier 1 capital less preferred stock, qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in Tier 1 capital, such a focus is consistent with existing capital adequacy guidelines and does not imply a new or ongoing capital standard. The modifications mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act are consistent with the renewed focus on Tier 1 common equity and the consolidated capitalization of banks, bank holding companies, and covered nonbank financial companies, which resulted from the financial crisis. Because Tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by GAAP nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations, this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. Figure 5 in the “Highlights of Our Performance” section reconciles Key shareholders’ equity, the GAAP performance measure, to Tier 1 common equity, the corresponding non-GAAP measure. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio was 8.07% at June 30, 2010, compared to 7.50% at December 31, 2009 and 7.36% at June 30, 2009.  99    Table of Contents  At June 30, 2010, we had a consolidated net deferred tax asset of $589 million compared to $569 million at December 31, 2009 and none at June 30, 2009. In recent years, we had been in a net deferred tax liability position. Generally, for risk-based capital purposes, deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income are limited to the lesser of: (i) the amount of deferred tax assets that a financial institution expects to realize within one year of the calendar quarter-end date, based on its projected future taxable income for the year, or (ii) 10% of the amount of an institution’s Tier 1 capital. Based on these restrictions, at June 30, 2010, $354 million of our net deferred tax assets were deducted from Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets compared to $514 million at December 31, 2009 and none at June 30, 2009. We anticipate that the amount of our net deferred tax asset disallowed for risk-based capital purposes will gradually decline in coming quarters.  Figure 25 represents the details of our regulatory capital position at June 30, 2010, December 31, 2009, and June 30, 2009.  100    Table of Contents  Figure 25.

KeyBank elected not to participate in this TAG program extension. KeyBank and many of its peers have elected not to continue in the TAG program at various times. As previously reported, we anticipate a certain amount of deposit run-off for this interim period of expiration of unlimited deposit insurance on non interest-bearing transaction accounts. We have established a liquidity buffer in anticipation and, as a result, do not expect it to have a significant effect on liquidity.  The Dodd-Frank Act makes permanent the current FDIC deposit insurance limit of $250,000, and provides for temporary unlimited FDIC deposit insurance until January 1, 2013, for non interest-bearing demand transaction accounts at all insured depository institutions effective December 31, 2010 (concurrent with the expiration date of the current TAG program extension). Accordingly, effective December 31, 2010, KeyBank will again offer non interest-bearing demand transaction accounts, with unlimited FDIC deposit insurance.  102    Table of Contents     Risk Management     Overview  Like all financial services companies, we engage in business activities and assume the related risks. The most significant risks we face are credit, liquidity, market, compliance, operational, strategic and reputation risks. We must properly and effectively identify, assess, measure, monitor, control and report such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability. Certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section.  During 2009, our management team reevaluated our ERM capabilities, and enhanced our ERM Program. Our ERM Committee, which consists of the Chief Executive Officer and his direct reports, is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite. The Program encompasses our risk philosophy, policy, framework and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company. The ERM Committee reports to the Risk Management Committee of our Board of Directors. The Board of Directors approves the ERM Program, as well as the risk appetite and corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories. We continue to enhance our ERM Program and related practices and to use a risk-adjusted capital framework to manage risks. This framework is approved and managed by the ERM Committee.  Our Board of Directors serves in an oversight capacity with the objective of managing our enterprise-wide risks in a manner that is effective, balanced and adds value for the shareholders. The Board inquires about risk practices, reviews the portfolio of risks, compares actual risks to the risk appetite and tolerances, and receives regular reports about significant risks — both actual and emerging. To assist in these efforts, the Board has delegated primary oversight responsibility for risk to the Audit Committee and Risk Management Committee.  The Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for internal audit; financial reporting; compliance risk and legal matters; the implementation, management and evaluation of operational risk and controls; information security and fraud risk; and evaluating the qualifications and independence of the independent auditors. The Audit Committee discusses policies related to risk assessment and risk management and the processes related to risk review and compliance.  The Risk Management Committee has responsibility for overseeing the management of credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk (including the actions taken to mitigate these risks), as well as reputational and strategic risks relating to the foregoing. The Risk Management Committee also oversees the maintenance of appropriate regulatory and economic capital. The Risk Management Committee reviews the ERM reports and, in conjunction with the Audit Committee, annually reviews reports of material changes to the Operational Risk Committee and Compliance Risk Committee charters, and annually approves any material changes to the charter of the ERM Committee and other subordinate risk committees.  The Audit and Risk Management Committees meet jointly, as appropriate, to discuss matters that relate to each committee’s responsibilities. In addition to regularly scheduled bi-monthly meetings, the Audit Committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases. Committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting. All members of the Board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months.  Federal banking regulators are reemphasizing with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution. We believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks, and comport with regulatory expectations.  103    Table of Contents     Market risk management  The values of some financial instruments vary not only with changes in market interest rates but also with changes in foreign exchange rates. Financial instruments also are susceptible to factors influencing valuations in the equity securities markets and other market-driven rates or prices. For example, the value of a fixed-rate bond will decline if market interest rates increase. Similarly, the value of the U.S. dollar regularly fluctuates in relation to other currencies. The holder of a financial instrument faces “market risk” when the value of the instrument is tied to such external factors. Most of our market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations.     Interest rate risk management  Interest rate risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the economic value of equity. Such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates, and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. To minimize the volatility of net interest income and the economic value of equity, we manage exposure to interest rate risk in accordance with policy limits established by the Enterprise Risk Management Committee.  Interest rate risk positions can be influenced by a number of factors other than changes in market interest rates, including economic conditions, the competitive environment within our markets, and balance sheet positioning that arises out of consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products. The primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of basis risk, gap risk, yield curve risk and option risk.                ¨    We face “basis risk” when floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities reprice at the same time, but in response to different market factors or indices. Under those circumstances, even if equal amounts of assets and liabilities are repricing, interest expense and interest income may not change by the same amount.           ¨    “Gap risk” occurs if interest-bearing liabilities and the interest-earning assets they fund (for example, deposits used to fund loans) do not mature or reprice at the same time.           ¨    “Yield curve risk” exists when short-term and long-term interest rates change by different amounts. For example, when U.S. Treasury and other term rates decline, the rates on automobile loans also will decline, but the cost of money market deposits and short-term borrowings may remain elevated.           ¨    A financial instrument presents “option risk” when one party to the instrument can take advantage of changes in interest rates without penalty. For example, when interest rates decline, borrowers may choose to prepay fixed-rate loans by refinancing at a lower rate. Such a prepayment gives us a return on our investment (the principal plus some interest), but unless there is a prepayment penalty, that return may not be as high as the return that would have been generated had payments been received over the original term of the loan. Deposits that can be withdrawn on demand also present option risk.        Net interest income simulation analysis. The primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis. For purposes of this analysis, we estimate our net interest income based on the current composition of our on- and off-balance sheet positions, the current interest rate environment and projected on- and off-balance sheet positions and interest rates. The simulation assumes that projections of our on- and off-balance sheet positions will reflect recent product trends, targets and plans established by the ALCO Committee and the lines of business, and consensus economic forecasts.  Typically, the amount of net interest income at risk is measured by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if the federal funds target rate were to gradually increase or decrease by 200 basis points over the next twelve months, and term rates were to move in a similar fashion. In light of the low interest rate environment, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, we modified the standard rate scenario of a gradual decrease of 200 basis points over twelve months to a gradual decrease of 25 basis points over two months with no change over the following ten months. After calculating the amount of net interest income at  104    Table of Contents  risk, we compare that amount with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment. The analysis also considers sensitivity to changes in a number of other variables, including other market interest rates and deposit mix. We also perform regular stress tests and sensitivities on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments. One set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of interest rate inputs on simulated exposures. Assessments are performed using different shapes in the yield curve (the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity), including a sustained flat yield curve, an inverted slope yield curve, changes in credit spreads, an immediate parallel change in market interest rates and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates. Another set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of pricing and volume projections and discretionary strategies on simulated exposures. Assessments are performed on changes to the following assumptions: the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities, changes in lending spreads, prepayments on loans and securities, other loan and deposit balance changes, investment, funding and hedging activities and liquidity and capital management strategies.  Simulation analysis produces only a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on assumptions and judgments related to balance sheet growth, customer behavior, new products, new business volume, product pricing, market interest rate behavior and anticipated investment, funding, hedging and capital management activities. We tailor the assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled, and validate those assumptions on a regular basis. Our simulations are performed with the assumption that interest rate risk positions will be actively managed through the use of on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments to achieve the desired risk profile. Actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, actual hedging strategies employed, changes in balance sheet composition, and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events.  Figure 26 presents the results of the simulation analysis at June 30, 2010 and 2009. At June 30, 2010, our simulated exposure to a change in short-term interest rates was moderately asset sensitive. ALCO policy limits for risk management call for corrective measures if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual increase or decrease in short-term interest rates over the next twelve months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 4%. As shown in Figure 26, we are operating within these limits.  Figure 26. Simulated Change in Net Interest Income                          June 30, 2010                         Basis point change assumption (short-term rates)     -25       +200     ALCO policy limits     -4.00  %     -4.00  %       Interest rate risk assessment     -1.04  %     +3.42  %                                     June 30, 2009                         Basis point change assumption (short-term rates)     -25       +200     ALCO policy limits     -4.00  %     -4.00  %       Interest rate risk assessment     -.96  %     +2.40  %             As interest rates declined throughout 2008 and have remained at low levels since that time, we have gradually shifted from a liability-sensitive position to an asset-sensitive position as a result of balance growth in transaction deposits, declines in loan balances and a number of capital-raising transactions. Although outstanding derivative hedge positions have declined over the past year due to contractual maturities, improved liquidity flows have resulted in increases of a similar magnitude in the outstanding balance of fixed rate investment securities, and this has served to moderate further increases in the asset-sensitive positioning. Our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume, mix, maturity and pricing of loan and deposit flows. As changes occur to the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy, management evaluates hedging opportunities that would change the reported interest rate risk profile.  105    Table of Contents  The results of additional simulation analyses that make use of alternative rising interest rate scenarios and yield curve shapes indicate that the improvement in net interest income when interest rates increase could be less than the policy simulation results in Figure 26. Net interest income improvements are highly dependent on the timing, magnitude and path of interest rate increases. Also, the sensitivity analysis of assumption inputs for deposit re-pricing relationships, lending spreads and the balance behavior of transaction accounts indicates that net interest income improvements in a rising rate environment could be diminished if actual behavior is different than modeled.  We also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second year of a two-year horizon. These simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a twelve-month horizon. To capture longer-term exposures, we simulate changes to the EVE as discussed in the following section.     Economic value of equity modeling.  EVE complements net interest income simulation analysis since it estimates risk exposure beyond twelve- and twenty-four month horizons. EVE measures the extent to which the economic values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates, and measuring the resulting change in the values of assets and liabilities under multiple interest rate paths. Under the current level of market interest rates, the calculation of EVE under an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest rates results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than 200 basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points. This analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities. Those assumptions are based on historical behaviors, as well as our expectations. We take corrective measures if this analysis indicates that our EVE will decrease by more than 15% in response to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates. We are operating within these guidelines.     Management of interest rate exposure.  We use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate A/LM strategies to achieve the desired risk profile within the parameters of our capital and liquidity guidelines. Specifically, we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities, issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates, and using derivatives — predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps, which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities.  Figure 27 shows all swap positions which we hold for A/LM purposes. These positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. For example, fixed-rate debt is converted to a floating rate through a “receive fixed/pay variable” interest rate swap. The volume, maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader A/LM objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our balance sheet, see Note 14 (“Derivatives and Hedging Activities”).  Figure 27. Portfolio Swaps by Interest Rate Risk Management Strategy                                                                      June 30, 2010                               Weighted-Average     June 30, 2009         Notional     Fair     Maturity     Receive     Pay     Notional     Fair     dollars in millions   Amount     Value     (Years)     Rate     Rate     Amount     Value           Receive fixed/pay variable—conventional A/LM (a)   $ 8,813     $ 44       .6       1.3  %     .4  %   $ 16,868     $ 37     Receive fixed/pay variable—conventional debt     4,722       485       15.8       5.1       .9       5,631       410     Pay fixed/receive variable—conventional debt     633       1       5.9       .8       2.5       —       —     Pay fixed/receive variable—forward starting     —       —       —       —       —       735       8     Foreign currency—conventional debt     1,383       (321 )     1.2       .9       .6       2,550       (258 )       Total portfolio swaps   $ 15,551     $ 209       5.5       2.4  %     .6  %   $ 25,784     $ 197                                                                       (a)   Portfolio swaps designated as A/LM are used to manage interest rate risk tied to both assets and liabilities.   106    Table of Contents     Derivatives not designated in hedge relationships  Our derivatives that are not designated in hedge relationships are described in Note 14. We use a VAR simulation model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of this portfolio. Using two years of historical information, the model estimates the maximum potential one-day loss with a 95% confidence level. Statistically, this means that losses will exceed VAR, on average, five out of 100 trading days, or three to four times each quarter.  We manage exposure to market risk in accordance with VAR limits for trading activity that have been approved by the Risk Capital Committee whose market risk management responsibilities are now performed by the Market Risk Committee established as part of Key’s ERM Program. At June 30, 2010, the aggregate one-day trading limit set by the committee was $6.9 million. We are operating within these constraints. During the first six months of 2010, our aggregate daily average, minimum and maximum VAR amounts were $2.0 million, $1.5 million and $2.5 million, respectively. During the same period one year ago, our aggregate daily average, minimum and maximum VAR amounts were $3.0 million, $2.6 million and $3.7 million, respectively.  In addition to comparing VAR exposure against limits on a daily basis, we monitor loss limits, use sensitivity measures and conduct stress tests. We report our market risk exposure to the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors.     Liquidity risk management  We define “liquidity” as the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences. Liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions.     Governance structure  We manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis. This approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity, as well as each entity’s capacity to manage through adverse conditions. It also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to money and capital market funding.  Oversight of the liquidity risk management process is governed by the Risk Management Committee of the KeyCorp Board of Directors, the KeyBank Board of Directors, the ERM Committee and the ALCO. These groups regularly review various liquidity reports, including liquidity and funding summaries, liquidity trends, peer comparisons, variance analyses, liquidity projections, hypothetical funding erosion stress tests and goal tracking reports. The reviews generate a discussion of positions, trends and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of the decisions that we make. Whenever liquidity pressures are elevated, we monitor and manage our position more frequently. We meet with individuals within and outside of the company on a daily basis to discuss emerging issues. In addition, we use a variety of daily liquidity reports to monitor the flow of funds.     Sources of liquidity  Our primary sources of funding include customer deposits, wholesale funding and capital. If the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances, we rely on wholesale funding or liquid assets. Conversely, excess cash generated by operating, investing and deposit-gathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets. We actively manage liquidity using a variety of nondeposit sources, including short- and long-term debt, and secured borrowings.  107    Table of Contents     Factors affecting liquidity  Our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events. Examples of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency. Examples of indirect events (events unrelated to us) that could impact our access to liquidity would be terrorism or war, natural disasters, political events, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund or hedge fund. Similarly, market speculation, or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources.     Managing liquidity risk  We regularly monitor our funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding. In the normal course of business, we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both KeyCorp and KeyBank. As we are in a “heightened monitoring mode,” we are conducting the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently, and revise assumptions so the stress tests are more strenuous and reflect the changed market environment. Erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods. Ultimately, they determine the periodic effects that major interruptions would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations. To compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures, we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed.  While the markets have achieved gradual improvement most credit markets in which we participate and rely upon as sources of funding have been significantly disrupted and highly volatile since July 2007. During the third quarter of 2009, our secured borrowings matured and were not replaced, though we retain the capacity to utilize secured borrowings as a contingent funding source. We continue to reposition our balance sheet to reduce future reliance on wholesale funding and increase our liquid asset portfolio.  We maintain a Contingency Funding Plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis. The Plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions. It also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for effectively managing liquidity through a problem period. As part of that plan, we maintain a liquidity reserve through balances in our liquid asset portfolio which during a problem period could reduce our potential reliance on market-sourced funding. The portfolio at June 30, 2010 totaled $8.7 billion. The portfolio balance consisted of $7.5 billion of unpledged securities, $1.0 billion of securities available for pledging at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and $200 million of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our Federal Reserve account. Additionally, as of June 30, 2010, our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was $11.0 billion at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and $2.8 billion at the Federal Home Loan Bank.     Long-term liquidity strategy  Our long-term liquidity strategy is to reduce our reliance on wholesale funding. Our Community Banking group supports our client-driven relationship strategy, with the objective of achieving greater reliance on deposit-based funding to reduce our liquidity risk.     Our liquidity position and recent activity  Over the past twelve months, we have increased our liquid asset portfolio, which includes overnight and short-term investments, as well as unencumbered, high quality liquid assets held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios. Liquidity stress scenarios include the loss of access to either unsecured or secured funding sources, as well as draws on unfunded commitments and significant deposit withdrawals.  From time to time, KeyCorp or its principal subsidiary, KeyBank, may seek to retire, repurchase or exchange outstanding debt, capital securities or preferred stock through cash purchase, privately negotiated transactions or other means. Such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity and capital requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.  108    Table of Contents  We generate cash flows from operations, and from investing and financing activities. During the second quarter of 2010 we used the proceeds from loan paydowns and maturities of short-term investments to increase the balance of our securities available-for-sale portfolio. During 2009 the issuance of common shares was used to fund the reduction of short-term borrowings and long-term debt and to increase the balance of our securities available-for-sale portfolio.  The consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for each of the three-month periods ended June 30, 2010 and 2009.     Liquidity for KeyCorp  The parent company has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt; support customary corporate operations and activities (including acquisitions) and occasional guarantees of subsidiary’s obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences; and pay dividends to shareholders.  Our primary tool for assessing parent company liquidity is the net short-term cash position, which measures the ability to fund debt maturing in twenty-four months or less with existing liquid assets. Another key measure of parent company liquidity is the “liquidity gap,” which represents the difference between projected liquid assets and anticipated financial obligations over specified time horizons. We generally rely upon the issuance of term debt to manage the liquidity gap within targeted ranges assigned to various time periods.  Typically, the parent company meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from KeyBank. Federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval. A national bank’s dividend-paying capacity is affected by several factors, including net profits (as defined by statute) for the two previous calendar years and for the current year, up to the date of dividend declaration. During the second quarter of 2010, KeyBank did not pay any dividends to the parent, and nonbank subsidiaries did not pay the parent any dividends. As of the close of business on June 30, 2010, KeyBank would not have been permitted to pay dividends to the parent without prior regulatory approval. To compensate for the absence of dividends, the parent company has relied upon the issuance of long-term debt and stock. During the first six months of 2010, the parent made capital infusions of $100 million to KeyBank, compared to $500 million during the first half of 2009.  The parent company generally maintains excess funds in interest-bearing deposits in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over the next twenty-four months. At June 30, 2010, the parent company held $3.3 billion in short-term investments, which we projected to be sufficient to repay our maturing debt obligations.  During the first quarter of 2009, KeyCorp issued $438 million of FDIC-guaranteed floating-rate senior notes under the TLGP, which are due April 16, 2012.     Liquidity programs  We have several liquidity programs, which are described in Note 12 (“Short-Term Borrowings”) on page 104 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which enable the parent company and KeyBank to raise funds in the public and private markets when the capital markets are functioning normally. The proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. Each of the programs is replaced or renewed as needed. There are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs.  109    Table of Contents     Liquidity and credit ratings  Our credit ratings at June 30, 2010, are shown in Figure 28. We believe that these credit ratings, under normal conditions in the capital markets, will enable the parent company or KeyBank to effect future offerings of securities that would be marketable to investors. Conditions in the credit markets are improving relative to the disruption experienced between the third quarter of 2007 and the third quarter of 2009; however, the availability of credit and the cost of funds remain tight and more costly than is typical of an economy with a growing gross domestic product.  Figure 28 reflects the credit ratings of KeyCorp securities at June 30, 2010. If our credit ratings fall below investment-grade, that event could have a material adverse effect on us. Such downgrades could adversely affect access to liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us. Ultimately, credit ratings downgrades would curtail our business operations and reduce our ability to generate income.  On April 27, 2010, Moody’s, a credit rating agency that rates KeyCorp and KeyBank debt securities, indicated that, if enacted into law, the financial reform bill then proposed by Senator Christopher Dodd could result in lower debt and deposit ratings for seventeen U.S. banks, including KeyBank, because the legislation could weaken Moody’s current assumptions regarding the systemic support provided to the largest financial institutions. Moody’s has publicly reported that KeyCorp holding company ratings do not currently benefit from any uplift as a result of a systemic support assumption by Moody’s. KeyBank long-term deposit and senior debt ratings were identified as receiving a one notch “uplift” due to systemic support.  Subsequently, on July 27, 2010, Moody’s announced that it is reviewing for possible downgrade the ratings of ten large U.S. regional banks, including KeyBank, that currently benefit from systemic support. According to Moody’s, the ratings being reviewed have benefited from an expectation of increased government support since 2009. Moody’s review will consider its government support assumptions in light of the recent passage of the Dodd-Frank Act. KeyBank long-term deposit, short-term borrowings, senior long-term debt, and subordinated long-term debt ratings were identified among the ratings under review for possible downgrade.  Figure 28.

Like other financial services institutions, we make loans, extend credit, purchase securities and enter into financial derivative contracts, all of which have related credit risk.     Credit policy, approval and evaluation. We manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program. Risk committees approve both retail and commercial credit policies. These policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit. For more information about our credit policies, as well as related approval and evaluation processes, see the section entitled “Credit policy, approval and evaluation” on page 61 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders.  We actively manage the overall loan portfolio in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives, including the use of credit derivatives — primarily credit default swaps — to mitigate credit risk. Credit default swaps enable us to transfer a portion of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit to a third party. At June 30, 2010, we used credit default swaps with a notional amount of $917 million to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending obligations. We also sell credit derivatives — primarily index credit default swaps — to diversify and manage portfolio concentration and correlation risks. At June 30, 2010, the notional amount of credit default swaps sold by us for the purpose of diversifying our credit exposure was $381 million. Occasionally, we have provided credit protection to other lenders through the sale of credit default swaps. These transactions with other lenders generated fee income.  Credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Related gains or losses, as well as the premium paid or received for credit protection, are included in the trading income component of noninterest income. These swaps decreased our operating results by $9 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2010 compared to a decrease of $23 million for the same period last year.  We also manage the loan portfolio using portfolio swaps and bulk purchases and sales. Our overarching goal is to manage the loan portfolio within a specified range of asset quality.  Selected asset quality statistics for each of the past five quarters are presented in Figure 29. The factors that drive these statistics are discussed in the remainder of this section.  Figure 29.

Watch and criticized assets. Watch assets  are troubled commercial loans with the potential to deteriorate in quality due to the client’s current financial condition and possible inability to perform in accordance with the terms of the underlying contract. Criticized assets are troubled loans and other assets that show additional signs of weakness that may lead, or have led, to an interruption in scheduled repayments from  111    Table of Contents  primary sources, potentially requiring us to rely on repayment from secondary sources, such as collateral liquidation.  Criticized assets showed significant improvement during the second quarter of 2010 from both the prior quarter and the same period one year ago.     Allowance for loan losses. At June 30, 2010, the allowance for loan losses was $2.2 billion, or 4.16% of loans, compared to $2.3 billion, or 3.48%, at June 30, 2009. The allowance includes $157 million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of $1.1 billion at June 30, 2010, compared to $393 million that was allocated for impaired loans of $1.7 billion one year ago. For more information about impaired loans, see Note 8 (“Nonperforming Assets and Past Due Loans from Continuing Operations”). At June 30, 2010, the allowance for loan losses was 130.30% of nonperforming loans, compared to 107.05% at June 30, 2009.  We estimate the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses on at least a quarterly basis. The methodology used is described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Allowance for Loan Losses” on page 82 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders. Briefly, we apply historical loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions, changes in credit policies or underwriting standards, and changes in the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets. If an impaired loan has an outstanding balance greater than $2.5 million, we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss content and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate. A specific allowance also may be assigned — even when sources of repayment appear sufficient — if we remain uncertain about whether the loan will be repaid in full. The allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2010, represents our best estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date.  As shown in Figure 30, our allowance for loan losses decreased by $120 million, or 5%, during the past twelve months. This decrease was attributable primarily to an improvement in credit quality of the loan portfolio. Our delinquency trends declined and our roll rates have improved, which we attribute to improved market liquidity during the quarter. In addition, our liability for credit losses on lending-related commitments increased by $44 million to $109 million at June 30, 2010, compared to the same period one year ago. When combined with our allowance for loan losses, our total allowance for credit losses represented 4.36% of loans at the end of the second quarter of 2010 compared to 3.58% at the end of the second quarter of 2009. We anticipate further reductions in the level of our allowance for loan losses for the balance of 2010 as a result of our expectation of lower levels of net charge-offs and nonperforming loans; however, if the economy should not continue to show signs of improvement this may change our expectation.

Our net loan charge-offs for the second quarter of 2010 exceeded the provision for loan losses by $207 million. The decrease in our provision is due to the improvement we have experienced in most of our loan portfolios. Additionally, we continue to work our exit loans through the credit cycle, and reduce exposure in the residential properties segment of our construction loan portfolio through the sale of certain loans, payments from borrowers or net charge-offs.     Net loan charge-offs. Net loan charge-offs for the second quarter of 2010 totaled $435 million, or 3.18% of average loans from continuing operations. These results compare to net charge-offs of $502 million, or 2.93%, for the same period last year. Figure 31 shows the trend in our net loan charge-offs by loan type, while the composition of loan charge-offs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in Figure 32.  Over the past twelve months, net charge-offs in the commercial loan portfolio dropped by $59 million, due primarily to commercial real estate related credits within the Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services line of business. Net charge-offs for this line of business declined by $111 million from the second quarter of 2009 and decreased $272 million from the fourth quarter 2009. Net charge-offs for this line of business included $131 million of net charge-offs recorded on two specific customer relationships during the fourth quarter of 2009. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, net loan charge-offs in the commercial loan portfolio decreased by $252 million which was attributable to declines in both the commercial, financial and agricultural, and real estate commercial mortgage and construction categories. As shown in Figure 34, our exit loan portfolio accounted for $114 million, or 26%, of total net loan charge-offs for the second quarter of 2010. We expect net charge-offs to remain elevated in 2010 but continue to show improvement in future quarters. However, should economic conditions materially weaken, we could change our outlook for net charge-offs, nonperforming loans and allowance for loan losses.  Figure 31.

These assets totaled $2.1 billion at June 30, 2010, and represented 3.88% of portfolio loans, OREO and other nonperforming assets, compared to $2.5 billion, or 4.25%, at December 31, 2009, and $2.5 billion, or 3.77%, at June 30, 2009. Nonperforming assets were down over $700 million from their peak at September 30, 2009. We experienced another decrease in the inflow of nonperforming loans during the second quarter of 2010, representing our fourth consecutive decrease and the lowest level of new inflows since the third quarter of 2008.

These concessions are made to improve the collectability of the loan and generally take the form of a reduction of the interest rate, extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance.    As shown in Figure 33, nonperforming assets decreased during the second quarter of 2010 which represents the third consecutive quarterly decline. Most of the reduction came from nonperforming loans and OREO in the commercial real estate lines of business. These reductions were offset in part by an increase in nonperforming loans held for sale which reflects the actions we are taking to reduce our exposure in the commercial real estate and institutional portfolios through the sale of selected assets. As shown in Figure 34, our exit loan portfolio accounted for $385 million, or 18%, of total nonperforming assets at June 30, 2010, compared to $499 million, or 21%, at March 31, 2010.  At June 30, 2010, the carrying amount of our commercial nonperforming loans outstanding represented 65% of their original face value, and total nonperforming loans outstanding represented 69% of their face value.  115    Table of Contents   At the same date, OREO represented 50% of its original face value, while loans held for sale and other nonperforming assets in the aggregate represented 60% of their face value.  At June 30, 2010, our 20 largest nonperforming loans totaled $441 million, representing 25% of total loans on nonperforming status.  Figure 34 shows the composition of our exit loan portfolio at June 30, 2010 and March 31, 2010, the net charge-offs recorded on this portfolio for the second and first quarters of 2010, and the nonperforming status of these loans at June 30, 2010 and March 31, 2010. The exit loan portfolio represented 12% of total loans and loans held for sale at June 30, 2010.  Figure 34.

The types of activity that caused the change in our nonperforming loans during each of the last five quarters are summarized in Figure 36. As shown in this figure, nonperforming loans experienced another quarterly decrease as loans placed on nonaccrual decreased for the fourth consecutive quarter and loans sold and payments received on nonperforming loans increased in the second quarter of 2010 as compared to the first quarter of 2010 and the second quarter of 2009, as market liquidity improved.

Operational risk also encompasses compliance (legal) risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules and regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards. Due to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, large financial companies like Key will be subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation due to their systemic importance. This heightened level of regulation will increase our operational risk. We have created and continue to create work teams to respond to and analyze the new regulatory requirements imposed upon us and that will be promulgated as a result of the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. Resulting losses could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation or forgone opportunities. We seek to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls.  We continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with laws, rules and regulations, and to improve the oversight of our operational risk. For example, a loss-event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational losses. This tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action. We also rely upon software programs designed to assist in monitoring our control processes. This technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the Board of Directors.  Primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business. Our Risk Review function periodically assesses the overall effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Risk Review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the Audit Committee, and independently supports the Audit Committee’s oversight of these controls. The Operational Risk Committee, a senior management committee, oversees our level of operational risk, and directs and supports our operational infrastructure and related activities.  118    Table of Contents     Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk  The information presented in the “Market risk management” section of the Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition & Results of Operations, is incorporated herein by reference.     Item 4. Controls and Procedures  As of the end of the period covered by this report, KeyCorp carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of KeyCorp’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of KeyCorp’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, KeyCorp’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, as of the end of the period covered by this report, in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. No changes were made to KeyCorp’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, KeyCorp’s internal control over financial reporting.     PART II. OTHER INFORMATION     Item 1. Legal Proceedings  The information presented in the Legal Proceedings section of Note 13 (“Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is incorporated herein by reference.     Item 1A. Risk Factors  An investment in our Common Shares, debt, or other securities is subject to risks inherent to our business and our industry. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below relating to recent developments and the risk factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2010, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. Although we have significant risk management policies, procedures and practices aimed at mitigating uncertainties, these risks may nevertheless impair our business operations. These risks are not the only ones that we face. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.  IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS (OR THOSE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE AS INDICATED ABOVE) ACTUALLY OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND/OR ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY AND/OR CREDIT COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED (“MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US”). IF THIS WERE TO HAPPEN, THE VALUE OF OUR SECURITIES — COMMON SHARES, SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK, TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES, AND OUR DEBT SECURITIES — COULD DECLINE, PERHAPS SIGNIFICANTLY, AND YOU COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT.  RISKS RELATED TO RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  The Federal Reserve and European Union monetary policy leaders appear to be bracing the global economy and financial markets for a transition of fiscal policy efforts from fiscal stimulus aimed at shortening the economic crisis to fiscal consolidation with the goal of long-term fiscal sustainability. Monetary leaders in the U.S. and the European Union are advocating for and implementing reductions in budget deficits and austerity measures in some countries. This eventual transition of fiscal policy in various developed nations, including the U.S., may cause the global economic recovery to be prolonged and may also hinder the return to an expansionary economy in the U.S.  119    Table of Contents  Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke and various governments in Europe have acknowledged the need to commence a shift from fiscal stimulus efforts to fiscal consolidation to reduce government deficits. A global coordinated shift from fiscal stimulus to fiscal consolidation could hinder the return of a robust global economy and cause instability in the financial markets. Various governments in Europe have announced budget reductions and/or austerity measures as a means to limit fiscal budget deficits due to reduced tax revenues experienced by governments globally as a result of the economic crisis. Chairman Bernanke has testified before Congress about the need for U.S. budget deficits to be reduced; and the outlook that the economic recovery in the U.S. is likely to be slow and painful for many Americans. A prolonged U.S. economic recovery could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.  The failure of the European Union to stabilize its weaker member economies, such as Greece, Portugal, Spain, Hungary and even Italy, could have international implications affecting the stability of global financial markets and hindering the U.S. economic recovery.  On the eve of May 10, 2010, Greece was facing imminent default on its obligations. On May 10, 2010, finance ministers from the European Union announced a deal to provide $560 billion in new loans and $76 billion under an existing lending program to countries facing instability. The International Monetary Fund joined forces and announced that it was prepared to give $321 billion separately. The European Central Bank also announced that it would buy government and corporate debt, and the world’s leading central banks, including the Federal Reserve, Bank of Canada, Bank of England, Bank of Japan, and Swiss National Bank, announced a joint intervention to make more dollars available for interbank lending. Should these monetary policy measures be insufficient to restore stability to the financial markets, the recovery of the U.S. economy could be hindered or reversed, which could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”), subjects us to a variety of new and more stringent legal and regulatory requirements. Because the Dodd-Frank Act imposes more stringent regulatory requirements on the largest financial institutions, Key could be competitively disadvantaged.  On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act, a sweeping financial regulatory reform bill, into law. The Dodd-Frank Act is intended to address perceived deficiencies and gaps in the regulatory framework for financial services in the United States, reduce the risks of bank failures and better equip the nation’s regulators to guard against or mitigate any future financial crises. The Dodd-Frank Act implements far-reaching changes across the financial landscape, including the following provisions:     ¨    establish a new interagency council to identify and manage systemic risk in the financial system;      ¨    subject systemically important financial companies (including nonbank financial companies) and activities to heightened prudential standards and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”);      ¨    establish a new resolution procedure for large financial companies (but not their bank subsidiaries) to mitigate the moral hazard and market disruption concerns associated with the liquidation of large, systemically important financial companies;      ¨    centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency responsible for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws, a number of which will be strengthened;      ¨    requires that any interchange transaction fee charged for a debit transaction be “reasonable and proportional” to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction and directs the Federal Reserve to prescribe regulations to establish standards, as well as eliminates exclusive arrangements between issuers and networks for electronic debit transactions and limits restrictions on merchant discounting and minimum or maximum dollar amount thresholds as a condition for acceptance of credit cards and eliminates and exclusivity arrangement;    120    Table of Contents    ¨    apply the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies, savings and loan holding companies and systemically important nonbank financial companies, which, among other things, will exclude, on a phase-out basis, all trust preferred and cumulative preferred securities from Tier 1 capital;      ¨    change the assessment base for federal deposit insurance premiums from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital, eliminate the ceiling on the size of the Deposit Insurance Fund, and increase the reserve ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund, which will require an increase in the level of assessments;      ¨    impose new regulatory requirements and restrictions on federally insured depository institutions, their holding companies and other affiliates, as well as other systemically important nonbank financial companies, including (for depository institutions, non-U.S. banks and their affiliates) the “Volcker Rule” (as the media often refers to it) ban on proprietary trading and sponsorship of, and investment in, hedge funds and private equity funds;      ¨    impose comprehensive regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market, including the so-called “Lincoln push-out provision” that effectively prohibits insured depository institutions from conducting certain derivatives businesses in the institution itself;      ¨    limit the Federal Reserve’s emergency authority to lend to nondepository institutions to programs and facilities with broad-based eligibility and authorize the FDIC to establish an emergency financial stabilization fund for solvent depository institutions and their holding companies, subject to the approval of Congress, the Secretary of the United States Department of the Treasury (the “U.S. Treasury”) and the Federal Reserve;      ¨    require persons offering asset-backed securities to retain some of the risk associated with the offered securities;      ¨    implement corporate governance revisions, including with regard to executive compensation and proxy access, that apply to all public companies, not just financial institutions;      ¨    eliminate the private adviser exemption from registration, thereby requiring advisers to hedge funds and private equity funds to register with the SEC, while providing a new exemption from registration for advisers to venture capital funds, and for private funds with assets under management of less than $150 million (although each of these classes of exempt advisers must provide such reports to the SEC as the SEC may by rule require);      ¨    reform the regulation of credit rating agencies, including the imposition of new liability standards;      ¨    establish a Federal Insurance Office within the Treasury Department and reform the regulation of the nonadmitted property and casualty insurance market and the reinsurance market;      ¨    make permanent the $250,000 limit for FDIC deposit insurance and increase the cash limit of Securities Investor Protection Corporation protection from $100,000 to $250,000, and provide unlimited federal deposit insurance until January 1, 2013, for non-interest bearing demand transaction accounts at all insured depository institutions (effective December 31, 2010), and for credit unions (effective immediately); and      ¨    repeal the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts.    The Dodd-Frank Act defers many of the details of its mandated reforms to future rulemakings by a variety of federal regulatory agencies. While we cannot predict the effect of these various rulemakings which have yet to be issued, we do anticipate a variety of new and more stringent legal and regulatory requirements. Regulatory reform will likely place additional costs on larger financial institutions, may impede growth  121    Table of Contents  opportunities, and may place larger financial institutions at a competitive disadvantage in the market place. Additionally, reform could affect the behaviors of third parties that we deal with in the course of our business, such as rating agencies, insurance companies, and investors. Heightened regulatory practices, requirements or expectations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules promulgated thereunder could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, and, in turn, could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us. For further detail on the Dodd-Frank Act, see the House-Senate conference report (House Report 111-517), as published in the Congressional Record of June 29, 2010.  The Dodd-Frank Act provides for the phase-out beginning January 1, 2013, of trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred securities as Tier 1 eligible capital for purposes of the regulatory capital guidelines for bank holding companies.  Currently, our trust preferred and enhanced trust preferred securities represent 14% of our Tier 1 capital or $1.8 billion of our $10.8 billion of Tier 1 capital. By comparison, the U.S. Treasury’s TARP investment, non-cumulative perpetual preferred securities, and our common equity represent 23%, 3% and 58%, respectively, of our Tier 1 capital, as of June 30, 2010. The anticipated phase-out (as Tier 1 eligible) of our trust preferred securities and enhanced trust preferred securities will eventually result in us having less of a capital buffer above the well-capitalized regulatory standard of 6% of Tier 1 capital. Accordingly, we may eventually determine or our regulators could require us, in connection with our redemption of TARP or otherwise, to raise additional Tier 1 capital through the issuance of additional preferred stock or common equity. Should such issuances occur, they would likely result in dilution to our shareholders. Currently, we expect to have sufficient access to the capital markets to be able to raise any necessary replacement capital. Nevertheless, should market conditions experienced during the fall of 2008 return, our ability to raise capital may be diminished significantly, which could, in turn, have a Material Adverse Effect on Us. Approximately $140 billion of trust preferred securities issued by U.S. financial institutions that are currently Tier 1 eligible will be affected by the Dodd-Frank Act phase-out of trust preferred securities as Tier 1 eligible. Many other institutions are faced with this same issue, and the number of institutions affected could have implications on investor demand for our securities. Furthermore, the Dodd-Frank Act and related or other rulemaking may result in new regulatory capital standards for institutions to be recognized as well-capitalized. These factors could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.  Our credit ratings could be adversely affected by the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits the Federal Reserve from providing support to specific financial companies that is not based upon programs with broad eligibility and implements resolution procedures for large, systemically important financial companies.  On April 27, 2010, Moody’s, a credit rating agency that rates KeyCorp and KeyBank debt securities, indicated that, if enacted into law, certain provisions of reform proposed at the time by Senator Christopher Dodd could result in lower debt and deposit ratings for seventeen U.S. banks, including KeyBank, because the legislation could weaken Moody’s current assumptions regarding the probability that the U.S. government would support the largest, most systemically important financial institutions, and it could possibly enhance the ability of regulators to unwind large, interconnected financial institutions. The regulatory reform achieved through the Dodd-Frank Act set forth certain limitations on bank activities that may weaken the earnings power of some banks, and reduce the probability that the U.S. government would support the largest, most systemically important financial companies, as the Dodd-Frank Act limits the Federal Reserve’s emergency authority to lend to non-depository institutions to programs and facilities with broad-based eligibility and authorizes the FDIC to establish an emergency financial stabilization fund for solvent depository institutions and their holding companies, subject to the approval of Congress, the U.S. Treasury Secretary and the Federal Reserve, as well as establishes a new resolution procedure for large financial companies (but not their bank subsidiaries) to mitigate the moral hazard and market disruption concerns associated with the liquidation of large, systemically important financial companies.  Moody’s has publicly reported that KeyCorp holding company (parent) ratings do not currently benefit from any “uplift” as a result of a systemic support assumption by Moody’s. KeyBank’s long-term deposit and senior debt ratings were identified in April 2010 as receiving a one notch “uplift” due to Moody’s  122    Table of Contents  assumption about systemic support. Subsequently, on July 27, 2010, Moody’s announced that it is reviewing for possible downgrade the ratings of ten large U.S. regional banks, including KeyBank, that currently benefit from systemic support. According to Moody’s, the ratings being reviewed have benefited from an expectation of increased government support since 2009. KeyBank’s long-term deposit, short-term borrowings, senior long-term debt, and subordinated long-term debt ratings were identified among the ratings under review for possible downgrade. Accordingly, should the Dodd-Frank Act affect the assumptions of the credit rating agencies, KeyBank’s credit ratings could be negatively affected and, in turn, KeyBank’s liquidity, which could have a Material Adverse Affect on Us.  An offering of a significant amount of additional Common Shares or equity convertible into our Common Shares could cause us to issue a significant amount of Common Shares to a private investor or group of private investors and thus have a significant investor with voting rights.  Any issuance or issuances totaling a significant amount of our Common Shares or equity convertible into our Common Shares could cause us to issue a significant amount of Common Shares to a private investor or group of investors and thus have a significant investor with voting rights. Having a significant shareholder may make some future transactions more difficult or perhaps impossible to complete without the support of such shareholder. The interests of the significant shareholder may not coincide with our interests or the interests of other shareholders. There can be no assurance that any significant shareholder will exercise its influence in our best interests as opposed to its best interests as a significant shareholder. Accordingly, a significant shareholder may make it difficult to approve certain transactions even if they are supported by the other shareholders. These factors could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.     Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
