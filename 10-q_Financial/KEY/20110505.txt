Strategic developments  We initiated the following actions during the first three months of 2011 to support our corporate strategy described in the “Introduction” section under the “Corporate Strategy” heading on page 30 of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.     ¨   We completed the repurchase of the Series B Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury as part of the TARP CPP. We paid approximately $2.5 billion to the U.S. Treasury to repurchase the Series B Preferred Stock. Additionally, we notified the U. S. Treasury of our intent to repurchase the warrant to purchase 35,244,361 of Common Shares issued in conjunction with the U. S. Treasury’s TARP CPP investment and on April 20, 2011 repurchased the warrant for $70 million.      ¨   We completed a $625 million underwritten public offering of 70,621,470 of our Common Shares at a price of $8.85 per share. We also completed a public offering of $1 billion 5.1% Senior Medium-Term Notes, Series I.      ¨   As of March 31, 2011, we have achieved $317 million of the targeted annual run-rate savings toward our goal of achieving $300 million to $375 million by the end of 2012. These savings are part of a corporate-wide initiative named Keyvolution, which is focused on business simplification, process improvement and demand management. From the fourth quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of 2011, we have reduced personnel costs by $205 million and nonpersonnel expenses by $112 million.      ¨   Our asset quality metrics continued to improve during the first quarter of 2011 as a result of our proactive efforts to address credit quality issues. Nonperforming loans have decreased $183 million and nonperforming assets have decreased $249 million from December 31, 2010. Additionally, net loan charge-offs declined to $193 million. Net loan charge-offs have declined for the fifth consecutive quarter.      ¨   Our balance sheet continues to reflect strong capital with a Tier 1 common equity ratio of 10.74%, loan loss reserves at 2.83% to period-end loans and is core funded with a loan to deposit ratio of 91%.     61    Table of Contents      Economic overview  During the first quarter of 2011, the economic recovery continued despite a challenging international environment. Positive gains in employment and consumer spending and continued strength in corporate profits were at times overshadowed by the potential negative economic impacts related to the turmoil in North Africa and the Middle East, the natural disaster in Japan and fiscal challenges of certain European countries. Job creation in the U.S. gained momentum as employers added 478,000 jobs in the first quarter of 2011, compared to the 940,000 jobs created in all of 2010. The average unemployment rate for the quarter fell to 8.9%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2010 average of 9.6% and the recent peak of 10.1% in October of 2009. The ten-year average of the unemployment rate as of March 2011 was 6.2%.  Even as U.S. consumers continued to be constrained by elevated levels of unemployment, consumer spending continued to increase at a faster pace during the first quarter of 2011. The average monthly rate of consumer spending increased .7% for the first quarter of 2011 compared to an average monthly increase of .5% in the fourth quarter of 2010 and .3% for all of 2010. As the quarter progressed, consumer strength was tested as rising gasoline prices threatened to reduce discretionary spending. In aggregate, consumer prices increased 2.7% for the twelve months ending March 2011, compared to a 1.5% annual increase through December 2010. Energy costs were the largest contributor to the recent increase, as the price of oil rose from just over $91 per barrel at December 31, 2010, to over $106 per barrel at March 31, 2011. The national average price for a gallon of unleaded gasoline in the U.S. rose 18% over the same period.  Continued weakening in the housing market further weighed on consumer wealth and confidence in the first quarter of 2011. March new home sales were down 22% and existing home sales were down 6% from the respective sales levels reported for the same month last year, while the median price of new and existing homes fell by 5% and 6% respectively over the same period. While remaining at elevated levels, the number of U.S. home foreclosures fell 35% in March from a year earlier. Home builders continued to show reluctance to renew building activity as housing starts at the end of the quarter fell 13% from March 2010.  The Federal Reserve held the federal funds target rate near zero in the first quarter of 2011. Additionally, the Federal Reserve maintained its stance that the current economic conditions warrant keeping the rate at an exceptionally low level for an extended period. During the first quarter of 2011, the Federal Reserve also continued to expand its holdings of U.S. Treasury securities as originally announced in November 2010. These purchases are expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter of 2011. Benchmark term interest rates rose during the quarter as the economic recovery gained momentum. However, investors sought the safety of U.S. Treasury securities in a time of heightened fears related to crises in the Middle East, North Africa and Japan. As a result, U.S. Treasury yields traded in a wide range over the quarter. The benchmark two-year U.S. Treasury yield, which began the quarter at .60% at December 31, 2010, declined to .55% twice during the quarter before ending the quarter near its highs at .83%. The ten-year U.S. Treasury yield, which began the first quarter of 2011 at 3.30%, hit a low of 3.17% and a high of 3.74%, before closing the first quarter of 2011 at 3.47%. As credit concerns continued to ease, credit spreads for banks’ and financial firms’ debt obligations continued to narrow.     Supervision and Regulation     Regulatory Reform Developments  On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act into law. This Act is intended to address perceived deficiencies and gaps in the regulatory framework for financial services in the United States, reduce the risks of bank failures and better equip the nation’s regulators to guard against or mitigate any future financial crises, and manage systemic risk through increased supervision of systemically important financial companies (including nonbank financial companies). The Dodd-Frank Act implements numerous and far-reaching changes across the financial landscape affecting financial companies, including banks and bank holding companies such as Key. For a review of the various measures being taken as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, we refer to the risk-factor on page 12 in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Many of the rulemakings required by the various regulatory agencies are still in the process of being developed and/or implemented.     Interchange Fees  Beginning on page 32 of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we provided a discussion of the Federal Reserve’s proposed rules governing interchange fees and their potential for impact on our revenue. Once the regulations are finalized, we will assess the impact on the revenue stream, which could be significant to the revenue that we derive from these activities. Implementation is expected by July 21, 2011, based upon the timeline prescribed under the Dodd-Frank Act. We refer you to the discussion of “Interchange Fees” on page 32 of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.   62    Table of Contents      Regulation E pursuant to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978  For a discussion of final rules regarding Regulation E relating to the charging of overdraft fees and the estimated impact on our revenue, we refer you to the discussion of “Regulation E pursuant to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978” on page 32 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our first quarter of 2011 deposit service charge income reflects the full estimated impact to Key of the change in Regulation E. Compared to the same period last year, deposit service charge income is down $8 million or 10.5%.     Joint Proposed Rule on Incentive Compensation  On April 14, 2011, seven U.S. federal financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the Federal Office of Thrift Supervision, the National Credit Union Administration, the SEC and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, proposed a joint rule to implement the Dodd-Frank Act requirement that these agencies prohibit, at any financial institution with consolidated assets of at least $1 billion, incentive pay that they determine encourages inappropriate risks. Comments on the proposed joint rule are due by May 31, 2011.     SCAP  In November 2010, the Federal Reserve issued Revised Temporary Addendum to Supervisory Letter SR 09-4. This letter outlines specific criteria the Federal Reserve will consider when evaluating proposed capital actions by the 19 largest U.S. banking institutions that participated in the SCAP, including KeyCorp (“SCAP BHCs”). These include actions such as increasing dividends, implementing common stock repurchase programs, or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments more broadly. The Federal Reserve is required to assess the capital adequacy of SCAP BHCs based upon a review of each SCAP BHC’s comprehensive capital plan, which we submitted to the Federal Reserve on January 7, 2011. On March 18, 2011, the Federal Reserve informed us that it had no objections to the capital actions set forth in our Comprehensive Capital Plan. For a discussion of our capital actions, see the “Capital” section.     Demographics  We have two major business segments: Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank.  Key Community Bank serves consumers and small to mid-sized businesses by offering a variety of deposit, investment, lending and wealth management products and services. These products and services are provided through a 14-state branch network organized into three internally defined geographic regions: Rocky Mountains and Northwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast. The effect on our business due to continued volatility and weakness in the housing market varies with the state of the economy in the regions in which these business segments operate.  Commercial and industrial loan growth in our middle-market portfolio is improving. We are particularly encouraged as we experienced commercial loan growth during the first quarter of 2011 in the Great Lakes region. However, these improvements were offset by a decline in the Northeast region. While we are encouraged by increasing pipelines, growth was flat in the Rocky Mountains and Northwest region. New commitments are up and we expect businesses to begin to draw on their available cash and credit facilities to fund inventory and receivables and make investments in their production capabilities that have been postponed over the past several years.  Figure 2 shows the geographic diversity of Key Community Bank’s average deposits, commercial loans and home equity loans.   63    Table of Contents   Figure 2.

Key Corporate Bank includes three lines of business that operate nationally, within and beyond our 14-state branch network, as well as internationally.  The Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services business consists of two business units. Real Estate Capital provides lending, debt placements, servicing, and equity and investment banking services to developers, brokers and owner investors dealing primarily with nonowner-occupied properties. Corporate Banking Services provides a full array of commercial banking products and cash management services.  Equipment Finance meets the equipment leasing needs of companies worldwide and provides equipment manufacturers, distributors and resellers with funding options for their clients.  The Institutional and Capital Markets business consists of two business units. KeyBanc Capital Markets provides commercial lending, treasury management, investment banking, derivatives, foreign exchange, equity and debt underwriting and trading, and syndicated finance products and services to large corporations and middle-market companies. Victory Capital Management manages or offers advice regarding investment portfolios for a national client base.  Additional information regarding the products and services offered by our Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank segments are described further in this report in Note 16 (“Line of Business”).  Since the beginning of the financial crisis, results for Key Corporate Bank have been adversely affected by increasing credit costs and volatility in the capital markets. During the first three months of 2011 credit losses in Key Corporate Bank declined and the overall recovery in the equity markets led to growth in the market values of assets under management, and stability in the market value of other assets (primarily commercial real estate loans and securities held for sale or trading).  We saw market liquidity continue to strengthen during the first three months of 2011. We used this as an opportunity to continue to sell certain of our nonperforming assets. We were encouraged by the fact that we were able to sell these assets at prices that were above their carrying value as recorded on our books.  Figure 21, which appears later in this report in the “Loans and loans held for sale” section, shows the diversity of our commercial real estate lending business based on industry type and location. As previously reported, we have ceased all new lending to homebuilders and, since December 31, 2007, we have reduced outstanding balances in the residential properties portion of the commercial real estate loan portfolio by $3.1 billion, or 88%, to $425 million. Additional information about loan sales is included in the “Credit risk management” section.     Critical accounting policies and estimates  Our business is dynamic and complex. Consequently, we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies. These choices are critical: not only are they necessary to comply with GAAP, they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance. All accounting policies are important, and all policies described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) on page 99 of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance.  In our opinion, some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility. These policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance,   64    Table of Contents   or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. Because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances, they may prove to be inaccurate, or we may find it necessary to change them.  We rely heavily on the use of judgment, assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions, including accounting for the allowance for loan and lease losses; contingent liabilities, guarantees and income taxes; derivatives and related hedging activities; and assets and liabilities that involve valuation methodologies. In addition, we may employ outside valuation experts to assist us in determining fair values of certain assets and liabilities. A brief discussion of each of these areas appears on pages 34 through 37 of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  At March 31, 2011, $23.3 billion, or 25%, of our total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Approximately 96% of these assets, before netting adjustments, were classified as Level 1 or Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. At March 31, 2011, $2.6 billion, or 3%, of our total liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Substantially all of these liabilities were classified as Level 1 or Level 2.  At March 31, 2011, $183 million, or .2%, of our total assets were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Approximately 10% of these assets were classified as Level 1 or Level 2. At March 31, 2011, there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  In addition, the education lending securitization trusts assets and liabilities were included on the balance sheet at March 31, 2011 at fair value, in the amount of $3.1 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, as a result of the consolidation on January 1, 2010.  During the first three months of 2011, we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates.     Highlights of Our Performance  Financial performance  For the first quarter of 2011, we announced net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $184 million, or $.21 per common share. These results were after the accelerated amortization of the discount on the repurchased preferred shares from the U.S. Treasury (“deemed dividend”) of $49 million, or $.06 per diluted common share, during the first quarter of 2011. Our first quarter 2011 results compare to a net loss from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $98 million, or $.11 per common share, for the first quarter of 2010. The first quarter 2011 results reflect an improvement in noninterest expense and lower credit costs from the same period one-year ago. First quarter 2011 net income attributable to Key common shareholders was $173 million compared to a net loss attributable to Key common shareholders of $96 million for the same quarter one year ago.  During the first quarter of 2011, we continued to benefit from improved asset quality in both Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. Nonperforming assets declined $1.3 billion, and nonperforming loans decreased by $1.2 billion from the year-ago quarter to $1.1 billion and $885 million, respectively. Net charge-offs declined $329 million from the first quarter of 2010 to $193 million, or 1.59%, of average loan balances for the first quarter of 2011. Our favorable credit quality trends have benefited from the ongoing modest economic recovery and the early aggressive actions that we began over four years ago to exit higher risk lending activities. We have experienced continued improvement in all of our asset quality statistics. Over the past five quarters net charge-offs have declined 63%, nonperforming assets are down 55% to 2.23% of total loans, OREO and other nonperforming assets and our coverage ratio of reserves to nonperforming loans has increased to 155% as of March 31, 2011.  The net interest margin was 3.25% for the first quarter of 2011. This was a decrease of 6 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2010 and an increase of 6 basis points from the year-ago quarter. The increase in the net interest margin from the year ago quarter primarily reflects our efforts to lower funding costs by reducing the level of higher costing certificates of deposit and growing lower costing transaction accounts. This benefit to the net interest margin was offset by a lower level of average earning assets and a change in asset mix as loans paid down which resulted in a lower level of net interest income. We expect net interest income and the net interest margin to decline in the second quarter of 2011 as a result of an approximately $3 billion decline in average earning assets and a change in the funding mix resulting from the repayment of the $2.5 billion of TARP CPP preferred securities and the movement of $1.5 billion of escrow deposits during March 2011. Until we see a more significant increase in lending activities we expect the net interest margin to be in the range of 3.15% to 3.25% for the remainder of 2011.   65    Table of Contents   Our capital ratios remain strong. Our tangible common equity and Tier 1 common equity at March 31, 2011, are 9.16% and 10.74%, respectively, compared to 7.37% and 7.51%, respectively, at March 31, 2010. During the first quarter of 2011, we completed the repurchase of the $2.5 billion of Series B Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury Department as a result of Key’s participation in the TARP CPP. The transaction followed our successful completion of a $625 million common equity offering and a $1 billion debt offering. The Board of Directors is expected to consider a dividend increase in the second quarter of 2011.  As a result of the repurchase of the U.S. Treasury’s preferred stock investment, we recorded a $49 million one-time deemed dividend related to the remaining difference between the repurchase price and the carrying value of the preferred shares at the time of repurchase. Beginning with the second quarter of 2011, the repurchase will result in the elimination of $31 million in dividends and $4 million of discount amortization, or $140 million on an annual basis, related to these preferred shares. On April 20, 2011, we repurchased the warrant directly from the U.S. Treasury for $70 million.  We expect to build 40 new branches in 2011, having opened eight new branches in the first quarter of 2011 and 77 others in the prior two calendar years. Our multi-year branch building and renovation project has resulted in approximately one-third of Key’s 1,040 branches in its 14 state-branch network either being newly constructed or remodeled over the past four years. In addition, Key originated approximately $6.9 billion in new or renewed lending commitments to consumers and businesses during the first quarter, which is up from $5.3 billion from the same period one year ago. Most of this increase was the result of new commitments extended to clients in March 2011.  We continue to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our organization. Our concerted efforts to improve Key’s efficiency and effectiveness under Keyvolution have resulted in approximately $317 million in annualized cost savings through the first quarter of 2011.  Figure 3 shows our continuing and discontinued operating results for the current, past and year-ago quarters. Our financial performance for each of the past five quarters is summarized in Figure 4.

In April 2009, we decided to wind down the operations of Austin, a subsidiary that specialized in managing hedge fund investments for institutional customers. As a result of these decisions, we have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations. The loss from discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2011, was primarily attributable to fair value adjustments related to the education lending securitization trusts.

to discontinue the education lending business conducted through Key Education Resources, the education payment and financing unit of KeyBank. In April 2009, we decided to wind down the operations of Austin, a subsidiary that specialized in managing hedge fund investments for institutional customers.     (b)   See Figure 5, which reconciles certain GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures.   Figure 5 presents certain financial measures related to “tangible common equity” and “Tier 1 common equity.” The tangible common equity ratio has been a focus for some investors. We believe this ratio may assist investors in analyzing our capital   67    Table of Contents   position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. Since the commencement of the SCAP in early 2009, the Federal Reserve has focused its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 risk-based capital known as Tier 1 common equity. Because the Federal Reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders’ equity (essentially Tier 1 risk-based capital less preferred stock, qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in Tier 1 risk-based capital, this focus on Tier 1 common equity is consistent with existing capital adequacy categories. This increased focus on Tier 1 common equity is also present in the Basel Committee’s Basel III guidelines, which U.S. regulators are expected to adopt pursuant to regulations expected to be issued in the second half of 2011. The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act also changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to bank holding companies by requiring regulators to create rules phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities Tier 1 eligible capital. This three year phase-out period, which commences January 1, 2013, will ultimately result in our capital securities being treated only as Tier 2 capital.  Tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by GAAP nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations; this measure is considered to be a nonGAAP financial measure. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity and Tier 1 common equity, we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases. Figure 5 also reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding nonGAAP measures.  The table also shows the computation for pre-provision net revenue, which is not formally defined by GAAP. Management believes that eliminating the effects of the provision for loan and lease losses makes it easier to analyze our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis.  NonGAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these nonGAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.   68    Table of Contents   Figure 5.

Results of Operations     Net interest income  One of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets (such as loans and securities) and loan-related fee income, and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. There are several factors that affect net interest income, including:     ¨   the volume, pricing, mix and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities;      ¨   the volume and value of net free funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and equity capital;      ¨   the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk;      ¨   interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace; and      ¨   asset quality.    To make it easier to compare results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets (some taxable, some not), we present net interest income in this discussion on a “taxable-equivalent basis” (i.e., as if it were all taxable and at the same rate). For example, $100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as $154, an amount that — if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% — would yield $100.   69    Table of Contents   Figure 6 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense, and their respective yields or rates over the past five quarters. This figure also presents a reconciliation of taxable-equivalent net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with GAAP for each of those quarters. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized taxable-equivalent net interest income by average earning assets.  Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $604 million for the first quarter of 2011, and the net interest margin was 3.25%. These results compare to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $632 million and a net interest margin of 3.19% for the first quarter of 2010. The increase in the net interest margin primarily reflects the Company’s efforts to lower funding costs by reducing the level of higher costing certificates of deposit and growing lower costing transaction accounts. This benefit to the net interest margin was partially offset by a lower level of average earning assets and a change in asset mix as loans paid down which resulted in a net decrease in net interest income.  Compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $31 million, and the net interest margin declined six basis points. The decline in the net interest margin and net interest income reflects the combined effect of hedge maturities and the change in the mix and lower levels of earning assets as average loan balances declined. The impact of the hedge maturities is reflected in lower interest income and yields on commercial loans.  We expect net interest income and the net interest margin to decline in the second quarter of 2011 as a result of an approximately $3 billion decline in average earning assets and a change in the funding mix resulting from the repayment of the $2.5 billion of TARP CPP preferred securities and the movement of $1.5 billion of escrow deposits during March 2011. Until we see a more significant increase in lending activities we expect the net interest margin to be in the range of 3.15% to 3.25% for the remainder of 2011.  Average earning assets for the first quarter of 2011 totaled $75.2 billion, which was $4.6 billion, or 5.8%, lower than the first quarter of 2010. Average loans declined $8.3 billion primarily in our commercial portfolio, due to soft demand for both commercial and consumer credits during the past year and run-off in our exit portfolios. Securities available for sale increased $4.8 billion. This increase was due to our emphasis on building liquidity and investing excess cash flows from loan payments and deposit flows.  Earning asset levels continued to decline during the first quarter of 2011 due to funding activities, capital management decisions and continued declines in loan balances. During the first quarter of 2011, we completed the repurchase of the $2.5 billion of TARP CPP preferred equity held by the U.S. Treasury by raising $625 million of common equity, issuing $1.0 billion of long-term debt and using other available funds. Also during the quarter we sold $1.5 billion of available for sale securities to provide replacement funding for the $1.5 billion of Commercial Real Estate escrow deposits that were transferred to another financial institution in connection with the Moody’s rating downgrade in November of 2010. Loan balance declines of $1.6 billion and other balance sheet changes provided funding to repay $500 million of maturing subordinated debt and a $1.2 billion decline in CD balances. Towards the end of the first quarter our deposits in our foreign office account experienced a temporary increase of approximately $2.5 billion and these funds were placed into short-term investments. The reversal of these foreign office deposit inflows occurred early in the second quarter and resulted in a corresponding decline in short-term investments. We anticipate these events will result in an additional reduction to average earning assets of approximately $3 billion during the second quarter of 2011 compared to the first quarter of 2011.  Since January 1, 2010, the size and composition of our loan portfolios have been affected by the following actions:     ¨   We sold $397 million of commercial real estate loans during the first three months of 2011 and $1.2 billion during 2010. Since some of these loans have been sold with limited recourse under FNMA’s delegated underwriting and servicing program (i.e., there is a risk that we will be held accountable for certain events or representations made in the sales agreements), we established and have maintained a loss reserve in an amount that we believe is appropriate. More information about the related recourse agreement is provided in Note 12 (“Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) under the heading “Recourse agreement with FNMA.”      ¨   In addition to the sales of commercial real estate loans discussed above, we sold other loans totaling $484 million (including $438 million of residential real estate loans) during the first three months of 2011 and $2.0 billion (including $1.6 billion of residential real estate loans) during 2010.      ¨   We did not sell any education loans (which are included in “discontinued assets” on the balance sheet) during the first three months of 2011. However, we sold education loans in the amount of $487 million during 2010.     70    Table of Contents   Figure 6.

Noninterest income  Our noninterest income was $457 million for the first quarter of 2011, compared to $450 million for the year-ago quarter, representing an increase of $7 million, or 2%, from the first three months of 2010.  As shown in Figure 8, noninterest income improved primarily due to increases of $34 million in investment banking and capital markets income, $15 million in gains from loan sales and $15 million in letter of credit and loan fees, due to increased syndication activity. Offsetting these increases was a $12 million decrease in operating lease income, an $8 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts resulting from the implementation of Regulation E in the third quarter of 2010 and a $22 million decrease in other noninterest income items.   73    Table of Contents   Figure 8.

Trust and investment services income  Trust and investment services are our largest source of noninterest income. The primary components of revenue generated by these services are shown in Figure 9. The decrease during the first quarter of 2011 of $4 million, or 4%, is attributable to lower income from institutional asset management and custody fees.  Figure 9. Trust and Investment Services Income                                              Three months ended               March 31,     Change      dollars in millions   2011     2010     Amount     Percent           Brokerage commissions and fee income    $ 32      $ 33      $ (1 )     (3.0 ) %   Personal asset management and custody fees     38       37       1       2.7     Institutional asset management and custody fees     40       44       (4 )     (9.1 )       Total trust and investment services income    $ 110      $ 114      $ (4 )     (3.5 ) %                                   A significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management. At March 31, 2011, our bank, trust and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of $61.5 billion, compared to $66.2 billion at March 31, 2010. As shown in Figure 10, most of the decrease was attributable to reductions in the securities lending and money market portfolios, offset by an increase in the equity portfolio. The decline in the securities lending portfolio was due to relatively flat equity market activities, a decline on spreads, and client departures. When clients’ securities are lent out, the borrower must provide us with cash collateral, which is invested during the term of the loan. The difference between the revenue generated from the investment and the cost of the collateral is shared with the lending client. This business, although profitable, generates a significantly lower rate of return (commensurate with the lower level of risk) than other types of assets under management. The decline in the money market portfolio was due in part to the low rate environment as clients look for higher yields in other investment strategies. The decrease in the value of our portfolio of hedge funds is attributable to our second quarter 2009 decision to wind down the operations of Austin.   74    Table of Contents   Figure 10.

Service charges on deposit accounts  The decrease in service charges on deposit accounts during the first three months of 2011 is due primarily to the implementation of Regulation E, which went into effect on July 1, 2010 for new clients and August 15, 2010 for our existing clients.     Operating lease income  Lower business volumes of operating leases due to the related economics resulted in a decrease of $12 million, or 26% for the first quarter of 2011, in our Equipment Finance line of business. Accordingly, as shown in Figure 12, operating lease expense also declined.     Investment banking and capital markets income (loss)  As shown in Figure 11, income from investment banking and capital markets activities increased $34 million, or 377.8% from the year-ago quarter. Dealer trading and derivatives income increased by $20 million from the year-ago quarter. This was largely due to a $9 million credit recorded during the first quarter of 2011 in the provision for losses related to customer derivatives compared to a $21 million provision for the same period one year-ago. Offsetting this change was a hedging loss of $6 million from a change in fair value of credit default swaps for the three-month period ended March 31, 2011 compared to a hedging gain of $3 million due to a change in fair value for the same period last year. Investment banking income increased $10 million, or 63% from the year-ago quarter due to increased levels of debt and equity financings as a result of improving capital market and economic conditions. Foreign exchange income and income from other investments also increased as compared to the year-ago quarter.  Figure 11.

During the first three months of 2011, we recorded $19 million of net gains from loan sales, compared to net gains of $4 million during the first three months of 2010. These sales were primarily in the residential mortgage and commercial real estate portfolios. Strengthening market liquidity and improved pricing in the portfolio provided us the opportunity to sell these assets.   75    Table of Contents      Net gains (losses) from principal investing  Principal investments consist of direct and indirect investments in predominantly privately-held companies. Our principal investing income is susceptible to volatility since most of it is derived from mezzanine debt and equity investments in small to medium-sized businesses. These investments are carried on the balance sheet at fair value ($943 million at March 31, 2011, compared to $898 million at December 31, 2010, and $1.1 billion at March 31, 2010). The net gains (losses) presented in Figure 8 derive from changes in fair values as well as sales of principal investments.     Noninterest expense  Noninterest expense was $701 million for the first quarter of 2011, compared to $785 million for the same period last year.  As shown in Figure 12, the decrease for the first quarter of 2011 compared to the year-ago quarter was attributable to a $22 million decrease in net OREO expense attributable to significant write-downs and losses on sales of OREO in the first quarter of 2010; an $11 million decrease in operating lease expenses; an $8 million decrease in FDIC assessment and a $43 million decrease in other expenses. The remaining noninterest expense decreases were offset by a $9 million increase in personnel expenses.  Figure 12.

The following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest expense and the factors that caused those elements to change.     Personnel  As shown in Figure 13, personnel expense, the largest category of our noninterest expense, increased by $9 million, or 3%, from the first three months of 2010. The increase was due primarily to a $26 million increase in incentive compensation due to improved performance compared to the year-ago quarter. Additionally, salaries and severance slightly increased from the year-ago quarter. The personnel increase was partially offset by a $12 million decrease in employee benefits due to a change in certain pension plan assumptions in the third quarter of 2010 and a $9 million decrease in our stock-based compensation resulting from forfeiture of performance-based shares. For more information related to our pension plans, see Note 14 (“Employee Benefits”).  Figure 13.

Income related to the rental of leased equipment is presented in Figure 8 as “operating lease income.”     Income taxes  We recorded tax expense from continuing operations of $111 million for the first quarter of 2011 and $172 million for the fourth quarter of 2010, compared to a tax benefit of $82 million for the first quarter of 2010.  The tax expense recorded in the first quarter of 2011 is largely attributable to the recognition of tax credits arising from investments in low income housing projects. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded domestic deferred income tax expense of $32 million as the result of management’s change in assertion as to indefinitely reinvesting in non-U.S. subsidiaries.  Our federal tax (benefit) expense differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate, primarily because we generate income from investments in tax-advantaged assets, such as corporate-owned life insurance, earn credits associated with investments in low-income housing projects, and make periodic adjustments to our tax reserves.  Additional information pertaining to how our tax (benefit) expense and the resulting effective tax rates were derived are included in Note 12 (“Income Taxes”) on page 138 of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.   77    Table of Contents      Line of Business Results  This section summarizes the financial performance and related strategic developments of our two major business segments (operating segments), Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. Note 16 (“Line of Business Results”) describes the products and services offered by each of these business segments, provides more detailed financial information pertaining to the segments and their respective lines of business, and explains “Other Segments” and “Reconciling Items.”  Figure 14 summarizes the contribution made by each major business segment to our “taxable-equivalent revenue from continuing operations” and “income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Key” for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2011 and 2010.

A substantial decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses drove the improvement in the first quarter of 2011.  Taxable-equivalent net interest income declined by $34 million, or 8%, from the first quarter of 2010, due to declines in average earning assets and average deposits. Average earning assets decreased by $1 billion, or 5%, from the year-ago quarter, reflecting reductions in the commercial loan and home equity loan portfolios. Average deposits declined by $3 billion, or 6%, as higher-costing certificates of deposit mature, partially offset by growth in noninterest-bearing deposits and NOW and money market deposit accounts.  Noninterest income increased by $5 million, or 3%, from the year-ago quarter, due to higher income from net gains on loan sales, electronic banking fees, trust and investment services, and a reduction in the provision for credit losses from client derivatives. These factors were partially offset by lower service charges on deposits from the implementation of Regulation E.  The provision for loan and lease losses declined by $131 million, or 92%, compared to the first quarter of 2010 due to improving economic conditions resulting in lower net charge-offs and nonperforming loans from the same period one year ago.  Noninterest expense declined by $6 million, or 1%, from the year-ago quarter. The decrease was driven by reductions in FDIC deposit insurance premiums and corporate allocated costs. These improvements were partially offset by increases in personnel expense and business services and professional fees, reflecting the cost of our third-party mortgage operations.  In our Commercial Banking group, which serves clients with revenues of $25 million to $250 million, we experienced a 4% annualized growth rate in average loans in the quarter, as our clients continue to gain more confidence and begin to finance   78    Table of Contents   inventory and equipment purchases. We also saw an 11% year-over-year increase in SBA loan originations and our national ranking in the SBA 7A small business financing program has moved from #15 in 2009 to #12 at the end of last year.

This improvement in the first quarter of 2011 was a result of a substantial decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses.  Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $10 million, or 5%, compared to the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to lower earning assets and deposits. Average earning assets decreased by $5 billion, or 21% from the year-ago quarter. Average deposits declined by $938 million, or 8%, from one year ago. During the first quarter of 2011, approximately $1.5 billion of escrow deposits associated with Key’s mortgage servicing operations were moved to another financial institution as a result of KeyBank’s previously reported ratings downgrade by Moody’s in November 2010.  Noninterest income increased by $41 million, or 23%, from the first quarter of 2010. Investment banking and capital markets income increased $39 million. The first quarter of 2010 included a $21 million provision for losses on customer derivatives compared to a credit of $9 million in the first quarter of 2011. This improvement was partially offset by lower levels of fixed income and equity trading income. Investment banking income increased primarily due to increased levels of debt and equity financings. Also contributing to the improvement in noninterest income was a $16 million increase in letter of credit and loan fees related to an increase in syndication activity. These gains were partially offset by decreases in trust and investment services income of $7 million and operating lease revenue of $5 million.   79    Table of Contents   The provision for loan and lease losses in the first quarter of 2011 was a credit of $21 million compared to a charge of $161 million for the same period one year ago. Key Corporate Bank continued to experience improved asset quality for the sixth quarter in a row.  Noninterest expense decreased by $44 million, or 16%, from the first quarter of 2010 due in part to a $24 million decline in OREO expense. Also contributing to the improvement was a $34 million decrease in various miscellaneous expenses and a $5 million decline in corporate overhead. These improvements were partially offset by an increase in personnel expense. We have hired more than 300 people, including over 100 senior professionals across industry verticals and product groups since January 2010.  In our Institutional and Capital Markets group, the KeyBanc Capital Markets unit raised more than $46 billion for our clients in the first quarter of 2011 through the successful execution of 82 capital markets transactions.

Loans related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business, which are excluded from total loans at March 31, 2011, December 31, 2010, and March 31, 2010, totaled $6.3 billion, $6.5 billion, and $6 billion, respectively. The decrease in our loans from continuing operations over the past twelve months reflects reductions in most of our portfolios, with the largest decline experienced in the commercial portfolio. For more information on balance sheet carrying value, see Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the headings “Loans” and “Loans Held for Sale” on page 101 of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Commercial loan portfolio  Commercial loans outstanding were $33.3 billion at March 31, 2011, a decrease of $6.1 billion, or 16%, since March 31, 2010. This decrease was caused by continued soft demand for credit due to our clients’ use of the strength of the capital markets to raise debt and equity, pay downs on our portfolios and the run-off in our exit loan portfolio as we continue to reduce our risk. We have seen some growth in the Commercial Banking group where businesses continue to gain more confidence as the economy continues to improve.     Commercial, financial and agricultural. Our Commercial, Financial and Agricultural loans, also referred to as “Commercial and Industrial,” represent 34% of our total loan portfolio at March 31, 2011, 33% at December 31, 2010 and 32% at March 31, 2010 and are the largest component of our total loans. The loans are comprised of fixed and variable rate loans to our large, middle market and small business clients. These loans decreased $1.6 billion or 9% from one year ago.     Commercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans represent approximately 22% of our total loan portfolio. These loans include both owner and nonowner-occupied properties and constitute approximately 32% of our commercial loan portfolio. As shown in Figure 17, at March 31, 2011, our commercial real estate portfolio included mortgage loans of $8.8 billion and construction loans of $1.8 billion representing 18% and 4% respectively, of our total loans. Nonowner-occupied loans represent 15% of our total loans and owner-occupied loans represent 7% of our total loans. The average size mortgage loan originated during the first quarter of 2011 was $2.2 million, and our largest mortgage loan at March 31, 2011, had a balance of $120 million. At March 31, 2011, our average construction loan commitment was $3.1 million. Our largest construction loan commitment was $49 million, $48 million of which was outstanding.  Our commercial real estate lending business is conducted through two primary sources: our 14-state banking franchise, and Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services, a national line of business that cultivates relationships both within and beyond the branch system. This line of business deals primarily with nonowner-occupied properties (generally properties for which at least 50% of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties) and accounted for approximately 58% of our average year-to-date commercial real estate loans during the first quarter of 2011, compared to 61% one year ago. Our commercial real estate business generally focuses on larger owners and operators of commercial real estate. As shown in Figure 17, this loan portfolio is diversified by both property type and geographic location of the underlying collateral. Figure 17 includes commercial mortgage and construction loans in both Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank.   81    Table of Contents   Figure 17.

For the period 2008 – 2010, the secondary market for income-property loans was severely constrained. During this period of time, we provided interim financing for certain maturing income property loans. Beginning with the second half of 2010 and continuing throughout the first quarter of 2011, market liquidity for income property loans showed significant improvement. Consequently, our clients’ need for interim financing has diminished and our portfolio of nonowner-occupied income property loans has shown a steady decrease in outstanding principal balances. Since June 30, 2010 our nonowner occupied commercial real estate portfolio has been reduced by approximately $2.2 billion or 23%. Nonetheless, there are circumstances where a client requests a loan extension. In cases where the loan terms were extended at less than normal market rates for similar lending arrangements, we have transferred these loans to the Asset Recovery Group for resolution. In the first quarter of 2011, there were $47 million of new restructured loans included in nonperforming loans, of which $3 million related to commercial real estate.  As shown in Figure 17, at March 31, 2011, 67% of our commercial real estate loans were for nonowner-occupied properties compared to 71% at March 31, 2010. Approximately 22% and 35% of these loans were construction loans at March 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Typically, these properties are not fully leased at the origination of the loan. The borrower relies upon additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide the cash flow necessary to support debt service payments. Uncertain economic conditions generally slow the execution of new leases and may also lead to the turnover of existing leases, driving rental rates and occupancy rates down. As we have experienced during the first three months of 2011, we expect vacancy rates for retail, office and industrial space to remain elevated and possibly further increase well into 2011.  Commercial real estate fundamentals are bottoming, and for certain sectors (i.e., apartments) showing signs of improvement. According to Property and Portfolio Research, Inc., vacancy declined modestly across the four major property sectors in 2010 (with significant declines in apartment vacancy). Rent growth, however, remains negative for retail and industrial and basically flat for office. Rents should be nearing their trough, but are unlikely to post any meaningful gains over the near-term. If there is an interruption in the slow improvement in market fundamentals, any resulting effect would likely be most noticeable in the nonowner-occupied properties segment of our commercial real estate loan portfolio, particularly in the retail properties and office buildings components, which comprise 26% of our commercial real estate loans.   82    Table of Contents   Commercial property values peaked in the fall of 2007, having experienced increases of approximately 30% since 2005 and 90% since 2001. The most recent Moody’s Real Estate Analytics, LLC Commercial Property Price Index shows a 43% drop in values from the peak. However, this is a 4.2% increase from the post peak low recorded in August 2010. While overall prices may be reaching a bottom, market averages obscure divergent trends by asset quality and location. Over the past year, competition for the best assets in the top markets has driven prices higher, while weak demand and continued uncertainty is keeping prices for distressed assets low (and keeping trends negative).  If the factors described above result in further weakening in the fundamentals underlying the commercial real estate market (i.e., vacancy rates, the stability of rental income and asset values), leading to reduced cash flow to support debt service payments, our ability to collect such payments and the strength of our commercial real estate loan portfolio could be adversely affected.     Commercial lease financing. We conduct financing arrangements through our Equipment Finance line of business and have both the scale and array of products to compete in the equipment lease financing business. Commercial lease financing receivables represented 19% of commercial loans at March 31, 2011, and 18% at March 31, 2010. As previously reported, we ceased conducting new business in both the commercial vehicle and office equipment leasing markets during the second half of 2009.     Commercial loan modification and restructuring  Certain commercial loans are modified and extended in the normal course of business for our clients. Loan modifications vary and are handled on a case by case basis with strategies responsive to the specific circumstances of each loan and borrower. In many cases, borrowers have other resources and can reinforce the credit with additional capital, collateral, guarantees or income sources.  Modifications are negotiated to achieve fair and mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan credit quality while at the same time meeting our clients’ financing needs. Modifications made to loans of creditworthy borrowers not experiencing financial difficulties and under circumstances where ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt are not classified as TDRs. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, TDR classification occurs when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a creditor concession has been granted.  Our concession types are primarily categorized as interest rate reductions, principal deferral, or forgiveness of principal. Loan extensions are sometimes coupled with these primary concession types. The table below provides the amount of TDRs by the primary type of concession made at each period end. While our volume of TDR activity is relatively new over the last six quarters, due to improving economic conditions and the restructuring of these loans to provide the best opportunity for successful repayment by the borrower, we have seen successes as measured by restructured loans returning to accrual status and consistent performance according to the restructured loan terms in each primary type of concession over the last three quarters.  Figure 18 shows our concession types for our commercial accruing and nonaccruing TDRs.  Figure 18.

Right-sizing the A note to sustainable cash flow should ultimately allow for its return to accrual status and thereupon a resumption of interest income recognition. Similarly, appropriately-sized A notes will allow for upgraded credit classification based on rehabilitated credit metrics including demonstrated payment performance. Other benefits include the borrower’s retention of ownership and control of the asset, deleveraged and sustainable capital structure (often sufficient to attract fresh capital into the transaction) and rehabilitation of local markets by minimizing distressed/fire sales.  As the objective of the multiple-notes TDR is to achieve a fully performing and well-rated A note, we focus on sizing the A note to a level that is supported by cash flow available to service debt at current market terms and consistent with our customary underwriting standards. This typically will include a debt coverage ratio of 1.2 or better of cash flow to monthly payments of market interest and principal amortization of generally not more than 25 years.  The B note is typically an interest-only note with no required amortization until the property stabilizes and generates excess cash flow which is customarily applied directly to principal. The B note is subsequently evaluated at such time when accrual restoration of the A note is under consideration. In many cases, the B note has then been charged-off contemporaneously with the A note being returned to accrual status. Alternatively, both A and B notes may be simultaneously returned to accrual if credit metrics are supportive as set forth above. In many cases where a three note structure (A, B, C) has been utilized, the C notes are fully charged-off at the time of the TDR. In the very few instances where the C note is not charged-off, there is a pending equity event, additional leasing or pending sale of developed units that support the C note balance shortly after the TDR.  All loans processed as a TDR, including A notes and any non-charged-off B or C notes, are reported as TDRs during the year in which they are consummated. Returning an A note to accrual status requires a reasonable level of certainty that the balance of principal and interest is fully collectable over time.  Our policy requires a sustained period of timely principal and interest payments to restore a loan to accrual status. Primary repayment derived from property cash flow is evaluated for risk of continued sustainability while secondary repayment (collateral) is appraised to ensure that market value exceeds the carrying value of the A note with a sufficient excess (generally 20%). Although our policy is a guideline, considerable judgment is required to review each borrower’s circumstances.     Extensions  Certain commercial loans are modified and extended in the normal course of business for our clients. Project loans are typically refinanced into the permanent commercial loan market at maturity; however, due to the limited sources of permanent commercial mortgage financing available in the market today and the market-wide decline in leasing activity and rental rates, an increased number of loans have been extended. Extension terms take into account the specific circumstances of the client relationship, the status of the project and near-term prospects for both the client and the collateral. In all cases, pricing and loan structure are reviewed and (where necessary) modified to ensure the loan has been priced to achieve a market rate of return and loan terms (i.e., amortization, covenants and term) that are appropriate for the risk. Typical enhancements include one or more of the following: principal paydown, increased amortization, additional collateral, increased guarantees, and/or a cash flow sweep. As previously mentioned, some maturing construction loans have automatic   84    Table of Contents   extension options built in and in those cases where the borrower qualifies for the extension option, pricing and loan terms cannot be altered. Most project loans by their nature are “collateral-dependent” as cash flow from the project loans or the sale of the real estate provides for repayment of the loan.  Pricing of a loan is determined based on the strength of the borrowing entity and the strength of the guarantor if any. Therefore, pricing may remain the same (e.g., the loan is already priced at or above current market). We do not consider loan extensions in the normal course of business (under existing loan terms or at market rates) as TDRs, particularly when ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt and no concession has been made. In the case of loan extensions outside of the normal course of business—where either collection of all principal and interest is uncertain or a concession has been made, we would analyze such credit under the accounting guidance to determine whether it qualifies as a TDR. Extensions that qualify as TDRs are measured for impairment under the applicable accounting guidance.     Guarantors  A detailed guarantor analysis is conducted (1) for all new extensions of credit, (2) at the time of any material modification/extension, and (3) typically annually, as part of our on-going portfolio and loan monitoring procedures. This analysis includes submission by the guarantor entity of all appropriate financial statements including balance sheets, income statements, tax returns, and real estate schedules.  While the specific steps of each guarantor analysis may have some minor differences, the high level objectives include reaching a conclusion regarding the overall financial conditions of the guarantor entities, including: size, quality, and nature of asset base; net worth (adjusted to reflect our opinion of market value); leverage; standing liquidity; recurring cash flow; contingent and direct debt obligations; and near term debt maturities.  Borrower and guarantor financial statements are required at least annually within 90-120 days of the calendar/fiscal year end. Income statements and rent rolls for project collateral are required quarterly. In some cases, disclosure of certain information including liquidity, certifications, status of asset sales or debt resolutions, and real estate schedules may be required more frequently.  We routinely seek performance from guarantors of impaired debt, if the guarantor is solvent. In limited circumstances, we would not seek to enforce the guaranty, including situations in which we are precluded by bankruptcy and/or it is determined the cost to pursue a guarantor exceeds the value to be returned given the guarantor’s verified financial condition. We are often successful in obtaining either monetary payment and/or the cooperation of our solvent guarantors to help mitigate loss, cost and the expense of collections.  As of March 31, 2011, we had $433 million of mortgage and construction loans that had a loan to value ratio greater than 1.0 and were accounted for as performing loans. These loans were not considered impaired due to one or more of the following factors: underlying cash flow adequate to service the debt at a market rate of return with adequate amortization; a satisfactory borrower payment history; and acceptable guarantor support.     Consumer loan portfolio  Consumer loans outstanding decreased by $1.2 billion, or 7%, from one year ago. As shown in Figure 36 in the “Credit risk management” section, the majority of the reduction came from our exit loan portfolio. Most of the decrease is attributable to the marine segment.  The home equity portfolio is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio. Virtually this entire portfolio (94% at March 31, 2011) is derived primarily from the Regional Banking line of business within our Key Community Bank. The remainder of the portfolio, which has been in an exit mode since the fourth quarter of 2007, was originated from the Consumer Finance line of business and is now included in Other Segments. Home equity loans within Key Community Bank decreased by $471 million, or 5%, over the past twelve months.  Figure 20 summarizes our home equity loan portfolio by source at the end of each of the last five quarters, as well as certain asset quality statistics and yields on the portfolio as a whole.   85    Table of Contents   Figure 20.

As previously reported, we have experienced a decrease in our consumer loan portfolio. We expect that the portfolio will continue to decrease in future periods as a result of our actions to exit dealer-originated home equity loans and indirect retail lending for marine and recreational vehicle products, and discontinue the education lending business. We ceased originating new education loans effective December 5, 2009 and account for this business in discontinued operations.  In the latter half of 2010, there was public controversy surrounding the foreclosure practices of large home lenders. Our number of home loan foreclosures is small (the average number of new mortgage foreclosures serviced by Key and third parties, initiated per month, through March 31, 2011 was 131; mortgage loans serviced by Key and third parties outstanding at March 31, 2011 are approximately 235,000 loans) and primarily have occurred in our home equity loan portfolio. A review of our foreclosure processes did not uncover any material defects in the process of signing and notarizing affidavits.     Loans held for sale  As shown in Note 3 (“Loans and Loans Held for Sale”), our loans held for sale decreased to $426 million at March 31, 2011 from $467 million at December 31, 2010 and totaled $556 million at March 31, 2010. Loans held for sale related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business, which are excluded from total loans held for sale at March 31, 2011, December 31, 2010 and March 31, 2010, totaled $14 million, $15 million, and $246 million, respectively.  At March 31, 2011, loans held for sale included $287 million of commercial mortgages, which increased by $22 million from March 31, 2010, and $52 million of residential mortgage loans which decreased $40 million from March 31, 2010.     Loan sales  As shown in Figure 21, during the first three months of 2011, we sold $397 million of commercial real estate loans, $438 million of residential real estate loans, and $46 million of commercial loans. Most of these sales came from the held-for-sale portfolio.  Figure 21 summarizes our loan sales for the first three months of 2011 and all of 2010.  Figure 21.

The table includes loans that have been sold.  Figure 22.

Additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in Note 12 (“Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) under the heading “Recourse agreement with FNMA.”  We derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold. We earn noninterest income (recorded as “other income”) from fees for servicing or administering loans. This fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets. In addition, we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing of commercial real estate loans.     Securities  Our securities portfolio totaled $19.5 billion at March 31, 2011, compared to $22.0 billion at December 31, 2010, and $16.6 billion at March 31, 2010. At each of these dates, most of our securities consisted of securities available for sale, with the remainder consisting of held-to-maturity securities of less than $22 million.     Securities available for sale  The majority of our securities available-for-sale portfolio consists of CMOs, which are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities. CMOs generate interest income and serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements. At March 31, 2011, we had $19.3 billion invested in CMOs and other mortgage-backed securities in the available-for-sale portfolio, compared to $21.7 billion at December 31, 2010 and $16.3 billion at March 31, 2010.  As shown in Figure 23, all of our mortgage-backed securities are issued by government-sponsored enterprises or GNMA, and are traded in highly liquid secondary markets and recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. For more information about these securities, see Note 5 (“Fair Value Measurements”) under the heading “Qualitative Disclosures of Valuation Techniques.”  Figure 23. Mortgage-Backed Securities by Issuer                                      March 31,     December 31,     March 31,      in millions   2011     2010     2010           FHLMC    $ 9,336      $ 10,373      $ 7,590     FNMA     6,132       7,357       4,322     GNMA     3,802       4,004       4,427         Total    $ 19,270      $ 21,734      $ 16,339                                                             During the first three months of 2011, we had net losses of $35 million from CMOs and other mortgage-backed securities, of which $33 million were net unrealized losses and $2 million were net realized losses. The net unrealized losses resulted from an increase in market interest rates and were recorded in the AOCI component of shareholders’ equity. We continue to maintain a moderate asset-sensitive exposure to near-term changes in interest rates.  We periodically evaluate our securities available-for-sale portfolio in light of established A/LM objectives, changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio, and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. These evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning.   87    Table of Contents   In addition, the size and composition of our securities available-for-sale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required (or elect) to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits. Although we generally use debt securities for this purpose, other assets, such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit, are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles.  During the first quarter of 2011, our investing activities continue to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs. Early in the quarter, we purchased $605 million in CMOs issued by government-sponsored entities or GNMA. We are able to either pledge these securities to the Federal Reserve or Federal Home Loan Bank for secured borrowing arrangements, sell them or use them in connection with repurchase agreements should alternate sources of liquidity be required in the future. We elected not to reinvest the monthly security cash flows during February and March and also sold approximately $1.6 billion of CMOs during the first quarter of 2011. These actions provided the liquidity necessary to address the funding requirements arising from the loss of certain escrow deposit balances related to commercial mortgage securitizations serviced by Key and rated by Moody’s, and also contributed to our preparations for TARP repayment in March 2011.  Figure 24 shows the composition, yields and remaining maturities of our securities available for sale.

(b)   Excludes $5 million of securities at March 31, 2011, that have no stated yield.       Other investments  Principal investments — investments in equity and mezzanine instruments made by our Principal Investing unit — represented 67% of other investments at March 31, 2011. They include direct investments (investments made in a particular company) as well as indirect investments (investments made through funds that include other investors). Principal   89    Table of Contents   investments are predominantly made in privately held companies and are carried at fair value ($943 million at March 31, 2011, $898 million at December 31, 2010, and $1.1 billion at March 31, 2010).  In addition to principal investments, “other investments” include other equity and mezzanine instruments, such as certain real estate-related investments that are carried at fair value, as well as other types of investments that generally are carried at cost.  Most of our other investments are not traded on an active market. We determine the fair value at which these investments should be recorded based on the nature of the specific investment and all available relevant information. Among other things, our review may encompass such factors as the issuer’s past financial performance and future potential, the values of public companies in comparable businesses, the risks associated with the particular business or investment type, current market conditions, the nature and duration of resale restrictions, the issuer’s payment history, our knowledge of the industry and third party data. During the first three months of 2011, net gains from our principal investing activities (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) totaled $35 million, which includes $26 million of net unrealized gains. These net gains are recorded as “net gains (losses) from principal investing” on the income statement.     Deposits and other sources of funds  Domestic deposits are our primary source of funding. During the first quarter of 2011, these deposits averaged $59.0 billion and represented 78% of the funds we used to support loans and other earning assets, compared to $64.6 billion and 81% during the same quarter in 2010. The composition of our average deposits is shown in Figure 6 in the section entitled “Net interest income.”  The decrease in average domestic deposits in the first quarter of 2011, compared to the first quarter of 2010, was due to a decline in certificates of deposit ($100,000 or more) and other time deposits. This decline was offset by an increase in NOW and money market deposit accounts, and noninterest-bearing deposits. The mix of deposits continues to change as higher-costing certificates of deposit mature and reprice to current market rates and clients move their balances to transaction and nonmaturity deposit accounts, such as NOW and money market savings accounts, or look for other alternatives for investing in the current low-rate environment. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2011, approximately $1.5 billion of escrow deposits associated with Key’s mortgage servicing operations were moved to another financial institution as a result of the previously reported ratings downgrade of KeyBank by Moody’s in November 2010. We funded this movement of the escrow deposits by selling a similar amount of securities available for sale at the time of the transfer.  Wholesale funds, consisting of deposits in our foreign office and short-term borrowings, averaged $4.2 billion during the first quarter of 2011, compared to $3.0 billion during the year-ago quarter. The change from the first quarter of 2010 resulted from a $347 million increase in foreign office deposits, a $585 million increase in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and a $248 million increase in bank notes and other short-term borrowings.  Additionally, in conjunction with a client’s equity raise at the end of March, $2.5 billion was placed on deposit with us in a foreign office account. These funds were subsequently disbursed in early April 2011.     The Dodd-Frank Act’s Reform of Deposit Insurance  The Dodd-Frank Act made permanent the current FDIC standard maximum deposit insurance coverage limit of $250,000, and provided for temporary unlimited FDIC deposit insurance until January 1, 2013, for non interest-bearing demand transaction accounts, including Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts, for all insured depository institutions effective December 31, 2010 (concurrent with the expiration date of the current TAG Program extension). Since December 31, 2010, KeyBank has offered noninterest-bearing demand transaction accounts, with unlimited FDIC deposit insurance, similar to when we participated in the TAG.  Substantially all of KeyBank’s domestic deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. The FDIC assesses an insured depository institution an amount for deposit insurance premiums equal to its deposit insurance assessment base times a risk-based assessment rate. Under the risk-based assessment system in effect for the first quarter of 2011, annualized deposit insurance premium assessments ranged from $.07 to $.775 for each $100 of assessable domestic deposits based on the institution’s risk category.  As discussed in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K on page 9 under the heading “Federal Deposit Insurance Act,” “Deposit Insurance Assessments”, in order to adhere to requirements imposed upon the DIF by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC adopted a final rule, effective April 1, 2011, changing the basis for assessments from domestic deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, and implementing a new assessment system. Under the new   90    Table of Contents   assessment system, KeyBank’s annualized deposit insurance premium assessments would range from $.025 to $.45 for each $100 of its new assessment base, depending on its new scorecard performance incorporating KeyBank’s regulatory rating, ability to withstand asset and funding related stress, and relative magnitude of potential losses to the FDIC in the event of KeyBank’s failure. We estimate that our 2011 expense for deposit insurance assessments will be $60 million to $90 million. As the end of the quarter, we had $361 million of prepaid FDIC insurance assessments remaining on our balance sheet from our December 2009 prepayment of 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 estimated assessments. Prepayment was required of depository institutions under the FDIC’s restoration plan for the DIF.  Subsequent to the effectiveness of the new FDIC assessment system discussed above, on April 15, 2011, the FDIC published a Notice of Proposed Assessment Rate Adjustment Guidelines in the Federal Register. The guidelines describe the process that the FDIC would follow to determine whether an adjustment to the score used to calculate the assessment rate for a large or highly complex institution, such as Key, and to notify an institution of an adjustment. The proposal sets forth guidelines for the FDIC’s use of its ability to adjust a large institution’s assessment rate provided for under the new assessment effective April 1, 2011. Comments on the proposed guidelines are due by May 31, 2011. Depending on the outcome of this adjustment, our assessment could be increased thereby reducing the amount of estimated savings we have described in the preceding paragraph for 2011.     Capital  At March 31, 2011, our shareholders’ equity was $9.4 billion, down $1.7 billion from December 31, 2010. The following discusses certain factors that contributed to the change in our shareholders’ equity. For other factors that contributed to the change, see the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity (Unaudited).     Repurchase of TARP CPP preferred stock, warrant and completion of equity and debt offerings  On March 30, 2011, we completed the repurchase of the $2.5 billion of Series B Preferred Stock, issued to the U.S. Treasury as part of the TARP CPP. The repurchase followed a $625 million common equity offering and a $1 billion debt offering of 5.1 % Senior Medium Term Notes, Series I, both of which were completed in the first quarter of 2011.  As a result of the repurchase of the Series B Preferred Stock, we accelerated the amortization of the issuance discount (deemed dividend) on the Series B Preferred Stock in the amount of $49 million, which reduced net income available to holders of our Common Shares and, in turn, reduced our earnings per Common Shares by $.06. The issuance discount is due to the carrying value of the Series B Preferred Stock being less than its liquidation value, as the carrying value of our Series B Preferred Stock and the corresponding warrant issued to the U.S. Treasury as part of our participation was based upon its fair value at issuance. On April 20, 2011 we repurchased the warrant directly from the U.S. Treasury for $70 million.  During the first quarter of 2011, KeyCorp completed the underwritten public offering of 70,621,470 of its Common Shares at a price of $8.85 per share, with aggregate proceeds to KeyCorp of $625 million. KeyCorp also completed the public offering of $1 billion 5.1% Senior Medium-Term Notes, Series I, during the first quarter of 2011. The proceeds from the sale of Common Shares and medium-term notes were used, along with other available funds, to repurchase the Series B Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury.     Dividends  During the first three months of 2011, we made dividend payments of $31 million to the U.S. Treasury on the Series B Preferred Stock as a participant in the U.S. Treasury’s TARP CPP. The repurchase will eliminate future quarterly dividends of $31 million, or $125 million on an annual basis, related to these preferred shares.  During the first quarter 2011, we made a dividend payment of $1.9375 per share or $6 million on our Series A Preferred Stock.  Additionally, during the first quarter 2011, we made a dividend payment of $.01 per share, or $9 million, on our Common Shares.  As part of our Comprehensive Capital Plan, we requested authority to increase our quarterly common stock dividend from $0.01 per share to $0.03 per share effective in the second quarter of 2011. The Federal Reserve did not object to that request as part of our Comprehensive Capital Plan, and our Board of Directors will consider the dividend increase at its regular May meeting. Future increases will be evaluated by the Board of Directors, based on our earnings, financial condition, capital   91    Table of Contents   requirements, and other factors including regulatory review. Further information regarding our Comprehensive Capital Plan is included in the “Supervision and Regulation” section under the heading “Supervisory Capital Assessment Program.”     Common shares outstanding  Our Common Shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol KEY. At March 31, 2011 our book value per Common Share was $9.58 based on 953.9 million shares outstanding at March 31, 2011, compared to $9.52 based on 880.6 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2010, and $9.01 based on 879.1 million shares outstanding at March 31, 2010. At March 31, 2011 our tangible book value per Common Share was $8.59 compared to $8.45 at December 31, 2010, and $7.91 at March 31, 2010.  Figure 26 shows activities that caused the change in outstanding Common Shares over the past five quarters.  Figure 26. Changes in Common Shares Outstanding                                                      2011   2010    in thousands   First    Fourth    Third    Second    First          Shares outstanding at beginning of period     880,608       880,328       880,515       879,052       878,535     Common shares issued     70,621       —       —       —       —     Shares reissued (returned) under employee benefit plans     2,697       280       (187 )     1,463       517         Shares outstanding at end of period     953,926       880,608       880,328       880,515       879,052                                             As shown above, Common Shares outstanding increased by 73,318 thousand shares during the first quarter of 2011 from the common share issuance discussed previously and net activity in our employee benefit plans.  At March 31, 2011, we had 63.0 million treasury shares, compared to 65.7 million treasury shares at December 31, 2010 and 67.3 million treasury shares at March 31, 2010. Going forward we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stock-based compensation awards and for other corporate purposes.  In the past we have periodically repurchased Common Shares, for employee benefit plans without regulatory approval, in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions under a repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors. The existing program does not have an expiration date, and we have outstanding Board authority to repurchase 13.9 million shares. We did not repurchase any Common Shares during the first three months of 2011 or 2010. Regulatory approval will be required for any future Common Share repurchases, including under the existing Board authority.     Capital adequacy  Capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance. All of our capital ratios remain in excess of regulatory requirements at March 31, 2011. Our capital and liquidity position us well to weather the current credit cycle while continuing to serve our clients’ needs, as well as to adjust to the application of any new regulatory capital standards due to or promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act. Our shareholders’ equity to assets ratio was 10.42% at March 31, 2011, compared to 12.10% at December 31, 2010 and 11.17% at March 31, 2010. Our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 9.16% at March 31, 2011, compared to 8.19% at December 31, 2010 and 7.37% at March 31, 2010.  Banking industry regulators prescribe minimum capital ratios for bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries. Risk-based capital guidelines require a minimum level of capital as a percent of “risk-weighted assets.” Risk-weighted assets consist of total assets plus certain off-balance sheet and market items, subject to adjustment for predefined credit risk factors. Currently, banks and bank holding companies must maintain, at a minimum, Tier 1 capital as a percent of risk-weighted assets of 4.00% and total capital as a percent of risk-weighted assets of 8.00%. We expect U.S. regulators to introduce new regulatory capital guidelines later this year, responding to both Dodd Frank and Basel III capital directives. As of March 31, 2011, our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and our total risk-based capital ratios were 13.48% and 17.38%, respectively, compared to 15.16% and 19.12%, respectively, at December 31, 2010.  Another indicator of capital adequacy, the leverage ratio, is defined as Tier 1 capital as a percentage of average quarterly tangible assets. Leverage ratio requirements vary with the condition of the financial institution. Bank holding companies that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the Federal Reserve’s risk-adjusted measure for market risk — as we have — must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 3.00%. All other bank holding companies must maintain a minimum ratio of 4.00%. As of March 31, 2011, our leverage ratio was 11.56% compared to 13.02% at December 31, 2010.   92    Table of Contents   The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to bank holding companies by requiring regulators to create rules phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities being eligible Tier 1 risk-based capital.  This three year phase-out period, which commences January 1, 2013, will ultimately result in our trust preferred securities issued by the KeyCorp and Union State Bank capital trusts (“capital securities”) being treated only as Tier 2 capital. These changes in effect apply the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to depository institutions to BHCs, savings and loan holding companies, and nonbank financial companies identified as systemically important.  As of March 31, 2011, our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, leverage ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio were 13.48%, 11.56%, and 17.38%, respectively. The capital securities issued by the KeyCorp and Union State Bank capital trusts contribute $1.8 billion or 235, 202, and 235 basis points to our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio, respectively, as of March 31, 2011.  Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950, prompt corrective action standards, Federal bank regulators group FDIC-insured depository institutions into five categories, ranging from “well capitalized” to “critically undercapitalized.” A “well capitalized” institution must meet or exceed the prescribed thresholds of 6.00% for Tier 1 risk-based capital, 5.00% for Tier 1 leverage capital, 10.00% for total risk-based capital and must not be subject to any written agreement, order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. If these provisions applied to bank holding companies, we would qualify as “well capitalized” at March 31, 2011. We believe there has not been any change in condition or event since that date that would cause our capital classification to change. Analysis on a pro forma basis, accounting for the phase-out of our trust preferred securities as Tier 1 eligible (and therefore as Tier 2 instead) as of March 31, 2011, also determines that we would qualify as “well capitalized” under current regulatory guidelines, with the pro forma Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, pro forma leverage ratio, and pro forma total risk-based capital ratio being 11.13%, 9.54%, and 17.38%, respectively. The current regulatory defined categories serve a limited supervisory function. Investors should not use our pro forma ratios as a representation of our overall financial condition or prospects of KeyCorp or KeyBank.  Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. As a result of the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has intensified its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 risk-based capital, known as Tier 1 common equity, and its review of the consolidated capitalization of systemically important financial companies, including KeyCorp. Because the Federal Reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders’ equity (essentially Tier 1 risk-based capital less preferred stock, qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in Tier 1 risk-based capital, such a focus is consistent with existing capital adequacy guidelines and does not imply a new or ongoing capital standard. The modifications mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act are consistent with the renewed focus on Tier 1 common equity and the consolidated capitalization of banks, BHCs, and covered nonbank financial companies, which resulted from the financial crisis. Because Tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by GAAP nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations, this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. Figure 5 in the “Highlights of Our Performance” section reconciles Key shareholders’ equity, the GAAP performance measure, to Tier 1 common equity, the corresponding non-GAAP measure. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio was 10.74% at March 31, 2011, compared to 9.34% at December 31, 2010, and 7.51% at March 31, 2010.  At March 31, 2011, we had a consolidated net deferred tax asset of $366 million compared to $442 million at December 31, 2010 and $651 million at March 31, 2010. Prior to the third quarter of 2009, we had been in a net deferred tax liability position. Generally, for risk-based capital purposes, deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income are limited to the lesser of: (i) the amount of deferred tax assets that a financial institution expects to realize within one year of the calendar quarter-end date, based on its projected future taxable income for the year, or (ii) 10% of the amount of an institution’s Tier 1 capital. Based on these restrictions, at March 31, 2011, $47 million of our net deferred tax assets were deducted from Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets compared to $158 million at December 31, 2010 and $651 million at March 31, 2010. We anticipate that the amount of our net deferred tax asset disallowed for risk-based capital purposes will continue to decline in coming quarters.   93    Table of Contents      Basel III  In December 2010, the Basel Committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation (“Basel III”). Basel III is a comprehensive set of reform measures designed to strengthen the regulation, supervision and risk management of the banking sector.  As discussed more fully in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K in the Supervision and Regulation section beginning on page 5, Basel III requires higher and better quality capital, better risk coverage, the introduction of a leverage ratio as a backstop to the risk-based requirement, measures to promote the build up of capital that can be drawn down in periods of stress, the use of contingent capital to provide an additional level of protection for depositors and creditors, and the introduction of two global liquidity standards.  While the U.S banking regulators have yet to adopt Basel III, on January 1, 2013, banks with regulators adopting the Basel III capital framework in full would be required to meet the following minimum capital ratios – 3.5% common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets, 4.5% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and 8.0% total capital to risk-weighted assets. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer will begin on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% and be phased in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019).  Basel III introduces for the first time an official definition and specific guideline minimums for Tier 1 common equity. When the requirements for the capital conservation buffer are included, the resulting minimum levels for Tier 1 capital and total risk-based capital will be higher than the U.S.’s current “well-capitalized” minimums.  The U.S. bank regulatory agencies have not yet set forth a formal timeline for a notice of proposed rulemaking or final adoption of regulations responsive to Basel III. However, they have indicated informally that a notice of proposed rulemaking likely will be released in the second half of 2011, with final amendments to regulations becoming effective in mid-2012. Given our strong capital position, we expect to be able to satisfy the Basel III capital framework should U.S. capital regulations corresponding to it be finalized. While we also have a strong liquidity position, the Basel III liquidity framework could require us and other U.S. banks to initiate additional liquidity management initiatives, including adding additional liquid assets, issuing term debt, and modifying our product pricing for loans, commitments, and deposits. U.S. regulators have indicated that they may elect to make certain refinements to the Basel III liquidity framework. Accordingly, at this point it is premature to assess the impact of the Basel III liquidity framework.  Figure 27 represents the details of our regulatory capital position at March 31, 2011, December 31, 2010, and March 31, 2010.   94    Table of Contents   Figure 27.

The most significant risks we face are credit, liquidity, market, compliance, operational, strategic and reputation risks. We must properly and effectively identify, assess, measure, monitor, control and report such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability. Certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section.  During the first quarter of 2011, our management team continued to enhance our ERM Program and related practices. Our ERM Committee, which consists of the Chief Executive Officer and other Senior Executives, is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite. The ERM Program encompasses our risk philosophy, policy, framework and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company. The ERM Committee reports to the Risk Management Committee of our Board of Directors. Annually, the Board of Directors reviews and approves the ERM Program, as well as the risk appetite and corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories. We use a risk-adjusted capital framework to manage risks. This framework is approved and managed by the ERM Committee.  Our Board of Directors serves in an oversight capacity with the objective of managing our enterprise-wide risks in a manner that is effective, balanced and adds value for the shareholders. The Board inquires about risk practices, reviews the portfolio of risks, compares actual risks to the risk appetite and tolerances, and receives regular reports about significant risks — both actual and emerging. To assist in these efforts, the Board has delegated primary oversight responsibility for risk to the Audit Committee and the Risk Management Committee.  The Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for internal audit; financial reporting; compliance risk and legal matters; the implementation, management and evaluation of operational risk and controls; information security and fraud risk; and evaluating the qualifications and independence of the independent auditors. The Audit Committee discusses policies related to risk assessment and risk management and the processes related to risk review and compliance.  The Risk Management Committee has responsibility for overseeing the management of credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk (including the actions taken to mitigate these risks), as well as reputational and strategic risks relating to the foregoing. The Risk Management Committee also oversees the maintenance of appropriate regulatory and economic capital. The Risk Management Committee reviews the ERM reports and, in conjunction with the Audit Committee, reviews reports of material changes to the Operational Risk Committee and Compliance Risk Committee charters, and approves any material changes to the charter of the ERM Committee.  The Audit and Risk Management Committees meet jointly, as appropriate, to discuss matters that relate to each committee’s responsibilities. In addition to regularly scheduled bi-monthly meetings, the Audit Committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases. Committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting. All members of the Board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months.  Federal banking regulators are reemphasizing with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution. We believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks, and comport with regulatory expectations.     Market risk management  The values of financial instruments change as a function of changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity values, commodity prices and other market factors that influence prospective market rates, values or prices. For example, the value of a fixed-rate bond will decline if market interest rates increase. Similarly, the value of the U.S. dollar regularly fluctuates in relation to other currencies. The holder of a financial instrument faces “market risk” when the value of the instrument is tied to such external factors. Most of our market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations.   96    Table of Contents      Interest rate risk management  Interest rate risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the EVE. Such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates, and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. We manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the EVE in accordance with our risk appetite, and within policy limits established by the ERM Committee.  Interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products, economic conditions, the competitive environment within our markets and changes in market interest rates that affect client activity and our hedging, investing, funding and capital positions. The primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of basis risk, gap risk, yield curve risk and option risk.     ¨   We face “basis risk” when floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities reprice at the same time, but in response to different market factors or indices. Under those circumstances, even if equal amounts of assets and liabilities are repricing, interest expense and interest income may not change by the same amount.      ¨   “Gap risk” occurs if interest-bearing liabilities and the interest-earning assets they fund (for example, deposits used to fund loans) do not mature or reprice at the same time.      ¨   “Yield curve risk” is the exposure to non-parallel changes in the slope of the yield curve (where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity) if interest-bearing liabilities and the interest-earning assets they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve.      ¨   A financial instrument presents “option risk” when one party to the instrument can take advantage of changes in interest rates without penalty. For example, when interest rates decline, borrowers may choose to prepay fixed-rate loans and refinance at a lower rate. Such a prepayment gives us a return on our investment (the principal plus some interest), but unless there is a prepayment penalty, that return may not be as high as the return that would have been generated had payments been received over the original term of the loan. Deposits that can be withdrawn on demand also present option risk.       Net interest income simulation analysis. The primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis. For purposes of this analysis, we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on- and off-balance sheet positions and account for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity and the risk management objectives of the ALCO Committee. The analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments, including a most likely macro economic scenario.  Typically, the amount of net interest income at risk is measured by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if the federal funds target rate were to gradually increase or decrease by 200 basis points over the next twelve months, and term rates were to move in a similar fashion. In light of the low interest rate environment, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, we modified the standard rate scenario of a gradual decrease of 200 basis points over twelve months to a gradual decrease of 25 basis points over two months with no change over the following ten months. After calculating the amount of net interest income at risk to interest rate changes, we compare that amount with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment. We also perform regular stress tests and sensitivities on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments. One set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of interest rate inputs on simulated exposures. Assessments are performed using different shapes in the yield curve, including a sustained flat yield curve, an inverted slope yield curve, changes in credit spreads, an immediate parallel change in market interest rates and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates. Another set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of loan and deposit assumptions and assumed discretionary strategies on simulated exposures. Assessments are performed on changes to the following assumptions: the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities, changes in lending spreads, prepayments on loans and securities, other loan and deposit balance changes, investment, funding and hedging activities, and liquidity and capital management strategies.  Simulation analysis produces only a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on judgments related to assumption inputs into the simulation model. We tailor assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled, and validate those assumptions on a regular basis. Our simulations are performed with the assumption that interest rate risk positions will be actively managed through the use of on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments to achieve the   97    Table of Contents   desired residual risk profile. However, actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the following inputs: balance sheet composition, customer behavior, product pricing, market interest rates, and investment, funding and hedging activities. Actual results may also differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events.  Figure 28 presents the results of the simulation analysis at March 31, 2011 and 2010. At March 31, 2011, our simulated exposure to a change in short-term interest rates was moderately asset sensitive. ALCO policy limits for risk management call for the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual increase or decrease in short-term interest rates over the next twelve months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 4%. As shown in Figure 28, we are operating within these limits.  Figure 28. Simulated Change in Net Interest Income                             March 31, 2011                       Basis point change assumption (short-term rates)     -25       +200      ALCO policy limits     -4.00 %     -4.00  %       Interest rate risk assessment     -.79 %     +3.67  %                           March 31, 2010                       Basis point change assumption (short-term rates)     -25       +200      ALCO policy limits     -4.00 %     -4.00  %       Interest rate risk assessment     -1.09 %     +4.16  %         As interest rates have remained at low levels for an extended period of time, we have gradually shifted from a liability-sensitive position to an asset-sensitive position as a result of balance growth in transaction deposits and declines in loan balances. Although outstanding derivative hedge positions have declined over the past several quarters due to contractual maturities, improved liquidity flows have resulted in increases of a similar magnitude in the outstanding balance of fixed rate investment securities, and this has served to moderate further increases in the asset-sensitive positioning. Our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume, mix, maturity and re-pricing of loan and deposit flows. As changes occur to the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy, management evaluates hedging opportunities that would change the reported interest rate risk profile.  The results of additional simulation analyses that make use of alternative interest rate paths and customer behavior assumptions indicate that net interest income improvement in a rising rate environment could be diminished, and actual results may be different than the policy simulation results in Figure 28. Net interest income improvements are highly dependent on the timing, magnitude, frequency and path of interest rate increases and assumption inputs for deposit re-pricing relationships, lending spreads and the balance behavior of transaction accounts.  We also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a three-year horizon. These simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a twelve-month horizon. To capture longer-term exposures, we calculate exposures to changes to the EVE as discussed in the following section.     Economic value of equity modeling. EVE complements net interest income simulation analysis since it estimates risk exposure beyond twelve- and twenty-four and thirty-six month horizons. EVE measures the extent to which the economic values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates, and measuring the resulting change in the values of assets and liabilities under multiple interest rate paths. Under the current level of market interest rates, the calculation of EVE under an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest rates results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than 200 basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points. This analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities. Those assumptions are based on historical behaviors, as well as our expectations. We develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our EVE will decrease by more than 15% in response to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates. We are operating within these guidelines.     Management of interest rate exposure. We use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate Asset Liability Management strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures. Specifically, we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities, issuing term debt with   98    Table of Contents   floating or fixed interest rates, and using derivatives — predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps, which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities.  Figure 29 shows all swap positions which we hold for A/LM purposes. These positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. For example, fixed-rate debt is converted to a floating rate through a “receive fixed/pay variable” interest rate swap. The volume, maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader A/LM objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile, see Note 7 (“Derivatives and Hedging Activities”).  Figure 29.

Derivatives not designated in hedge relationships  Our derivatives that are not designated in hedge relationships are described in Note 7. We use a VAR simulation model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of this portfolio. Using two years of historical information, the model estimates the maximum potential one-day loss with a 95% confidence level. Statistically, this means that losses will exceed VAR, on average, five out of 100 trading days, or three to four times each quarter.  We manage exposure to market risk in accordance with VAR limits for trading activity that have been approved by the Market Risk Committee which was established as part of Key’s ERM Program. At March 31, 2011, the aggregate one-day trading limit set by the committee was $6.9 million. We are operating within these constraints. During the first quarter of 2011, our aggregate daily average, minimum and maximum VAR amounts were $1.5 million, $1.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively. During the same period one year ago, our aggregate daily average, minimum and maximum VAR amounts were $2.0 million, $1.6 million and $2.5 million, respectively.  In addition to comparing VAR exposure against limits on a daily basis, we monitor loss limits, use sensitivity measures and conduct stress tests. We report our market risk exposure to the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors.     Liquidity risk management  We define “liquidity” as the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences. Liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions.     Governance structure  We manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis. This approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity, as well as each entity’s capacity to manage through adverse conditions. It also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding.  Oversight of the liquidity risk management process is governed by the Risk Management Committee of the KeyCorp Board of Directors, the KeyBank Board of Directors, the ERM Committee and the ALCO. These groups regularly review various liquidity reports, including liquidity and funding summaries, liquidity trends, peer comparisons, variance analyses, liquidity projections, hypothetical funding erosion stress tests and goal tracking reports. The reviews generate a discussion of positions, trends and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of the decisions that we make. When liquidity pressure   99    Table of Contents   is elevated, monitoring of positions is heightened and reporting is more intensive. We communicate with individuals within and outside of the company on a daily basis to discuss emerging issues. In addition, we use a variety of daily liquidity reports to monitor the flow of funds.     Factors affecting liquidity  Our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events. An example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency. Examples of indirect events (events unrelated to us) that could impact our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war, natural disasters, political events, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund or hedge fund. Similarly, market speculation, or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources.  Moody’s (a credit rating agency that rates KeyCorp and KeyBank debt securities) indicated to KeyBank that certain escrow deposits associated with our mortgage servicing operations will be required to be moved to another financial institution which meets Moody’s minimum ratings threshold. As a result of this decision by Moody’s, on March 7, 2011, KeyBank transferred approximately $1.5 billion of these escrow deposit balances to an acceptably-rated institution which resulted in an immaterial impairment of the related mortgage servicing assets. KeyBank has ample liquidity reserves to offset the loss of these deposits and expects to remain in a strong liquidity position.     Managing liquidity risk  We regularly monitor our funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding. In the normal course of business, we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both KeyCorp and KeyBank. In a “heightened monitoring mode,” we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently, and use assumptions so the stress tests are more strenuous and reflect the changed market environment. Erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods. Ultimately, they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations. To compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures, we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed.  We continue to reposition our balance sheet to reduce future reliance on wholesale funding and maintain a strong liquid asset portfolio. As our secured borrowings matured, in prior years, they were not replaced. However, we retain the capacity to utilize secured borrowings as a contingent funding source.  We maintain a Contingency Funding Plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis. The Plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions. It also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for effectively managing liquidity through a problem period. As part of the Plan, we maintain a liquidity reserve through balances in our liquid asset portfolio which during a problem period could reduce our potential reliance on wholesale funding. The portfolio at March 31, 2011 totaled $12.4 billion. The liquid asset portfolio balance consisted of $7.4 billion of unpledged securities, $2.2 billion of securities available for secured funding at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and $2.7 billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our Federal Reserve account. Additionally, as of March 31, 2011, our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was $11.7 billion at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and $3.8 billion at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati.     Long-term liquidity strategy  Our long-term liquidity strategy is to be core deposit funded with reduced reliance on wholesale funding. Key’s client-based relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base, which support our liquidity risk management strategy. We use the loan to deposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies. Our target loan to deposit ratio is between 90-100%, which we calculate as total loans, loans held-for-sale, and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by domestic deposits.     Sources of liquidity  Our primary sources of funding include customer deposits, wholesale funding, liquid assets, and capital. If the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances, we rely on wholesale funding or liquid assets. Conversely, excess cash generated by operating, investing and deposit-gathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets. We actively manage liquidity using a variety of nondeposit sources, including short- and long-term debt, and secured borrowings.   100    Table of Contents      Liquidity programs  We have several liquidity programs, which are described in Note 14 (“Short-Term Borrowings”) on page 144 of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which enable the parent company and KeyBank to raise funds in the public and private markets when the capital markets are functioning normally. The proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. Each of the programs is replaced or renewed as needed. There are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs.     Liquidity for KeyCorp  The parent company has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt; support customary corporate operations and activities (including acquisitions) and occasional guarantees of subsidiary’s obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences; and pay dividends to shareholders.  Our primary tool for assessing parent company liquidity is the net short-term cash position, which measures the ability to fund debt maturing in twenty-four months or less with existing liquid assets. Another key measure of parent company liquidity is the “liquidity gap,” which represents the difference between projected liquid assets and anticipated financial obligations over specified time horizons. We generally rely upon the issuance of term debt to manage the liquidity gap within targeted ranges assigned to various time periods.  Typically, the parent company meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from KeyBank. Federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval. A national bank’s dividend-paying capacity is affected by several factors, including net profits (as defined by statute) for the two previous calendar years and for the current year, up to the date of dividend declaration. During the first three months of 2011, KeyBank did not pay any dividends to the parent; however, nonbank subsidiaries paid the parent $12 million in dividends. As of the close of business on March 31, 2011, KeyBank would not have been permitted to pay dividends to the parent without prior regulatory approval. To compensate for the absence of dividends, the parent company has relied upon the issuance of long-term debt and stock. During the first three months of 2011, the parent did not make any capital infusions to KeyBank, compared to $100 million during the first three months of 2010.  The parent company generally maintains cash and short-term investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over the next twenty-four months. At March 31, 2011, the parent company held $2.2 billion in short-term investments, which we projected to be sufficient to repay our maturing debt obligations.  During the first quarter of 2011, the parent company completed a $625 million equity offering at a price of $8.85 per Common Share. In conjunction with the equity offering, the parent company issued $1 billion, 5.1% Senior Medium-Term Notes, Series I, during the first quarter of 2011. The proceeds from the sale of Common Shares and medium-term notes were used, along with other available funds, to repurchase the Series B Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury. The repurchase will eliminate future quarterly dividends of $31 million, or $125 million on an annual basis, related to these preferred shares.     Our liquidity position and recent activity  Over the past twelve months, we have increased our liquid asset portfolio, which includes overnight and short-term investments, as well as unencumbered, high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios. Liquidity stress scenarios include the loss of access to either unsecured or secured funding sources, as well as draws on unfunded commitments and significant deposit withdrawals.  From time to time, KeyCorp or its principal subsidiary, KeyBank, may seek to retire, repurchase or exchange outstanding debt, capital securities or preferred stock through cash purchase, privately negotiated transactions or other means. Such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity and capital requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.  We generate cash flows from operations, and from investing and financing activities. During the first three months of 2011, we used the proceeds from our debt and Common Share offerings as well as our securities available for sale portfolio (which we had previously accumulated from loan pay downs and maturities of short-term investments) to repurchase our Series B Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury as part of the TARP CPP and to pay dividends. As previously noted, the repurchase will eliminate future quarterly dividends of $31 million, or $125 million on an annual basis, related to these preferred shares.   101    Table of Contents   Additionally, in conjunction with a client’s equity raise at the end of March, $2.5 billion was placed on deposit with us in a foreign office account. These funds were subsequently disbursed in early April 2011.  The consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for each three month period ended March 31, 2011 and 2010.     Credit ratings  Our credit ratings at March 31, 2011 are shown in Figure 30. We believe that these credit ratings, under normal conditions in the capital markets, will enable the parent company or KeyBank to issue fixed income securities to investors. Conditions in the credit markets have materially improved relative to the disruption experienced between the latter part of 2007 and 2009; however, while credit is more readily available, the cost of funds remains higher than what was experienced prior to the market disruption.  If our credit ratings fall below investment-grade, that event could have a material adverse effect on us. Such downgrades could adversely affect access to liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us. Ultimately, credit ratings downgrades could adversely affect our business operations and reduce our ability to generate income.  In the fourth quarter of 2010, Moody’s (a credit rating agency that rates KeyCorp and KeyBank debt securities) announced a one notch downgrade of KeyBanks’s short-term borrowings, senior long-term debt, and subordinated debt. As a result of this decision by Moody’s, on March 7, 2011, KeyBank transferred approximately $1.5 billion of certain escrow deposit balances to an acceptably-rated institution which resulted in an immaterial impairment of the related mortgage servicing assets. For more information regarding this transfer of escrow deposit balances see Note 8 (“Mortgage Servicing Assets”).   102    Table of Contents   Figure 30.

Like other financial services institutions, we make loans, extend credit, purchase securities and enter into financial derivative contracts, all of which have related credit risk.     Credit policy, approval and evaluation  We manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program. The Credit Risk Committee approves both retail and commercial credit policies. These policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit. For more information about our credit policies, as well as related approval and evaluation processes, see the section entitled “Credit policy, approval and evaluation” on page 79 of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We actively manage the overall loan portfolio in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives, including the use of credit derivatives — primarily credit default swaps — to mitigate credit risk. Credit default swaps enable us to transfer a portion of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit to a third party. At March 31, 2011, we used credit default swaps with a notional amount of $777 million to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending obligations. We also sell credit derivatives — primarily index credit default swaps — to diversify and manage portfolio concentration and correlation risks. At March 31, 2011, the notional amount of credit default swaps sold by us for the purpose of diversifying our credit exposure was $436 million. Occasionally, we have provided credit protection to other lenders through the sale of credit default swaps. These transactions with other lenders generated fee income.  Credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Related gains or losses, as well as the premium paid or received for credit protection, are included in the trading income component of noninterest income. These swaps decreased our operating results by $6 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2011 compared to an increase of $3 million for the same period last year.  We also manage the loan portfolio using portfolio swaps and bulk purchases and sales. Our overarching goal is to manage the loan portfolio within a specified range of asset quality.  Selected asset quality statistics for each of the past five quarters are presented in Figure 31.

Watch and criticized assets  Watch assets are troubled commercial loans with the potential to deteriorate in quality due to the client’s current financial condition and possible inability to perform in accordance with the terms of the underlying contract. Criticized assets are troubled loans and other assets that show additional signs of weakness that may lead, or have led, to an interruption in scheduled repayments from primary sources, potentially requiring us to rely on repayment from secondary sources, such as collateral liquidation. Criticized assets showed significant improvement during the first quarter of 2011 from both the prior quarter and the same period one year ago.     Allowance for loan and lease losses  At March 31, 2011, the allowance for loan and lease losses was $1.4 billion, or 2.83% of loans, compared to $2.4 billion, or 4.34%, at March 31, 2010. The allowance includes $39 million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of $493 million at March 31, 2011, compared to $307 million that was allocated for impaired loans of $1.5 billion one year ago. For more information about impaired loans, see Note 4 (“Asset Quality”). At March 31, 2011, the allowance for loan and lease losses was 155.03% of nonperforming loans, compared to 117.43% at March 31, 2010.  We estimate the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses on at least a quarterly basis. The methodology used is described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses” on page 102 of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Briefly, we apply historical loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions, changes in credit policies or underwriting standards, and changes in the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets. For all TDRs, regardless of size, as well as impaired loans having an outstanding balance greater than $2.5 million, we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss content and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate. A specific allowance also may be assigned — even when sources of repayment appear sufficient — if we remain uncertain about whether the loan will be repaid in full. The allowance for loan and lease losses at March 31, 2011, represents our best estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date.  As shown in Figure 32, our allowance for loan and lease losses decreased by $1.1 billion, or 43%, during the past twelve months. This contraction was associated with the improvement in credit quality of the loan portfolio, which has trended more favorably the past twelve months. Asset quality is improving and has resulted in favorable risk rating migration and a reduction in our general allowance. Our delinquency trends continue to decline while our roll rates keep improving. We attribute this to a more moderate level of economic activity, more favorable conditions in the capital markets, improvement in client income statements and continued run off in our exit loan portfolio. Our liability for credit losses on lending-related commitments decreased by $50 million to $69 million at March 31, 2011, compared to the same period one year ago. When combined with our allowance for loan and lease losses, our total allowance for credit losses represented 2.97% of loans at the end of the first quarter of 2011 compared to 4.55% at the end of the first quarter of 2010. We anticipate further reductions in the level of our allowance for loan and lease losses for the balance of 2011 as a result of our expectation of lower levels of net charge-offs and nonperforming loans as the economy continues to show signs of improvement.   104    Table of Contents   Figure 32.

Our provision for loan and lease losses was a credit of $40 million for the first quarter of 2011, compared to a provision of $413 million for the year-ago quarter. Our net loan charge-offs for the first quarter of 2011 exceeded the credit provision for loan and lease losses by $233 million. The decrease in our provision is due to the improving credit quality we have experienced in most of our loan portfolios and the reduction of our outstanding loan balances. Additionally, we continue to work our exit loans through the credit cycle, and reduce exposure in our higher-risk businesses including the residential properties portion of our construction loan portfolio, Marine/RV financing, and other selected leasing portfolios through the sale of certain loans, payments from borrowers or net charge-offs. As these outstanding loan balances decrease, so does their required allowance for loan and lease losses and corresponding provision.     Net loan charge-offs  Net loan charge-offs for the first quarter of 2011 totaled $193 million, or 1.59% of average loans from continuing operations. These results compare to net charge-offs of $522 million, or 3.67%, for the same period last year. Figure 33 shows the trend in our net loan charge-offs by loan type, while the composition of loan charge-offs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in Figure 34.  Over the past twelve months, net charge-offs in the commercial loan portfolio decreased by $294 million, due primarily to commercial real estate related credits within the Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services line of business. Net charge-offs for this line of business declined by $184 million from the first quarter of 2010 and decreased $6 million from the fourth quarter of 2010. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, net loan charge-offs in the commercial loan portfolio decreased by $56 million which was attributable to declines in both the real estate — commercial mortgage and commercial, financial and agricultural portfolios. As shown in Figure 36, our exit loan portfolio accounted for $41 million, or 21%, of total net loan charge-offs for the first quarter of 2011. Our net loan charge-offs have declined each of the past five quarters and are at their lowest level since the first quarter of 2008.   105    Table of Contents   Figure 33.

These assets totaled $1.1 billion at March 31, 2011, and represented 2.23% of portfolio loans, OREO and other nonperforming assets, compared to $1.3 billion, or 2.66%, at December 31, 2010, and $2.4 billion, or 4.31%, at March 31, 2010. Nonperforming assets were down over $1.7 billion from their peak at September 30, 2009. We experienced another decrease in the inflow of nonperforming loans during the first quarter of 2011, representing our fifth consecutive decrease and the lowest level of new inflows since the third quarter of 2008.

These concessions are made to improve the collectability of the loan and generally take the form of a reduction of the interest rate, extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance.   As shown in Figure 35, nonperforming assets decreased during the first quarter of 2011 which represents the fifth consecutive quarterly decline. Most of the reduction came from nonperforming loans and OREO in the commercial real estate lines of business. As shown in Figure 36, our exit loan portfolio accounted for $145 million, or 13%, of total nonperforming assets at March 31, 2011, compared to $210 million, or 16%, at December 31, 2010.  At March 31, 2011, the carrying amount of our commercial nonperforming loans outstanding represented 55% of their original face value, and total nonperforming loans outstanding represented 62% of their face value. At the same date, OREO represented 49% of its original face value, while loans held for sale and other nonperforming assets in the aggregate represented 53% of their face value.  At March 31, 2011, our 20 largest nonperforming loans totaled $284 million, representing 32% of total loans on nonperforming status.  Figure 36 shows the composition of our exit loan portfolio at March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the net charge-offs recorded on this portfolio for the first quarter of 2011 and the fourth quarter of 2010, and the nonperforming status of these loans at March 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. The exit loan portfolio represented 10% of total loans and loans held for sale at March 31, 2011.   108    Table of Contents   Figure 36.

Figure 37 shows credit exposure by industry classification in the largest sector of our loan portfolio, “commercial, financial and agricultural loans.” Since December 31, 2010, total commitments and loans outstanding in this sector have declined by $285 million and $1 million, respectively, and have declined by $4.2 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively from March 31, 2010.  The types of activity that caused the change in our nonperforming loans during each of the last five quarters are summarized in Figure 38. As shown in this figure, nonperforming loans experienced another quarterly decrease as loans placed on nonaccrual decreased for the fifth consecutive quarter and loans sold and payments received on nonperforming loans increased in the first quarter of 2011 as compared to the first quarter of 2010, as market liquidity improved.

As shown in this figure, the decrease in the first quarter of 2011 from the fourth quarter of 2010 and the first quarter of 2010 was primarily attributable to a decrease in properties acquired through foreclosure or voluntary transfer from the borrower.

Operational risk also encompasses compliance (legal) risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules and regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards and contractual obligations. Due to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, large financial companies like Key will be subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation due to their systemic importance. This heightened level of regulation will increase our operational risk. We have created work teams to respond to and analyze the new regulatory requirements imposed upon us and that will be promulgated as a result of the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. Resulting losses could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation or forgone opportunities. We seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk, alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance, a system of internal controls and reporting.  We continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with laws, rules and regulations, and to improve the oversight of our operational risk. For example, an operational event database tracks the amounts and   110    Table of Contents   sources of operational risk and losses. This tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action. We also rely upon software programs designed to assist in the assessment of operational risk and monitoring our control processes. This technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the Board of Directors.  Primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business. Our Operational Risk Management function manages the Operational Risk Management Program which provides the framework for the structure, governance, roles and responsibilities as well as the content to manage operational risk for Key. The Operational Risk Committee, a senior management committee, oversees our level of operational risk, and directs and supports our operational infrastructure and related activities. This committee and the Operational Risk Management function are an integral part of our ERM Program. Our Risk Review function periodically assesses the overall effectiveness of our Operational Risk Management Program and our system of internal controls. Risk Review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the Audit Committee, and independently supports the Audit Committee’s oversight of these controls.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk  The information presented in the “Market risk management” section of the Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition & Results of Operations, is incorporated herein by reference.     Item 4. Controls and Procedures  As of the end of the period covered by this report, KeyCorp carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of KeyCorp’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of KeyCorp’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, KeyCorp’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, as of the end of the period covered by this report, in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. No changes were made to KeyCorp’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, KeyCorp’s internal control over financial reporting.
