Item 1A. Risk Factors.Regulatory capital requirementIn July 2013, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a final rule to implement Basel III with an effective date of January 1, 2015, and a multi-year transition period ending on December 31, 2018 (“Regulatory Capital Rules”). Consistent with the international framework, the Regulatory Capital Rules further restrict the type of instruments that may be recognized in Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital (including the phase out of trust preferred securities from tier 1 capital for BHCs above a certain asset threshold, like KeyCorp), establish a minimum Tier 1 Common Equity Capital ratio requirement of 4.5% and capital buffers to address procyclicality concerns and absorb losses during periods of financial stress, and refine several of the methodologies used for determining risk-weighted assets. The Regulatory Capital Rules provide additional requirements for large banking organizations with over $250 billion in total consolidated assets or $10 billion in foreign exposure, but those additional requirements do not apply to KeyCorp nor to KeyBank. Accordingly, for purposes of the Regulatory Capital Rules, KeyCorp and KeyBank are treated as “standardized approach” banking organizations.The Basel III capital framework and the U.S. implementation of the Basel III capital framework are discussed in more detail in Item 1. Business of our 2016 Form 10-K under the heading “Supervision and Regulation - Regulatory capital requirements.”Under the Regulatory Capital Rules, “standardized approach” banking organizations, like KeyCorp, are required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in Figure 3 below. At March 31, 2017, Key had an estimated Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 9.83% under the fully phased-in Regulatory Capital Rules. Also at March 31, 2017, based on the fully phased-in Regulatory Capital Rules, Key estimates that its capital and leverage ratios, after adjustment for market risk, would be as set forth in Figure 3.Figure 3.

The table reconciles the GAAP performance measure to the corresponding non-GAAP measure, which provides a basis for period-to-period comparisons.(b)Capital conservation buffer must consist of Common Equity Tier 1 capital. As a standardized approach banking organization, KeyCorp is not subject to the countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% imposed upon an advanced approaches banking organization under the Regulatory Capital Rules.(c)As a standardized approach banking organization, KeyCorp is not subject to the 3% supplemental leverage ratio requirement, which becomes effective January 1, 2018.Revised prompt corrective action framework The federal prompt corrective action (“PCA”) framework under the FDIA groups FDIC-insured depository institutions into one of five capital categories: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and 82Table of Contents“critically undercapitalized,” for purposes of determining whether a bank should be required to establish a capital restoration plan and become subject to limitations on the bank’s activities, capital actions, and payment of management fees.In addition to implementing the Basel III capital framework in the U.S., the Regulatory Capital Rules also revised the capital category thresholds under the PCA framework for FDIC-insured depository institutions such as KeyBank. The revised PCA framework table in Figure 4 identifies the capital category thresholds for a “well capitalized” and an “adequately capitalized” institution under the Regulatory Capital Rules. Figure 4. "Well Capitalized" and "Adequately Capitalized" Capital Category Ratios under Revised PCA Framework Prompt Corrective Action Capital Category Ratio Well Capitalized (a) Adequately Capitalized Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based 6.5%4.5%Tier 1 Risk-Based 8.0 6.0 Total Risk-Based 10.0 8.0 Tier 1 Leverage (b) 5.0 4.0       (a)A “well capitalized” institution also must not be subject to any written agreement, order, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.(b)As a “standardized approach” banking organization, KeyBank is not subject to the 3% supplemental leverage ratio requirement, which becomes effective January 1, 2018.We believe that, as of March 31, 2017, KeyBank (consolidated) satisfied the risk-based and leverage capital requirements to be considered “well capitalized” for purposes of the revised PCA framework. However, investors should not regard this determination as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of KeyBank because the PCA framework is intended to serve a limited supervisory function. Moreover, it is important to note that the PCA framework does not apply to BHCs, like KeyCorp.Capital planning and stress testingOn January 30, 2017, the Federal Reserve released a final rule to revise the capital plan and stress test rules as they apply to large, noncomplex BHCs and U.S. intermediaries of foreign banks. Under the final rule, a large noncomplex BHC is one with total consolidated assets of more than $50 billion but less than $250 billion, and nonbank assets of less than $75 billion (“covered BHCs”). This includes KeyCorp.The final rule provides relief from the compliance requirements associated with the Federal Reserve’s capital plan and stress test rules. Specifically, the final rule relieves covered BHCs from the qualitative assessment portion of the Federal Reserve’s CCAR program and modifies the reporting requirements for these organizations by reducing the reporting requirements applicable to covered BHCs under the FR Y-14A and by raising the materiality thresholds for specific portfolio reporting requirements. The final rule also limits the amount of capital a covered BHC is authorized to distribute in excess of the amount set forth in its capital plan without Federal Reserve approval (the “de minimis exception”), and establishes a one-quarter blackout period during which a BHC is not permitted to submit a notice to use the de minimis exception or seek prior approval to make a capital distribution in an amount that exceeds the de minimis exception level. If exigent circumstances arise during the blackout period that require a capital distribution, a covered BHC may resubmit its capital plan and request expedited review from the Federal Reserve; however, the Federal Reserve is not required to expedite the review process.The final rule also requires covered BHCs to measure nonbank assets on a monthly basis and report the monthly average to the Federal Reserve on a quarterly basis beginning March 31, 2017.The final rule is effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register, and therefore, the relief provided under the final rule from the qualitative assessment portion of the CCAR program is effective for the 2017 CCAR cycle.Liquidity requirementsIn October 2014, the federal banking agencies published a final rule to implement the Basel III liquidity coverage ratio (“Basel III LCR”) for U.S. banking organizations (the “Liquidity Coverage Rules”) that establishes a minimum LCR for certain internationally active bank and nonbank financial companies (excluding KeyCorp) and a modified version of the LCR (“Modified LCR”) for BHCs and other depository institution holding companies with over $50 billion in consolidated assets that are not internationally active (including KeyCorp). KeyBank will not be subject to the LCR or the Modified LCR under the Liquidity Coverage Rules unless the OCC affirmatively determines that application to KeyBank is appropriate in light of 83Table of ContentsKeyBank’s asset size, level of complexity, risk profile, scope of operations, affiliation with foreign or domestic covered entities, or risk to the financial system.Under the Liquidity Coverage Rules, KeyCorp must calculate a Modified LCR on a monthly basis, and was required to satisfy a minimum Modified LCR requirement of 100% by January 1, 2017. At March 31, 2017, Key’s estimated Modified LCR was above 100%. In the future, KeyCorp may change the composition of our investment portfolio, increase the size of the overall investment portfolio, and modify product offerings to enhance or optimize our liquidity position.Net stable funding ratioThe federal banking agencies commenced implementation of the Basel III net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) in the US in April and May 2016, with the release of a proposed rule to implement a NSFR requirement for certain internationally active banking organizations (excluding KeyCorp) and a modified version of the minimum NSFR requirement (“Modified NSFR”) for BHCs and other depository institution holding companies with over $50 billion in consolidated assets that are not internationally active (including KeyCorp), together with quarterly public disclosure requirements. The proposed rule would require banking organizations to satisfy a minimum NSFR requirement of 1.0 on an ongoing basis. However, banking organizations subject to the Modified NSFR (like KeyCorp) would be required to maintain a lower minimum amount of available stable funding, equal to 70% of the required stable funding under the NSFR. The proposed rule would be effective on January 1, 2018. The comment period for the NPR expired on August 5, 2016. If the proposed NSFR requirement is adopted as a final rule, then similar to actions taken in connection with the implementation of the Liquidity Coverage Rules, KeyCorp may adjust its balance sheet or modify product offerings to enhance its liquidity position.Resolution and recovery planningBHCs with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, like KeyCorp, are required to periodically submit to the Federal Reserve and FDIC a plan discussing how the company could be rapidly and efficiently resolved if the company failed or experienced material financial distress. Insured depository institutions with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, like KeyBank, are also required to submit a resolution plan to the FDIC. These plans are due annually by December 31 of each year. For 2015, these resolution plans, the third required from KeyCorp and KeyBank, were submitted on December 1, 2015. KeyCorp and KeyBank were not required to submit resolution plans for 2016 because the FDIC and Federal Reserve deferred such requirement until December 2017. By letter dated March 24, 2017, KeyCorp received guidance from the Federal Reserve and the FDIC regarding the information requirements for certain aspects of KeyCorp’s December 2017 resolution plan submission. That letter is publicly available on the Federal Reserve’s website, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20170324a.htm.Annually, in January, the Federal Reserve and FDIC make available on their websites the public sections of resolution plans for the companies, including KeyCorp and KeyBank, that submitted plans in the prior December. The public section of the resolution plans of KeyCorp and KeyBank is available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/resolution-plans.htm and https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/reform/resplans/.On September 28, 2016, the OCC released final guidelines that establish standards for recovery planning by certain large OCC-regulated institutions, including KeyBank. The guidelines require such institutions to establish a comprehensive framework for evaluating the financial effects of severe stress events, and recovery actions an institution may pursue to remain a viable, going concern during a period of severe financial stress. Under the final guidelines, an institution’s recovery plan must include triggers to alert the institution of severe stress events, escalation procedures, recovery options, and a process for periodic review and approval by senior management and the board of directors. The recovery plan should be tailored to the complexity, scope of operations, and risk profile of the institution.Because KeyBank had average total consolidated assets of greater than $100 billion but less than $750 billion as reported on KeyBank’s Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income for the four most recent consecutive quarters prior to January 1, 2017, it must be in compliance with the guidelines not later than January 1, 2018.84Table of ContentsDeposit insurance and assessmentsAs required under the Dodd-Frank Act, in March 2015, the FDIC approved a final rule to impose a surcharge on the quarterly deposit insurance assessments of insured depository institutions having total consolidated assets of at least $10 billion (like KeyBank). The surcharge is 4.5 cents per $100 of the institution’s assessment base (after making certain adjustments). The final rule became effective on July 1, 2016. As of July 1, 2016, KeyBank must pay a surcharge to assist in bringing the reserve ratio to the statutory minimum of 1.35%. Surcharges will continue through the quarter that the DIF reserve ratio reaches or exceeds 1.35%, but not later than December 31, 2018. If the reserve ratio does not reach 1.35% by December 31, 2018 (provided it is at least 1.15%), the FDIC will impose a shortfall assessment on March 31, 2019, on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more (like KeyBank).In December 2016, the FDIC issued a final rule that imposes recordkeeping requirements on insured depository institutions with two million or more deposit accounts (including KeyBank) in order to facilitate rapid payment of insured deposits to customers if the institutions were to fail. The rule requires those insured depository institutions to: (i) maintain complete and accurate data on each depositor’s ownership interest by right and capacity for all of the institution’s deposit accounts; and (ii) develop the capability to calculate the insured and uninsured amounts for each deposit owner within 24 hours of failure. The FDIC will conduct periodic testing of compliance with these requirements, and institutions subject to the rule must submit to the FDIC a certification of compliance, signed by the KeyBank CEO, and deposit insurance coverage summary report on or before the mandatory compliance date and annually thereafter. The final rule became effective on April 1, 2017, with a mandatory compliance date of April 1, 2020.Single counterparty credit limitsIn March 2016, the Federal Reserve issued an NPR proposing to establish single counterparty credit limits for BHCs with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. This proposal would implement a provision in the Dodd-Frank Act and replaces proposals on this subject issued by the Federal Reserve in 2011 and 2012. Under the proposal, a covered BHC (including KeyCorp) would not be allowed to have an aggregate net credit exposure to any unaffiliated counterparty that exceeds 25% of the consolidated capital stock and surplus of the covered BHC. Globally, systemically important banks and certain other large BHCs (excluding KeyCorp) would be subject to stricter limits under the proposal. A covered BHC such as KeyCorp would be required to comply with the proposed limits and quarterly reporting to show such compliance starting two years after the effective date of a final rule. The comment period for the NPR expired on June 3, 2016.ERISA fiduciary standardIn April 2016, the Department of Labor published final rules and amendments to certain prohibited transaction exemptions regarding which service providers would be regarded as fiduciaries under ERISA for making investment advice recommendations to: (i) certain retirement plan fiduciaries, participants, or beneficiaries; and (ii) owners or beneficiaries of individual retirement accounts and health savings accounts, among other retirement plans. The purpose of the rules is to place fiduciary obligations, rather than the lesser legal obligations that currently apply, on these service providers. Accordingly, the rules subject any financial institution making recommendations for either the purchase or sale of investments in or rollover of the respective retirement plan to certain fiduciary obligations under ERISA such as an impartial conduct standard and not selling certain investment products whose compensation may raise a conflict of interest for the advisor without entering into a contract providing certain disclosures and legal remedies to the customer. Under the Department of Labor’s original rules, the impartial standard requirement for financial institutions and their advisors was to become effective April 10, 2017. However, in response to a Presidential Order, the Department of Labor has extended the effective date to June 9, 2017. The contract provisions must be in place by January 1, 2018. The Department of Labor will continue to review whether to modify, further delay, or rescind these rules in whole or in part. Highlights of Our PerformanceFinancial performanceFor the first quarter of 2017, we announced net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $296 million, or $.27 per common share. Our first quarter of 2017 results compare to net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $182 million, or $.22 per common share, for the first quarter of 2016. During the first quarter of 2017, we incurred merger-related charges totaling $81 million, or $.05 per common share, compared to $24 million, or $.02 per common share, in the first quarter of 2016.85Table of ContentsOur taxable-equivalent net interest income was $929 million for the first quarter of 2017, and the net interest margin was 3.13%, compared to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $612 million and a net interest margin of 2.89% for the first quarter of 2016, reflecting the benefit from the First Niagara acquisition, including purchase accounting accretion, as well as higher earning asset yields and balances. For the full year of 2017, we expect net interest income to be in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion, with our outlook including one additional interest rate increase in the middle of 2017.Key’s noninterest income was $577 million for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $431 million for the year-ago quarter. The most notable increase was in investment banking and debt placement fees, which increased $56 million, related to improved capital markets conditions and activity from the year-ago period. Trust and investment services income, cards and payments income, and service charges on deposit accounts also contributed to the growth, largely resulting from to the First Niagara acquisition. For the full year of 2017, we expect noninterest income to be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion.Our noninterest expense was $1 billion for the first quarter of 2017, which included $81 million of merger-related charges. The merger-related charges were primarily composed of $51 million in nonpersonnel expense largely recognized in marketing, net occupancy, business services and professional fees, and other expenses reflecting a $20 million philanthropic contribution. The remaining $30 million was personnel expense, related to ongoing integration activities. During the first quarter of 2016, we incurred $24 million of merger-related charges.Excluding merger-related charges, noninterest expense was $253 million higher than the first quarter of last year. The increase from the prior year, reflected in both personnel and nonpersonnel expense, was primarily driven by the acquisition of First Niagara. Higher incentive and stock-based compensation related to stronger capital markets performance also contributed to the year-over-year increase. For the full year of 2017, we expect noninterest expense excluding merger-related charges to be in the range of $3.65 billion to $3.75 billion.Average loans were $86.1 billion for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $26 billion compared to the first quarter of 2016, primarily reflecting the impact of the First Niagara acquisition and growth in commercial and industrial loans. We anticipate mid-single digit (4%-6%) loan growth from the fourth quarter of 2016, which translates to $87 billion to $88 billion for fiscal year 2017 average balances and for average loan growth to exceed average deposit growth.Average deposits totaled $102.1 billion for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $30.5 billion compared to the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting the acquisition of First Niagara and core deposit growth in Key’s retail banking franchise. Our consolidated loan-to-deposit ratio was 85.6% at March 31, 2017, compared to 85.7% at March 31, 2016. We anticipate average deposits to be in the range of $104 billion to $105 billion for the fiscal year 2017.Our provision for credit losses was $63 million for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $89 million for the first quarter of 2016. Our allowance for loan and lease losses was $870 million, or 1.01% of total period-end loans, at March 31, 2017, compared to 1.37% at March 31, 2016. For the remainder of 2017, we expect the provision for credit losses to slightly exceed net loan charge-offs to provide for loan growth.Net loan charge-offs for the first quarter of 2017 totaled $58 million, or .27% of average total loans, compared to $46 million, or .31%, for the first quarter of 2016. For the remainder of 2017, we expect net loan charge-offs to average loans to remain below our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points.At March 31, 2017, our nonperforming loans totaled $573 million, which represented .67% of period-end portfolio loans, compared to 1.12% at March 31, 2016. Nonperforming assets at March 31, 2017, totaled $623 million and represented .72% of period-end portfolio loans and OREO and other nonperforming assets, compared to $692 million, or 1.14% of period-end portfolio loans, at March 31, 2016.Our capital ratios remain strong. Our tangible common equity and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios at March 31, 2017, are 8.51% and 10.74%, respectively, compared to 9.97% and 11.38%, respectively, at March 31, 2016. In addition, our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio is 9.91% at March 31, 2017, compared to 11.07% at March 31, 2016. We continue to return capital to our shareholders by repurchasing Common Shares and through our quarterly common share dividend. In the first quarter of 2017, we completed $160 million of Common Share repurchases, including $107 million of common share repurchases in the open market and $53 million of Common Share repurchases related to employee equity compensation programs and paid a cash dividend of $.085 per Common Share, under our 2016 capital plan authorization.Figure 5 shows our continuing and discontinued operating results for the current, past, and year-ago quarters. Our financial performance for each of the past five quarters is summarized in Figure 1.86Table of ContentsFigure 5.

As a result of this decision, we have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations. For further discussion regarding the income (loss) from discontinued operations, see Note 12 (“Acquisition, Divestiture, and Discontinued Operations”).(b)EPS may not foot due to rounding.Figure 6 presents certain non-GAAP financial measures related to “tangible common equity,” “return on tangible common equity,” “Common Equity Tier 1,” “pre provision net revenue,” “cash efficiency ratio,” certain financial measures excluding merger-related charges, and “Common Equity Tier 1 under the Regulatory Capital Rules (estimates).”The tangible common equity ratio and the return on tangible common equity ratio have been a focus for some investors, and management believes that these ratios may assist investors in analyzing Key’s capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and BHC capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. The Federal Reserve focuses its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 capital known as Common Equity Tier 1. Because the Federal Reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders’ equity (essentially Tier 1 risk-based capital less preferred stock and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in Tier 1 risk-based capital, this focus on Common Equity Tier 1 is consistent with existing capital adequacy categories. The Regulatory Capital Rules, described in more detail under the section “Supervision and Regulation” in Item 2 of this report, also make Common Equity Tier 1 a priority. The Regulatory Capital Rules change the regulatory capital standards that apply to BHCs by, among other changes, phasing out the treatment of trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred securities as Tier 1 eligible capital. Starting in 2016, our trust preferred securities are only included in Tier 2 capital. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity and Common Equity Tier 1, we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases. Figure 6 reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures.Figure 6 also shows the computation for and reconciliation of pre provision net revenue, which is not formally defined by GAAP. We believe that eliminating the effects of the provision for credit losses makes it easier to analyze our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis.As disclosed in Note 2 (“Business Combination”) and Note 12 (“Acquisition, Divestiture, and Discontinued Operations”), KeyCorp completed its purchase of First Niagara on August 1, 2016. The definitive agreement and plan of merger to acquire First Niagara was originally announced on October 30, 2015. As a result of this transaction, we’ve recognized merger-related charges. Figure 6 shows the computation of pre provision net revenue excluding merger-related charges, noninterest expense excluding merger-related charges, EPS excluding merger-related charges, and return on average assets from continuing operations excluding merger-related charges. We believe that eliminating the effects of the merger-related charges makes it easier to analyze our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis with our prior results.The cash efficiency ratio is a ratio of two non-GAAP performance measures. Accordingly, there is no directly comparable GAAP performance measure. The cash efficiency ratio excludes the impact of our intangible asset amortization from the calculation. We also disclose the cash efficiency ratio excluding merger-related charges. We believe these ratios provide greater consistency and comparability between our results and those of our peer banks. Additionally, these ratios are used by analysts and investors as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis.87Table of ContentsNon-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, nor as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.88Table of ContentsFigure 6.

calculation and is risk-weighted at 250%.   90Table of ContentsResults of OperationsNet interest incomeOne of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets (such as loans and securities) and loan-related fee income, and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. There are several factors that affect net interest income, including: •the volume, pricing, mix, and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities;•the volume and value of net free funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and equity capital;•the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk;•interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace; and•asset quality.To make it easier to compare both the results across several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets (some taxable, some not), we present net interest income in this discussion on a “taxable-equivalent basis” (i.e., as if all income were taxable and at the same rate). For example, $100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as $154, an amount that, if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35%, would yield $100.Figure 7 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense, and their respective yields or rates over the past five quarters. This figure also presents a reconciliation of TE net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with GAAP for each of those quarters. The net interest margin, which is an indicator of the profitability of the earning assets portfolio less cost of funding, is calculated by dividing annualized TE net interest income by average earning assets.First quarter 2017 net interest income included $53 million of purchase accounting accretion related to the acquisition of First Niagara. This compares to $92 million of purchase accounting accretion in the fourth quarter of 2016, which included $34 million related to the refinement of third quarter 2016 purchase accounting estimates. TE net interest income was $929 million for the first quarter of 2017, and the net interest margin was 3.13%, compared to TE net interest income of $612 million and a net interest margin of 2.89% for the first quarter of 2016, reflecting the benefit from the First Niagara acquisition, including $53 million of purchase accounting accretion, as well as higher earning asset yields and balances.Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, TE net interest income decreased by $19 million, and the net interest margin increased by one basis point. The decline in net interest income reflects a decline in purchase accounting accretion and two fewer days in the quarter, partly offset by higher earning asset yields. The net interest margin benefited from higher earning asset yields and lower levels of liquidity, offset by a decline in purchase accounting accretion. Excluding purchase accounting accretion, TE net interest income increased $20 million from the fourth quarter of 2016 and $264 million from the first quarter of 2016.Average loans were $86.1 billion for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $26 billion compared to the first quarter of 2016, primarily reflecting the impact of the First Niagara acquisition and growth in commercial and industrial loans. The acquisition resulted in an estimated adjustment to the fair value of the acquired loan portfolio of $548 million. We anticipate finalizing the valuation of the acquired loans during the second quarter of 2017. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, average loans increased by $773 million, driven by a $507 million increase in commercial and industrial loans, and a $416 million increase in commercial mortgage loans. The growth reflects overall business activity and lower payoffs in Key’s Commercial Real Estate line of business. Consumer loans decreased $292 million, mostly related to continued decline in the home equity loan portfolio, largely the result of paydowns on home equity lines of credit.Average deposits totaled $102.1 billion for the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $30.5 billion compared to the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting the acquisition of First Niagara and core deposit growth in Key’s retail banking franchise. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, average deposits decreased by $2.6 billion, largely driven by a decline in escrow deposits and both seasonal and short-term commercial deposit outflows. On a period-end basis, total deposits decreased $105 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 as the decline in escrow deposits was partially offset by core deposit growth in Key’s retail banking franchise.91Table of ContentsFigure 7.

The most notable increase was in investment banking and debt placement fees, which increased $56 million, related to improved capital markets conditions and activity from the year-ago period. Trust and investment services income, cards and payments income, and service charges on deposit accounts also contributed to the growth, largely resulting from the First Niagara acquisition. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, noninterest income decreased by $41 million. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower investment banking and debt placement fees, as well as a decline in corporate-owned life insurance income, which is seasonally lower in the first quarter. Corporate services income also decreased $7 million related to lower loan and derivative trading income. An increase of $12 million in trust and investment services income related to higher insurance revenue and fixed income trading volume slightly offset these declines. Figure 9.

The assets under management that primarily generate these revenues are shown in Figure 10. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, trust and investment services income increased $26 million, or 23.9%, compared to the same period one year ago, primarily due to the acquisition of First Niagara. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, trust and investment services income increased $12 million, or 9.8%, related to higher insurance revenue and fixed income trading volume.A significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management. At March 31, 2017, our bank, trust, and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of $37.4 billion, compared to $34.1 billion at March 31, 2016. The increase in assets under management, as shown in Figure 10, was primarily attributable to the acquisition of First Niagara and growth in equity investments.Figure 10.

Investment banking and debt placement fees increased $56 million, or 78.9%, for the first quarter of 2017, related to improved capital markets conditions and activity from the year-ago period. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, investment banking and debt placement fees decreased $30 million, or 19.1%, primarily due to lower gains on sales of commercial mortgages and mergers and acquisition advisory fees. The first quarter of 2017 was the strongest first quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees in our history.Service charges on deposit accountsService charges on deposit accounts increased $22 million, or 33.8%, for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to the same period one year ago. The increase from the three months ended March 31, 2016, was primarily due to the acquisition of First Niagara. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, service charges on deposit accounts increased $3 million, or 3.6%, primarily due to an increase in account analysis and other fees.Corporate services incomeCorporate services income increased $4 million, or 8.0%, from the year-ago quarter. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of First Niagara. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, corporate services income decreased $7 million, or 11.5%, driven by lower loan and derivative trading income.Cards and payments incomeCards and payments income, which consists of debit card, consumer and commercial credit card, and merchant services income, increased $19 million, or 41.3%, from the year-ago quarter. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of First Niagara and to higher purchase and prepaid card fees in Key Corporate Bank. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, cards and payments income decreased $4 million, or 5.8%, due to seasonal consumer behavior.95Table of ContentsOther incomeOther income, which consists primarily of gains on sales of loans held for sale, other service charges, and certain dealer trading income, was flat from the year-ago quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, other income decreased $2 million, or 6.1%, primarily attributable to changes in various miscellaneous income categories.Noninterest expenseAs shown in Figure 11, noninterest expense was $1 billion for the first quarter of 2017, which included $81 million of merger-related charges. The merger-related charges were primarily made up of $51 million of nonpersonnel expense, largely recognized in marketing, net occupancy, business services and professional fees, and other expense reflecting a $20 million philanthropic contribution. The remaining $30 million was personnel expense, related to ongoing integration activities. $24 million of merger-related charges were incurred in the first quarter of 2016.Excluding merger-related charges, noninterest expense was $253 million higher than the first quarter of last year. The increase from the prior year, reflected in both personnel and nonpersonnel expense, was primarily driven by the acquisition of First Niagara. Higher incentive and stock-based compensation related to stronger capital markets performance also contributed to the year-over-year increase. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, noninterest expense, excluding merger-related charges, decreased by $81 million. The decrease primarily reflects cost savings related to the First Niagara acquisition, reflected in both personnel and nonpersonnel expense. Lower incentive and stock-based compensation and the absence of a pension settlement charge also contributed to the decline. These decreases were partially offset by seasonally higher employee benefits expenses.Figure 11.

This increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of First Niagara. Higher incentive and stock-based compensation related to stronger capital markets performance also contributed to the year-over-year increase. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, personnel expense decreased $92 million, or 14.2%, driven by lower incentive and stock-based compensation and by the absence of a pension settlement charge. These decreases were partially offset by seasonally higher employee benefits expenses.Figure 13.

This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of First Niagara. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, net occupancy expense decreased $25 million, or 22.3%, primarily attributable to lower property reserve expenses.Other expenseOther expense comprises various miscellaneous expense items. The $63 million, or 70.0%, increase in the current quarter compared to the same period one year ago reflects the impact of the First Niagara acquisition and other miscellaneous expenses. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, other expense increased $3 million, or 2.0%, reflecting a $20 million philanthropic contribution, partially offset by decreases in other miscellaneous expenses.Income taxesWe recorded tax expense from continuing operations of $94 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $56 million for the first quarter of 2016. Our federal tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate, primarily because we generate income from investments in tax-advantaged assets, such as corporate-owned life insurance and credits associated with renewable energy and low-income housing investments, and make periodic adjustments to our tax reserves. Tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and March 31, 2016, was favorably affected by net discrete income tax benefits of $19 million and $2 million, respectively. The tax expense for the first quarter of 2017 was also significantly reduced due to merger-related charges of $81 million. Excluding those expenses, the tax expense for the first quarter of 2017 was $124 million.Additional information pertaining to how our tax expense (benefit) and the resulting effective tax rates were derived is included in Note 13 (“Income Taxes”) beginning on page 170 of our 2016 Form 10-K.Line of Business ResultsThis section summarizes the financial performance and related strategic developments of our two major business segments (operating segments): Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank.

The increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of First Niagara, as well as benefit from the Federal Reserve rate increase. Average loans and leases increased $16.2 billion, or 52.8%, largely driven by a $5.1 billion, or 39.3%, increase in commercial and industrial loans. Additionally, average deposits increased $26.6 billion, or 50.4%, from one year ago.Noninterest income increased $81 million, or 41.3%, from the year-ago quarter, driven by the acquisition of First Niagara, as well as strength in derivatives and higher assets under management balances, primarily attributable to the acquisition of First Niagara and growth in equity investments. The provision for credit losses increased by $5 million, or 11.9%, and net loan charge-offs increased $20 million, from the first quarter of 2016, primarily related to the acquisition of First Niagara. Noninterest expense increased by $191 million, or 43.8%, from the year-ago quarter, largely driven by the acquisition of First Niagara, as well as an increase in core business activity and investments. Personnel expense increased $75 million, while non-personnel expense increased by $116 million, including higher intangible amortization expense and higher FDIC assessment expense.98Table of ContentsFigure 15.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $86 million, or 39.4%, compared to the first quarter of 2016. Average loan and lease balances increased $10 billion, or 36.1%, from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by the First Niagara acquisition as well as growth in commercial and industrial loans. Average deposit balances increased $2.9 billion, or 16.2%, from the year-ago quarter, mostly driven by the First Niagara acquisition.Noninterest income was up $68 million, or 32.9%, from the prior year. This growth was mostly due to $54 million of higher investment banking and debt placement fees related to improved capital markets conditions and activity from the year-ago period, as well as an increase of $8 million in operating lease income and other leasing gains related to higher originations. 99Table of ContentsAdditional increases of $7 million in cards and payments income and $4 million in mortgage servicing fees were partially offset by a $7 million decrease in other noninterest income. The provision for credit losses decreased $26 million, or 60.5%, compared to the first quarter of 2016 due to $4 million of lower net loan charge-offs and improvement in the oil and gas portfolio. Noninterest expense increased by $66 million, or 27.8%, from the first quarter of 2016. The increase from the prior year, reflected in both personnel and nonpersonnel expense, was largely driven by the acquisition of First Niagara, higher performance-based compensation and various other items, including operating lease and cards and payments expenses.Figure 16.

Our commercial and industrial loans represented 47% of our total loan portfolio at March 31, 2017, and 46% at December 31, 2016, and are the largest component of our total loans. These loans are originated by both Key Corporate Bank and Key Community Bank and consist of fixed and variable rate loans to our large, middle market, and small business clients.101Table of ContentsCommercial and industrial loans increased $344 million, or .9%, from December 31, 2016, with Key Corporate Bank increasing $1 million, Key Community Bank up $369 million, and Other Segments decreasing $26 million. We have experienced growth in new, high credit quality loan commitments and utilization with clients in our middle market segment and Institutional and Capital Markets business. Our largest commercial loan industry classifications, commercial real estate, increased by 7.5%, when compared to December 31, 2016. We experienced growth in our transportation, construction materials and contractors, and business products commercial loan classifications, increasing 50%, 29.8%, and 27.9%, respectively, from December 31, 2016. Partially offsetting these increases, the utilities and financial commercial loan classifications, which represented approximately 8% and 9%, respectively, of the commercial and industrial loan portfolio at March 31, 2017, decreased 3.7% and 4.2%, respectively, from December 31, 2016. Commercial real estate loans. Our commercial real estate lending business is conducted through two primary sources: our 15-state banking franchise, and KeyBank Real Estate Capital, a national line of business that cultivates relationships with owners of commercial real estate located both within and beyond the branch system. This line of business deals primarily with nonowner-occupied properties (generally properties for which at least 50% of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties) and accounted for approximately 69% of our average year-to-date commercial real estate loans for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and March 31, 2016. KeyBank Real Estate Capital generally focuses on larger owners and operators of commercial real estate.Commercial real estate loans totaled $17.5 billion at March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, and represented 20% of our total loan portfolio at March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively. The $74 million increase from December 31, 2016, was due to an increase in real estate—commercial mortgage loans. These loans, which include both owner- and nonowner-occupied properties, represented 28% of our commercial loan portfolio at both March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016. We continue to decrease the risk of the portfolio by changing our focus from developers to owners of completed and stabilized commercial real estate.Figure 18 includes commercial mortgage and construction loans in both Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. As shown in Figure 18, this loan portfolio is diversified by both property type and geographic location of the underlying collateral.As presented in Figure 18, at March 31, 2017, our commercial real estate portfolio included commercial mortgage loans of $15.3 billion and construction loans of $2.3 billion, representing 18% and 3%, respectively, of our total loans. At March 31, 2017, nonowner-occupied loans represented 16% of our total loans and owner-occupied loans represented 4% of our total loans. The average size of commercial mortgage loans originated during the first quarter of 2017 was $4.3 million, and our largest commercial mortgage loan at March 31, 2017, had a balance of $125 million. At March 31, 2017, our average construction loan commitment was $9.1 million, our largest construction loan commitment was $65 million, and our largest construction loan amount outstanding was $47.4 million.Also shown in Figure 18, 79% of our commercial real estate loans at March 31, 2017, were for nonowner-occupied properties compared to 78% at December 31, 2016. Approximately 16% of these loans were construction loans at March 31, 2017, and 17% were construction loans at December 31, 2016. Typically, these properties are not fully leased at the origination of the loan. The borrower relies upon additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide the cash flow necessary to support debt service payments. A significant decline in economic growth, and in turn in rental rates and occupancy, would adversely affect our portfolio of construction loans.102Table of ContentsFigure 18.

Our nonowner-occupied commercial real estate portfolio has increased by 1.2%, or approximately $161 million, since December 31, 2016. The growth reflects overall business activity and lower payoffs in our Commercial Real Estate line of business.Commercial lease financing. We conduct commercial lease financing arrangements through our KEF line of business. Commercial lease financing receivables represented 7% of commercial loans at March 31, 2017, and 8% of commercial loans at December 31, 2016.Commercial loan modification and restructuringWe modify and extend certain commercial loans in the normal course of business for our clients. Loan modifications vary and are handled on a case-by-case basis with strategies responsive to the specific circumstances of each loan and borrower. In many cases, borrowers have other resources and can reinforce the credit with additional capital, collateral, guarantees, or other income sources.Modifications are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan credit quality while at the same time meeting our clients’ financing needs. Modifications made to loans of creditworthy borrowers not experiencing financial difficulties and under circumstances where ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt are not classified as TDRs. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, a loan is classified as a TDR only when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a creditor concession has been granted.Our concession types are primarily interest rate reductions, forgiveness of principal, and other modifications. Loan extensions are sometimes coupled with these primary concession types. Because economic conditions have improved modestly and we have restructured loans to provide the optimal opportunity for successful repayment by the borrower, certain of our restructured loans have returned to accrual status and consistently performed under the restructured loan terms over the past year.103Table of ContentsIf loan terms are extended at less than normal market rates for similar lending arrangements, our Asset Recovery Group is consulted to help determine if any concession granted would result in designation as a TDR. Transfer to our Asset Recovery Group is considered for any commercial loan determined to be a TDR. During the first three months of 2017, we had $28 million of new restructured commercial loans compared to $3 million of new restructured commercial loans during the first three months of 2016.For more information on concession types for our commercial accruing and nonaccruing TDRs, see Note 5 (“Asset Quality”).Figure 19. Commercial TDRs by Accrual Status in millionsMarch 31, 2017December 31, 2016September 30, 2016June 30, 2016March 31, 2016Commercial TDRs by Accrual Status     Nonaccruing$70$51$67$33$50Accruing161618202Total Commercial TDRs$86$67$85$53$52      We often use an A-B note structure for our TDRs, breaking the existing loan into two tranches. First, we create an A note. Since the objective of this TDR note structure is to achieve a fully performing and well-rated A note, we focus on sizing that note to a level that is supported by cash flow available to service debt at current market terms and consistent with our customary underwriting standards. This note structure typically will include a debt coverage ratio of 1.2 or better of cash flow to monthly payments of market interest, and principal amortization of generally not more than 25 years. These metrics are adjusted from time to time based upon changes in long-term markets and “take-out underwriting standards” of our various lines of business. Appropriately sized A notes are more likely to return to accrual status, allowing us to resume recognizing interest income. As the borrower’s payment performance improves, these restructured notes typically also allow for an upgraded internal quality risk rating classification.The B note typically is a structurally subordinate note that may or may not require any debt service until the primary payment source stabilizes and generates excess cash flow. This excess cash flow customarily is captured for application to either the A note or B note dependent upon the terms of the restructure. We evaluate the B note when we consider returning the A note to accrual status. In many cases, the B note is charged off at the same time the A note is returned to accrual status in accordance with our interpretation of accounting and regulatory guidance applicable to TDRs. Alternatively, both A and B notes may be simultaneously returned to accrual if credit metrics are supportive.Restructured nonaccrual loans may be returned to accrual status based on a current, well-documented evaluation of the credit, which would include analysis of the borrower’s financial condition, prospects for repayment under the modified terms, and alternate sources of repayment such as the value of loan collateral. We consider the borrower’s ability to perform under the modified terms for a reasonable period (generally a minimum of six months) before returning the loan to accrual status. Sustained historical repayment performance prior to the restructuring also may be taken into account. The primary consideration for returning a restructured loan to accrual status is the reasonable assurance that the full contractual principal balance of the loan and the ongoing contractually required interest payments will be fully repaid. Although our policy is a guideline, considerable judgment is required to review each borrower’s circumstances.All loans processed as TDRs, including A notes and any non-charged-off B notes, are reported as TDRs during the calendar year in which the restructure took place. At March 31, 2017, we had $86 million of A note commercial TDRs. We did not have any B note commercial TDRs at March 31, 2017.Additional information regarding TDRs is provided in Note 5 (“Asset Quality”).Extensions. Project loans typically are refinanced into the permanent commercial loan market at maturity, but they are often modified and extended. Extension terms take into account the specific circumstances of the client relationship, the status of the project, and near-term prospects for the client, the repayment source, and the collateral. In all cases, pricing and loan structure are reviewed and, where necessary, modified to ensure that the loan has been priced to achieve a market rate of return and loan terms that are appropriate for the risk. Typical enhancements include one or more of the following: principal pay down, increased amortization, additional collateral, increased guarantees, and a cash flow sweep. Some maturing loans have automatic extension options built in; in those cases, pricing and loan terms cannot be altered.104Table of ContentsLoan pricing is determined based on the strength of the borrowing entity, the strength of the guarantor, if any, and the structure and residual risk of the transaction. Therefore, pricing for an extended loan may remain the same because the loan is already priced at or above current market.We do not consider loan extensions in the normal course of business (under existing loan terms or at market rates) as TDRs, particularly when ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt and no concession has been made. In the case of loan extensions where either collection of all principal and interest is uncertain or a concession has been made, we would analyze such credit under the applicable accounting guidance to determine whether it qualifies as a TDR. Extensions that qualify as TDRs are measured for impairment under the applicable accounting guidance. Guarantors. We conduct a detailed guarantor analysis (i) for all new extensions of credit, (ii) at the time of any material modification/extension, and (iii) as part of our ongoing portfolio and loan monitoring procedures, typically annually. This analysis requires the guarantor entity to submit all appropriate financial statements, including balance sheets, income statements, tax returns, and real estate schedules. While the specific steps of each guarantor analysis may vary, the high-level objectives include determining the overall financial conditions of the guarantor entities, including size, quality, and nature of asset base; net worth (adjusted to reflect our opinion of market value); leverage; standing liquidity; recurring cash flow; contingent and direct debt obligations; and near-term debt maturities.Borrower and guarantor financial statements are required at least annually within 90-120 days of the calendar/fiscal year end. Income statements and rent rolls for project collateral are required quarterly. We may require certain information, such as liquidity, certifications, status of asset sales or debt resolutions, and real estate schedules, to be provided more frequently.We routinely seek performance from guarantors of impaired debt if the guarantor is solvent. We may not seek to enforce the guaranty if we are precluded by bankruptcy or we determine that the cost to pursue a guarantor exceeds the value to be returned given the guarantor’s verified financial condition. We often are successful in obtaining either monetary payment or the cooperation of our solvent guarantors to help mitigate loss, cost, and the expense of collections.Consumer loan portfolioConsumer loans outstanding decreased by $311 million, or 1.3%, from December 31, 2016, mostly related to continued decline in the home equity loan portfolio, largely the result of paydowns on home equity lines of credit.The home equity portfolio is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio. Approximately 99% of this portfolio at March 31, 2017, was originated from our Key Community Bank within our 15-state footprint. The remainder of the portfolio, which has been in an exit mode since the fourth quarter of 2007, was originated from the Consumer Finance line of business and is now included in Other Segments. As shown in Figure 15, we held the first lien position for approximately 60% of the Key Community Bank home equity portfolio at March 31, 2017, and 61% at March 31, 2016. At March 31, 2017, 40% of the Key Community Bank home equity portfolio was secured by second lien mortgages. For consumer loans with real estate collateral, we track borrower performance monthly. Regardless of the lien position, credit metrics are refreshed quarterly, including recent FICO scores as well as original and updated loan-to-value ratios. This information is used in establishing the ALLL. Our methodology is described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses” beginning on page 109 of our 2016 Form 10-K.Loans held for saleAs shown in Note 4 (“Loans and Loans Held for Sale”), our loans held for sale increased to $1.4 billion at March 31, 2017, from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2016. At March 31, 2017, loans held for sale included $171 million of commercial and industrial loans, which increased $152 million from December 31, 2016; $1.2 billion of commercial mortgage loans, which increased $128 million from December 31, 2016; $62 million of residential mortgage loans, which were unchanged from December 31, 2016; and $1 million of commercial lease financing, which increased $1 million from December 31, 2016.Loan salesAs shown in Figure 20, during the first three months of 2017, we sold $2 billion of commercial real estate loans, $194 million of residential real estate loans, $83 million of commercial lease financing loans, and $49 million of commercial loans. Most of these sales came from the held-for-sale portfolio; however, $37 million of these loan sales related to the held-to-maturity portfolio.105Table of ContentsLoan sales classified as held for sale generated net gains of $35 million in the first three months of 2017 and are included in “investment banking and debt placement fees” and “other income” on the income statement.Among the factors that we consider in determining which loans to sell are: •our business strategy for particular lending areas;•whether particular lending businesses meet established performance standards or fit with our relationship banking strategy;•our A/LM needs;•the cost of alternative funding sources;•the level of credit risk;•capital requirements; and•market conditions and pricing.Figure 20 summarizes our loan sales for the first three months of 2017 and all of 2016.Figure 20.

Additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in Note 16 (“Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) under the heading “Recourse agreement with FNMA.”We derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold. We earn noninterest income (recorded as “mortgage servicing fees”) from fees for servicing or administering loans. This fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets. In addition, we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing of commercial real estate loans.Securities106Table of ContentsOur securities portfolio totaled $28.6 billion at March 31, 2017, compared to $30.4 billion at December 31, 2016. Available-for-sale securities were $18.4 billion at March 31, 2017, compared to $20.2 billion at December 31, 2016. Held-to-maturity securities were $10.2 billion at March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016.As shown in Figure 22, all of our mortgage-backed securities, which include both securities available for sale and held-to-maturity securities, are issued by government-sponsored enterprises or GNMA and traded in liquid secondary markets. These securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value for the available-for-sale portfolio and at cost for the held-to-maturity portfolio. For more information about these securities, see Note 6 (“Fair Value Measurements”) under the heading “Qualitative Disclosures of Valuation Techniques,” and Note 7 (“Securities”).Figure 22. Mortgage-Backed Securities by Issuer in millionsMarch 31, 2017December 31, 2016FHLMC$5,575$6,415FNMA8,9669,879GNMA13,84513,920Total (a)$28,386$30,214   (a) Includes securities held in the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios.Securities available for saleThe majority of our securities available for sale portfolio consists of federal agency CMOs and mortgage-backed securities. CMOs are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities. These mortgage securities generate interest income, serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements, and provide liquidity value under regulatory requirements. At March 31, 2017, we had $18.2 billion invested in CMOs and other mortgage-backed securities in the available-for-sale portfolio, compared to $20 billion at December 31, 2016.We periodically evaluate our securities available for sale portfolio in light of established A/LM objectives, changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio, the regulatory environment, and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. These evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning.In addition, the size and composition of our securities available for sale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required (or elect) to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits. Although we generally use debt securities for this purpose, other assets, such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit, are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles.Our investing activities continue to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs. Our actions to not reinvest the monthly security cash flows at various times provide the liquidity necessary to address our funding requirements. These funding requirements include ongoing loan growth and occasional debt maturities. At other times, we may make additional investments that go beyond the replacement of maturities or mortgage security cash flows as our liquidity position and/or interest rate risk management strategies may require. Lastly, our focus on investing in high quality liquid assets, including GNMA-related securities, is related to liquidity management strategies to satisfy regulatory requirements.Figure 23 shows the composition, yields, and remaining maturities of our securities available for sale.

Such yields have been adjusted to a TE basis using the statutory federal income tax rate of 35%.108Table of ContentsOther investmentsPrincipal investments — investments in equity and debt instruments made by our principal investing unit — represented 25% of other investments at both March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016. They include direct investments (investments made in a particular company) as well as indirect investments (investments made through funds that include other investors). Principal investments are predominantly made in privately held companies and are carried at fair value. The fair value of the direct investments was $21 million at March 31, 2017, and $27 million at December 31, 2016, while the fair value of the indirect investments was $155 million at March 31, 2017, and $158 million at December 31, 2016. Under the requirements of the Volcker Rule, we will be required to dispose of some or all of our indirect principal investments. The Federal Reserve extended the conformance period to July 21, 2017, for all banking entities with respect to covered funds. On January 13, 2017, Key filed for an additional extension for illiquid funds, to retain certain indirect investments until the earlier of the date on which the investment is conformed or is expected to mature, or July 21, 2022. The application for an extension was approved on February 14, 2017. As of March 31, 2017, we have not committed to a plan to sell these investments. Therefore, these investments continue to be valued using the net asset value per share methodology. For more information about the Volcker Rule, see the discussion in Item 1 under the heading “Other Regulatory Developments under the Dodd-Frank Act — ‘Volcker Rule’” in the section entitled “Supervision and Regulation” beginning on page 16 of our 2016 Form 10-K.In addition to principal investments, “other investments” include real estate-related investments that are carried at fair value, as well as other types of investments that generally are carried at cost. The real estate-related investments were valued at $2 million at March 31, 2017, and $6 million at December 31, 2016. Additional information pertaining to the equity investment is included in the “Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis” section of Note 6 (“Fair Value Measurements”).Most of our other investments are not traded on an active market. We determine the fair value at which these investments should be recorded based on the nature of the specific investment and all available relevant information. This review may encompass such factors as the issuer’s past financial performance and future potential, the values of public companies in comparable businesses, the risks associated with the particular business or investment type, current market conditions, the nature and duration of resale restrictions, the issuer’s payment history, our knowledge of the industry, third-party data, and other relevant factors. During the first three months of 2017, net gains from our principal investing activities (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) totaled $1 million, which includes $3 million of net unrealized losses. These net gains are recorded as “net gains (losses) from principal investing” on the income statement. Additional information regarding these investments is provided in Note 6 (“Fair Value Measurements”).Deposits and other sources of fundsDomestic deposits are our primary source of funding. The composition of our average deposits is shown in Figure 7 in the section entitled “Net interest income.” During the first quarter of 2017, average domestic deposits were $102.1 billion, compared to $71.6 billion during the first quarter of 2016. The increase reflected the acquisition of First Niagara and core deposit growth in Key’s retail banking franchise. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, average deposits decreased by $2.6 billion, largely driven by a decline in escrow deposits and both seasonal and short-term commercial deposit outflows. On a period-end basis, total deposits decreased $105 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 as the decline in escrow deposits was partially offset by core deposit growth in Key’s retail banking franchise. As of March 31, 2017, period-end deposits represented 85.6% of the funds we used to support loans and other earning assets, compared to 85.2% at December 31, 2016.Wholesale funds, consisting of short-term borrowings, averaged $2.6 billion during the first quarter of 2017, compared to $1 billion during the first quarter of 2016. The change from the first quarter of 2016 was caused by increases of $358 million in federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements, and $1.2 billion in bank notes and other short-term borrowings.CapitalAt March 31, 2017, our shareholders’ equity was $15 billion, down $264 million from December 31, 2016. The following sections discuss certain factors that contributed to this change. For other factors that contributed to the change, see the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity and Note 18 (“Shareholders' Equity”).CCAR and capital actions As part of its ongoing supervisory process, the Federal Reserve requires BHCs like KeyCorp to submit an annual comprehensive capital plan and to update that plan to reflect material changes in the BHC’s risk profile, business strategies, or 109Table of Contentscorporate structure, including but not limited to changes in planned capital actions. In April 2016, we submitted to the Federal Reserve and provided to the OCC our 2016 capital plan under the annual CCAR process. On June 29, 2016, the Federal Reserve announced that it did not object to our 2016 capital plan. Share repurchases of up to $350 million were included in the 2016 capital plan, which is effective through the second quarter of 2017. We completed $160 million of Common Share repurchases, including $107 million of Common Share repurchases in the open market and $53 million of Common Share repurchases related to employee equity compensation programs in the first quarter of 2017 under this authorization. DividendsAs previously reported, our 2015 capital plan proposed an increase in our quarterly Common Share dividend from $.075 to $.085 per share, which was approved by our Board in May 2016. An additional potential increase in our quarterly Common Share dividend, up to $.095 per share, will be considered by the Board for the second quarter of 2017, consistent with the 2016 capital plan. Other changes to future dividends may be evaluated by the Board based upon our earnings, financial condition, and other factors, including regulatory review. Further information regarding the capital planning process and CCAR is included under the heading “Capital planning and stress testing” in the “Supervision and Regulation” section beginning on page 12 of our 2016 Form 10-K.Consistent with the 2016 capital plan, we made a dividend payment of $.085 per share, or $90 million, on our Common Shares during the first quarter of 2017.During the first quarter of 2017, we made the following dividend payments on our preferred stock:•$1.9375 per share, or $6 million, on our Series A Preferred Stock;•$.539063 per share, or $7 million, on our Series C Preferred Stock;•$12.50 per depositary share, or $7 million, on the depositary shares related to our Series D Preferred Stock; and•$.395573 per depositary share, or $8 million, on the depositary shares related to our Series E Preferred Stock.Preferred sharesOn February 15, 2017, our Series C Preferred Stock was redeemed for cash at a redemption price of $25 per share. The Series C Preferred Stock was initially issued in connection with the First Niagara acquisition to replace First Niagara’s outstanding preferred stock.On March 9, 2017, we provided notice of our intention to convert the Series A Preferred Stock into Common Shares on March 20, 2017. On March 20, 2017, each outstanding share of Series A Preferred Stock was converted into 7.0922 Common Shares. Cash was paid in lieu of fractional shares.Common shares outstandingOur Common Shares are traded on the NYSE under the symbol KEY with 43,129 holders of record at March 31, 2017. Our book value per Common Share was $12.71 based on 1.097 billion shares outstanding at March 31, 2017, compared to $12.58 per Common Share based on 1.079 billion shares outstanding at December 31, 2016. At March 31, 2017, our tangible book value per Common Share was $10.21, compared to $9.99 per Common Share at December 31, 2016.Figure 25 shows activities that caused the change in outstanding common shares over the past five quarters.Figure 25.

This increase was primarily due to the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock into Common Shares during the first quarter of 2017 which added approximately 21 million Common Shares outstanding as disclosed above.110Table of ContentsAt March 31, 2017, we had 159.2 million treasury shares, compared to 177.4 million treasury shares at December 31, 2016. Going forward we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stock-based compensation awards and for other corporate purposes.Information on repurchases of Common Shares by KeyCorp is included in Part II, Item 2. “Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds” of this report.Capital adequacyCapital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance. All of KeyCorp’s capital ratios remained in excess of regulatory requirements at March 31, 2017. Our capital and liquidity levels are intended to position us to weather an adverse credit cycle while continuing to serve our clients’ needs, as well as to meet the Regulatory Capital Rules described in the “Supervision and regulation” section of Item 2 of this report. Our shareholders’ equity to assets ratio was 11.14% at March 31, 2017, compared to 11.17% at December 31, 2016. Our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.51% at March 31, 2017, compared to 8.09% at December 31, 2016.The capital modifications mandated by the Regulatory Capital Rules, which became effective on January 1, 2015, for KeyCorp, require higher and better-quality capital and introduced a new capital measure, “Common Equity Tier 1.” The Rules phased outthe treatment of certain capital securities and cumulative preferred securities as eligible Tier 1 capital. The phase-out period, which began January 1, 2015, for “standardized approach” banking organizations such as KeyCorp, resulted in our trust preferred securities issued by the KeyCorp capital trusts and acquired from First Niagara, being treated only as Tier 2 capital starting in 2016. The new minimum capital and leverage ratios under the Regulatory Capital Rules, together with the estimated ratios of KeyCorp at March 31, 2017, calculated on a fully phased-in basis, are set forth under the heading “New minimum capital and leverage ratio requirements” in the “Supervision and regulation” section in Item 2 of this report.As of January 1, 2016, KeyCorp (and its banking subsidiaries) were each required to maintain, on a consolidated basis, a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. At March 31, 2017, our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, and Tier 1 leverage ratio were 10.74%, 12.69%, and 9.81%, respectively, compared to 10.89%, 12.85%, and 9.90%, respectively, at December 31, 2016. Information regarding the regulatory capital ratios of KeyCorp’s banking subsidiaries is presented annually, in Note 23 (“Shareholders’ Equity”) beginning on page 198 of our 2016 Form 10-K.Common Equity Tier 1 is not formally defined by GAAP and is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. Figure 6 in the “Highlights of Our Performance” section reconciles Key shareholders’ equity, the GAAP performance measure, to Common Equity Tier 1, the corresponding non-GAAP measure. Beginning with the implementation of the Regulatory Capital Rules, deferred tax assets that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are deductible from Common Equity Tier 1 on a phase-in basis. As of March 31, 2017, this balance was $11 million. As of January 1, 2016, KeyCorp (and its banking subsidiaries) were each required to maintain, on a consolidated basis, a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%. Our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 9.91% and 9.54% at March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively.111Table of Contents Figure 26.

The most significant risks we face are credit, compliance, operational, liquidity, market, reputation, strategic, and model risks. Our risk management activities are focused on ensuring that we properly identify, measure, and manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness, and to maximize profitability.The Board serves in an oversight capacity, ensuring that Key’s risks are managed in a manner that is not only effective and balanced, but also adds value for the shareholders. The Board understands Key’s risk philosophy, approves the risk appetite, inquires about risk practices, reviews the portfolio of risks, compares the actual risks to the risk appetite, and is apprised of significant risks, both actual and emerging, and determines whether management is responding appropriately. The Board challenges management and ensures accountability.The Board’s Audit Committee assists the Board in oversight of financial statement integrity, regulatory and legal requirements, independent auditors’ qualifications and independence, and the performance of the internal audit function and independent auditors. The Audit Committee meets with management and approves significant policies relating to the risk areas overseen by 112Table of Contentsthe Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has responsibility over all risk review functions, including internal audit, as well as financial reporting, legal matters, and fraud risk. The Audit Committee also receives reports on enterprise risk. In addition to regularly scheduled bi-monthly meetings, the Audit Committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases.The Board’s Risk Committee assists the Board in oversight of strategies, policies, procedures, and practices relating to the assessment and management of enterprise-wide risk, including credit, market, liquidity, model, operational, compliance, reputation, and strategic risks. The Risk Committee also assists the Board in overseeing risks related to capital adequacy, capital planning, and capital actions. The Risk Committee reviews and provides oversight of management’s activities related to the enterprise-wide risk management framework, which includes review of the ERM Policy, including the Risk Appetite Statement, and management and ERM reports. The Risk Committee also approves any material changes to the charter of the ERM Committee and significant policies relating to risk management.The Audit and Risk Committees meet jointly, as appropriate, to discuss matters that relate to each committee’s responsibilities. Committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting. All members of the Board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months.Our ERM Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer and comprising other senior level executives, is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite. The ERM Program encompasses our risk philosophy, policy, framework, and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company. The ERM Committee reports to the Board’s Risk Committee. Annually, the Board reviews and approves the ERM Policy, as well as the risk appetite, including corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories. We use a risk-adjusted capital framework to manage risks. This framework is approved and managed by the ERM Committee.Tier 2 Risk Governance Committees support the ERM Committee by identifying early warning events and trends, escalating emerging risks, and discussing forward-looking assessments. Risk Governance Committees include attendees from each of the Three Lines of Defense. The First Line of Defense is the line of business primarily responsible to accept, own, proactively identify, monitor, and manage risk. The Second Line of Defense comprises Risk Management representatives who provide independent, centralized oversight over all risk categories by aggregating, analyzing, and reporting risk information. Risk Review, our internal audit function, provides the Third Line of Defense in its role to provide independent assessment and testing of the effectiveness of, appropriateness of, and adherence to KeyCorp’s risk management policies, practices, and controls. The Chief Risk Officer ensures that relevant risk information is properly integrated into strategic and business decisions, ensures appropriate ownership of risks, provides input into performance and compensation decisions, assesses aggregate enterprise risk, monitors capabilities to manage critical risks, and executes appropriate Board and stakeholder reporting.Federal banking regulators continue to emphasize with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution. We believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks, and conform to regulatory expectations.Market risk managementMarket risk is the risk that movements in market risk factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, credit spreads, and volatilities will reduce Key’s income and the value of its portfolios. These factors influence prospective yields, values, or prices associated with the instrument. For example, the value of a fixed-rate bond will decline when market interest rates increase, while the cash flows associated with a variable rate loan will increase when interest rates increase. The holder of a financial instrument is exposed to market risk when either the cash flows or the value of the instrument is tied to such external factors.We are exposed to market risk both in our trading and nontrading activities, which include asset and liability management activities. Our trading positions are carried at fair value with changes recorded in the income statement. These positions are subject to various market-based risk factors that affect the fair value of the financial instruments in the trading category. Our traditional banking loan and deposit products, as well as long-term debt and certain short-term borrowings are nontrading positions. These positions are generally carried at the principal amount outstanding for assets and the amount owed for liabilities. The nontrading positions are subject to changes in economic value due to varying market conditions, primarily changes in interest rates.113Table of ContentsTrading market riskKey incurs market risk as a result of trading, investing, and client facilitation activities, principally within our investment banking and capital markets businesses. Key has exposures to a wide range of interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and commodity prices, as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads. Our primary market risk exposures are a result of trading activities in the derivative and fixed income markets, and of maintaining positions in these instruments. We maintain modest trading inventories to facilitate customer flow, make markets in securities, and hedge certain risks. The majority of our positions are traded in active markets.Management of trading market risks. Market risk management is an integral part of Key’s risk culture. The Risk Committee of our Board provides oversight of trading market risks. The ERM Committee and the Market Risk Committee regularly review and discuss market risk reports prepared by our MRM that contain our market risk exposures and results of monitoring activities. Market risk policies and procedures have been defined and approved by the Market Risk Committee, a Tier 2 Risk Governance Committee, and take into account our tolerance for risk and consideration for the business environment.The MRM is an independent risk management function that partners with the lines of business to identify, measure, and monitor market risks throughout our company. The MRM is responsible for ensuring transparency of significant market risks, monitoring compliance with established limits, and escalating limit exceptions to appropriate senior management. The various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well-managed and prudent. Market risk is monitored through various measures, such as VaR, and through routine stress testing, sensitivity, and scenario analyses. The MRM conducts stress tests for each covered position using historical worst case and standard shock scenarios. VaR, stressed VaR, and other analyses are prepared daily and distributed to appropriate management.Covered positions. We monitor the market risk of our covered positions, which includes all of our trading positions as well as all foreign exchange and commodity positions, regardless of whether the position is in a trading account. All positions in the trading account are recorded at fair value, and changes in fair value are reflected in our consolidated statements of income. Information regarding our fair value policies, procedures, and methodologies is provided in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Fair Value Measurements” on page 110 of our 2016 Form 10-K and Note 6 (“Fair Value Measurements”) in this report. Instruments that are used to hedge nontrading activities, such as bank-issued debt and loan portfolios, equity positions that are not actively traded, and securities financing activities, do not meet the definition of a covered position. The MRM is responsible for identifying our portfolios as either covered or noncovered. The Covered Position Working Group develops the final list of covered positions, and a summary is provided to the Market Risk Committee.Our significant portfolios of covered positions are detailed below. We analyze market risk by portfolios of covered positions, and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type. The descriptions below incorporate the respective risk types associated with each of these portfolios. •Fixed income includes those instruments associated with our capital markets business and the trading of securities as a dealer. These instruments may include positions in municipal bonds, bonds backed by the U.S. government, agency and corporate bonds, certain mortgage-backed securities, securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, money markets, and certain CMOs. The activities and instruments within the fixed income portfolio create exposures to interest rate and credit spread risks.•Interest rate derivatives include interest rate swaps, caps, and floors, which are transacted primarily to accommodate the needs of commercial loan clients. In addition, we enter into interest rate derivatives to offset or mitigate the interest rate risk related to the client positions. The activities within this portfolio create exposures to interest rate risk.•Credit derivatives generally include credit default swap indices, which are used to manage the credit risk exposure associated with anticipated sales of certain commercial real estate loans. The transactions within the credit derivatives portfolio result in exposure to counterparty credit risk and market risk.VaR and stressed VaR. VaR is the estimate of the maximum amount of loss on an instrument or portfolio due to adverse market conditions during a given time interval within a stated confidence level. Stressed VaR is used to assess extreme conditions on market risk within our trading portfolios. MRM calculates VaR and stressed VaR on a daily basis, and the results are distributed to appropriate management. VaR and stressed VaR results are also provided to our regulators and utilized in regulatory capital calculations.We use a historical VaR model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions. Historical scenarios are customized for specific covered positions, and numerous risk factors are incorporated in the calculation. Additional consideration is given to the risk 114Table of Contentsfactors to estimate the exposures that contain optionality features, such as options and cancelable provisions. VaR is calculated using daily observations over a one-year time horizon, and approximates a 95% confidence level. Statistically, this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than VaR, on average, five out of 100 trading days, or three to four times each quarter. We also calculate VaR and stressed VaR at a 99% confidence level.The VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of possible gains and losses on our covered positions. However, there are limitations inherent in the VaR model since it uses historical results over a given time interval to estimate future performance. Historical results may not be indicative of future results, and changes in the market or composition of our portfolios could have a significant impact on the accuracy of the VaR model. We regularly review and enhance the modeling techniques, inputs and assumptions used. Our market risk policy includes the independent validation of our VaR model by Key’s Risk Management Group on an annual basis. The Model Risk Management Committee oversees the Model Validation Program, and results of validations are discussed with the ERM Committee.Actual losses for the total covered positions did not exceed aggregate daily VaR on any day during the quarters ended March 31, 2017, and March 31, 2016. The MRM backtests our VaR model on a daily basis to evaluate its predictive power. The test compares VaR model results at the 99% confidence level to daily held profit and loss. Results of backtesting are provided to the Market Risk Committee. Backtesting exceptions occur when trading losses exceed VaR. We do not engage in correlation trading, or utilize the internal model approach for measuring default and credit migration risk. Our net VaR approach incorporates diversification, but our VaR calculation does not include the impact of counterparty risk and our own credit spreads on derivatives.The aggregate VaR at the 99% confidence level for all covered positions was $2 million at March 31, 2017, and $1 million at March 31, 2016. The increase in aggregate VaR was primarily due to the increased exposure in our fixed income and CMBS portfolios. Figure 27 summarizes our VaR at the 99% confidence level for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and March 31, 2016. During these periods, none of our significant portfolios daily trading VaR numbers exceeded their VaR limits or stress VaR limits.Figure 27.

Market risk is a component of our internal capital adequacy assessment. Our risk-weighted assets include a market risk-equivalent asset position, which consists of a VaR component, stressed VaR component, a de minimis exposure amount, and a specific risk add-on, which are added together to arrive at total market risk equivalent assets. Specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments, which is not accounted for by changes in broad market risk factors and is measured through a standardized approach. Specific risk calculations are run quarterly by the MRM, and approved by the Chief Market Risk Officer.115Table of ContentsNontrading market riskMost of our nontrading market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations and its impacts on our traditional loan and deposit products, as well as investments, hedging relationships, long-term debt, and certain short-term borrowings. Interest rate risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the EVE. Such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. We manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the EVE in accordance with our risk appetite and within Board-approved policy limits.Interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of customer preferences for loan and deposit products, economic conditions, the competitive environment within our markets, changes in market interest rates that affect client activity, and our hedging, investing, funding, and capital positions. The primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of reprice risk, basis risk, yield curve risk, and option risk.•Reprice risk is the exposure to changes in the level of interest rates and occurs when the volume of interest-bearing liabilities and the volume of interest-earning assets they fund (e.g., deposits used to fund loans) do not mature or reprice at the same time.•Basis risk is the exposure to asymmetrical changes in interest rate indices and occurs when floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities reprice at the same time, but in response to different market factors or indices.•Yield curve risk is the exposure to nonparallel changes in the slope of the yield curve (where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity) and occurs when interest-bearing liabilities and the interest-earning assets that they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve.•Option risk is the exposure to a customer or counterparty’s ability to take advantage of the interest rate environment and terminate or reprice one of our assets, liabilities, or off-balance sheet instruments prior to contractual maturity without a penalty. Option risk occurs when exposures to customer and counterparty early withdrawals or prepayments are not mitigated with an offsetting position or appropriate compensation.The management of nontrading market risk is centralized within Corporate Treasury. The Risk Committee of our Board provides oversight of nontrading market risk. The ERM Committee and the ALCO review reports on the components of interest rate risk described above as well as sensitivity analyses of these exposures. These committees have various responsibilities related to managing nontrading market risk, including recommending, approving, and monitoring strategies that maintain risk positions within approved tolerance ranges. The A/LM policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of interest rate risk and is administered by the ALCO. Internal and external emerging issues are monitored on a daily basis. The MRM, as the second line of defense, provides additional oversight.Net interest income simulation analysis. The primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis. For purposes of this analysis, we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on- and off-balance sheet positions, accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity. The analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments, and balance sheet growth projections based on a most likely macroeconomic view. While simulation modeling assumes that residual risk exposures are managed within the risk appetite and Board approved policy limits, the results also reflect management’s desired interest rate risk positioning. Achieving the current modeled position typically requires purchases of investment securities to replace security cash flows and the execution of new interest rate swaps to replace maturing interest rate swaps. The simulation model estimates the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if interest rates were to gradually increase or decrease over the next 12 months. Our standard rate scenarios encompass a gradual, parallel increase or decrease of 200 basis points, but due to the low interest rate environment, we have modified the standard decrease scenario to a gradual, parallel decrease of 100 basis points over six months with no change over the following six months. After calculating the amount of net interest income at risk to interest rate changes, we compare that amount with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment.Figure 29 presents the results of the simulation analysis at March 31, 2017, and March 31, 2016. At March 31, 2017, our simulated impact to changes in interest rates was modestly asset-sensitive. Tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual, parallel 200 basis point increase or 100 basis point decrease in interest rates over the next 12 months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 5.5%. In March 2017, the Federal Reserve increased the range for the 116Table of ContentsFederal Funds Target Rate, which led to an increase in the magnitude of the declining rate scenario to 100 basis points. As a result of the change, our modeled exposure to declining rates increased. The modeled exposure depends on the relationships of interest rates on our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. As shown in Figure 29, we are operating within these levels as of March 31, 2017.Figure 29. Simulated Change in Net Interest Income March 31, 2017    Basis point change assumption (short-term rates)-100 +200 Tolerance level-5.50%-5.50%Interest rate risk assessment-4.03%1.05%March 31, 2016    Basis point change assumption (short-term rates)-50 +200 Tolerance level-4.00%-4.00%Interest rate risk assessment-3.19%2.23%Simulation analysis produces a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on judgments related to assumptions input into the model. We tailor certain assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled, and validate those assumptions on a regular basis. However, actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition, customer behavior, product pricing, market interest rates, changes in management’s desired interest rate risk positioning, investment, funding and hedging activities, and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events.We also perform regular stress tests and sensitivity analyses on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments. Assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve, including steepening or flattening of the yield curve, changes in credit spreads, immediate changes in market interest rates, and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates. Assessments are also performed on changes to the following assumptions: loan and deposit balances, the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities, changes in lending spreads, prepayments on loans and securities, investment, funding and hedging activities, and liquidity and capital management strategies.The results of additional assessments indicate that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results presented in Figure 29. Net interest income is highly dependent on the timing, magnitude, frequency, and path of interest rate increases and the associated assumptions for deposit repricing relationships, lending spreads, and the balance behavior of transaction accounts. The modeling is sensitive to the volume of fixed-rate assets and liabilities incorporated. The modeling currently assumes approximately $23.5 billion of investment security purchases and swap executions over the next three years. For every immediate reduction in fixed-rate assets of $1 billion, the modeled benefit to rising rates would increase by approximately 30 basis points. The low level of interest rates increases the uncertainty of assumptions for deposit balance behavior and deposit repricing relationships to market interest rates. Our historical deposit repricing betas in the last rising rate cycle ranged between 50% and 60% for interest-bearing deposits, and we continue to make similar assumptions in our modeling, with the modeled betas varying by customer segment and product type. Recent deposit repricing has been lower than our modeled assumptions. In the modeling, if the deposit beta for the first 25 basis point increase in the Federal Funds Target Rate was zero, then returned to the standard modeled betas for the next 175 basis points of rate increases, our modeled asset sensitive benefit would increase by approximately 200 basis points. The sensitivity testing of assumptions supports our confidence that actual results are likely to be within 100 basis points of modeled results.Our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume, mix, maturity, and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows. Treasury discretionary activities related to funding, investing, and hedging may also change as a result of changes in customer business flows, or changes in management’s desired interest rate risk positioning. As changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy, management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile.We also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a three-year horizon. These simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a 12-month horizon. To capture longer-term exposures, we calculate exposures to changes of the EVE as discussed in the following section.Economic value of equity modeling. EVE complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond 12-, 24-, and 36-month horizons. EVE modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates, measuring the resulting change in the 117Table of Contentsvalues of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet instruments, and comparing those amounts with the base case of the current interest rate environment. Because the calculation of EVE under an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest rates in the current low rate environment results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than 200 basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points, we have modified the standard declining rate scenario to an immediate 100 basis point decrease. This analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with non-contractual maturities. Those assumptions are based on historical behaviors, as well as our expectations. We develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our EVE will decrease by more than 15% in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates. We are operating within these guidelines as of March 31, 2017.Management of interest rate exposure. We use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate A/LM strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures. Specifically, we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities, issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates, and using derivatives — predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps, which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities.Figure 30 shows all swap positions that we hold for A/LM purposes. These positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. For example, fixed-rate debt is converted to a floating rate through a “receive fixed/pay variable” interest rate swap. The volume, maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader A/LM objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile, see Note 8 (“Derivatives and Hedging Activities”).Figure 30.

Liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions.Governance structureWe manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis. This approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity, as well as each entity’s capacity to manage through adverse conditions. The approach also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding.The management of consolidated liquidity risk is centralized within Corporate Treasury. Oversight and governance is provided by the Board, the ERM Committee, the ALCO, and the Chief Risk Officer. The Asset Liability Management Policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of liquidity risk and is administered by the ALCO. The MRM, as the Second Line of Defense, provides additional oversight. Our current liquidity risk management practices are in compliance with the Federal Reserve’s Enhanced Prudential Standards and the OCC’s Heightened Standards for Large Insured National Banks.These committees regularly review liquidity and funding summaries, liquidity trends, peer comparisons, variance analyses, liquidity projections, hypothetical funding erosion stress tests, and goal tracking reports. The reviews generate a discussion of positions, trends, and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of our decisions. When liquidity pressure is elevated, 118Table of Contentspositions are monitored more closely and reporting is more intensive. To ensure that emerging issues are identified, we also communicate with individuals inside and outside of the company on a daily basis.Factors affecting liquidityOur liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events. An example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency. Examples of indirect events (events unrelated to us) that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war, natural disasters, political events, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund or hedge fund. Similarly, market speculation, or rumors about us or the banking industry in general, may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources.Our credit ratings at March 31, 2017, are shown in Figure 31. We believe these credit ratings, under normal conditions in the capital markets, would enable KeyCorp or KeyBank to issue fixed income securities to investors. Figure 31.

Liquidity risk is also derived from our deposit gathering activities and the ability of our customers to withdraw funds that do not have a stated maturity or to withdraw funds before their contractual maturity. The assessments of liquidity risk are measured under the assumption of normal operating conditions as well as under a stressed environment. We manage these exposures in accordance with our risk appetite, and within Board-approved policy limits.We regularly monitor our liquidity position and funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of hypothetical scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding. In the normal course of business, we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both KeyCorp and KeyBank. In a “heightened monitoring mode,” we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently, and use assumptions to reflect the changed market environment. Our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies. Erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods. Ultimately, they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations. To compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures, we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed.We maintain a Contingency Funding Plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis. The plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions. It also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for managing liquidity through a problem period. As part of the plan, we maintain on-balance sheet liquid reserves referred to as our liquid asset portfolio, which consists of high quality liquid assets. During a problem period, that reserve could be used as a source of funding to provide time to develop and execute a longer-term strategy. The liquid asset portfolio at March 31, 2017, totaled $22.2 billion, consisting of $19.6 billion of unpledged securities, $383 million of securities available for secured funding at the FHLB, and $2.2 billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our Federal Reserve account. The liquid asset portfolio can fluctuate due to excess liquidity, heightened risk, or prefunding of expected outflows, such as debt maturities. Additionally, as of March 31, 2017, our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was $23.5 billion at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and $6.2 billion at the FHLB. During the first quarter of 2017, Key’s outstanding FHLB of Cincinnati advances were reduced by $1 million due to repayments.119Table of ContentsFinal U.S. liquidity coverage ratioUnder the Liquidity Coverage Rules, we are required to calculate the Modified LCR for Key. For the first quarter of 2017, our Modified LCR was above 100%. In the future, we may change the composition of our investment portfolio, increase the size of the overall investment portfolio, and modify product offerings to enhance or optimize our liquidity position.Additional information about the LCR is included in the “Supervision and regulation” section under the heading “Liquidity requirements” in Item 2 of this report.Long-term liquidity strategyOur long-term liquidity strategy is to be predominantly funded by core deposits. However, we may use wholesale funds to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio, meet daily cash demands, and allow management flexibility to execute business initiatives. Key’s client-based relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base that, in conjunction with intermediate and long-term wholesale funds managed to a diversified maturity structure and investor base, supports our liquidity risk management strategy. We use the loan-to-deposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies. Our target loan-to-deposit ratio is 90-100% (at March 31, 2017, our loan-to-deposit ratio was 86%) which we calculate as total loans, loans held for sale, and nonsecuritized discontinued loans, divided by domestic deposits.Sources of liquidityOur primary sources of liquidity include customer deposits, wholesale funding, and liquid assets. If the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances, we rely on wholesale funding or on-balance sheet liquid reserves. Conversely, excess cash generated by operating, investing, and deposit-gathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets.Liquidity programsWe have several liquidity programs, which are described in Note 19 (“Long-Term Debt”) beginning on page 191 of our 2016 Form 10-K, that are designed to enable KeyCorp and KeyBank to raise funds in the public and private debt markets. The proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. These liquidity programs are reviewed from time to time by the Board and are renewed and replaced as necessary. There are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs.Liquidity for KeyCorp The primary source of liquidity for KeyCorp is from subsidiary dividends, primarily from KeyBank. KeyCorp has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt, support customary corporate operations and activities (including acquisitions), support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries’ obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, and without adverse consequences, and pay dividends to shareholders.We use a parent cash coverage months metric as the primary measure to assess parent company liquidity. The parent cash coverage months metric measures the months into the future where projected obligations can be met with the current amount of liquidity. KeyCorp generally issues term debt to supplement dividends from KeyBank to manage our liquidity position at or above our targeted levels. The parent company generally maintains cash in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over at least the next 24 months. At March 31, 2017, KeyCorp held $2.3 billion in cash, which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations, including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our risk tolerance.Typically, KeyCorp meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from KeyBank and other non-bank subsidiaries, supplemented with term debt. Federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval. A national bank’s dividend-paying capacity is affected by several factors, including net profits (as defined by statute) for the two previous calendar years and for the current year, up to the date of dividend declaration. During the first quarter of 2017, KeyBank paid $125 million in dividends to KeyCorp. As of March 31, 2017, KeyBank had regulatory capacity to pay $435 million in dividends to KeyCorp without prior regulatory approval.120Table of ContentsOur liquidity position and recent activityOver the past quarter, our liquid asset portfolio, which includes overnight and short-term investments, as well as unencumbered, high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios, has decreased as a result of a decrease in unpledged securities. The liquid asset portfolio continues to exceed the amount that we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a longer-term solution.From time to time, KeyCorp or KeyBank may seek to retire, repurchase, or exchange outstanding debt, capital securities, preferred shares, or Common Shares through cash purchase, privately negotiated transactions or other means. Additional information on repurchases of Common Shares by KeyCorp is included in Part II, Item 2. “Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds” of this report and in Part II, Item 5. “Market for the Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” on page 28 of our 2016 Form 10-K. Such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity and capital requirements, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material, individually or collectively.We generate cash flows from operations and from investing and financing activities. We have approximately $171 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments in international tax jurisdictions as of March 31, 2017. As we consider alternative long-term strategic and liquidity plans, opportunities to repatriate these amounts would result in approximately $3 million in taxes to be paid. We have included the appropriate amount as a deferred tax liability at March 31, 2017.The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2017, and March 31, 2016.Credit risk managementCredit risk is the risk of loss arising from an obligor’s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms. Like other financial services institutions, we make loans, extend credit, purchase securities, and enter into financial derivative contracts, all of which have related credit risk.Credit policy, approval, and evaluationWe manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program. The Credit Risk Committee and the Commercial Credit Policy Committee approve retail and commercial credit policies. Significant policies are reviewed periodically with our Executive Risk Management Committee and the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors on a prescribed schedule. These policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit.Our credit risk management team and individuals within our lines of business to whom credit risk management has delegated authority are responsible for credit approval. Individuals with assigned credit authority are authorized to grant exceptions to credit policies. It is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate, however, a corporate tolerance has been established to keep exceptions at an acceptable level based upon portfolio and economic considerations.Most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or scoring. Loan grades are assigned to commercial loans at the time of origination, verified by the credit risk management team and periodically reevaluated thereafter. This risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling. Commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings. The first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation; the second rating reflects expected loss rates on the credit facility. Default probability is determined based on, among other factors, the financial strength of the borrower, an assessment of the borrower’s management, the borrower’s competitive position within its industry sector, and our view of industry risk within the context of the general economic outlook. Types of exposure, transaction structure and collateral, including credit risk mitigants, affect the expected loss assessment.Our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans. These models, known as scorecards, forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant. The scorecards are embedded in the application processing system, which allows for real-time scoring and automated decisions for many of our products. We periodically validate the loan grading and scoring processes.We maintain an active concentration management program to monitor concentration risk in our credit portfolios. For aggregate credit relationships, we employ a sliding scale of exposure, known as hold limits, which is dictated by the type of loan and 121Table of Contentsstrength of the borrower. Our legal lending limit is approximately $2.1 billion. However, internal hold limits generally restrict the largest exposures to less than 20% of that amount. As of March 31, 2017, we had seven client relationships with loan commitments net of credit default swaps of more than $200 million. The average amount outstanding on these seven individual net obligor commitments was $72 million at March 31, 2017. In general, our philosophy is to maintain a diverse portfolio with regard to credit exposures.We actively manage the overall loan portfolio in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives and concentration risk tolerances to mitigate excess portfolio credit risk. We utilize credit default swaps on a limited basis to transfer a portion of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit to a third party. At March 31, 2017, we used credit default swaps with a notional amount of $191 million to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending obligations. We may also sell credit derivatives — primarily single name credit default swaps — to offset our purchased credit default swap position prior to maturity. At March 31, 2017, we did not have any sold credit default swaps outstanding.Credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Related gains or losses, as well as the premium paid or received for credit protection, are included in the “corporate services income” and “other income” components of noninterest income.Allowance for loan and lease lossesAt March 31, 2017, the ALLL was $870 million, or 1.01% of period-end loans, compared to $858 million, or 1.00%, at December 31, 2016. The allowance includes $39 million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of $469 million at March 31, 2017, compared to $37 million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of $501 million at December 31, 2016. For more information about impaired loans, see Note 5 (“Asset Quality”). At March 31, 2017, the ALLL was 151.8% of nonperforming loans, compared to 137.3% at December 31, 2016.Selected asset quality statistics for each of the past five quarters are presented in Figure 32. The factors that drive these statistics are discussed in the remainder of this section.Figure 32.

The methodology used is described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses” beginning on page 109 of our 2016 Form 10-K. Briefly, our allowance applies expected loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics. We exercise judgment to assess any adjustment to the expected loss rates for the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions, lending policies including underwriting standards, and the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets.For all commercial and consumer loan TDRs, regardless of size, as well as impaired commercial loans with an outstanding balance of $2.5 million or greater, we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss content and assign a specific allowance to the loan. We estimate the extent of the individual impairment for commercial loans and TDRs by comparing the recorded investment of the loan with the estimated present value of its future cash flows, the fair value of its underlying collateral, or the loan’s observable market price. Secured consumer loan TDRs that are discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not formally re-affirmed are adjusted to reflect the fair value of the underlying collateral, less costs to sell. 122Table of ContentsOther consumer loan TDRs are combined in homogenous pools and assigned a specific allocation based on the estimated present value of future cash flows using the effective interest rate. A specific allowance also may be assigned — even when sources of repayment appear sufficient — if we remain uncertain about whether the loan will be repaid in full. On at least a quarterly basis, we evaluate the appropriateness of our loss estimation methods to reduce differences between estimated incurred losses and actual losses. The ALLL at March 31, 2017, represents our best estimate of the probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date.As shown in Figure 33, our ALLL from continuing operations increased by $12 million, or 1.4%, from December 31, 2016. Our allowance applies expected loss rates to our existing loans with similar risk characteristics as well as any adjustments to reflect our current assessment of qualitative factors, such as changes in economic conditions, underwriting standards, and concentrations of credit. Our commercial ALLL increased by $11 million, or 1.5%, from December 31, 2016, primarily because of loan growth in certain segments of the commercial loan portfolio as well as credit quality migration. Our consumer ALLL increased from December 31, 2016. Our consumer ALLL increased by $1 million, or .7%, from December 31, 2016, reflecting a provision in excess of net loan charge-offs of $1 million.Our liability for credit losses on lending-related commitments decreased by $7 million from December 31, 2016, to $48 million at March 31, 2017. When combined with our ALLL, our total allowance for credit losses represented 1.07% of period-end loans at March 31, 2017, compared to 1.06% at December 31, 2016.Figure 33.

Compared to the first three months of 2016, oil and gas prices have stabilized, leading to improved credit quality metrics. We continue to reduce our exposure in our higher-risk businesses, including the residential properties portion of our construction loan portfolio, marine/RV financing, and other selected leasing portfolios through the sale of certain loans, payments from borrowers, or net loan charge-offs.Net loan charge-offs Net loan charge-offs for the first quarter of 2017 totaled $58 million, or .27% of average loans, compared to net loan charge-offs of $46 million, or .31%, for the same period last year. Figure 34 shows the trend in our net loan charge-offs by loan type, while the composition of loan charge-offs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in Figure 35.Over the past 12 months, net loan charge-offs increased $12 million. This increase is attributable to growth in our loan portfolio and lower levels of recoveries coupled with high levels of charge-offs over the same period.123Table of ContentsFigure 34.

These concessions are made to improve the collectability of the loan and generally take the form of a reduction of the interest rate, extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance.As shown in Figure 36, nonperforming assets at March 31, 2017, decreased $53 million from December 31, 2016. This decrease was reflected in both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios. 126Table of ContentsFigure 37 shows the types of activity that caused the change in our nonperforming loan balance during each of the last five quarters.Figure 37.

These events include, among other things, threats to our cybersecurity, as we are reliant upon information systems and the Internet to conduct our business activities.Operational risk also encompasses compliance risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules and regulations, prescribed practices, and ethical standards. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, large financial companies like Key are subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation. This heightened level of regulation has increased our operational risk. Resulting operational risk losses and/or additional regulatory compliance costs could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation, or foregone opportunities.We seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk, alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance, and a system of internal controls and reporting. We continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws, rules, and regulations. For example, an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses. This tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action. We also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes. This technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the Board.The Operational Risk Management Program provides the framework for the structure, governance, roles, and responsibilities, as well as the content, to manage operational risk for Key. The Compliance Risk Committee serves the same function in managing compliance risk for Key. Primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business. The Operational Risk Committee and Compliance Risk Committee are senior management committees that oversee our level of operational and compliance risk and direct and support our operational and compliance infrastructure and related activities. These committees and the Operational Risk Management and Compliance functions are an integral part of our ERM Program. Our Risk Review function regularly assesses the overall effectiveness of our Operational Risk Management and Compliance Programs and our system of internal controls. Risk Review reports the 127Table of Contentsresults of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the Risk and Audit Committees and independently supports the Risk Committee’s oversight of these controls.CybersecurityWe maintain comprehensive Cyber Incident Response Plans, and we devote significant time and resources to maintaining and regularly updating our technology systems and processes to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks, and other technology assets against attempts by third parties to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems, or cause other damage. We and many other U.S. financial institutions have experienced distributed denial-of-service attacks from technologically sophisticated third parties. These attacks are intended to disrupt or disable consumer online banking services and prevent banking transactions. We also periodically experience other attempts to breach the security of our systems and data. These cyberattacks have not, to date, resulted in any material disruption of our operations or material harm to our customers, and have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Cyberattack risks may also occur with our third-party technology service providers, and may interfere with their ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us, with attendant potential for financial loss or liability that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Recent high-profile cyberattacks have targeted retailers and other businesses for the purpose of acquiring the confidential information (including personal, financial, and credit card information) of customers, some of whom are customers of ours. We may incur expenses related to the investigation of such attacks or related to the protection of our customers from identity theft as a result of such attacks. Risks and exposures related to cyberattacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking, and other technology-based products and services by us and our clients.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur business is dynamic and complex. Consequently, we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies. These choices are critical – not only are they necessary to comply with GAAP, they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance. All accounting policies are important, and all policies described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) beginning on page 106 of our 2016 Form 10-K should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance.In our opinion, some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility. These policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance, or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. Because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances, they may prove to be inaccurate, or we may find it necessary to change them.We rely heavily on the use of judgment, assumptions, and estimates to make a number of core decisions, including accounting for the ALLL; contingent liabilities, guarantees and income taxes; derivatives and related hedging activities; and assets and liabilities that involve valuation methodologies. In addition, we may employ outside valuation experts to assist us in determining fair values of certain assets and liabilities. A brief discussion of each of these areas appears on pages 92 through 95 of our 2016 Form 10-K. At March 31, 2017, $20.2 billion, or 15%, of our total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Approximately 99% of these assets, before netting adjustments, were classified as Level 1 or Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. At March 31, 2017, $1.2 billion, or 1%, of our total liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. All of these liabilities were classified as Level 1 or Level 2.At March 31, 2017, $18 million, or less than 1% of our total assets were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. All of these assets were classified as Level 3. At March 31, 2017, there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.During the first three months of 2017, we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates. 128Table of ContentsEuropean Sovereign and Nonsovereign Debt ExposuresOur total European sovereign and Nonsovereign debt exposure is presented in Figure 39.Figure 39.

Controls and ProceduresAs of the end of the period covered by this report, KeyCorp carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of KeyCorp’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of KeyCorp’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under 129Table of Contentsthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), to ensure that information required to be disclosed by KeyCorp in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to KeyCorp’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, KeyCorp’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, as of the end of the period covered by this report.PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal ProceedingsThe information presented in the Legal Proceedings section of Note 16 (“Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) is incorporated herein by reference.On at least a quarterly basis, we assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings utilizing the latest information available. Where it is probable that we will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements. These legal reserves may be increased or decreased to reflect any relevant developments on a quarterly basis. Where a loss is not probable or the amount of the loss is not estimable, we have not accrued legal reserves, consistent with applicable accounting guidance. Based on information currently available to us, advice of counsel, and available insurance coverage, we believe that our established reserves are adequate and the liabilities arising from the legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the inherent uncertainty in legal proceedings there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution will not exceed established reserves. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter or a combination of matters may be material to our results of operations for a particular period, depending upon the size of the loss or our income for that particular period.Item 1A.
