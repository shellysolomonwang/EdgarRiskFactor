Item 1A: Risk Factors in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of subsequent events or circumstances. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider all risks and uncertainties disclosed in our SEC filings, including our reports on Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q and our registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, all of which are accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and at www.Key.com/IR.  Economic overview  During the third quarter of 2011, a moderate, yet fragile, economic recovery continued in the United States. Job creation remained sluggish as employers were reluctant to add workers amid several economic uncertainties. Payrolls increased by 287,000 jobs in the third quarter of 2011, compared to the 290,000 increase in the second quarter of 2011 and the 497,000 increase in the first quarter of 2011. The average unemployment rate for the third quarter of 2011 remained elevated at 9.1%, the same average rate seen in the second quarter of 2011 and still considerably higher than the ten year average unemployment rate of 6.4%. Confidence in the recovery was further weakened throughout the third quarter of 2011 by the debt ceiling debate in Congress, the eventual S&P downgrade of the U.S. long term credit rating, and the continued sovereign debt crisis in Europe.  Despite the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, U.S. consumers were resilient as the average monthly rate of consumer spending increased 0.6% for the third quarter of 2011 compared to an average monthly increase of 0.1% in the second quarter of 2011. Consumers faced rising inflationary pressures, as consumer prices during September 2011 increased at an annual rate of 3.9%, up from the prior quarter’s 3.6% annual increase and the 1.5% increase for all of 2010. Gasoline prices continued to be one of the major contributors to elevated prices as the national average price for a regular gallon of gasoline in the U.S. was approximately 28% higher at the end of September 2011 than a year earlier.  Continued weakness in the housing market also weighed on consumer wealth and confidence. September 2011 new home sales were down 1% from September 2010, while the median price of new homes decreased by 10% over the same period. Building activity improved modestly as housing starts at the end of the quarter rose 10% from a year earlier, but still remain at historically low levels. Existing home sales showed some signs of improvement as lower mortgage rates and price discounts encouraged buyers back into the market. September 2011 existing home sales were up 11% from the same month a year ago. However, in September 2011 median home values continued their decline with a 4% decrease from a year earlier as a sustained high level of new foreclosures pressured existing home prices.  The weaker economic and employment outlook sparked a response from both fiscal and monetary policy makers during the third quarter of 2011. President Obama proposed the American Jobs Act to Congress and the Federal Reserve took further actions to strengthen its commitment to an accommodative monetary policy. As part of these actions, the Federal Reserve stated it would keep the federal funds rate at exceptionally low levels at least through mid-2013. Furthermore, in an attempt to lower longer-term borrowing rates to consumers and businesses, the Federal Reserve announced a program dubbed Operation Twist by investors. This program involves the Federal Reserve purchasing $400 billion of Treasury securities with longer maturities while selling the same amount of Treasury securities with shorter maturities. These actions along with the recognition of a weakening global economy contributed to a drop in benchmark term interest rates. The benchmark two-year U.S. Treasury yield declined from 0.46% at June 30, 2011 to 0.25% at September 30, 2011. The ten-year Treasury yield, which began the quarter at 3.16%, declined 1.24% to close the quarter at 1.92%.  Long-term financial goals  Our long-term financial goals are as follows:      ¿ Target a loan to core deposit ratio range of 90% to 100%.      ¿ Return to a moderate risk profile by targeting a net charge-off ratio range of .40% to .50%.    63    Table of Contents   ¿ Grow high quality and diverse revenue streams by targeting a net interest margin in excess of 3.50% and ratio of noninterest income to total revenue of greater than 40%.      ¿ Create positive operating leverage and target an efficiency ratio in the range of 60 to 65%.      ¿ Achieve a return on average assets in the range of 1.00% to 1.25%.  Figure 1 shows the evaluation of our long-term financial goals for the third quarter of 2011.  Figure 1.

Strategic developments  We initiated the following actions during the first nine months of 2011 to support our corporate strategy described in the “Introduction” section under the “Corporate Strategy” heading on page 30 of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.      ¿ We are continuing our support of small- and medium-sized businesses and have committed $5 billion in lending capital over the next three years to foster growth and expansion in this important segment.      ¿ During the third quarter of 2011, we continued to benefit from improved asset quality. Nonperforming loans declined by $584 million, and nonperforming assets decreased by $887 million from the year-ago quarter to $788 million and $914 million, respectively. Net charge-offs declined to $109 million, or 0.90% of average loan balances for the third quarter of 2011, compared to $357 million, or 2.69% of average loan balances for the same period one year ago.      ¿ Our capital ratios remained strong with a Tier 1 common equity ratio of 11.28%, our loan loss reserves were adequate at 2.35% to period-end loans and we were core funded with a loan to deposit ratio of 86% at September 30, 2011. Our strong capital position provides us with the flexibility to support our clients and our business needs and to evaluate other appropriate capital deployment opportunities.      ¿ We continue to manage our expenses and focus on delivering solutions that our clients value. In this regard we have established a target efficiency ratio of 60 – 65%. For the quarter ended September 30, 2011, we achieved an efficiency ratio of 67%.    64    Table of Contents   ¿ During the second quarter of 2011, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $.03 per Common Share or $.12 on an annualized basis. This is a result of our return to sustained profitability, disciplined capital and expense management, and continued improvement in credit quality.      ¿ As previously reported, Key completed the repurchase of the $2.5 billion of Series B Preferred Stock and corresponding warrant issued to the U.S. Treasury Department. As a result of the repurchase, we recorded a $49 million one-time deemed dividend in the first quarter of 2011 related to the remaining difference between the repurchase price and the carrying value of the preferred shares at the time of repurchase. Beginning with the second quarter of 2011, the repurchase resulted in the elimination of quarterly dividends of $31 million and discount amortization of $4 million, or $140 million on an annual basis, related to these preferred shares. In total, Key paid $2.867 billion to the U.S. Treasury during the investment period in the form of dividends, principal and repurchase of the warrant, resulting in a return to the U.S. Treasury of $367 million above the initial investment of $2.5 billion on November 14, 2008.  We view our third quarter results as another step forward. Despite the uneven pace of the recovery and regulatory changes, we are gaining traction in both the Key Community Bank and the Key Corporate Bank.  With the foundation of our strong balance sheet in place, we believe we are positioned to grow our franchise and remain disciplined with respect to costs and capital management.  Demographics  We have two major business segments: Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank.  Key Community Bank serves individuals and small to mid-sized businesses by offering a variety of deposit, investment, lending, and personalized wealth management products and services. These products and services are provided through our relationship managers and specialists residing in our 14-state branch network, which is organized into three internally defined geographic regions: Rocky Mountains and Northwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast.  Figure 2 shows the geographic diversity of Key Community Bank’s average deposits, commercial loans and home equity loans.  Figure 2.

Key Corporate Bank includes three lines of business that operate nationally, within and beyond our 14-state branch network.  The Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services business consists of two business units. Real Estate Capital professionals are located in select markets across the country and provide financial services for public and private owners, investors and developers of nonowner-occupied commercial real estate properties. In addition to direct loans, this business unit is a Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriter and Servicer, Freddie Mac Program Plus Seller/Servicer and FHA-approved mortgagee. KeyBank Real Estate Capital is also one of the nation’s largest and highest rated commercial mortgage servicers. Figure 20, which appears later in this report in the “Loans and loans held for sale” section, shows the diversity of our commercial real estate lending business based on industry type and location. Corporate Banking Services provides cash management, interest rate derivatives, and foreign exchange products and services to clients served by Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. Through its Public Sector and Financial Institutions businesses, Corporate Banking Services also provides a full array of commercial banking products and services to government and not-for-profit entities and to community banks. A variety of cash management services are provided through the Global Treasury Management unit.    65    Table of Contents Equipment Finance is one of the largest bank-based equipment finance providers based in the U.S. This business unit meets the equipment financing needs of companies worldwide and provides equipment manufacturers, distributors and resellers with funding options for their clients. Equipment finance specializes in the technology, healthcare, and renewable energy markets as well as other capital assets.  The Institutional and Capital Markets business consists of two business units. KeyBanc Capital Markets provides commercial lending, treasury management, investment banking, derivatives, foreign exchange, equity and debt underwriting and trading, and syndicated finance products and services. This business unit focuses primarily on emerging and middle-market companies in the Industrial, Consumer, Real Estate, Energy, Technology and Healthcare sectors. Our clients benefit from this business unit’s focused industry expertise and its consistent, integrated team approach, which helps our clients achieve their strategic objectives. Victory Capital Management is an investment advisory firm that manages or offers advice regarding investment portfolios. This business unit’s national client base consists of both institutional and retail clients derived from four primary channels: public plans, Taft-Hartley plans, corporations, and endowments and foundations.  Additional information regarding the products and services offered by our Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank segments are described further in this report in Note 16 (“Line of Business Results”).  Supervision and Regulation  Regulatory reform developments  On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. This Act is intended to address perceived deficiencies and gaps in the regulatory framework for financial services in the United States, reduce the risks of bank failures and better equip the nation’s regulators to guard against or mitigate any future financial crises, and manage systemic risk through increased supervision of systemically important financial companies (including nonbank financial companies). The Dodd-Frank Act implements numerous and far-reaching changes across the financial landscape affecting financial companies, including banks and bank holding companies such as Key. Many of the rulemakings required by the various regulatory agencies are still in the process of being developed and/or implemented. A number of proposed rules referenced in our prior reports continue to remain pending. For further discussion concerning the Dodd-Frank Act, we refer you to our “Supervision and Regulation” discussion on page 66 in our Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2011, and the risk factor on page 12 in Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following provides a summary of pertinent regulatory developments relating to the Dodd-Frank Act as well as other regulatory matters.  Interchange fees  As previously reported, the Federal Reserve approved Regulation II, Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing (“Regulation II”), which limits debit card issuer interchange fees for electronic debit transactions and implements provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. If interchange fees are set at the maximum amount allowed by Regulation II and we receive the fraud adjustment amount, we estimate that the impact on our debit interchange revenue stream will be an annualized decline of approximately $50 million to $60 million before any potential offsets from other fees or cost mitigation that may be implemented.  Our debit interchange revenue for the first nine months of 2011 was $84 million. The relevant portions of Regulation II became effective on October 1, 2011.  Regulation E pursuant to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978  For a discussion of final rules regarding Regulation E relating to the charging of overdraft fees and the estimated impact on our revenue, we refer you to the discussion of “Regulation E pursuant to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978” on page 32 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. For the first nine months of 2011 deposit service charge income reflects the full impact to Key of the change in Regulation E. Compared to the same period last year, service charge income on deposit accounts is down $20 million or 9% which is consistent with our expectations.  Comprehensive capital plan  In November 2010, the Federal Reserve issued Revised Temporary Addendum to Supervisory Letter SR 09-4. This letter outlines specific criteria the Federal Reserve will consider when evaluating proposed capital actions by the 19 largest U.S. banking institutions that participated in the SCAP, including KeyCorp. These include actions such as increasing dividends, implementing common stock repurchase programs, or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments more broadly. The Federal Reserve is required to assess the capital adequacy of the 19 largest BHCs based upon a review of each BHC’s    66    Table of Contents  comprehensive capital plan and planned capital actions. As previously reported on June 10, 2011, we submitted to the Federal Reserve and provided to the OCC an updated Comprehensive Capital Plan, which set forth additional capital actions related to redemptions of certain outstanding capital securities. On August 1, 2011, the Federal Reserve informed us that it had no objections to the capital actions set forth in our updated capital plan. For a discussion of our capital actions, see the “Capital” section.  Capital plan proposal  As previously reported, the Federal Reserve published in the Federal Register a proposed rule on capital plans. The proposal, which would amend Regulation Y, would require top-tier U.S. bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or greater to submit annual capital plans for review. According to the proposal, the capital plan review builds on the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) conducted earlier this year on the 19 largest financial institutions, including us, and aims to ensure that institutions have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress.  Under the proposal, as part of the capital plan reviews, the Federal Reserve would evaluate institutions’ plans to make capital distributions, such as increasing dividend payments or repurchasing or redeeming stock. In some cases, such as when the Federal Reserve has previously objected to a capital plan the institution would be required to receive approval from the Federal Reserve before making capital distributions. The proposal is expected to institutionalize the previously completed CCAR exercise. The CCAR followed the SCAP, a standardized stress test led by the Federal Reserve in 2009. The Federal Reserve indicated in its proposal that as of March 31, 2011, thirty-five financial institutions would be affected by this proposal. Comments on the proposal were due by August 5, 2011.  Proposed joint guidance on stress testing  On June 15, 2011, the OCC, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC published in the Federal Register proposed joint guidance on stress testing for banking organizations with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, including KeyBank and KeyCorp. The proposed joint guidance outlines high-level principles for stress testing practices, applicable to all Federal Reserve-supervised, FDIC-supervised, and OCC-supervised banking organizations with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets. The proposed guidance highlights the importance of stress testing as an ongoing risk management practice that supports a banking organization’s forward-looking assessment of its risks. Comments were due by July 29, 2011.  Systemically important financial companies  The FDIC and the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule to implement the requirement in the Dodd-Frank Act that bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in assets and certain nonbank financial companies prepare a “living will” and submit such living will to the FDIC and the Federal Reserve for review. In a related rulemaking, the FDIC adopted an interim final rule that requires insured depository institutions with $50 billion or more in assets to prepare and submit to the FDIC a living will. A living will is intended to be a plan to resolve a covered company under the applicable insolvency regime (the Bankruptcy Code or the Federal Deposit Insurance Act) in the event of the company’s material financial distress or failure. The initial living wills for KeyCorp and KeyBank are due by December 31, 2013. KeyCorp and KeyBank will be required to submit an updated living will annually thereafter.  Restrictions on proprietary trading and interests in hedge funds and private equity funds  On October 12, 2011, the OCC, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the SEC issued a proposed rule implementing certain prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of a banking entity and nonbank financial company supervised by the Federal Reserve to engage in proprietary trading and have certain interests in, or relationships with, a hedge fund or private equity fund. Comments are due by January 13, 2012.  Critical accounting policies and estimates  Our business is dynamic and complex. Consequently, we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies. These choices are critical: not only are they necessary to comply with GAAP, they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance. All accounting policies are important, and all policies described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) on page 99 of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance.    67    Table of Contents In our opinion, some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility. These policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance, or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. Because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances, they may prove to be inaccurate, or we may find it necessary to change them.  We rely heavily on the use of judgment, assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions, including accounting for the allowance for loan and lease losses; contingent liabilities, guarantees and income taxes; derivatives and related hedging activities; and assets and liabilities that involve valuation methodologies. In addition, we may employ outside valuation experts to assist us in determining fair values of certain assets and liabilities. A brief discussion of each of these areas appears on pages 34 through 37 of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  At September 30, 2011, $20.7 billion, or 23%, of our total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Approximately 96% of these assets, before netting adjustments, were classified as Level 1 or Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. At September 30, 2011, $2.1 billion, or 3%, of our total liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Substantially all of these liabilities were classified as Level 1 or Level 2.  At September 30, 2011, $189 million, or .2%, of our total assets were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Approximately 6% of these assets were classified as Level 1 or Level 2. At September 30, 2011, there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  In addition, the education lending securitization trusts assets and liabilities were included on the balance sheet at September 30, 2011 at fair value, in the amount of $2.9 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively, as a result of their consolidation on January 1, 2010. During the third quarter of 2011, we determined that the $45 million cumulative effect adjustment made related to the consolidation of these trusts on January 1, 2010 was incorrect. Further information regarding this error and its correction is provided in Note 11 (“Divestiture and Discontinued Operations”).  During the first nine months of 2011, we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates.  Highlights of Our Performance  Financial performance  For the third quarter of 2011, we announced net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $229 million, or $.24 per common share. Our third quarter of 2011 results compare to net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $163 million, or $.19 per common share, for the third quarter of 2010. The third quarter 2011 results reflect an improvement in noninterest expense and lower credit costs from the same period one-year ago. Third quarter 2011 net income attributable to Key common shareholders was $212 million compared to net income attributable to Key common shareholders of $178 million for the same quarter one year ago.  For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders was $656 million, or $.71 per common share, compared to net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $121 million, or $.14 per common share, for the same period one year ago. Net income attributable to Key common shareholders for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2011, was $619 million compared to net income attributable to Key common shareholders of $111 million for the same period one year ago.  Our financial results demonstrate positive momentum for us and reflect progress in executing our relationship strategy, improving credit quality and maintaining disciplined expense control. Our commercial, financial and agricultural loan portfolio grew for the second consecutive quarter. Our clients continue to benefit from our ability to work together across business lines to deliver value by combining local knowledge and service with specialized industry expertise and advisory capabilities. We intend to support small- and medium-sized businesses by committing $5 billion in lending capital over the next three years to foster growth and expansion in this important segment.  During the third quarter of 2011, we continued to benefit from improved asset quality. Nonperforming assets declined $887 million, and nonperforming loans decreased by $584 million from the year-ago quarter to $914 million and $788 million, respectively. Net charge-offs declined $248 million from the third quarter of 2010 to $109 million, or .90%, of average loan balances for the third quarter of 2011, compared to $357 million, or 2.69% of average loan balances for the same period one year ago. Our credit quality trends have benefited from actions that we began over four years ago to exit higher risk lending    68    Table of Contents  activities. We have experienced continued improvement in our asset quality statistics. Over the past seven quarters net charge-offs have declined 79%, nonperforming assets are down 62% to 1.89% of total loans, OREO and other nonperforming assets and our coverage ratio of loan and lease loss reserves to nonperforming loans is 144% as of September 30, 2011.  Our capital ratios remain strong. Our tangible common equity, Tier 1 common equity and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios at September 30, 2011, are 9.82%, 11.28%, and 13.49%, respectively, compared to 8.00%, 8.61%, and 14.30%, respectively, at September 30, 2010. We are currently in the process of finalizing and presenting our 2012 financial plan to our Board, which will then become our base case for our capital plan submission to our regulators. While we continue to await guidelines for the 2012 regulatory process, we preliminarily expect our capital planning process to include assessment of certain capital distributions, including potential dividend increases and share repurchases in the future.  As previously reported, Key completed the repurchase of the $2.5 billion of Series B Preferred Stock and corresponding warrant issued to the U.S. Treasury Department. As a result of the repurchase, the Company recorded a $49 million one-time deemed dividend in the first quarter of 2011 related to the remaining difference between the repurchase price and the carrying value of the preferred shares at the time of repurchase. Beginning with the second quarter of 2011, the repurchase resulted in the elimination of quarterly dividends of $31 million and discount amortization of $4 million, or $140 million on an annual basis, related to these preferred shares. In total, Key paid $2.867 billion to the U.S. Treasury during the investment period in the form of dividends, principal and repurchase of the warrant, resulting in a return to the U.S. Treasury of $367 million above the initial investment of $2.5 billion on November 14, 2008.  During the first nine months of 2011, we have originated approximately $26.1 billion, or a 24% increase from $21.0 billion for the same period one year ago in new or renewed lending commitments to consumers and businesses. In addition, we expect to build a total of 40 new branches in 2011, having opened 36 new branches in the first nine months of 2011 and 77 others in the prior two calendar years. Our multi-year branch building and renovation project has resulted in approximately one-third of Key’s 1,063 branches in its 14 state-branch network either being newly constructed or remodeled over the past four years.

In April 2009, we decided to wind down the operations of Austin, an investment subsidiary that specializes in managing hedge fund investments for its institutional customer base. As a result of these decisions, we have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations. The loss from discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, was primarily attributable to fair value adjustments related to the education lending securitization trusts.      (b) Nine months ended September 30, 2011 includes a $49 million deemed dividend recorded in the first quarter of 2011 related to the repurchase of the $2.5 billion Series B Preferred Stock.

education payment and financing unit of KeyBank. In April 2009, we decided to wind down the operations of Austin, an investment subsidiary that specializes in managing hedge fund investments for its institutional customer base.      (b) See Figure 5 entitled “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations,” which presents the computations of certain financial measures to “tangible common equity” and “Tier 1 common equity.” The table reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures, which provides a basis for period-to-period comparisons.      (c) Represents period-end consolidated total loans and loans held for sale (excluding education loans in the securitizations trusts) divided by period-end consolidated total deposits (excluding deposits in foreign office).    70    Table of Contents Figure 5 presents certain financial measures related to “tangible common equity” and “Tier 1 common equity.” The tangible common equity ratio has been a focus for some investors. We believe this ratio may assist investors in analyzing our capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock.  Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. Since the commencement of the SCAP in early 2009, the Federal Reserve has focused its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 risk-based capital known as Tier 1 common equity. Because the Federal Reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders’ equity (essentially Tier 1 risk-based capital less preferred stock, qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in Tier 1 risk-based capital, this focus on Tier 1 common equity is consistent with existing capital adequacy categories. This increased focus on Tier 1 common equity is also present in the Basel Committee’s Basel III guidelines, which U.S. regulators are expected to adopt pursuant to regulations that are expected to be issued in the near future. The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act also changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to bank holding companies by requiring regulators to create rules phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities as Tier 1 eligible capital. This three year phase-out period, which commences January 1, 2013, will ultimately result in our capital securities being treated only as Tier 2 capital.  Tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by GAAP nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations; this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity and Tier 1 common equity, we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases. Figure 5 also reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures.  The table also shows the computation for pre-provision net revenue, which is not formally defined by GAAP. Management believes that eliminating the effects of the provision for loan and lease losses makes it easier to analyze our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis.  Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.    71    Table of Contents Figure 5.

There were no disallowed deferred tax assets at September 30, 2011.  Results of Operations  Net interest income  One of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets (such as loans and securities) and loan-related fee income, and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. There are several factors that affect net interest income, including:      ¿ the volume, pricing, mix and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities;      ¿ the volume and value of net free funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and equity capital;      ¿ the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk;      ¿ interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace; and      ¿ asset quality.  To make it easier to compare results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets (some taxable, some not), we present net interest income in this discussion on a “taxable-equivalent basis” (i.e., as if it were all taxable and at the same rate). For example, $100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as $154, an amount that — if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% — would yield $100.    72    Table of Contents Figure 6 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense, and their respective yields or rates over the past five quarters. This figure also presents a reconciliation of taxable-equivalent net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with GAAP for each of those quarters. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized taxable-equivalent net interest income by average earning assets.  Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $555 million for the third quarter of 2011, and the net interest margin was 3.09%. These results compare to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $647 million and a net interest margin of 3.35% for the third quarter of 2010. The decrease in net interest income is attributable to both a decline in earning assets and tighter spread between asset yields and funding costs.  Compared to the second quarter of 2011, taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $15 million, and the net interest margin declined 10 basis points. The decline in the net interest margin and net interest income reflects a higher level of lower yielding short-term investments. The unfavorable impact of the shift in asset mix was partially offset by rate reductions on deposits, maturities of higher rate certificates of deposit, and the impact of the redemptions on September 1, 2011, of certain capital securities.  We expect the net interest margin to be stable to up and for average earning assets to remain relatively stable for the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the third quarter of 2011. Helping reverse some of the margin pressure is the expectation of modest improvement in the mix of assets with short-term liquidity coming down as it is redeployed for debt maturities and the expectation of growth in loan balances and continued improvement in the mix of deposits compared to the prior quarter.  Average earning assets for the third quarter of 2011 totaled $72.3 billion, which was $5.2 billion, or 6.7%, lower than the third quarter of 2010. Average loans declined $4.6 billion primarily in our commercial portfolio, due to soft demand for both commercial and consumer credits during the past year and run-off in our exit portfolios. When compared to the second quarter of 2011, average total loans declined $446 million. This was a slower decline than we had been experiencing in prior quarters and we believe we are near an inflection point in our total loan portfolio where average loans may begin to show increases on a linked quarter basis. Our commercial, financial and agricultural loan portfolio showed its second consecutive quarterly growth in average balances, increasing $459 million or 2.7%, unannualized from the prior quarter. Short-term investments increased $1.8 billion from the year ago quarter. This increase was due to investing excess cash flows from loan repayments and net deposit flows. When compared to the second quarter of 2011, investment securities decreased approximately $840 million while short-term investments increased approximately $1.4 billion. The return on average assets for the third quarter of 2011 was 1.14%. We continue to benefit from well managed expenses and provision expense, which remains low due to improving credit quality.    73    Table of Contents Figure 6.

Noninterest income  Our noninterest income was $483 million for the third quarter of 2011, compared to $486 million for the year-ago quarter, representing a decrease of $3 million, or 1%. Increases of $16 million in net gains (losses) from principal investing (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests), $14 million in fair value hedge accounting adjustments and $13 million in gains on the redemption of trust preferred securities were essentially offset with decreases of $17 million in investment banking and capital markets income, $11 million in operating lease income due to product run-off and a $12 million corporate-owned life insurance dividend recognized in the third quarter of 2010.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2011, noninterest income decreased $34 million, or 2%. The largest components of the decrease are a $34 million decrease in operating lease income due to product run-off, a $20 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts as a result of the implementation of Regulation E in the third quarter of 2010, a $20 million decrease in income generated by Tuition Management Services, a business unit sold in the fourth quarter of 2010 and a $12 million corporate-owned life insurance dividend recognized in the third quarter of 2010. Offsetting these decreases was a $28 million increase in investment banking and capital markets income (loss) attributable to a lower provision for losses related to customer derivatives, a $14 million increase in letter of credit and loan fees due to increased syndication loan production, an increase of $14 million in net gains (losses) from principal investing (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) and an increase of $10 million in electronic banking fees due to higher customer transaction volume. Also, we believe, the effect of the new pricing controls on debit transactions are estimated to negatively impact our revenue by $12 million to $15 million per quarter before implementation of mitigation strategies.    76    Table of Contents Figure 8.

Trust and investment services income  Trust and investment services are our largest source of noninterest income. The primary components of revenue generated by these services are shown in Figure 9. During the third quarter of 2011, trust and investment services income decreased slightly over the same period one year ago due to lower income from advisory and custody fees.  Figure 9.

At September 30, 2011, our bank, trust and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of $51.6 billion, compared to $59.7 billion at September 30, 2010. As shown in Figure 10, the decrease was attributable to reductions in the equity and securities lending portfolios. The decline in the equity portfolio was due in part to asset outflows and market value declines. The decrease in the value of our portfolio of hedge funds is attributable to our second quarter 2009 decision to wind down the operations of Austin. Our securities lending business has been declining due to the fact that we have de-emphasized this business resulting in lower transaction volumes, client departures and fewer assets under management.    77    Table of Contents Figure 10.

Service charges on deposit accounts  The decrease in service charges on deposit accounts during the first nine months of 2011 is due primarily to the implementation of Regulation E, which went into effect on July 1, 2010 for new clients and August 15, 2010 for our existing clients. The decrease was partially offset by service charges earned on increased deposit transaction fees.  Operating lease income  Operating lease income decreased $11 million, or 27% for the third quarter of 2011, and decreased $34 million, or 26% for the nine months ended September 30, 2011 in our Equipment Finance line of business due to product run-off. Accordingly, as shown in Figure 12, operating lease expense also declined.  Investment banking and capital markets income  As shown in Figure 11, income from investment banking and capital markets activities decreased $17 million, or 41% from the year-ago quarter and increased $28 million, or 34% from the nine-month period ended one year ago.  Investment banking income decreased $22 million from a year-ago quarter and decreased $12 million from the nine-month period ended one year ago due to lower merger and acquisition advisory fees and lower equity originations income.  Income from other investments increased by $4 million from a year-ago quarter and increased $12 million from the nine-month period ended one year ago due to asset sales made by our Funds Management Group.  Dealer trading and derivatives income increased by $2 million from the year-ago quarter and increased $27 million from the nine-month period ended one year ago due largely to improved results related to the provision for losses related to customer derivatives.  Foreign exchange income remained essentially unchanged compared to prior reporting periods.  Figure 11.

Net gains (losses) from principal investing  Principal investments consist of direct and indirect investments in predominantly privately-held companies. Our principal investing income is susceptible to volatility since most of it is derived from mezzanine debt and equity investments in small to medium-sized businesses. These investments are carried on the balance sheet at fair value ($759 million at September 30, 2011, compared to $898 million at December 31, 2010, and $945 million at September 30, 2010). During the first half of 2011, employees who managed our various principal investments formed two independent entities that will serve as investment managers of these investments going forward. Under this arrangement, which was mutually agreeable to both parties, these individuals are no longer employees of Key. As a result of these changes, during the second quarter of 2011, we deconsolidated certain of these direct and indirect investments, totaling $234 million. The net gains (losses) presented in Figure 8 derive from changes in fair values as well as sales of principal investments.  Other income  Other income increased $24 million, or 75% from the year-ago quarter due to $14 million in fair value hedge accounting adjustments and $13 million in gains on the redemption of trust preferred securities. Other income decreased $23 million, or 17% for the nine-month period ended a year ago due to a $20 million decrease in income generated by Tuition Management Services, a business unit sold in the fourth quarter of 2010.  Noninterest expense  Noninterest expense was $692 million for the third quarter of 2011, compared to $736 million for the same period last year. For the first nine months of 2011, noninterest expense decreased $217 million, or 10% from the first nine months of 2010.  As shown in Figure 12, the decrease for the third quarter of 2011 and the first nine months of 2011 compared to the year-ago quarter and period were attributable to decreases in net OREO expense attributable to gains on sales of OREO, decreases in FDIC insurance as a result of the change in the calculation method for deposit insurance assessments as discussed in the “Deposits and other sources of funds” section under the “The Dodd-Frank Act reform of deposit insurance” heading, increases in the credit to the provision for unfunded commitments as a result of improved credit quality and expense management philosophy adopted from our Keyvolution initiative.

The following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest expense and the factors that caused those elements to change.    79    Table of Contents Personnel  As shown in Figure 13, personnel expense, the largest category of our noninterest expense, increased by $23 million, or 7%, when compared to the year-ago quarter and increased slightly from the first nine months of 2010. This was due primarily to increased incentive compensation on improved performance and an increase in employee benefits related to a change in certain pension plan assumptions, as previously reported in the third quarter of 2010. For the first nine months ended 2011, incentive compensation increased on improved performance while the aforementioned pension plan adjustments have resulted in lower levels of expense. The decrease in stock-based compensation resulted from forfeiture of performance based shares. For more information related to our pension plans, see Note 14 (“Employee Benefits”).  Figure 13.

Income related to the rental of leased equipment is presented in Figure 8 as “operating lease income.”  Income taxes  We recorded tax expense from continuing operations of $95 million for the third quarter of 2011, $94 million for the second quarter of 2011 and $85 million for the third quarter of 2010. For the first nine months of 2011, we recorded tax expense from continuing operations of $300 million, and $14 million for the same period last year.  Our federal tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate, primarily because we generate income from investments in tax-advantaged assets, such as corporate-owned life insurance, earn credits associated with investments in low-income housing projects, and make periodic adjustments to our tax reserves.  Additional information pertaining to how our tax expense (benefit) and the resulting effective tax rates were derived are included in Note 12 (“Income Taxes”) on page 138 of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.    80    Table of Contents Line of Business Results  This section summarizes the financial performance and related strategic developments of our two major business segments (operating segments), Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. Note 16 (“Line of Business Results”) describes the products and services offered by each of these business segments, provides more detailed financial information pertaining to the segments and their respective lines of business, and explains “Other Segments” and “Reconciling Items.”  Figure 14 summarizes the contribution made by each major business segment to our “taxable-equivalent revenue from continuing operations” and “income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Key” for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010.

Decreases in the provision for loan and lease losses and noninterest expenses were partially offset by lower net interest income in the third quarter of 2011.  Taxable-equivalent net interest income declined by $32 million, or 8%, from the third quarter of 2010. Average earning assets decreased by $557 million, or 2%, from the year-ago quarter, reflecting reductions in the commercial and home equity loan portfolios. Average deposits declined by $1 billion, or 2%, as higher-costing certificates of deposit matured, partially offset by growth in noninterest-bearing deposits and NOW and money market deposit accounts.  Noninterest income increased by $1 million, or 1%, from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to higher income from electronic banking fees and letter of credit and loan fees. This was partially offset by lower insurance income.  The provision for loan and lease losses declined by $36 million, or 48%, compared to the third quarter of 2010 due to lower net charge-offs and nonperforming loans from the same period one year ago.  Noninterest expense declined by $3 million, or 1%, from the year-ago quarter. The decrease was driven by reductions in FDIC deposit insurance premiums of $18 million, partially offset by increases in personnel expense and real estate costs associated with investments in our branch network.    81    Table of Contents Figure 15.

This decline was driven by lower net interest income and investment banking and capital markets income. The decrease in revenues was partially offset by a significant decline in noninterest expense. The provision for loan and lease losses also decreased as net charge-offs significantly declined between periods.  Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $29 million, or 15%, compared to the third quarter of 2010, due to lower average deposits and average earning assets. Average deposits declined by $1 billion, or 9%, from one year ago primarily as a result of the movement of $1.5 billion in escrow balances out of the Real Estate Capital line of business to a third party in the first quarter of 2011. Average earning assets decreased by $2.9 billion, or 13%, from the year-ago quarter, while the earning asset spread improved due to lower levels of nonperforming assets and better pricing helping to partially offset volume-related declines.  Noninterest income declined by $27 million, or 12%, from the third quarter of 2010. Contributing to the decline in noninterest income was the impact from a slowing merger and acquisition market and the third quarter volatility in the capital markets, which resulted in a decrease in investment banking and capital markets income of $18 million. In addition, letter of credit and loan fees and operating lease revenue both decreased $7 million from the year-ago quarter. These declines were partially offset by improvements in gains on leased equipment of $5 million and mortgage banking fees of $3 million.    82    Table of Contents The provision for loan and lease losses in the third quarter of 2011 was a credit of $40 million compared to a credit of $25 million for the same period one year ago. Key Corporate Bank continued to experience improved asset quality for the eighth quarter in a row.  Noninterest expense decreased by $21 million, or 9%, from the third quarter of 2010. Contributing to the improvement in expense levels were decreases in operating lease expense of $7 million, corporate support costs of $5 million, and various other miscellaneous expense items of $11 million. Personnel expense also declined $4 million as a result of lower investment banking and capital markets income. These improvements were partially offset by an increase in the provision for losses on lending-related commitments of $5 million.  Figure 16.

Other Segments generated net income attributable to Key of $55 million for the third quarter of 2011, compared to net income attributable to Key of $17 million for the same period last year. These results are primarily attributable to a decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses of $34 million in the exit portfolio.    83    Table of Contents Financial Condition  Loans and loans held for sale  At September 30, 2011, total loans outstanding from continuing operations were $48.2 billion, compared to $50.1 billion at December 31, 2010 and $51.4 billion at September 30, 2010. Loans related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business, which are excluded from total loans at September 30, 2011, December 31, 2010, and September 30, 2010, totaled $6.0 billion, $6.5 billion, and $6.6 billion, respectively. The decrease in our loans from continuing operations over the past twelve months reflects reductions in most of our portfolios, with the largest decline experienced in the commercial portfolio. This was a slower decline than what we had been experiencing in prior quarters and we believe we are near an inflection point in the loan portfolio where it will begin to show growth in average balances. While our clients remain somewhat cautious compared to prior recoveries, our lending pipelines are solid and we are actively supporting our clients’ borrowing needs. Compared to June 30, 2011, ending balance of total loans increased 355 million or .7%. For more information on balance sheet carrying value, see Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the headings “Loans” and “Loans Held for Sale” on page 101 of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Commercial loan portfolio  Commercial loans outstanding were $33.2 billion at September 30, 2011, a decrease of $2.2 billion, or 6%, since September 30, 2010. This decrease was caused by continued soft demand for credit due to our clients’ use of the capital markets to raise debt and equity, and pay downs on our portfolios as clients continue to deleverage. Another reason for our commercial loan decreases are due to run-off in our exit loan portfolio as we continue to reduce our risk. Compared to June 30, 2011, our ending commercial loans increased by $531 million, or 1.6%.  Commercial, financial and agricultural. Our Commercial, Financial and Agricultural loans, also referred to as “Commercial and Industrial,” represent 37% of our total loan portfolio at September 30, 2011, 33% at December 31, 2010 and 32% at September 30, 2010 and are the largest component of our total loans. These loans are comprised of fixed and variable rate loans to our large, middle market and small business clients. These loans increased $1.4 billion or 8% from one year ago. As compared to the second quarter of 2011, quarterly average loan balances have increased approximately $459 million, or 2.7%, due to increased activity in our industrial sectors and middle market lending in all three of our regions.  Commercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans represent approximately 20% of our total loan portfolio. These loans include both owner and nonowner-occupied properties and constitute approximately 28% of our commercial loan portfolio. These loans have decreased $3 billion, or 24%, to $9.4 billion at September 30, 2011, from $12.4 billion at September 30, 2010. When compared to the second quarter of 2011, these loans have decreased by $286 million. This quarterly decrease is the result of continued market liquidity for these assets.  As shown in Figure 17, at September 30, 2011, our commercial real estate portfolio included mortgage loans of $7.9 billion and construction loans of $1.5 billion, representing 17% and 3%, respectively, of our total loans. Nonowner-occupied loans represented 12% of our total loans and owner-occupied loans represented 7% of our total loans. The average size of mortgage loans originated during the third quarter of 2011 was $3.2 million, and our largest mortgage loan at September 30, 2011, had a balance of $65 million. At September 30, 2011, our average construction loan commitment was $3.7 million. Our largest construction loan commitment was $56 million, and our largest construction amount outstanding was $48 million.  Our commercial real estate lending business is conducted through two primary sources: our 14-state banking franchise, and KeyBank Real Estate Capital, a national line of business that cultivates relationships both within and beyond the branch system. This line of business deals primarily with nonowner-occupied properties (generally properties for which at least 50% of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties) and accounted for approximately 56% of our average year-to-date commercial real estate loans during the third quarter of 2011, compared to 61% one year ago. Our commercial real estate business generally focuses on larger owners and operators of commercial real estate.

For the period 2008 – 2010, the secondary market for income-property loans was severely constrained. During this period of time, we provided interim financing for certain maturing income property loans. Beginning with the second half of 2010 and continuing throughout the third quarter of 2011, market liquidity for income property loans showed significant improvement. Consequently, our clients’ need for interim financing has diminished and our portfolio of nonowner-occupied income property loans has shown a steady decrease in outstanding principal balances. Since September 30, 2010, our nonowner occupied commercial real estate portfolio has been reduced by approximately $2.6 billion, or 30%. Nonetheless, there are circumstances where a client requests a loan extension. In cases where the loan terms were extended at less than normal market rates for similar lending arrangements, we have transferred these loans to the Asset Recovery Group for resolution. During the first nine months of 2011, there were $168 million of new restructured loans included in nonperforming loans, of which $56 million related to commercial real estate.  As shown in Figure 17, at September 30, 2011, 64% of our commercial real estate loans were for nonowner-occupied properties compared to 69% at September 30, 2010. Approximately 21% and 28% of these loans were construction loans at September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Typically, these properties are not fully leased at the origination of the loan. The borrower relies upon additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide the cash flow necessary to support debt service payments. Uncertain economic conditions generally slow the execution of new leases and may also lead to the turnover of existing leases, driving rental rates and occupancy rates down. As we have experienced during the first nine months of 2011, we expect vacancy rates for retail, office and industrial space to remain elevated and may possibly further increase into 2012.  Commercial real estate fundamentals are bottoming, and for certain sectors (i.e., apartments) showing signs of improvement. According to Property and Portfolio Research, Inc., vacancy declined modestly across the four major property sectors in 2010 (with significant declines in apartment vacancy). Rent growth, however, remains negative for retail and industrial and basically flat for office. Rents should be nearing their trough, but are unlikely to post any meaningful gains over the near-term. If there is an interruption in the slow improvement in market fundamentals, any resulting effect would likely be most noticeable in the nonowner-occupied properties segment of our commercial real estate loan portfolio, particularly in the retail properties and office buildings components, which comprise 23% of our commercial real estate loans.  Commercial property values peaked in the Fall of 2007, having experienced increases of approximately 30% since 2005 and 90% since 2001. The most recent Moody’s Real Estate Analytics, LLC Commercial Property Price Index (July 2011) shows a 43% drop in values from the peak in October 2007. As of July 2011, the index is now at 110%, a 12.6% increase from April    85    Table of Contents  2011. April 2011 was the lowest point since the inception of the index in December of 2000. Market averages obscure divergent trends by asset quality and location. Over the past year, competition for the best assets in the top markets has driven prices higher, while weak demand and continued uncertainty is keeping prices for distressed assets low (and keeping trends negative).  If the factors described above result in further weakening in the fundamentals underlying the commercial real estate market (i.e., vacancy rates, the stability of rental income and asset values), leading to reduced cash flow to support debt service payments, our ability to collect such payments and the strength of our commercial real estate loan portfolio could be adversely affected.  Commercial lease financing. We conduct financing arrangements through our Key Equipment Finance line of business and have both the scale and array of products to compete in the equipment lease financing business. Commercial lease financing receivables represented 18% of commercial loans at September 30, 2011, and 19% at September 30, 2010.  Commercial loan modification and restructuring  Certain commercial loans are modified and extended in the normal course of business for our clients. Loan modifications vary and are handled on a case by case basis with strategies responsive to the specific circumstances of each loan and borrower. In many cases, borrowers have other resources and can reinforce the credit with additional capital, collateral, guarantees or income sources.  Modifications are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan credit quality while at the same time meeting our clients’ financing needs. Modifications made to loans of creditworthy borrowers not experiencing financial difficulties and under circumstances where ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt are not classified as TDRs. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, TDR classification occurs when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a creditor concession has been granted.  Our concession types are primarily categorized as interest rate reductions, principal deferral, or forgiveness of principal. Loan extensions are sometimes coupled with these primary concession types. With improving economic conditions and the restructuring of these loans to provide the optimal opportunity for successful repayment by the borrower, we have seen successes as measured by restructured loans returning to accrual status and consistent performance according to the restructured loan terms in each primary type of concession over the last three quarters.  For more information on concession types for our commercial accruing and nonaccruing TDRs, see Note 4 (“Asset Quality”).  Figure 18 quantifies restructured loans, TDRs, using our three-note structure.  Figure 18.

Right-sizing the A note to sustainable cash flow should ultimately allow for its return to accrual status and thereupon a resumption of interest income recognition. Similarly, appropriately-sized A notes will allow for upgraded credit classification based on rehabilitated credit metrics including demonstrated payment performance. Other benefits include the borrower’s retention of ownership and    86    Table of Contents  control of the asset, deleveraged and sustainable capital structure (often sufficient to attract fresh capital into the transaction) and rehabilitation of local markets by minimizing distressed/fire sales.  As the objective of the multiple-note TDR is to achieve a fully performing and well-rated A note, we focus on sizing the A note to a level that is supported by cash flow available to service debt at current market terms and consistent with our customary underwriting standards. This typically will include a debt coverage ratio of 1.2 or better of cash flow to monthly payments of market interest and principal amortization of generally not more than 25 years.  The B note is typically an interest-only note with no required amortization until the property stabilizes and generates excess cash flow which is customarily applied directly to principal. The B note is subsequently evaluated at such time when accrual restoration of the A note is under consideration. In many cases, the B note has then been charged-off contemporaneously with the A note being returned to accrual status. Alternatively, both A and B notes may be simultaneously returned to accrual if credit metrics are supportive as set forth above. In many cases where a three note structure (A, B, C) has been utilized, the C notes are fully charged-off at the time of the TDR. In the very few instances where the C note is not charged-off, there is a pending equity event, additional leasing or pending sale of developed units that support the C note balance shortly after the TDR.  All loans processed as a TDR, including A notes and any non-charged-off B or C notes, are reported as TDRs during the year in which they are consummated. Returning an A note to accrual status requires a reasonable level of certainty that the balance of principal and interest is fully collectable over time.  Our policy requires a sustained period of timely principal and interest payments to restore a loan to accrual status. Primary repayment derived from property cash flow is evaluated for risk of continued sustainability while secondary repayment (collateral) is appraised to ensure that market value exceeds the carrying value of the A note with a sufficient excess (generally 20%). Although our policy is a guideline, considerable judgment is required to review each borrower’s circumstances.  Extensions. Certain commercial loans are modified and extended in the normal course of business for our clients. Project loans are typically refinanced into the permanent commercial loan market at maturity; however, due to the limited sources of permanent commercial mortgage financing available in the market today and the market-wide decline in leasing activity and rental rates, an increased number of loans have been extended. Extension terms take into account the specific circumstances of the client relationship, the status of the project and near-term prospects for both the client and the collateral. In all cases, pricing and loan structure are reviewed and (where necessary) modified to ensure the loan has been priced to achieve a market rate of return and loan terms (i.e., amortization, covenants and term) that are appropriate for the risk. Typical enhancements include one or more of the following: principal paydown, increased amortization, additional collateral, increased guarantees, and/or a cash flow sweep. As previously mentioned, some maturing construction loans have automatic extension options built in and in those cases where the borrower qualifies for the extension option, pricing and loan terms cannot be altered. Most project loans by their nature are “collateral-dependent” as cash flow from the project loans or the sale of the real estate provides for repayment of the loan.  Pricing of a loan is determined based on the strength of the borrowing entity and the strength of the guarantor, if any. Therefore, pricing may remain the same (e.g., the loan is already priced at or above current market). We do not consider loan extensions in the normal course of business (under existing loan terms or at market rates) as TDRs, particularly when ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt and no concession has been made. In the case of loan extensions outside of the normal course of business—where either collection of all principal and interest is uncertain or a concession has been made, we would analyze such credit under the accounting guidance to determine whether it qualifies as a TDR. Extensions that qualify as TDRs are measured for impairment under the applicable accounting guidance.  Guarantors. A detailed guarantor analysis is conducted (1) for all new extensions of credit, (2) at the time of any material modification/extension, and (3) typically annually, as part of our on-going portfolio and loan monitoring procedures. This analysis includes submission by the guarantor entity of all appropriate financial statements including balance sheets, income statements, tax returns, and real estate schedules.  While the specific steps of each guarantor analysis may have some minor differences, the high level objectives include reaching a conclusion regarding the overall financial conditions of the guarantor entities, including: size, quality, and nature of asset base; net worth (adjusted to reflect our opinion of market value); leverage; standing liquidity; recurring cash flow; contingent and direct debt obligations; and near term debt maturities.    87    Table of Contents Borrower and guarantor financial statements are required at least annually within 90-120 days of the calendar/fiscal year end. Income statements and rent rolls for project collateral are required quarterly. In some cases, disclosure of certain information including liquidity, certifications, status of asset sales or debt resolutions, and real estate schedules may be required more frequently.  We routinely seek performance from guarantors of impaired debt, if the guarantor is solvent. In limited circumstances, we would not seek to enforce the guaranty, including situations in which we are precluded by bankruptcy and/or it is determined the cost to pursue a guarantor exceeds the value to be returned given the guarantor’s verified financial condition. We are often successful in obtaining either monetary payment and/or the cooperation of our solvent guarantors to help mitigate loss, cost and the expense of collections.  As of September 30, 2011, we had $262 million of mortgage and construction loans that had a loan to value ratio greater than 1.0, and were accounted for as performing loans. These loans were not considered impaired due to one or more of the following factors: underlying cash flow adequate to service the debt at a market rate of return with adequate amortization; a satisfactory borrower payment history; and acceptable guarantor support.  Consumer loan portfolio  Consumer loans outstanding decreased by $940 million, or 6%, from one year ago. Most of the decrease is attributable to the marine segment, which is included in our exit portfolio, as shown in Figure 35 in the “Credit risk management” section.  The home equity portfolio is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio. Virtually this entire portfolio (94% at September 30, 2011) is derived primarily from our Key Community Bank. The remainder of the portfolio, which has been in an exit mode since the fourth quarter of 2007, was originated from the Consumer Finance line of business and is now included in Other Segments. Home equity loans from Key Community Bank decreased by $308 million, or 3%, over the past twelve months.  Figure 19 summarizes our home equity loan portfolio by source at the end of each of the last five quarters, as well as certain asset quality statistics and yields on the portfolio as a whole.

As previously reported, we have experienced a decrease in our consumer loan portfolio. We expect that the portfolio will continue to decrease in future periods as a result of our actions to exit dealer-originated home equity loans and indirect retail lending for marine and recreational vehicle products. We ceased originating new education loans effective December 5, 2009 and account for this business in discontinued operations.  In the latter half of 2010, there was public controversy surrounding the foreclosure practices of large home lenders. Our number of home loan foreclosures is small (the average number of new mortgage foreclosures serviced by Key and third parties, initiated per month, through September 30, 2011 was 121; mortgage loans serviced by Key and third parties outstanding at September 30, 2011 were approximately 225,000 loans) and primarily have occurred in our home equity loan portfolio. A review of our foreclosure processes completed in the first quarter of 2011 did not uncover any material defects in the process of signing and notarizing affidavits.    88    Table of Contents Loans held for sale  As shown in Note 3 (“Loans and Loans Held for Sale”), our loans held for sale increased to $ 479 million at September 30, 2011 from $467 million at December 31, 2010 and totaled $637 million at September 30, 2010. Loans held for sale related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business, which are excluded from total loans held for sale at December 31, 2010 and September 30, 2010, totaled $15 million and $15 million, respectively. There were no loans held for sale related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business at September 30, 2011.  At September 30, 2011, loans held for sale included $325 million of commercial mortgages, which decreased by $2 million from September 30, 2010, and $79 million of residential mortgage loans, which decreased $13 million from September 30, 2010.  Loan sales  As shown in Figure 20, during the first nine months of 2011, we sold $1.5 billion of commercial real estate loans, $991 million of residential real estate loans, and $87 million of commercial loans. Most of these sales came from the held-for-sale portfolio.  Figure 20 summarizes our loan sales for the first nine months of 2011 and all of 2010.  Figure 20.

Additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in Note 12 (“Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) under the heading “Recourse agreement with FNMA.”  We derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold. We earn noninterest income (recorded as “other income”) from fees for servicing or administering loans. This fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets. In addition, we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing of commercial real estate loans.    89    Table of Contents Securities  Our securities portfolio totaled $18.8 billion at September 30, 2011, compared to $22.0 billion at December 31, 2010, and $21.3 billion at September 30, 2010. Held-to-maturity securities were $1.2 billion at September 30, 2011, compared to $17 million at December 31, 2010, primarily reflecting increases in agency mortgage-backed securities, as we increased our on-balance sheet liquidity in response to potential future changes in regulatory capital rules. At September 30, 2011, we had $1.2 billion in CMOs in our held-to-maturity securities portfolio.  Securities available for sale  The majority of our securities available-for-sale portfolio consists of CMOs, which are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities. CMOs generate interest income and serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements. At September 30, 2011, we had $17.5 billion invested in CMOs and other mortgage-backed securities in the available-for-sale portfolio, compared to $21.7 billion at December 31, 2010 and $21.1 billion at September 30, 2010.  As shown in Figure 22, all of our mortgage-backed securities are issued by government-sponsored enterprises or GNMA, and are traded in highly liquid secondary markets and recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. For more information about these securities, see Note 5 (“Fair Value Measurements”) under the heading “Qualitative Disclosures of Valuation Techniques.”  Figure 22. Mortgage-Backed Securities by Issuer                    in millions   September 30,2011     December 31,2010     September 30,2010     FHLMC   $ 8,885     $ 10,373     $ 9,759     FNMA     5,962       7,357       7,060     GNMA     3,843       4,004       4,248     Total   $ 18,690 (a)   $ 21,734     $ 21,067                                                                   (a) includes both available for sale and held-to-maturity securities.  During the first nine months of 2011, we had net gains of $251 million from CMOs and other mortgage-backed securities, of which $253 million were net unrealized gains and $2 million were net realized losses. The net unrealized gains resulted from a decrease in market interest rates and were recorded in the AOCI component of shareholders’ equity. We continue to maintain a moderate asset-sensitive exposure to near-term changes in interest rates.  We periodically evaluate our securities available-for-sale portfolio in light of established A/LM objectives, changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio, and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. These evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning.  In addition, the size and composition of our securities available-for-sale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required (or elect) to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits. Although we generally use debt securities for this purpose, other assets, such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit, are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles.  During the third quarter of 2011, our investing activities continued to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs. In the first half of 2011, we chose not to reinvest the monthly security cash flows during February and March and also sold approximately $1.6 billion of CMOs. These actions provided the liquidity necessary to address the funding requirements arising from the loss of certain escrow deposit balances related to commercial mortgage securitizations serviced by Key and rated by Moody’s, and also contributed to our preparations for TARP repayment in March 2011.  Figure 23 shows the composition, yields and remaining maturities of our securities available for sale.

Held-to-maturity securities  Federal Agency CMOs, constitute most of our held-to-maturity securities along with foreign bonds and preferred equity securities.

(b) Excludes $5 million of securities at September 30, 2011, that have no stated yield.    91    Table of Contents Other investments  Principal investments — investments in equity and mezzanine instruments made by our Principal Investing unit — represented 63% of other investments at September 30, 2011. They include direct investments (investments made in a particular company) as well as indirect investments (investments made through funds that include other investors). Principal investments are predominantly made in privately held companies and are carried at fair value ($759 million at September 30, 2011, $898 million at December 31, 2010, and $945 million at September 30, 2010). During the first half of 2011, employees who managed our various principal investments formed two independent entities that will serve as investment managers of these investments going forward. Under this arrangement, which was mutually agreeable to both parties, these individuals are no longer employees of Key. As a result of these changes, during the second quarter of 2011, we deconsolidated certain of these direct and indirect investments, totaling $234 million.  In addition to principal investments, “other investments” include other equity and mezzanine instruments, such as certain real estate-related investments that are carried at fair value, as well as other types of investments that generally are carried at cost.  Most of our other investments are not traded on an active market. We determine the fair value at which these investments should be recorded based on the nature of the specific investment and all available relevant information. Among other things, our review may encompass such factors as the issuer’s past financial performance and future potential, the values of public companies in comparable businesses, the risks associated with the particular business or investment type, current market conditions, the nature and duration of resale restrictions, the issuer’s payment history, our knowledge of the industry and third party data. During the first nine months of 2011, net gains from our principal investing activities (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) totaled $86 million, which includes $67 million of net unrealized gains. These net gains are recorded as “net gains (losses) from principal investing” on the income statement.  Deposits and other sources of funds  Domestic deposits are our primary source of funding. During the third quarter of 2011, these deposits averaged $58.2 billion and represented 81% of the funds we used to support loans and other earning assets, compared to $60.9 billion and 79% during the same quarter in 2010. The composition of our average deposits is shown in Figure 6 in the section entitled “Net interest income.”  The decrease in average domestic deposits in the third quarter of 2011, compared to the third quarter of 2010, was due to a decline in certificates of deposit ($100,000 or more) and other time deposits and was partially offset by an increase in NOW and money market deposit accounts, and noninterest-bearing deposits. The mix of deposits continues to change as higher-costing certificates of deposit mature and re-price to current market rates and clients move their balances to transaction and nonmaturity deposit accounts, such as NOW and money market savings accounts, or look for other alternatives for investing in the current low-rate environment.  Compared to the second quarter of 2011, we experienced a $1.2 billion or 2.8%, unannualized increase in non-time deposits during the third quarter of 2011, as our improved mix of deposits continued. The average balances of time deposits declined approximately $700 million during the third quarter of 2011. At September 30, 2011, we had $11.2 billion in time deposits outstanding and approximately 74% of the certificates of deposit outstanding will mature over the next five quarters. The weighted average rate paid on new and renewed certificates of deposit was 0.25%.  Wholesale funds, consisting of deposits in our foreign office and short-term borrowings, averaged $3 billion during the third quarter of 2011, compared to $3.9 billion during the year-ago quarter. The change from the third quarter of 2010 resulted from a $283 million decrease in foreign office deposits, a $576 million decrease in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and a $71 million decrease in bank notes and other short-term borrowings.  The Dodd-Frank Act’s reform of deposit insurance  The Dodd-Frank Act made permanent the current FDIC standard maximum deposit insurance coverage limit of $250,000, and provided for temporary unlimited FDIC deposit insurance until January 1, 2013, for non interest-bearing demand transaction accounts, including Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts, for all insured depository institutions effective December 31, 2010 (concurrent with the expiration date of the current TAG Program extension). Since December 31, 2010, KeyBank    92    Table of Contents  has offered noninterest-bearing demand transaction accounts, with unlimited FDIC deposit insurance, similar to when we participated in the TAG.  Substantially all of KeyBank’s domestic deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. The FDIC assesses an insured depository institution an amount for deposit insurance premiums equal to its deposit insurance assessment base times a risk-based assessment rate. Under the risk-based assessment system, effective for the first quarter of 2011, annualized deposit insurance premium assessments ranged from $.07 to $.775 for each $100 of assessable domestic deposits based on the institution’s risk category.  As discussed in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K on page 9 in the section titled “Federal Deposit Insurance Act,” under the heading “Deposit Insurance Assessments”, in order to adhere to the requirements imposed upon the DIF by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC adopted a final rule, effective April 1, 2011, changing the basis for assessments from domestic deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, and implementing a new assessment system. Under the new assessment system, KeyBank’s annualized deposit insurance premium assessments would range from $.025 to $.45 for each $100 of its new assessment base, depending on its new scorecard performance incorporating KeyBank’s regulatory rating, ability to withstand asset and funding related stress, and relative magnitude of potential losses to the FDIC in the event of KeyBank’s failure. We estimate that our 2011 expense for deposit insurance assessments will be approximately $55 million. As the end of the quarter, we had $329 million of prepaid FDIC insurance assessments remaining on our balance sheet from our December 2009 prepayment of 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 estimated assessments. Prepayment was required of depository institutions under the FDIC’s restoration plan for the DIF.  Subsequent to the effective date of the new FDIC assessment system discussed above, on April 15, 2011, the FDIC published a Notice of Proposed Assessment Rate Adjustment Guidelines in the Federal Register. The guidelines describe the process that the FDIC would follow to determine whether an adjustment, upward or downward, to the score used to calculate the assessment rate for a large or highly complex institution, such as KeyBank, should be made; and to notify an institution of an adjustment, if any. The proposal sets forth guidelines for the FDIC’s use of its ability to adjust a large institution’s assessment rate provided for under the new assessment effective April 1, 2011. Comments on the proposed guidelines were due by May 31, 2011. If the FDIC determined KeyBank to have an upward adjustment our assessment could be affected thereby increasing our FDIC insurance assessments.    93    Table of Contents Capital  At September 30, 2011, our shareholders’ equity was $9.9 billion, down $1.2 billion from December 31, 2010. The following discusses certain factors that contributed to the change in our shareholders’ equity. For other factors that contributed to the change, see the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity (Unaudited).  As previously reported, on January 1, 2010, we adopted new consolidation accounting guidance which required us to consolidate our education loan securitization trusts (classified as discontinued assets and liabilities), thereby adding $2.8 billion in assets and liabilities to our balance sheet. As a result of adopting this new guidance, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment (after-tax) of $45 million to beginning retained earnings on January 1, 2010. During the third quarter of 2011, we determined that the $45 million cumulative effect adjustment made related to the consolidation of these trusts on January 1, 2010 was incorrect. Further information regarding this error and its correction is provided in Note 11 (“Divestiture and Discontinued Operations”).  Updated comprehensive capital plan and redemption notices for certain capital securities  On June 10, 2011, we submitted to the Federal Reserve and provided to the OCC an updated Comprehensive Capital Plan, which set forth additional capital actions related to redemptions of certain outstanding capital securities. On August 1, 2011, the Federal Reserve informed us that it had no objections to the capital actions set forth in our updated capital plan.  On September 1, 2011, KeyCorp fully redeemed the following capital securities: KeyCorp Capital V, KeyCorp Capital VI, KeyCorp Capital VIII, and Union State Capital I. As previously reported, on September 1, 2011, KeyCorp submitted notices to the property trustee for the redemption in full of the capital securities issued by Union State Statutory Trust II and Union State Statutory Trust IV. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, capital securities issued by Union State Statutory Trust II and Union State Statutory Trust IV were redeemed on October 31, 2011 and October 7, 2011, respectively. Additionally, in August 2011, KeyCorp repurchased $22.6 million of capital securities issued by KeyCorp Capital VII.  On October 31, 2011, KeyCorp submitted notice to the property trustee for the redemption in full of the capital securities issued by KeyCorp Capital IX; such capital securities will be redeemed on December 15, 2011.  Provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act provide for the phase-out of Tier 1 capital treatment for capital securities beginning in 2013. As a result, the outstanding capital securities will eventually become Tier 2 capital. Management continues to evaluate its options with respect to the outstanding capital securities. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve has until January 21, 2012 to issue the relevant regulations.  Repurchase of TARP CPP preferred stock, warrant and completion of equity and debt offerings  As previously reported, Key completed the repurchase of the $2.5 billion of Series B Preferred Stock and corresponding warrant issued to the U.S. Treasury Department. As a result of the repurchase, we recorded a $49 million one-time deemed dividend in the first quarter of 2011 related to the remaining difference between the repurchase price and the carrying value of the preferred shares at the time of repurchase. Beginning with the second quarter of 2011, the repurchase resulted in the elimination of quarterly dividends of $31 million and discount amortization of $4 million, or $140 million on an annual basis, related to these preferred shares. In total, Key paid $2.867 billion to the U.S. Treasury during the investment period in the form of dividends, principal and repurchase of the warrant, resulting in a return to the U.S. Treasury of $367 million above the initial investment of $2.5 billion on November 14, 2008.  Dividends  During the first quarter of 2011, we made dividend payments of $31 million to the U.S. Treasury on the Series B Preferred Stock as a participant in the U.S. Treasury’s TARP CPP. The repurchase of this Preferred Stock in March 2011 eliminated future quarterly dividends of $31 million, or $125 million on an annual basis.  During the third quarter of 2011, we made a dividend payment of $1.9375 per share or $5 million on our Series A Preferred Stock.  During the second quarter of 2011, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $.03 per Common Share or $.12 on an annualized basis. As a result, during the third quarter of 2011, we made a dividend payment of $.03 per share, or $29 million, on our Common Shares.    94    Table of Contents Common shares outstanding  Our Common Shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol KEY. At September 30, 2011 our book value per Common Share was $10.09 based on 952.8 million shares outstanding at September 30, 2011, compared to $9.52 based on 880.6 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2010, and $9.54 based on 880.3 million shares outstanding at September 30, 2010. At September 30, 2011 our tangible book value per Common Share was $9.10 compared to $8.45 at December 31, 2010, and $8.46 at September 30, 2010.  Figure 25 shows activities that caused the change in outstanding Common Shares over the past five quarters.  Figure 25.

At September 30, 2011, we had 64.2 million treasury shares, compared to 65.7 million treasury shares at December 31, 2010 and 66.0 million treasury shares at September 30, 2010. Going forward we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stock-based compensation awards and for other corporate purposes.  In the past we have periodically repurchased Common Shares, for employee benefit plans without regulatory approval, in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions under a repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors. The existing program does not have an expiration date, and we have outstanding Board authority to repurchase 13.9 million shares. We did not repurchase any Common Shares during the first nine months of 2011 or all of 2010. Regulatory approval will be required for any future Common Share repurchases, including under the existing Board authority.  Capital plan and proposed actions  As part of its ongoing supervisory process, the Federal Reserve requires a BHC to submit an annual Comprehensive Capital Plan as well as to update such plan to reflect material changes in a firm’s risk profile, business strategies, or corporate structure, including but not limited to changes in planned capital actions. On January 7, 2011, we submitted our Comprehensive Capital Plan to the Federal Reserve. On March 18, 2011, the Federal Reserve informed us that it had no objection to our Comprehensive Capital Plan following its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”).  On June 10, 2011, we submitted to the Federal Reserve and provided to the OCC an updated Comprehensive Capital Plan, which set forth additional capital actions related to redemptions of certain outstanding capital securities. On August 1, 2011, the Federal Reserve informed us that it had no objections to the capital actions set forth in our updated capital plan.  We are in the process of finalizing our 2012 profit and capital plan at this time. This is critical input to our CCAR submission that we expect to complete during the fourth quarter of 2011 and submit to the regulators with our 2012 capital actions request. As we update our stress scenarios like others in the industry, we will need to incorporate into our analysis the regulatory stress scenario once it is available. Our priorities with respect to capital management will include reviewing for a possible dividend increase and seeking authority for potential share repurchases. However, until we have additional transparency into the 2012 CCAR process, we are not able state what actions, if any we may be able to take.  As previously reported, on August 2, 2011, KeyCorp submitted redemption notices to the property trustee for the redemption in full of each of the following capital securities: KeyCorp Capital V, KeyCorp Capital VI, KeyCorp Capital VIII, and Union State Capital I.  For a discussion of the Federal Reserve’s proposed rule on capital plans see the section titled Supervision and Regulation under the heading “Capital Plan Proposal.”    95    Table of Contents Capital adequacy  Capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance. All of our capital ratios remain in excess of regulatory requirements at September 30, 2011. Our capital and liquidity are intended to position us well to weather an adverse credit cycle while continuing to serve our clients’ needs, as well as to adjust to the application of any new regulatory capital standards expected to be promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act or due to Basel III. Our shareholders’ equity to assets ratio was 11.09% at September 30, 2011, compared to 12.10% at December 31, 2010 and 11.84% at September 30, 2010. Our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 9.82% at September 30, 2011, compared to 8.19% at December 31, 2010 and 8.00% at September 30, 2010.  Banking industry regulators prescribe minimum capital ratios for bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries. Risk-based capital guidelines require a minimum level of capital as a percent of “risk-weighted assets.” Risk-weighted assets consist of total assets plus certain off-balance sheet and market items, subject to adjustment for predefined credit risk factors. Currently, banks and bank holding companies must maintain, at a minimum, Tier 1 capital as a percent of risk-weighted assets of 4.00% and total capital as a percent of risk-weighted assets of 8.00%. We expect U.S. regulators to introduce new regulatory capital guidelines later this year, responding to both the Dodd Frank Act and Basel III capital directives. As of September 30, 2011, our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and our total risk-based capital ratios were 13.49% and 17.05%, respectively, compared to 15.16% and 19.12%, respectively, at December 31, 2010.  Another indicator of capital adequacy, the leverage ratio, is defined as Tier 1 capital as a percentage of average quarterly tangible assets. Bank holding companies that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the Federal Reserve’s risk-adjusted measure for market risk — as we have — must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 3.00%. All other bank holding companies must maintain a minimum ratio of 4.00%. As of September 30, 2011, our leverage ratio was 11.93% compared to 13.02% at December 31, 2010.  The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to bank holding companies by requiring regulators to create rules phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities being eligible Tier 1 risk-based capital.  This three year phase-out period, which commences January 1, 2013, will ultimately result in our capital securities issued by the KeyCorp and the Union State Bank capital trusts (“capital securities”) being treated only as Tier 2 capital. These changes in effect apply the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to depository institutions to BHCs, savings and loan holding companies, and nonbank financial companies identified as systemically important.  As of September 30, 2011, our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, leverage ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio were 13.49%, 11.93%, and 17.05%, respectively. The capital securities issued by the KeyCorp capital trusts contribute $1.4 billion or 182, 161, and 182 basis points to our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio, respectively, as of September 30, 2011.  Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950, prompt corrective action standards, Federal bank regulators group FDIC-insured depository institutions into five categories, ranging from “well capitalized” to “critically undercapitalized.” A “well capitalized” institution must meet or exceed the prescribed thresholds of 6.00% for Tier 1 risk-based capital, 5.00% for Tier 1 leverage capital, and 10.00% for total risk-based capital and must not be subject to any written agreement, order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. If these provisions applied to bank holding companies, we would qualify as “well capitalized” at September 30, 2011. We believe there has not been any change in condition or event since that date that would cause our capital classification to change. Analysis on a pro forma basis, accounting for the phase-out of our capital securities as Tier 1 eligible (and therefore as Tier 2 instead) as of September 30, 2011, also determines that we would qualify as “well capitalized” under current regulatory guidelines, with the pro forma Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, pro forma leverage ratio, and pro forma total risk-based capital ratio being 11.66%, 10.32%, and 17.05%, respectively. The current regulatory defined categories serve a limited supervisory function. Investors should not use our pro forma ratios as a representation of our overall financial condition or prospects of KeyCorp or KeyBank.  Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. As a result of the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has intensified its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 risk-based capital, known as Tier 1 common equity, and its review of the consolidated capitalization of systemically important financial companies, including KeyCorp. Because the Federal Reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders’ equity (essentially Tier 1 risk-based capital less preferred stock, qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in Tier 1 risk-based capital, such a focus is consistent with existing    96    Table of Contents  capital adequacy guidelines and does not imply a new or ongoing capital standard. The capital modifications mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act and set forth in Basel III are consistent with the renewed focus on Tier 1 common equity and the consolidated capitalization of banks, BHCs, and covered nonbank financial companies, which resulted from the financial crisis. Because Tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by GAAP nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations, this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. Figure 5 in the “Highlights of Our Performance” section reconciles Key shareholders’ equity, the GAAP performance measure, to Tier 1 common equity, the corresponding non-GAAP measure. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio was 11.28% at September 30, 2011, compared to 9.34% at December 31, 2010, and 8.61% at September 30, 2010.  At September 30, 2011, we had a consolidated federal net deferred tax asset of $62 million and a state deferred tax liability of $29 million compared to combined net federal and state deferred tax assets of $442 million at December 31, 2010 and $389 million at September 30, 2010. Prior to the third quarter of 2009, we had been in a net deferred tax liability position. Generally, for risk-based capital purposes, deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income are limited to the lesser of: (i) the amount of deferred tax assets that a financial institution expects to realize within one year of the calendar quarter-end date, based on its projected future taxable income for the year, or (ii) 10% of the amount of an institution’s Tier 1 capital. Based on these restrictions, at September 30, 2011, we had no net deferred tax assets deducted from Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets compared to $158 million at December 31, 2010 and $277 million at September 30, 2010. We anticipate that we will not have a net deferred tax asset disallowed for risk-based capital purposes as we believe we will be in a net deferred tax liability position in the coming quarters.  Basel III  In December 2010, the Basel Committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation (“Basel III”). Basel III is a comprehensive set of reform measures designed to strengthen the regulation, supervision and risk management of the banking sector. A more thorough discussion of Basel III is included in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K in the “Supervision and Regulation” section beginning on page 5, as well as in our Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2011 on page 94.  While the U.S banking regulators have yet to adopt Basel III, on January 1, 2013, banks with regulators adopting the Basel III capital framework in full would be required to meet the following minimum capital ratios – 3.5% common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets, 4.5% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and 8.0% total capital to risk-weighted assets. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer will begin on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% and be phased in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019).  Basel III introduces for the first time an official definition and specific guideline minimums for Tier 1 common equity. When the requirements for the capital conservation buffer are included, the resulting minimum levels for Tier 1 capital and total risk-based capital will be higher than the U.S.’s current “well-capitalized” minimums.  The U.S. bank regulatory agencies have not yet set forth a formal timeline for a notice of proposed rulemaking or final adoption of regulations responsive to Basel III. However, they have indicated informally that a notice of proposed rulemaking likely will be released in the near future, with final amendments to regulations being adopted in mid-2012. Given our strong capital position, we expect to be able to satisfy the Basel III capital framework should U.S. capital regulations corresponding to it be finalized. While we also have a strong liquidity position, the Basel III liquidity framework could require us and other U.S. banks to initiate additional liquidity management initiatives, including adding additional liquid assets, issuing term debt, and modifying our product pricing for loans, commitments, and deposits. U.S. regulators have indicated that they may elect to make certain refinements to the Basel III liquidity framework. Accordingly, at this point it is premature to assess the impact of the Basel III liquidity framework.  Figure 26 represents the details of our regulatory capital position at September 30, 2011, December 31, 2010, and September 30, 2010.    97    Table of Contents Figure 26.

The most significant risks we face are credit, liquidity, market, compliance, operational, strategic and reputation risks. We must properly and effectively identify, assess, measure, monitor, control and report such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability. Certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section.  Our ERM Committee, which consists of the Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives, is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite. The ERM Program encompasses our risk philosophy, policy, framework and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company. The ERM Committee reports to the Risk Management Committee of our Board of Directors. Annually, the Board of Directors reviews and approves the ERM Program, as well as the risk appetite and corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories. We use a risk-adjusted capital framework to manage risks. This framework is approved and managed by the ERM Committee.  Our Board of Directors serves in an oversight capacity with the objective of managing our enterprise-wide risks in a manner that is effective, balanced and adds value for the shareholders. The Board inquires about risk practices, reviews the portfolio of risks, compares actual risks to the risk appetite and tolerances, and receives regular reports about significant risks — both actual and emerging. To assist in these efforts, the Board has delegated primary oversight responsibility for risk to the Audit Committee and the Risk Management Committee.  The Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for internal audit; financial reporting; compliance risk and legal matters; the implementation, management and evaluation of operational risk and controls; information security and fraud risk; and evaluating the qualifications and independence of the independent auditors. The Audit Committee discusses policies related to risk assessment and risk management and the processes related to risk review and compliance.  The Risk Management Committee has responsibility for overseeing the management of credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk (including the actions taken to mitigate these risks), as well as reputational and strategic risks. The Risk Management Committee also oversees the maintenance of appropriate regulatory and economic capital. The Risk Management Committee reviews the ERM reports and, approves any material changes to the charter of the ERM Committee.  The Audit and Risk Management Committees meet jointly, as appropriate, to discuss matters that relate to each committee’s responsibilities. In addition to regularly scheduled bi-monthly meetings, the Audit Committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases. Committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting. All members of the Board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months.  Federal banking regulators are reemphasizing with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution. We believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks, and comport with regulatory expectations.  Market risk management  The cash flows and values of financial instruments change as a function of changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices and other market factors that influence prospective yields, values or prices associated with the instrument. For example, the value of a fixed-rate bond will decline if market interest rates increase, while the cash flows associated with a variable rate loan will increase when interest rates increase. The holder of a financial instrument is exposed to “market risk” when the cash flows or value of the instrument is tied to such external factors. Most of our market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations.    99    Table of Contents Interest rate risk management  Interest rate risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the EVE. Such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates, and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. We manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the EVE in accordance with our risk appetite, and within policy limits established by the ERM Committee.  Interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products, economic conditions, the competitive environment within our markets and changes in market interest rates that affect client activity and our hedging, investing, funding and capital positions. The primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of basis risk, gap risk, yield curve risk and option risk.      ¿ “Gap risk” occurs if interest-bearing liabilities and the interest-earning assets they fund (for example, deposits used to fund loans) do not mature or reprice at the same time.      ¿ We face “basis risk” when floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities reprice at the same time, but in response to different market factors or indices. Under those circumstances, even if equal amounts of assets and liabilities are repricing, interest expense and interest income may not change by the same amount.      ¿  “Yield curve risk” is the exposure to non-parallel changes in the slope of the yield curve (where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity) if interest-bearing liabilities and the interest-earning assets they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve.      ¿ A financial instrument presents “option risk” when one party to the instrument can take advantage of changes in interest rates without penalty. For example, when interest rates decline, borrowers may choose to prepay fixed-rate loans and refinance at a lower rate. Unless there is a prepayment penalty, that return on the loan may not be as high as the return that would have been generated had payments been received over the original term of the loan. Deposits that can be withdrawn on demand also present option risk.  Net interest income simulation analysis. The primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis. For purposes of this analysis, we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on- and off-balance sheet positions accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity. The analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments, including a most likely macro economic scenario. Simulation modeling assumes that residual risk exposures will be managed to within the risk appetite.  Typically, the amount of net interest income at risk is measured by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if the federal funds target rate were to gradually increase or decrease by 200 basis points over the next twelve months, and term rates were to move in a similar fashion. In light of the low interest rate environment, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, we modified the standard rate scenario of a gradual decrease of 200 basis points over twelve months to a gradual decrease of 25 basis points over two months with no change over the following ten months. After calculating the amount of net interest income at risk to interest rate changes, we compare that amount with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment. We also perform regular stress tests and sensitivities on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments. One set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of interest rate inputs on simulated exposures. Assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve, including a sustained flat yield curve, an inverted slope yield curve, changes in credit spreads, an immediate parallel change in market interest rates and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates. Another set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of loan and deposit assumptions and assumed discretionary strategies on simulated exposures. Assessments are performed on changes to the following assumptions: the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities, changes in lending spreads, prepayments on loans and securities, other loan and deposit balance shifts, investment, funding and hedging activities, and liquidity and capital management strategies.  Simulation analysis produces only a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on judgments related to assumption inputs into the simulation model. We tailor assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled, and validate those assumptions on a regular basis. Our simulations are performed with the assumption that interest rate risk positions will be actively managed through the use of on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments to achieve the desired residual risk profile. However, actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the following inputs: balance sheet composition, customer behavior, product pricing, market interest    100    Table of Contents  rates, and investment, funding and hedging activities. Actual results may also differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events. Figure 27 presents the results of the simulation analysis at September 30, 2011 and 2010. At September 30, 2011, our simulated exposure to a change in short-term interest rates was moderately asset sensitive. ALCO policy limits for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual increase or decrease in short-term interest rates over the next twelve months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 4%. As shown in Figure 27, we are operating within these limits.  Figure 27. Simulated Change in Net Interest Income                 September 30, 2011                   Basis point change assumption (short-term rates)     -25        +200      ALCO policy limits     -4.00  %      -4.00  %    Interest rate risk assessment     -.65  %      2.67  %        September 30, 2010                   Basis point change assumption (short-term rates)     -25        +200      ALCO policy limits     -4.00  %      -4.00  %    Interest rate risk assessment     -.88  %      3.53  %   As interest rates have remained at low levels for an extended period of time, we have gradually shifted from a liability-sensitive position to an asset-sensitive position as a result of balance growth in transaction deposits and declines in loan balances. Although outstanding derivative hedge positions have declined over the past year due to contractual maturities, recent changes in the mix of customer deposits and the anticipation of a continuation of this shift served to offset the effect of the decline in hedges on the simulated exposure. Our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume, mix, maturity and re-pricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows. As changes occur to the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy, management evaluates hedging opportunities that would change the reported interest rate risk profile.  The results of additional simulation analyses that make use of alternative interest rate paths and customer behavior assumptions indicate that net interest income improvement in a rising rate environment could be diminished, and actual results may be different than the policy simulation results in Figure 27. Net interest income improvements are highly dependent on the timing, magnitude, frequency and path of interest rate increases and assumption inputs for deposit re-pricing relationships, lending spreads and the balance behavior of transaction accounts.  We also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a three-year horizon. These simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a twelve-month horizon. To capture longer-term exposures, we calculate exposures to changes to the EVE as discussed in the following section.  Economic value of equity modeling. EVE complements net interest income simulation analysis since it estimates risk exposure beyond twelve- and twenty-four and thirty-six month horizons. EVE measures the extent to which the economic values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates, and measuring the resulting change in the values of assets and liabilities under multiple interest rate paths. Under the current level of market interest rates, the calculation of EVE under an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest rates results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than 200 basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points. This analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities. Those assumptions are based on historical behaviors, as well as our expectations. We develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our EVE will decrease by more than 15% in response to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates. We are operating within these guidelines.  Management of interest rate exposure. We use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate Asset Liability Management strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures. Specifically, we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities, issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates, and using derivatives — predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps, which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities.    101    Table of Contents Figure 28 shows all swap positions which we hold for A/LM purposes. These positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. For example, fixed-rate debt is converted to a floating rate through a “receive fixed/pay variable” interest rate swap. The volume, maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader A/LM objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile, see Note 7 (“Derivatives and Hedging Activities”).  Figure 28.

Derivatives not designated in hedge relationships  Our derivatives that are not designated in hedge relationships are described in Note 7. We use a VAR simulation model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of this portfolio. Using two years of historical information, the model estimates the maximum potential one-day loss with a 95% confidence level. Statistically, this means that losses will exceed VAR, on average, five out of 100 trading days, or three to four times each quarter.  We manage exposure to market risk in accordance with VAR limits for trading activity that have been approved by the Market Risk Committee which was established as part of our ERM Program. At September 30, 2011, the aggregate one-day trading limit set by the committee was $5.5 million. We are operating within these constraints. During the first nine months of 2011, our aggregate daily average, minimum and maximum VAR amounts were $1.4 million, $1 million and $2 million, respectively. During the same period one year ago, our aggregate daily average, minimum and maximum VAR amounts were $1.9 million, $1.4 million and $2.5 million, respectively.  In addition to comparing VAR exposure against limits on a daily basis, we monitor loss limits, use sensitivity measures and conduct stress tests. We report our market risk exposure to the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors.  Liquidity risk management  We define “liquidity” as the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences. Liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions.  Governance structure  We manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis. This approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity, as well as each entity’s capacity to manage through adverse conditions. It also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding.  Oversight of the liquidity risk management process is governed by the Risk Management Committee of the KeyCorp Board of Directors, the KeyBank Board of Directors, the ERM Committee and the ALCO. These groups regularly review various liquidity reports, including liquidity and funding summaries, liquidity trends, peer comparisons, variance analyses, liquidity projections, hypothetical funding erosion stress tests and goal tracking reports. The reviews generate a discussion of positions, trends and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of the decisions that we make. When liquidity pressure is elevated, monitoring of positions is heightened and reporting is more intensive. We communicate with individuals within    102    Table of Contents  and outside of the company on a daily basis to discuss emerging issues. In addition, we use a variety of daily liquidity reports to monitor the flow of funds.  Factors affecting liquidity  Our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events. An example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency. Examples of indirect events (events unrelated to us) that could impact our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war, natural disasters, political events, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund or hedge fund. Similarly, market speculation, or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources.  During the first quarter of 2011, Moody’s (a credit rating agency that rates KeyCorp and KeyBank debt securities) indicated to KeyBank that certain escrow deposits associated with our mortgage servicing operations had to be moved to another financial institution which meets Moody’s minimum ratings threshold. As a result of this decision by Moody’s, on March 7, 2011, KeyBank transferred approximately $1.5 billion of these escrow deposit balances to an acceptably-rated institution which resulted in an immaterial impairment of the related mortgage servicing assets. KeyBank had ample liquidity reserves to offset the loss of these deposits.  Managing liquidity risk  We regularly monitor our funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding. In the normal course of business, we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both KeyCorp and KeyBank. In a “heightened monitoring mode,” we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently, and use assumptions so the stress tests are more strenuous and reflect the changed market environment. Erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods. Ultimately, they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations. To compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures, we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed.  We continue to maintain a strong liquid asset portfolio. As our secured borrowings matured, in prior years they were not replaced. However, we retain the capacity to utilize secured borrowings as a contingent funding source.  We maintain a Contingency Funding Plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis. The Plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions. It also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for effectively managing liquidity through a problem period. As part of the Plan, we maintain a liquidity reserve through balances in our liquid asset portfolio which during a problem period could reduce our potential reliance on wholesale funding. The portfolio at September 30, 2011 totaled $13.3 billion. The liquid asset portfolio balance consisted of $7.3 billion of unpledged securities, $2.1 billion of securities available for secured funding at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and $3.9 billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our Federal Reserve account. Additionally, as of September 30, 2011, our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was $11.6 billion at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and $4.3 billion at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati.   Long-term liquidity strategy  Our long-term liquidity strategy is to be core deposit funded with reduced reliance on wholesale funding. Key’s client-based relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base, which support our liquidity risk management strategy. We use the loan to deposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies. Our target loan to deposit ratio is between 90-100%, which we calculate as total loans, loans held-for-sale, and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by domestic deposits.  Sources of liquidity  Our primary sources of funding include customer deposits, wholesale funding, liquid assets, and capital. If the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances, we rely on wholesale funding or liquid assets. Conversely, excess cash generated by operating, investing and deposit-gathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets. We actively manage liquidity using a variety of nondeposit sources, including short- and long-term debt, and secured borrowings.    103    Table of Contents Liquidity programs  We have several liquidity programs, which are described in Note 14 (“Short-Term Borrowings”) on page 144 of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which enable the parent company and KeyBank to raise funds in the public and private markets when the capital markets are functioning normally. The proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. Each of the programs is replaced or renewed as needed. There are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs.  Liquidity for KeyCorp  The parent company has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt; support customary corporate operations and activities (including acquisitions) and occasional guarantees of subsidiary’s obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences; and pay dividends to shareholders.  Our primary tool for assessing parent company liquidity is the net short-term cash position, which measures the ability to fund debt maturing in 24 months or less with existing liquid assets. Another key measure of parent company liquidity is the “liquidity gap,” which represents the difference between projected liquid assets and anticipated financial obligations over specified time horizons. We generally rely upon the issuance of term debt to manage the liquidity gap within targeted ranges assigned to various time periods.  Typically, the parent company meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from KeyBank. Federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval. A national bank’s dividend-paying capacity is affected by several factors, including net profits (as defined by statute) for the two previous calendar years and for the current year, up to the date of dividend declaration. During the first nine months of 2011, KeyBank did not pay any dividends to the parent; however, nonbank subsidiaries paid the parent $45 million in dividends. As of the close of business on September 30, 2011, KeyBank would not have been permitted to pay dividends to the parent without prior regulatory approval. To compensate for the absence of dividends, the parent company has relied upon the issuance of long-term debt and stock. During the first nine months of 2011, the parent did not make any capital infusions to KeyBank, compared to $100 million during the first nine months of 2010.  The parent company generally maintains cash and short-term investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over the next 24 months. At September 30, 2011, the parent company held $2.4 billion in short-term investments, which we projected to be sufficient to repay our maturing debt obligations.  During the first quarter of 2011, the parent company completed a $625 million equity offering at a price of $8.85 per Common Share. In conjunction with the equity offering, the parent company issued $1 billion, 5.1% Senior Medium-Term Notes, Series I, during the first quarter of 2011. The proceeds from the sale of Common Shares and medium-term notes were used, along with other available funds, to repurchase the Series B Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury. The repurchase eliminated future quarterly dividends of $31 million and discount amortization of $4 million, or $140 million on an annual basis, related to these preferred shares.  Our liquidity position and recent activity  Over the past twelve months our liquid asset portfolio has increased, which includes overnight and short-term investments, as well as unencumbered, high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios. Liquidity stress scenarios include the loss of access to either unsecured or secured funding sources, as well as draws on unfunded commitments and significant deposit withdrawals.  From time to time, KeyCorp or its principal subsidiary, KeyBank, may seek to retire, repurchase or exchange outstanding debt, capital securities or preferred stock through cash purchase, privately negotiated transactions or other means. Such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity and capital requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.  We generate cash flows from operations, and from investing and financing activities. During the first nine months of 2011, we used the proceeds from our debt and Common Share offerings as well as our securities available for sale portfolio (which we had previously accumulated from loan pay downs and maturities of short-term investments) to repurchase our Series B Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury as part of the TARP CPP and to pay dividends. As previously noted, the repurchase eliminated future quarterly dividends of $31 million and discount amortization of $4 million, or $140 million on an annual basis, related to these preferred shares.  The consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for each nine month period ended September 30, 2011 and 2010.    104    Table of Contents Credit ratings  Our credit ratings at September 30, 2011 are shown in Figure 29. We believe that these credit ratings, under normal conditions in the capital markets, will enable the parent company or KeyBank to issue fixed income securities to investors. Conditions in the credit markets have materially improved relative to the disruption experienced between the latter part of 2007 and 2009; however, while credit is more readily available, the cost of funds remains higher than what was experienced prior to the market disruption.  If our credit ratings fall below investment-grade, that event could have a material adverse effect on us. Such downgrades could adversely affect access to liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us. Ultimately, credit ratings downgrades could adversely affect our business operations and reduce our ability to generate income.  In the fourth quarter of 2010, Moody’s (a credit rating agency that rates KeyCorp and KeyBank debt securities) announced a one notch downgrade of KeyBanks’s short-term borrowings, senior long-term debt, and subordinated debt. As a result of this decision by Moody’s, on March 7, 2011, KeyBank transferred approximately $1.5 billion of certain escrow deposit balances to an acceptably-rated institution. For more information regarding this transfer of escrow deposit balances and the related mortgage servicing assets see Note 8 (“Mortgage Servicing Assets”).  Figure 29.

Like other financial services institutions, we make loans, extend credit, purchase securities and enter into financial derivative contracts, all of which have related credit risk.   Credit policy, approval and evaluation  We manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program. The Credit Risk Committee approves both retail and commercial credit policies. These policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit. For more information about our credit policies, as well as related approval and evaluation processes, see the section entitled “Credit policy, approval and evaluation” on page 79 of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We maintain an active concentration management program to encourage diversification in our credit portfolios. For individual obligors, we employ a sliding scale of exposure, known as hold limits, which is dictated by the strength of the borrower. Our legal lending limit is approximately $2 billion for any individual borrower. However, internal hold limits generally restrict the largest exposures to less than 20% of that amount. As of September 30, 2011, we had three client relationships with loan commitments net of credit default swaps of more than $200 million. The average amount outstanding on these three individual net obligor commitments was $90 million at September 30, 2011. In general, our philosophy is to maintain a diverse portfolio with regard to credit exposures.  We actively manage the overall loan portfolio in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives, including the use of credit derivatives — primarily credit default swaps — to mitigate credit risk. Credit default swaps enable us to transfer a portion of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit to a third party. At September 30, 2011, we used credit default swaps with a notional amount of $672 million to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending obligations. We also sell credit derivatives — primarily index credit default swaps — to diversify and manage portfolio    105    Table of Contents  concentration and correlation risks. At September 30, 2011, the notional amount of credit default swaps sold by us for the purpose of diversifying our credit exposure was $363 million. Occasionally, we have provided credit protection to other lenders through the sale of credit default swaps. These transactions with other lenders generated fee income.  Credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Related gains or losses, as well as the premium paid or received for credit protection, are included in the trading income component of noninterest income. These swaps decreased our operating results by $11 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2011 and 2010.  We also manage the loan portfolio using portfolio swaps and bulk purchases and sales. Our overarching goal is to manage the loan portfolio within a specified range of asset quality.  Selected asset quality statistics for each of the past five quarters are presented in Figure 30. The factors that drive these statistics are discussed in the remainder of this section.  Figure 30.

Watch and criticized assets  Watch assets are troubled commercial loans with the potential to deteriorate in quality due to the client’s current financial condition and possible inability to perform in accordance with the terms of the underlying contract. Criticized assets are troubled loans and other assets that show additional signs of weakness that may lead, or have led, to an interruption in scheduled repayments from primary sources, potentially requiring us to rely on repayment from secondary sources, such as collateral liquidation. Criticized loan and lease outstandings showed improvement during the third quarter of 2011 decreasing 10.2% from the second quarter of 2011 and 41.7% from the year ago quarter.  Allowance for loan and lease losses  At September 30, 2011, the allowance for loan and lease losses was $1.1 billion, or 2.35% of loans, compared to $2.0 billion, or 3.81%, at September 30, 2010. The allowance includes $44 million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of $441 million at September 30, 2011, compared to $135 million that was allocated for impaired loans of $840 million one year ago. For more information about impaired loans, see Note 4 (“Asset Quality”). At September 30, 2011, the allowance for loan and lease losses was 143.53% of nonperforming loans, compared to 142.64% at September 30, 2010.  We estimate the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses on at least a quarterly basis. The methodology used is described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses” on page 102 of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Briefly, we apply historical loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions, changes in credit policies or underwriting standards, and changes in the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets. For all TDRs, regardless of size, as well as impaired loans having an outstanding balance greater than $2.5 million, we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss content and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate. A specific allowance also may be assigned — even when sources of repayment appear sufficient — if we remain uncertain about whether the loan will be repaid in full. The allowance for loan and lease losses at September 30, 2011, represents our best estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date.  As shown in Figure 31, our allowance for loan and lease losses decreased by $826 million, or 42%, during the past twelve months. This contraction was associated with the improvement in credit quality of the loan portfolio, which has trended    106    Table of Contents  more favorably along with the decrease in loan levels over the past twelve months. Asset quality is improving and has resulted in favorable risk rating migration and a reduction in our general allowance. Our delinquency trends continue to decline while our roll rates keep improving. We attribute this to a more moderate level of economic activity, more favorable conditions in the capital markets, improvement in client income statements and continued run off in our exit loan portfolio. Our liability for credit losses on lending-related commitments decreased by $43 million to $56 million at September 30, 2011, compared to the same period one year ago. When combined with our allowance for loan and lease losses, our total allowance for credit losses represented 2.46% of loans at the end of the third quarter of 2011 compared to 4.00% at the end of the third quarter of 2010. We anticipate further reductions in the level of our allowance for loan and lease losses for the balance of 2011 as a result of our expectation of lower levels of net charge-offs and nonperforming loans as the economy continues to show signs of improvement.

Our provision for loan and lease losses was a provision of $10 million for the third quarter of 2011, compared to a provision of $94 million for the year-ago quarter. Our net loan charge-offs for the third quarter of 2011 exceeded the provision for loan and lease losses by $99 million. The decrease in our provision is due to the improving credit quality we have experienced in most of our loan portfolios and the reduction of our outstanding loan balances. Additionally, we continue to work our exit loans through the credit cycle, and reduce exposure in our higher-risk businesses including the residential properties portion of our construction loan portfolio, Marine/RV financing, and other selected leasing portfolios through the sale of certain loans, payments from borrowers or net charge-offs. As these outstanding loan balances decrease, so does their required allowance for loan and lease losses and corresponding provision.    107    Table of Contents Net loan charge-offs  Net loan charge-offs for the third quarter of 2011 totaled $109 million, or .90% of average loans from continuing operations. These results compare to net charge-offs of $357 million, or 2.69%, for the same period last year. Figure 32 shows the trend in our net loan charge-offs by loan type, while the composition of loan charge-offs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in Figure 33.  Over the past twelve months, net charge-offs in the commercial loan portfolio decreased by $216 million, due primarily to commercial real estate related credits within the Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services line of business. Net charge-offs for this line of business declined by $103 million from the third quarter of 2010 and decreased $4 million from the first quarter of 2011. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, net loan charge-offs in the commercial loan portfolio decreased by $114 million which was attributable to declines in both the real estate — commercial mortgage and commercial, financial and agricultural portfolios. As shown in Figure 35, our exit loan portfolio accounted for $27 million, or 25%, of total net loan charge-offs for the third quarter of 2011. Net charge-offs in the exit loan portfolio increased by $2 million from the second quarter of 2011, primarily driven by an increase in net charge-offs in the marine loan portfolio. Our net loan charge-offs have declined each of the past seven quarters and are at their lowest level since the first quarter of 2008.  Figure 32.

These assets totaled $914 million at September 30, 2011, and represented 1.89% of portfolio loans, OREO and other nonperforming assets, compared to $1.3 billion, or 2.66%, at December 31, 2010, and $1.8 billion, or 3.48%, at September 30, 2010. Nonperforming assets were down over $1.9 billion from their peak at September 30, 2009. Nonperforming assets are less than a billion dollars for the first time since December 31, 2007.

These concessions are made to improve the collectability of the loan and generally take the form of a reduction of the interest rate, extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance.  As shown in Figure 34, nonperforming assets decreased during the third quarter of 2011 which represents the eighth consecutive quarterly decline. Most of the reduction came from nonperforming loans held for sale and OREO in the commercial real estate lines of business. As shown in Figure 35, our exit loan portfolio accounted for $119 million, or 13%, of total nonperforming assets at September 30, 2011, compared to $126 million, or 13%, at June 30, 2011.  At September 30, 2011, the carrying amount of our commercial nonperforming loans outstanding represented 55% of their contractual amount owed, and total nonperforming loans outstanding represented 64% of their contractual amount owed and nonperforming assets in total were carried at 61% of their original contractual amount.  At September 30, 2011, our 20 largest nonperforming loans totaled $265 million, representing 34% of total nonperforming loans.  Figure 35 shows the composition of our exit loan portfolio at September 30, 2011 and June 30, 2011, the net charge-offs recorded on this portfolio for the third quarter of 2011 and the second quarter of 2011, and the nonperforming status of these loans at September 30, 2011 and June 30, 2011. The exit loan portfolio represented 9% of total loans and loans held for sale at September 30, 2011.

The types of activity that caused the change in our nonperforming loans during each of the last five quarters are summarized in Figure 37. As shown in this figure, nonperforming loans experienced another quarterly decrease. Loans placed on non-accrual declined nearly $400 million in the third quarter of 2011 as compared to the third quarter of 2010, and market liquidity continued to improve.    111    Table of Contents Figure 37.

Operational risk also encompasses compliance risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules and regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards. Due to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, large financial companies like Key will be subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation due to their systemic importance. This heightened level of regulation will increase our operational risk. We have created work teams to respond to and analyze the new regulatory requirements imposed upon us and that will be promulgated as a result of the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. Resulting operational risk losses and/or additional regulatory compliance costs could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation or forgone opportunities. We seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk, alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance, a system of internal controls and reporting.    112    Table of Contents We continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with laws, rules and regulations, and to improve the oversight of our operational risk. For example, an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses. This tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action. We also rely upon software programs designed to assist in the assessment of operational risk and monitoring our control processes. This technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the Board of Directors.  Primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business. Our Operational Risk Management function manages the Operational Risk Management Program which provides the framework for the structure, governance, roles and responsibilities as well as the content to manage operational risk for Key. The Operational Risk Committee, a senior management committee, oversees our level of operational risk, and directs and supports our operational infrastructure and related activities. This committee and the Operational Risk Management function are an integral part of our ERM Program. Our Risk Review function periodically assesses the overall effectiveness of our Operational Risk Management Program and our system of internal controls. Risk Review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the Audit Committee, and independently supports the Audit Committee’s oversight of these controls.  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk  The information presented in the “Market risk management” section of the Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition & Results of Operations, is incorporated herein by reference.  Item 4. Controls and Procedures  As of the end of the period covered by this report, KeyCorp carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of KeyCorp’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of KeyCorp’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, KeyCorp’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, as of the end of the period covered by this report, in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. No changes were made to KeyCorp’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, KeyCorp’s internal control over financial reporting.  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  Item 1. Legal Proceedings  The information presented in the Legal Proceedings section of Note 12 (“Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is incorporated herein by reference.  Item 1A. Risk Factors  An investment in our Common Shares, debt or other securities is subject to risks inherent to our business and industry. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below relating to recent developments and the risk factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2010, see Part 1, Item 1A: Risk Factors, on pages 11-25 of such Annual Report on Form 10-K, and the Forward-Looking Statements of this Form 10-Q. Although we have significant risk management policies, procedures and practices aimed at mitigating uncertainties, these risks may nevertheless impair our business operations. These risks are not the only ones that we face. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.  IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS (OR THOSE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE AS INDICATED ABOVE) ACTUALLY OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATION, AND/OR ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY AND/OR CREDIT COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED (“MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US”). IF THIS WERE TO HAPPEN, THE VALUE OF OUR SECURITIES—COMMON SHARES, SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK, CAPITAL    113    Table of Contents  SECURITIES, AND OUR DEBT SECURITIES—COULD DECLINE, PERHAPS SIGNIFICANTLY, AND YOU COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT  RISKS RELATED TO RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  The failure of the European Union to stabilize the fiscal condition and creditworthiness of its weaker member economies, such as Greece, Portugal, Spain, Hungary, Ireland, and Italy, could have international implications potentially impacting global financial institutions, the financial markets, and the economic recovery underway in the United States.  Certain European Union member states have fiscal obligations greater than their fiscal revenue, which has caused investor concern over such countries ability to continue to service their debt and foster economic growth. Currently, the European debt crisis has caused credit spreads to widen in the fixed income debt markets, and liquidity to be less abundant. A weaker European economy may transcend Europe, cause investors to lose confidence in the safety and soundness of European financial institutions and the stability of European member economies, and likewise affect U.S.-based financial institutions, the stability of the global financial markets and the economic recovery underway in the United States.  Should the U.S. economic recovery be adversely impacted by these factors, loan and asset growth at U.S. financial institutions, like Key, could be affected. We have taken steps since the 2008-2009 financial crisis to strengthen our liquidity position. Nevertheless, a return of the volatile economic conditions experienced in the U.S. during 2008-2009, including the adverse conditions in the fixed income debt markets, for an extended period of time, particularly if left unmitigated by policy measures, may have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.
