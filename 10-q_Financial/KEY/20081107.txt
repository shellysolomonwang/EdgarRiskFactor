Item 1A. Risk Factors,” which begins on page 95, are not intended to be a complete summary of all risks and uncertainties that may affect Key’s business, the financial services industry and financial markets. Though management strives to monitor and mitigate risk, management cannot anticipate all potential economic, operational and financial developments that may have an adverse impact on Key’s operations and financial results. Forward-looking statements speak only as to the date the statement is made, and Key does not undertake any obligation to revise any forward-looking statement to reflect subsequent events.  Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider all risks and uncertainties disclosed in Key’s SEC filings, including this and Key’s other reports on Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q and our registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933, all of which are accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.  Long-term goals  Key’s long-term financial goals are to grow its earnings per common share and achieve a return on average equity, each at or above the respective median of its peer group. The strategy for achieving these goals is described under the heading “Corporate Strategy” on page 16 of Key’s 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders.  Economic overview  During the third quarter of 2008, financial markets were severely strained as the fallout from the housing market and the recognition of losses by financial institutions continued. Home sales remained weak even in the face of improved housing affordability and falling home values. The median price of existing homes fell by more than 9.0% from the respective price levels reported for the same month last year. Lower prices  42    Table of Contents  were partly a consequence of the elevated levels of foreclosures, which rose by 21% from the number of foreclosures experienced in September 2007. September new home sales were down 33% from one year ago and existing home sales were relatively flat for the same period. In response, homebuilder activity declined as housing starts hit a 17-year low, falling more than 30% from September 2007.  Further write-downs caused by distressed real estate values and increasing loan losses continued to pressure capital levels at financial institutions, forcing many to raise additional capital, often at substantially higher costs than in recent years. Some financial institutions were forced into liquidation or mergers as losses mounted, and the availability of funding and capital remained restricted. As concern over the strength of their peers’ balance sheets increased, banks curbed lending to each other, and short-term unsecured lending rates rose. Short-term interbank lending rates increased by 127 basis points during the quarter, while the yield on short-term Treasury bills declined by 83 basis points. For regional banking institutions such as Key, there were no cost-effective means of accessing capital markets for unsecured term debt.  Early in the third quarter, inflationary pressures intensified before showing signs of subsiding. Most of the reduction came from lower oil prices, which declined to $101 per barrel at September 30, 2008, after reaching an all time high of $145 per barrel in early July 2008. Consumer prices in September 2008 rose 4.9% from September 2007, down slightly from a 5.0% annual increase in June 2008. Employment continued to weaken in the third quarter as the economy lost 299,000 jobs, which brought the number of jobs lost since December 2007 to 760,000. The average unemployment rate for the quarter rose to 6.0%, compared to the second quarter average of 5.3% and the 2007 average of 4.6%. The positive impact from the second quarter 2008 tax rebate checks dissipated in the third quarter. Consumer spending during the third quarter declined at an average monthly rate of .1%, compared to an average monthly rate increase of .5% in the second quarter of 2008.  While the downside risks to the economy increased during the third quarter of 2008, the Federal Reserve held the federal funds target rate at 2.00%, mainly due to elevated inflationary pressures. Meanwhile, as investors looked for safe-haven as the financial crisis continued, the benchmark two-year Treasury yield decreased to 1.96% at September 30, 2008, from 2.62% at June 30, 2008, and the ten-year Treasury yield, which began the third quarter at 3.97%, closed the quarter at 3.83%. In an effort to alleviate strains in the financial markets and increase liquidity available to U.S. financial institutions, the Federal Reserve expanded many of its liquidity programs, and together with the U.S. Treasury and the FDIC, took a variety of unprecedented actions. In September, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, with the support of the U.S. Treasury, placed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, two government-sponsored enterprises that play a critical role in the U.S. home mortgage market, in conservatorship, taking full management control. The Federal Reserve seized control of insurance giant American International Group Inc. in September, and provided traditional investment banks the authority to become bank holding companies and to access the discount window of the Federal Reserve. On October 3, 2008, President Bush signed into law the EESA, which is intended to restore liquidity and stability to the U.S. financial system through the purchase of up to $700 billion of certain mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and other financial instruments (including preferred equity). On October 8, 2008, as falling oil prices tempered inflationary concerns and liquidity concerns remained, the Federal Reserve, as part of a coordinated effort with six other central banks to stabilize world markets, lowered the federal funds target rate to 1.50%. On October 14, 2008, the FDIC announced its Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program, including its debt guarantee program for qualifying newly issued senior unsecured debt of insured depository institutions, their holding companies and certain other affiliates of insured depository institutions designated by the FDIC (the “Debt Guarantee”), and a transaction account guarantee for funds held at FDIC-insured depository institutions in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts in excess of the current standard maximum deposit insurance amount of $250,000 (the “Transaction Account Guarantee”). Finally, on October 29, 2008, the Federal Reserve further lowered the federal funds target rate to 1.00%.  Demographics. The extent to which Key’s business has been affected by continued volatility and weakness in the housing market is directly related to the state of the economy in the regions in which its two major business groups, Community Banking and National Banking, operate.  43    Table of Contents  Key’s Community Banking group serves consumers and small to mid-sized businesses by offering a variety of deposit, investment, lending and wealth management products and services. These products and services are provided through a 14-state branch network organized into four geographic regions as defined by management: Northwest, Rocky Mountains, Great Lakes and Northeast. Figure 1 shows the geographic diversity of the Community Banking group’s average core deposits, commercial loans and home equity loans. As of September 30, 2008, approximately two-thirds of the loans and deposits held by Community Banking were outside of the Great Lakes region, which has been particularly hard hit by the weakening economy. The Community Banking group continues to benefit from its geographic diversity. Compared to the third quarter of 2007, this business experienced growth in both revenue and deposits, with revenue increases coming from each of the group’s 23 districts.  Figure 1.

Key’s National Banking group includes those corporate and consumer business units that operate nationally, within and beyond the 14-state branch network, as well as internationally. The specific products and services offered by the National Banking group are described in Note 4 (“Line of Business Results”), which begins on page 14.  The diversity of Key’s commercial real estate lending business based on industry type and location is shown in Figure 18 on page 67. The homebuilder loan portfolio within the National Banking group has been adversely affected by the downturn in the U.S. housing market. As a result of deteriorating market conditions in the residential properties segment of Key’s commercial real estate construction portfolio, principally in Florida and southern California, Key has experienced a significant increase in the level of its nonperforming assets since mid-2007 and has taken aggressive steps to reduce its exposure in this segment of its loan portfolio. As previously reported, during the fourth quarter of 2007, Key announced its decision to cease conducting business with nonrelationship homebuilders outside of its 14-state Community Banking footprint and, during the second quarter of 2008, initiated a process to further reduce its exposure through the planned sale of certain loans. As a result of these actions, Key has reduced the outstanding balances in the residential properties segment of its commercial real estate loan portfolio by $1.3 billion, or 34%, over the past twelve months, with the majority of the reduction coming from the weakest part of the portfolio. Additional information about the planned loan sales is included in the “Credit risk management” section, which begins on page 86.  In recent quarters, results for the National Banking group have also been affected adversely by volatility in the capital markets, leading to declines in the market values at which certain assets (primarily commercial real estate loans and securities held for sale or trading) are recorded. Results for the third quarter of 2008 include $33 million of after-tax derivative-related charges recorded as a result of market disruption caused by the failure of Lehman Brothers, and $19 million of realized and unrealized after-tax losses from the residential properties segment of the construction loan portfolio.  During the third quarter of 2008, the banking industry, including Key, continued to experience commercial and industrial loan growth, due in part to increased reliance by borrowers on commercial lines of credit in response to the challenging economic environment.  44    Table of Contents  Critical accounting policies and estimates  Key’s business is dynamic and complex. Consequently, management must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies in many areas. These choices are critical; not only are they necessary to comply with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), they also reflect management’s view of the appropriate way to record and report Key’s overall financial performance. All accounting policies are important, and all policies described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”), which begins on page 65 of Key’s 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how Key’s financial performance is recorded and reported.  In management’s opinion, some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a significant effect on Key’s financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility. These policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance, or require management to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. Because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances, they may change over time or prove to be inaccurate.  Management relies heavily on the use of judgment, assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions, including accounting for the allowance for loan losses; loan securitizations; contingent liabilities, guarantees and income taxes; derivatives and related hedging activities; and assets and liabilities that involve valuation methodologies. A brief discussion of each of these areas appears on pages 17 through 19 of Key’s 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders. Information about Key’s goodwill impairment testing conducted as of June 30, 2008, and the review performed as of September 30, 2008, is included in Note 1 (“Basis of Presentation”) under the heading “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” on page 7.  Effective January 1, 2008, Key adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements,” which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. In the absence of quoted market prices, management determines the fair value of Key’s assets and liabilities using internally-developed models which are based on management’s judgment, assumptions and estimates regarding credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and other relevant inputs. Key’s adoption of this accounting guidance and the process used in determining fair values are more fully described in Note 1 (“Basis of Presentation”) under the heading “Fair Value Measurements” on page 8 and Note 15 (“Fair Value Measurements”), which begins on page 35.  At September 30, 2008, $11.8 billion, or 12%, of Key’s total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Approximately 97% of these assets were classified as Level 1 or Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. At September 30, 2008, $777 million, or 1%, of Key’s total liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Substantially all of these liabilities were classified as Level 1 or Level 2.  At September 30, 2008, $622 million, or 1%, of Key’s total assets were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Approximately 1% of these assets were classified as Level 1 or Level 2. At September 30, 2008, there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  Highlights of Key’s Performance  Financial performance  For the third quarter of 2008, Key recorded a loss from continuing operations of $36 million, or $.10 per common share. This compares to income from continuing operations of $224 million, or $.57 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2007, and a loss from continuing operations of $1.126 billion, or $2.70 per common share, for the second quarter of 2008.  Key’s results for 2008 include additional charges associated with certain leveraged lease financing transactions being challenged by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). Third and second quarter results include after-tax charges of $30 million, or $.06 per common share, and $1.011 billion, or $2.43 per common share, respectively, resulting from a previously announced adverse federal court decision on the tax treatment of a Service Contract Lease transaction.  45    Table of Contents  During the first quarter of 2008, Key increased its tax reserves for certain lease in, lease out (“LILO”) transactions and recalculated its lease income in accordance with prescribed accounting standards, resulting in after-tax charges of $38 million, or $.10 per common share.  For the first nine months of 2008, Key reported a loss from continuing operations of $944 million, or $2.19 per common share. Adjusting for the lease financing charges, Key had income from continuing operations of $135 million, or $.30 per diluted common share, compared to $919 million, or $2.31 per diluted common share, for the same period last year.  Key reported a net loss of $36 million, or $.10 per common share, for the third quarter of 2008, compared to net income of $210 million, or $.54 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2007, and a net loss of $1.126 billion, or $2.70 per common share, for the second quarter of 2008. For the first nine months of 2008, Key reported a net loss of $944 million, or $2.19 per common share, compared to net income of $894 million, or $2.25 per diluted common share, for the same period last year.  Figure 2 shows Key’s continuing and discontinued operating results and related performance ratios for comparative quarters and the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2008 and 2007.  Figure 2.

As a result of these actions, Key has accounted for this business as a discontinued operation.    The continuation of a difficult economic environment and the resulting increase in Key’s allowance for loan losses contributed to the loss recorded for the third quarter of 2008. The current quarter provision for loan losses exceeded net loan charge-offs by $134 million and increased Key’s allowance for loan losses to $1.554 billion, or 2.03% of period-end loans. Additionally, third quarter results were adversely impacted by $33 million of after-tax losses on derivative contracts that resulted from market disruption caused by the failure of Lehman Brothers, and $19 million of realized and unrealized after-tax losses from the residential properties segment of the construction loan portfolio. As previously reported, Key has taken action to reduce its exposure to the residential properties segment of its commercial real estate construction loan portfolio through the planned sale of certain loans. As a result of these efforts and the December 2007 decision to cease conducting business with nonrelationship homebuilders outside of its 14-state Community Banking footprint, Key’s total residential property exposure in commercial real estate, including loans held for sale, has been reduced by $1.3 billion, or 34%, over the past twelve months, with the majority of the reduction coming from the weakest part of the portfolio. Additional information pertaining to the status of these loan sales is presented in the section entitled “Credit risk management,” which begins on page 86.  46    Table of Contents  Through this difficult credit cycle, management has continued to focus on Key’s relationship business model, maintain Key’s strong capital position and carefully manage expenses to ensure the company’s readiness to respond to business opportunities as they emerge. During the third quarter, Key continued to take decisive steps to exit low-return, indirect businesses, consistent with the company’s strategy of focusing its capital and resources on its best relationship customers. Key is in the process of exiting direct and indirect retail and floor-plan lending for marine and recreational vehicle products, will limit new student loans to those backed by government guarantee and will cease conducting business with homebuilders outside of its 14-state Community Banking footprint. These actions are the most recent in a series of actions taken over several years that have seen the company exit subprime mortgage and automobile financing and broker-originated home equity lending, and dispose of a segment of its residential homebuilder portfolio.  As previously reported, Key took aggressive steps during the second quarter of 2008 to further strengthen its capital position by raising additional capital through the issuance of preferred stock and common shares and by reducing the dividend on its common shares by 50% to an annualized dividend of $.75 per share. At September 30, 2008, Key had Tier 1 and total capital ratios of 8.55% and 12.40%, respectively, both of which exceed the “well-capitalized” standard for banks established by the banking regulators.  Despite the challenging economic environment, the Community Banking group continues to perform solidly, with higher revenue and deposit growth across the entire branch network. Management believes that Key’s continued focus on building a relationship-based, customer-focused business model, along with the actions discussed above will serve Key well as the economy ultimately recovers.  Further, Key has elected to reduce uncertainty surrounding its previously disclosed leveraged lease tax issue with the IRS. While management continues to believe Key’s initial tax position was correct, it would take years of effort and expense to resolve this matter through litigation. Accordingly, Key has elected to participate in the IRS’ global settlement initiative, which is essentially an offer by the federal tax authorities to resolve all such disputed cases. Key expects that the definitive settlement documents will be executed as soon as the fourth quarter and that Key should realize an after-tax recovery of between $75 million and $100 million for previously accrued interest on disputed tax balances. Additional information pertaining to the status of leveraged lease tax issue and Key’s opt-in to the IRS’ global settlement initiative is included in Note 12 (“Income Taxes”), which begins on page 27.  Shown in Figure 3 below are significant items that affect the comparability of Key’s financial performance for the periods presented.  Figure 3.

(b)   Represents the financial effect of the McDonald Investments branch network, including a gain of $171 million ($107 million after tax) from the February 9, 2007, sale of that network.    47    Table of Contents  Events leading to the recognition of the items presented in Figure 3, as well as other factors that contributed to the changes in Key’s revenue and expense components from those reported for the third quarter of 2007, are reviewed in detail throughout the remainder of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis section.  Key’s financial performance for each of the past five quarters and for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2008 and 2007, is summarized in Figure 4.  Figure 4.

effect on Key’s results, making it difficult to compare results from one period to the next. Note 3 (“Acquisitions and Divestitures”), which begins on page 12, contains specific information about the acquisitions and divestitures that Key completed during 2007 and the first nine months of 2008 to help in understanding how those transactions may have impacted Key’s financial condition and results of operations.          (a)   See Figure 5, which shows certain earnings data and performance ratios, excluding charges related to the tax treatment of certain leveraged lease financing transactions disallowed by the IRS. Figure 5 reconciles certain GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures and provides a basis for period-to-period comparisons.    48    Table of Contents  As a result of an adverse federal court decision on Key’s tax treatment of a Service Contract Lease transaction entered into by AWG Leasing Trust, in which Key is a partner, Key recorded after-tax charges of $30 million, or $.06 per common share, during the third quarter of 2008, and $1.011 billion, or $2.43 per common share, during the second quarter of 2008. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2008, Key increased its tax reserves for certain LILO transactions and recalculated its lease income in accordance with prescribed accounting standards, resulting in after-tax charges of $38 million, or $.10 per common share. The table below presents certain earnings data and performance ratios, excluding these charges (non-GAAP), reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures and provides a basis for period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited.

On October 24, 2008, the U.S. Treasury informed KeyCorp that it had received preliminary approval to participate in the U.S. Treasury’s TARP Capital Purchase Program. Under the TARP Capital Purchase Program, the U.S. Treasury would purchase $2.5 billion of TARP preferred stock and warrants to purchase common shares of KeyCorp. KeyCorp anticipates receipt of the additional capital by December 31, 2008. The TARP Capital Purchase Program was initiated by the U.S. Treasury under authority provided in the\ EESA in order to restore liquidity and stability to the U.S. financial system. Additional information pertaining to the EESA and the TARP Capital Purchase Program is presented in the “Capital” discussion under the heading “Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008” on page 77.  Strategic developments  Management initiated a number of specific actions during 2008 and 2007 to support Key’s corporate strategy, which is described under the heading “Corporate Strategy” on page 16 of Key’s 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders.     ¨   During the third quarter of 2008, Key decided to exit direct and indirect retail and floor-plan lending for marine and recreational vehicle products and to limit new student loans to those backed by government guarantee. Key also determined that it will cease conducting business with homebuilders within its 14-state Community Banking footprint.      ¨   On January 1, 2008, Key acquired U.S.B. Holding Co., Inc., the holding company for Union State Bank, a 31-branch state-chartered commercial bank headquartered in Orangeburg, New York. The acquisition doubles Key’s branch presence in the attractive Lower Hudson Valley area. Assets and deposits acquired in this transaction were assigned to both the Community Banking and National Banking groups.      ¨   On December 20, 2007, Key announced its decision to exit dealer-originated home improvement lending activities, which involve prime loans but are largely out-of-footprint. Key also announced that it will cease offering Payroll Online services, which are not of sufficient size to provide economies of scale to compete profitably. Additionally, Key has moved to cease conducting business with nonrelationship homebuilders outside of its 14-state Community Banking footprint.      ¨   On October 1, 2007, Key acquired Tuition Management Systems, Inc., one of the nation’s largest providers of outsourced tuition planning, billing, counseling and payment services. Headquartered in Warwick, Rhode Island, Tuition Management Systems serves more than 700 colleges, universities, elementary and secondary educational institutions. The combination of the payment plan systems and technology in place at Tuition Management Systems and the array of payment plan products offered by Key’s Consumer Finance line of business created one of the largest education payment plan providers in the nation.    50    Table of Contents    ¨   On February 9, 2007, McDonald Investments Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of KeyCorp, sold its branch network, which included approximately 570 financial advisors and field support staff, and certain fixed assets. Key retained the corporate and institutional businesses, including Institutional Equities and Equity Research, Debt Capital Markets and Investment Banking. In addition, KeyBank continues to operate the Wealth Management, Trust and Private Banking businesses. On April 16, 2007, Key renamed the registered broker-dealer through which its corporate and institutional investment banking and securities businesses operate to KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.    51    Table of Contents     Line of Business Results  This section summarizes the financial performance and related strategic developments of Key’s two major business groups: Community Banking and National Banking. To better understand this discussion, see Note 4 (“Line of Business Results”), which begins on page 14. Note 4 describes the products and services offered by each of these business groups, provides more detailed financial information pertaining to the groups and their respective lines of business, and explains “Other Segments” and “Reconciling Items.”  Figure 6 summarizes the contribution made by each major business group to Key’s taxable-equivalent revenue and (loss) income from continuing operations for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2008 and 2007. Key’s line of business results for each of these periods reflect a new organizational structure that took effect January 1, 2008.  Figure 6.

See Note 3 (“Acquisitions and Divestitures”), which begins on page 12, for more information pertaining to this transaction.     (b)   National Banking’s results for the third quarter of 2008 include $54 million ($33 million after tax) of derivative-related charges recorded as a result of market disruption caused by the failure of Lehman Brothers and $31 million ($19 million after tax) of realized and unrealized losses from the residential properties segment of the construction loan portfolio. During the second quarter of 2008, National Banking’s taxable-equivalent net interest income and net income were reduced by $838 million and $536 million, respectively, as a result of an adverse federal court decision on the tax treatment of a Service Contract Lease transaction. During the first quarter of 2008, National Banking increased its tax reserves for certain LILO transactions and recalculated its lease income in accordance with prescribed accounting standards. These actions reduced National Banking’s taxable-equivalent revenue by $34 million and its net income by $21 million in the first quarter. National Banking’s results for the first quarter of 2007 include a $26 million ($17 million after tax) gain from the settlement of the residual value insurance litigation.     (c)   Other Segments’ results for the third quarter of 2008 include a $23 million ($14 million after tax) credit, representing the reversal of the remaining reserve associated with the Honsador litigation, which was settled in September. Other Segments’ results for the second quarter of 2007 include a $26 million ($16 million after tax) charge for litigation. This charge and the litigation charge referred to in note (d) below comprise the initial $42 million reserve established in connection with the Honsador litigation. Other Segments’ results for the first quarter of 2007 include a $49 million ($31 million after tax) loss from the repositioning of the securities portfolio.     (d)   Reconciling Items for the third and second quarters of 2008 include charges of $30 million and $475 million, respectively, to income taxes for the interest cost associated with the leveraged lease tax litigation. Reconciling Items for the first quarter of 2008 include a $165 million ($103 million after tax) gain from the partial redemption of Key’s equity interest in Visa Inc. and a $17 million charge to income taxes for the interest cost associated with the increase to Key’s tax reserves for certain LILO transactions. Reconciling Items for the third and second quarters of 2007 include gains of $27 million ($17 million after tax) and $40 million ($25 million after tax), respectively, related to MasterCard Incorporated shares. During the second quarter of 2007, Reconciling Items include a $16 million ($10 million after tax) charge for litigation.     TE = Taxable Equivalent     N/M = Not Meaningful    52    Table of Contents  Community Banking summary of operations  As shown in Figure 7, Community Banking recorded net income of $98 million for the third quarter of 2008, compared to $134 million for the year-ago quarter. Increases in the provision for loan losses and noninterest expense were the primary causes of the decline, and more than offset an increase in net interest income.  Figure 7.

The increase was attributable to a $1.9 billion, or 7%, rise in average earning assets, due largely to growth in the commercial loan portfolio, and a $3.7 billion, or 8%, increase in average deposits. Both loans and deposits experienced organic growth and benefited from the January 1, 2008, acquisition of U.S.B. Holding Co., Inc. described on page 54.  The provision for loan losses rose by $54 million compared to the third quarter of 2007, reflecting a $51 million increase in net loan charge-offs, almost half of which was attributable to two specific commercial loans.  53    Table of Contents  Noninterest expense rose by $32 million, or 8%, from the year-ago quarter as a result of increases in personnel expense, marketing expense, professional fees, costs associated with other real estate owned, and smaller increases in a variety of other expense components. Overall, the increase in noninterest expense was largely attributable to initiatives undertaken with regard to branch modernization, deposit growth and the acquisition of U.S.B. Holding Co., Inc.  On January 1, 2008, Key acquired U.S.B. Holding Co., Inc., the holding company for Union State Bank, a 31-branch state-chartered commercial bank headquartered in Orangeburg, New York. The acquisition doubles Key’s branch presence in the attractive Lower Hudson Valley area. Assets and deposits acquired in this transaction were assigned to both the Community Banking and National Banking groups.  On February 9, 2007, McDonald Investments Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of KeyCorp, sold its branch network, which included approximately 570 financial advisors and field support staff, and certain fixed assets. Key retained the corporate and institutional businesses, including Institutional Equities and Equity Research, Debt Capital Markets and Investment Banking. In addition, KeyBank continues to operate the Wealth Management, Trust and Private Banking businesses. On April 16, 2007, Key renamed its registered broker-dealer through which its corporate and institutional investment banking and securities businesses operate. The new name is KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc.  National Banking summary of continuing operations  As shown in Figure 8, National Banking recorded a loss of $133 million from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2008, compared to income of $70 million from continuing operations for the same period last year. A substantially higher provision for loan losses, lower net interest income and an increase in noninterest expense were offset in part by growth in noninterest income.  Figure 8.

During the second quarter of 2008, National Banking’s taxable-equivalent net interest income and net income were reduced by $838 million and $536 million, respectively, as a result of an adverse federal court decision on the tax treatment of a Service Contract Lease transaction. During the first quarter of 2008, National Banking increased its tax reserves for certain LILO transactions and recalculated its lease income in accordance with prescribed accounting standards. These actions reduced National Banking’s taxable-equivalent revenue by $34 million and its net income by $21 million in the first quarter. National Banking’s results for the first quarter of 2007 include a $26 million ($17 million after tax) gain from the settlement of the residual value insurance litigation.     TE = Taxable Equivalent     N/M = Not Meaningful     N/A = Not Applicable    54    Table of Contents  Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $33 million, or 9%, from the third quarter of 2007 as a result of tighter loan and deposit spreads caused by competitive pricing, and a higher level of nonperforming assets. Also contributing to the decrease was the prospective reduction in net interest income caused by the second quarter 2008 recalculation of income previously recognized on all leveraged leases being contested by the IRS. Average loans and leases grew by $6.8 billion, or 17%, while the level of average deposits was down slightly from the year-ago quarter. Contributing to the loan growth was the March 31, 2008, transfer of $3.3 billion of education loans from loans held for sale to the loan portfolio.  Excluding $54 million of derivative-related charges recorded in the current quarter as a result of market disruption caused by the failure of Lehman Brothers, noninterest income rose by $62 million, or 41%, from the third quarter of 2007. The improvement reflected a $15 million increase in income from trust and investment services, a $23 million reduction in net losses from loan sales and write-downs, and a $15 million decrease in losses attributable to changes in the fair values of certain real estate related investments held by the Private Equity unit within the Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services line of business. Noninterest income also benefited from an increase in fee income generated from tuition payment plan processing.  The provision for loan losses rose by $281 million, due primarily to higher levels of net loan charge-offs from the commercial, commercial real estate and education loan portfolios. National Banking’s provision for loan losses for the third quarter of 2008 exceeded its net loan charge-offs by $147 million, as the company continued to build reserves.  Noninterest expense increased by $15 million, or 5%, from the third quarter of 2007, reflecting $10 million of additional expense attributable to severance and other costs recorded during the current quarter in connection with Key’s decision to exit direct and indirect retail and floor-plan lending for marine and recreational vehicle products.  During the third quarter of 2008, Key decided to exit direct and indirect retail and floor-plan lending for marine and recreational vehicle products and to limit new student loans to those backed by government guarantee. Additionally, Key has determined that it will cease conducting business with homebuilders within its 14-state Community Banking footprint. In December 2007, Key had previously announced its decision to cease lending to out-of-footprint homebuilders. These strategic actions are consistent with those taken over the past several years to exit low-return nonrelationship business.  Other Segments  Other segments consist of Corporate Treasury and Key’s Principal Investing unit. These segments generated net income of $9 million for the third quarter of 2008, compared to $16 million for the same period last year. These results reflect less favorable results from principal investing in the current year.  55    Table of Contents  Results of Operations  Net interest income  One of Key’s principal sources of revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets (such as loans and securities) and loan-related fee income, and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. There are several factors that affect net interest income, including:     ¨   the volume, pricing, mix and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities;      ¨   the volume and value of net free funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and equity capital;      ¨   the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk;      ¨   interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace; and      ¨   asset quality.    To make it easier to compare results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets (some taxable, some not), we present net interest income in this discussion on a “taxable-equivalent basis” (i.e., as if it were all taxable and at the same rate). For example, $100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as $154, an amount that — if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% — would yield $100.  Figure 9, which spans pages 58 and 59, shows the various components of Key’s balance sheet that affect interest income and expense, and their respective yields or rates over the past five quarters. The net interest margin, which is an indicator of the profitability of the earning assets portfolio, is calculated by dividing net interest income by average earning assets. This figure also presents a reconciliation of taxable-equivalent net interest income for each of the past five quarters to net interest income reported in accordance with GAAP.  Key’s taxable-equivalent net interest income was $705 million for the third quarter of 2008, compared to $712 million for the year-ago quarter. Average earning assets rose by $6.6 billion, or 8%, due primarily to growth in commercial loans and the January 1 acquisition of U.S.B. Holding Co., Inc., which added approximately $1.5 billion to Key’s loan portfolio. The net interest margin for the current quarter declined to 3.13% from 3.40% for the third quarter of 2007. Approximately 13 basis points of the reduction was attributable to the prospective reduction in net interest income caused by the second quarter 2008 recalculation of income previously recognized on all leveraged leases being contested by the IRS. Also contributing to the lower net interest margin were tighter loan and deposit spreads caused by competitive pricing, and a higher level of nonperforming assets.  As previously reported, Key’s taxable-equivalent net interest income for the second quarter of 2008 was reduced significantly as a result of an adverse federal court decision on the company’s tax treatment of a Service Contract Lease transaction entered into by AWG Leasing Trust, in which Key is a partner. In accordance with the accounting guidance provided under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Staff Position No. 13-2, “Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction,” Key recalculated the lease income recognized from inception for all of the leveraged leases being contested by the IRS, not just the single leveraged lease subject to the Court decision. Key’s second quarter results also reflect a $475 million charge to income taxes for the interest cost associated with the contested tax liabilities. These actions reduced Key’s taxable-equivalent net interest income and net interest margin for the second quarter of 2008 by $838 million and 376 basis points, respectively, and reduced Key’s earnings by $1.011 billion, or $2.43 per common share.  56    Table of Contents  During the first quarter of 2008, Key increased its tax reserves for certain LILO transactions, the deductions for which have been disallowed by the IRS. The change in the level of LILO reserves also necessitated a recalculation of lease income under FASB Staff Position No. 13-2. These actions reduced Key’s taxable-equivalent net interest income and net interest margin for the first quarter of 2008 by $34 million and 15 basis points, respectively, and reduced Key’s earnings by $38 million, or $.10 per diluted common share.  As previously reported, Service Contract Leases, LILO transactions and Qualified Technological Equipment Leases represent a portion of Key’s overall leveraged lease financing portfolio, and the tax deductions for some of these transactions are being challenged by the IRS. On August 6, 2008, the IRS announced a global initiative for the settlement of all transactions, including the contested leveraged leases entered into by Key, which the IRS has characterized as LILO/SILO transactions (the “LILO/SILO Settlement Initiative”). As preconditions to its participation, Key was required to provide written acceptance to the IRS of the terms of the LILO/SILO Settlement Initiative and to dismiss its appeal of the AWG Leasing Trust litigation. Key has complied with these preconditions and was accepted into the LILO/SILO Settlement Initiative by the IRS on October 6, 2008. However, Key’s acceptance into this initiative is not binding until a closing agreement is executed by both Key and the IRS. Management believes that, upon the execution of a closing agreement, Key should realize an after-tax recovery of between $75 million and $100 million for previously accrued interest on disputed tax balances. Additional information related to these lease financing transactions, and the related LILO/SILO Settlement Initiative is included in Note 12 (“Income Taxes”), which begins on page 27.  For the fourth quarter of 2008, management expects Key’s net interest margin to be in the range of 3.00% to 3.10%. Management believes the continuation of competitive pressure on deposit pricing and the effect of customer draws under existing lines of credit at relatively narrow spreads will offset the impact of more favorable spreads on new assets.  Since January 1, 2007, the growth and composition of Key’s earning assets have been affected by the following actions:     ¨   During the first quarter of 2008, Key increased its loan portfolio (primarily commercial real estate and consumer loans) through the acquisition of U.S.B. Holding Co., Inc., the holding company for Union State Bank, a 31-branch state-chartered commercial bank headquartered in Orangeburg, New York.      ¨   Key sold $1.7 billion of commercial real estate loans during the first nine months of 2008 and $3.8 billion ($238 million through a securitization) during all of 2007. Since some of these loans have been sold with limited recourse (i.e., there is a risk that Key will be held accountable for certain events or representations made in the sales agreements), Key established and has maintained a loss reserve in an amount estimated by management to be appropriate. More information about the related recourse agreement is provided in Note 13 (“Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) under the heading “Recourse agreement with Federal National Mortgage Association” on page 30. In June 2008, Key transferred $384 million of commercial real estate loans ($719 million, net of $335 million in net charge-offs) from the held-to-maturity loan portfolio to held-for-sale status as part of a process undertaken to aggressively reduce its exposure in the residential properties segment of its construction loan portfolio through the planned sale of certain loans. Additional information about the status of this process is included in the section entitled “Commercial real estate loans” on page 67.      ¨   Key sold $120 million of education loans during the first nine months of 2008 and $247 million during all of 2007. In March 2008, Key transferred $3.3 billion of education loans from held-for-sale status to the held-to-maturity loan portfolio. The secondary markets for these loans have been adversely affected by market liquidity issues, prompting the company’s decision to move them to a held-to-maturity classification.      ¨   Key sold $700 million of other loans (including $580 million of residential mortgage loans) during the first nine months of 2008 and $1.2 billion during all of 2007.    57    Table of Contents  Figure 9.

Key’s January 1, 2008, adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 39, “Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts,” and FASB Staff Position FIN 39-1, “Amendment of FASB Interpretation 39.” Key’s adoption of this accounting guidance is described in Note 1 (“Basis of Presentation”) under the heading “Accounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2008” on page 9.          (a)   Interest income on tax-exempt securities and loans has been adjusted to a taxable-equivalent basis using the statutory federal income tax rate of 35%.     (b)   For purposes of these computations, nonaccrual loans are included in average loan balances.     (c)   During the second quarter of 2008, Key’s taxable-equivalent net interest income was reduced by $838 million as a result of an adverse federal court decision on Key’s tax treatment of a Service Contract Lease transaction. Excluding this reduction, the taxable-equivalent yield on Key’s commercial lease financing portfolio would have been 5.25% for the second quarter of 2008, and Key’s taxable-equivalent net interest margin would have been 3.32%. During the prior quarter, Key increased its tax reserves for certain LILO transactions and recalculated its lease income in accordance with prescribed accounting standards. These actions reduced Key’s first quarter 2008 taxable-equivalent net interest income by $34 million. Excluding this reduction, the taxable-equivalent yield on Key’s commercial lease financing portfolio would have been 5.27% for the first quarter of 2008, and Key’s taxable-equivalent net interest margin would have been 3.29%.    58    Table of Contents  Figure 9.

TE = Taxable Equivalent  Noninterest income  Key’s noninterest income was $388 million for the third quarter of 2008, compared to $438 million for the year-ago quarter. For the first nine months of the year, noninterest income was $1.5 billion, representing a decrease of $270 million, or 16%, from the first nine months of 2007.  In both the current and year-ago quarters, noninterest income was affected by significant items. Noninterest income for the third quarter of 2008 includes $54 million of derivative-related charges recorded as a result of market disruption caused by the failure of Lehman Brothers, and $31 million of net losses from the sales or write-downs of loans within the residential properties segment of the construction loan portfolio. Results for the third quarter of 2007 benefited from a $27 million gain from the sale of MasterCard Incorporated shares. For more information about the failure of Lehman Brothers and the implications for Key, see Note 13 (“Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”), which begins on page 29.  60    Table of Contents  Excluding significant items, Key’s noninterest income was $473 million for the third quarter of 2008, representing a $62 million, or 15%, increase from the same period last year. As shown in Figure 12, the improvement reflects a $14 million increase in income from trust and investment services, a $6 million increase in deposit service charges and, as shown in Figure 15 on page 63, a $15 million decrease in losses attributable to changes in the fair values of certain real estate related investments held by the Private Equity unit within the Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services line of business. Excluding the $31 million of loan-related losses discussed in the preceding paragraph, Key had net gains of $1 million from loan sales in the current quarter, compared to net losses of $53 million for the same period last year. These favorable results were offset in part by net losses of $24 million from principal investing in the third quarter of 2008, compared to net gains of $9 million for the year-ago quarter.  The trend in the major components of Key’s fee-based income over the past five quarters is shown in Figure 11.  Figure 11.

In addition to the two third quarter 2008 items discussed on page 60, Key’s noninterest income for the first nine months of 2008 includes a $165 million gain from the partial redemption of Visa Inc. shares. Results for the first nine months of 2007 include a $171 million gain associated with the sale of the McDonald Investments branch network, $67 million in gains related to the sale of MasterCard Incorporated shares, and a $26 million gain from the settlement of the automobile residual value insurance litigation.  Excluding significant items, Key’s noninterest income was $1.4 billion for the first nine months of 2008, representing an $86 million, or 6%, decrease from the same period last year. As shown in Figure 12, Key recorded net losses of $29 million from principal investing in the first nine months of 2008, compared to net gains of $128 million for the first nine months of 2007. Excluding the $31 million of net losses from the third quarter 2008 sales or write-downs of loans within the residential properties segment of the construction loan portfolio, net losses from loan sales rose by $56 million. The reduction in noninterest income attributable to these factors was substantially offset by a $49 million loss recorded during the first quarter of 2007 in connection with the repositioning of the securities portfolio, a $28 million increase in income from deposit service charges and a $41 million increase in income from trust and investment services. Last year’s results include $16 million of trust and investment services income generated by the McDonald Investments branch network. Adjusting for this revenue, trust and investment services income rose by $57 million, or 17%, driven by growth in institutional asset management income and income from brokerage commissions and fees.  61    Table of Contents  Figure 12.

Trust and investment services income. Trust and investment services generally are Key’s largest source of noninterest income. The primary components of revenue generated by these services are shown in Figure 13. The increases from 2007 results were attributable to strong growth in institutional asset management income and higher income from brokerage commissions and fees. Excluding the results of the McDonald Investments branch network, income from brokerage commissions and fees was up $33 million from the first nine months of 2007.  Figure 13. Trust and Investment Services Income                                                                              Three months ended                     Nine months ended               September 30,     Change     September 30,     Change     dollars in millions   2008     2007     Amount     Percent     2008     2007     Amount     Percent           Brokerage commissions and fee income   $ 37     $ 26     $ 11       42.3  %   $ 111     $ 94     $ 17       18.1  %   Personal asset management and custody fees     38       41       (3 )     (7.3 )     119       122       (3 )     (2.5 )   Institutional asset management and custody fees     58       52       6       11.5       170       143       27       18.9         Total trust and investment services income   $ 133     $ 119     $ 14       11.8  %   $ 400     $ 359     $ 41       11.4  %                                                                 A significant portion of Key’s trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management. At September 30, 2008, Key’s bank, trust and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of $76.7 billion, compared to $88.1 billion at September 30, 2007. As shown in Figure 14, most of the decrease was attributable to the equity and the securities lending portfolios. The reduction in the equity portfolio is attributable to weakness in the equity markets in general, while the decline in the securities lending portfolio was due in part to increased volatility in the fixed income markets and actions taken by management to maintain sufficient liquidity within the portfolio. When clients’ securities are lent to a borrower, the borrower must provide Key with cash collateral, which is invested during the term of the loan. The difference between the revenue generated from the investment and the cost of the collateral is shared with the lending client. This business, although profitable, generates a significantly lower rate of return (commensurate with the lower level of risk) than other types of assets under management. Key’s portfolio of hedge funds, which more than doubled over the past twelve months, generates a significantly higher rate of return and accounted for much of the improvement in Key’s trust and investment services income.  62    Table of Contents  Figure 14.

Service charges on deposit accounts were up from the prior year, due primarily to an increase in fee income from cash management services. The year-to-date increase from the prior year, to a lesser extent, also reflected higher overdraft fee income resulting from pricing and process changes.  Investment banking and capital markets (loss) income. As shown in Figure 15, the decreases in investment banking and capital markets (loss) income compared to the prior year were due to higher losses from dealer trading and derivatives, due primarily to the $54 million of losses on derivative contracts recorded during the current quarter as a result of market disruption caused by the failure of Lehman Brothers.

Key sells or securitizes loans to achieve desired interest rate and credit risk profiles, to improve the profitability of the overall loan portfolio or to diversify funding sources. During the first nine months of 2008, Key recorded $98 million of net losses from loan sales and write-downs, compared to net losses of $11 million for the first nine months of 2007. Results for the current year include $31 million of net losses from the third quarter 2008 sales or write-downs of loans within residential properties segment of the construction loan portfolio and $101 million of net losses from loan sales and write-downs recorded during the first quarter, due primarily to volatility in the fixed income markets and the related housing correction. Approximately $84 million of these losses pertained to commercial real estate loans held for sale. The types of loans sold during 2008 and 2007 are presented in Figure 20 on page 70. In March 2008, Key transferred $3.3 billion of education loans from held-for-sale status to the loan portfolio. The secondary markets for these loans have been adversely affected by market liquidity issues, precluding any recent securitizations and prompting the company’s decision to move them to a held-to-maturity classification.  Net (losses) gains from principal investing. Principal investments consist of direct and indirect investments in predominantly privately held companies. Key’s principal investing income is susceptible to volatility since most of it is derived from mezzanine debt and equity investments in small to medium-sized businesses. These investments are carried on the balance sheet at fair value ($1.0 billion at September 30, 2008, $993 million at December 31, 2007, and $970 million at September 30, 2007). The net (losses) gains presented in Figure 12 derive from changes in fair values as well as the sales of principal investments.  63    Table of Contents  Noninterest expense  Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2008 was $762 million, compared to $753 million for the third quarter of 2007. For the first nine months of the year, noninterest expense was $2.3 billion, representing a decrease of $77 million, or 3%, from the first nine months of 2007.  As shown in Figure 16, personnel expense decreased by $2 million from the third quarter of 2007, as increases in both salaries and severance expense were more than offset by reductions in costs associated with employee benefits and stock-based compensation. Nonpersonnel expense rose by $11 million, reflecting increases of $8 million in professional fees, $6 million in marketing expense, $5 million in net occupancy expense and $7 million resulting from the write-down or amortization of intangible assets. Included in noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2008 is $19 million of severance and other exit costs, including $10 million of expense recorded in connection with Key’s third quarter 2008 decision to exit direct and indirect retail and floor-plan lending for marine and recreational vehicle products. Key expects to record additional exit-related costs in the fourth quarter. The increase in noninterest expense relative to the year-ago quarter was moderated by a $23 million credit (included in “miscellaneous expense”), representing the reversal of the remaining litigation reserve associated with the previously reported Honsador litigation, which was settled in September 2008. See Note 13 (“Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”), which begins on page 29, for more information pertaining to the Honsador litigation.  For the year-to-date period, personnel expense decreased by $28 million. Approximately $17 million of the reduction was attributable to the sale of the McDonald Investments branch network. Nonpersonnel expense was down $49 million, due to the initial $42 million reserve established during the second quarter of 2007 in connection with the Honsador litigation and the related third quarter 2008 reversal of the remaining reserve discussed above. Additionally, nonpersonnel expense included a $21 million credit for losses on lending-related commitments in the current year, compared to a $3 million provision in the prior year. The sale of the McDonald Investments branch network reduced Key’s total nonpersonnel expense by approximately $19 million.  The decline in total noninterest expense was moderated by an increase in professional fees, higher net occupancy expense and additional expenses recorded during the first nine months of 2008 as a result of the January 1, 2008, acquisition of U.S.B. Holding Co., Inc. and the October 1, 2007, acquisition of Tuition Management Systems, Inc.  Figure 16.

N/M = Not Meaningful    The following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of Key’s noninterest expense and the factors that caused those elements to change.  64    Table of Contents  Personnel. As shown in Figure 17, personnel expense, the largest category of Key’s noninterest expense, decreased by $28 million, or 2%, from the first nine months of 2007. This improvement was largely attributable to lower costs associated with salaries and employee benefits stemming from a 4% reduction in the number of average full-time equivalent employees, and a decrease in stock-based compensation. The McDonald Investments branch network accounted for $3 million of Key’s personnel expense for the first nine months of 2008, compared to $20 million for the same period last year. The reductions discussed above were offset in part by an increase in severance expense, including $5 million of additional expense recorded in connection with Key’s third quarter 2008 decision to exit certain businesses.

The decrease in computer processing costs for both the quarterly and year-to-date periods reflects a reduction in expenses attributable to the use of outside services.  Professional fees. The increase in professional fees for both the quarterly and year-to-date periods was due in part to additional costs recorded in connection with increased collection efforts on loans and product pricing.  Income taxes  Key recorded a tax benefit of $46 million from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2008, compared to a provision of $86 million for the comparable period in 2007. The tax benefit was largely attributable to the continuation of a difficult economic environment and the resulting increase in Key’s provision for loan losses, which contributed to the loss recorded for the third quarter.  For the first nine months of 2008, Key recorded a provision for income taxes of $669 million, compared to $363 million for the first nine months of 2007. The significant increase in the year-to-date tax provision reflects several developments related to Key’s tax treatment of certain leveraged lease financing transactions.  During the second quarter of 2008, Key received an adverse federal court decision on the company’s tax treatment of a Service Contract Lease transaction entered into by AWG Leasing Trust, in which Key is a partner. Although the Court decision applies only to the previously disclosed AWG Leasing Litigation, in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,” Key was required to increase the amount of unrecognized tax benefits associated with all of the leases under challenge by the IRS by $2.15 billion. Key has deposited $1.975 billion (including $1.775 billion deposited with the IRS in October 2008) to cover the anticipated amount of taxes due to the IRS for the tax years 1998 through 2006. The increase in unrecognized tax benefits associated with the contested leases necessitated a recalculation of Key’s lease income under FASB Staff Position No. 13-2, “Accounting for a Change or Projected Change in the Timing of Cash Flows Relating to Income Taxes Generated by a Leveraged Lease Transaction,” as well as an increase to Key’s tax reserves. These actions reduced Key’s second quarter 2008 after-tax earnings by $1.011 billion, or $2.43 per common share, including a $359 million reduction to lease income, a $177 million increase to the provision for income taxes and a $475 million charge to the tax provision for the interest cost associated with the contested tax liabilities. During the third quarter of 2008, Key recorded a $30 million charge to the tax provision for the interest cost associated with the contested tax liabilities.  65    Table of Contents  During the first quarter of 2008, Key increased the amount of its unrecognized tax benefits associated with its LILO transactions by $46 million. This adjustment resulted from an updated assessment of Key’s tax position performed by management in accordance with the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48. The increase in unrecognized tax benefits associated with Key’s LILO transactions also necessitated a recalculation of Key’s lease income under FASB Staff Position No. 13-2 and an increase to Key’s tax reserves. These actions reduced Key’s first quarter 2008 after-tax earnings by $38 million, or $.10 per diluted common share, including a $3 million reduction to lease income, an $18 million increase to the provision for income taxes and a $17 million charge to the tax provision for the associated interest charges.  Excluding the lease financing charges recorded in the current year, Key’s effective tax rate was 92.7% for the third quarter of 2008, compared to 27.7% for the third quarter of 2007. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rates for the first nine months of 2008 and 2007 were 55.2% and 28.3%, respectively. The higher effective tax rates in 2008 reflect the combined effects of the losses recorded in the current year and the permanent tax differences described below.  On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rates for both the current and priors year differ from Key’s combined federal and state statutory tax rate of 37.5%, primarily because Key generated income from investments in tax-advantaged assets such as corporate-owned life insurance, earns credits associated with investments in low-income housing projects and records tax deductions associated with dividends paid to Key’s common shares held in the 401(k) savings plan.  In the ordinary course of business, Key enters into certain types of lease financing transactions, including those discussed above, that result in tax deductions. The IRS has completed audits of Key’s income tax returns for a number of prior years and has disallowed the tax deductions taken in connection with these transactions. On August 6, 2008, the IRS announced an initiative for the settlement of all transactions that the IRS has characterized as LILO/SILO transactions (the “LILO/SILO Settlement Initiative”). On October 6, 2008, Key was accepted into the LILO/SILO Settlement Initiative by the IRS. However, Key’s acceptance into this initiative is not binding until a closing agreement is executed by both Key and the IRS. Management believes that, upon the execution of a closing agreement, Key should realize an after-tax recovery of between $75 million and $100 million for previously accrued interest on disputed tax balances. Additional information pertaining to the status of leveraged lease tax issue and Key’s opt-in to the IRS’ global settlement initiative is included in Note 12 (“Income Taxes”), which begins on page 27.  66    Table of Contents  Financial Condition  Loans and loans held for sale  At September 30, 2008, total loans outstanding were $76.7 billion, compared to $70.8 billion at December 31, 2007, and $69.0 billion at September 30, 2007. The increase in Key’s loan portfolio over the past twelve months was primarily attributable to growth in the commercial portfolio and the March 2008 transfer of $3.3 billion of education loans from held-for-sale status to the loan portfolio.  Commercial loan portfolio  Commercial loans outstanding increased by $3.9 billion, or 8%, from the year ago quarter, due largely to a higher volume of originations in the commercial mortgage portfolio, and the commercial, financial and agricultural portfolio. This growth reflected increased reliance by borrowers on commercial lines of credit in response to the challenging economic environment, as well as the January 1, 2008, acquisition of U.S.B. Holding Co., Inc., which added approximately $900 million to Key’s commercial loan portfolio. The overall growth in the commercial loan portfolio was geographically broad-based and spread among a number of industry sectors.  Commercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans for both owner- and nonowner-occupied properties constitute one of the largest segments of Key’s commercial loan portfolio. At September 30, 2008, Key’s commercial real estate portfolio included mortgage loans of $10.6 billion and construction loans of $7.7 billion. The average mortgage loan originated during the first nine months of 2008 was $2 million, and the largest mortgage loan at September 30, 2008, had a balance of $63 million. At September 30, 2008, the average construction loan commitment was $6 million. The largest construction loan commitment was $75 million, of which $9 million was outstanding.  Key’s commercial real estate lending business is conducted through two primary sources: a 14-state banking franchise, and Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services, a national line of business that cultivates relationships both within and beyond the branch system. This line of business deals exclusively with nonowner-occupied properties (generally properties for which at least 50% of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties) and accounted for approximately 62% of Key’s average commercial real estate loans during the third quarter of 2008. Key’s commercial real estate business generally focuses on larger real estate developers and, as shown in Figure 18, is diversified by both industry type and geographic location of the underlying collateral.

The majority of the increase in this segment came from loans outstanding in Florida and southern California. As previously reported, Key has undertaken a process to reduce its exposure in the residential properties segment of its construction loan portfolio through the planned sale of certain loans. In conjunction with these efforts, Key transferred $384 million of commercial real estate loans ($719 million, net of $335 million in net charge-offs) from the held-to-maturity loan portfolio to held-for-sale status in June 2008. As of June 30, 2008, sales had closed on $44 million of these loans, and $340 million remained to be sold. During the third quarter, Key continued to work with bidders to finalize sales terms and documentation. However, continued disruption in the financial markets has precluded the ability of certain potential buyers to obtain the necessary funding. The balance of this portfolio was reduced to $133 million at September 30, 2008, as a result of sales, transfers to other real estate owned (“OREO”), and both realized and unrealized losses. Key is continuing to pursue the sale of the remaining loans, all of which are on nonperforming status.  During the third quarter of 2008, Key determined that it will cease conducting business with homebuilders within its 14-state Community Banking footprint.  Commercial lease financing. Management believes Key has both the scale and array of products to compete in the specialty of equipment lease financing. Key conducts these financing arrangements through the Equipment Finance line of business. Commercial lease financing receivables represented 17% of commercial loans at September 30, 2008, compared to 20% at September 30, 2007.  Consumer loan portfolio  Consumer loans outstanding increased by $3.8 billion, or 21%, from one year ago. As stated previously, in March 2008, Key transferred $3.3 billion of education loans from held-for-sale status to the loan portfolio. The secondary markets for these loans have been adversely affected by market liquidity issues, prompting the company’s decision to move them to a held-to-maturity classification. Adjusting for this transfer, consumer loans were up $488 million, or 3%, from the year-ago quarter, due primarily to the January 1, 2008, acquisition of U.S.B. Holding Co., Inc.  The home equity portfolio is by far the largest segment of Key’s consumer loan portfolio. A significant amount of this portfolio (90% at September 30, 2008) is derived primarily from the Regional Banking line of business within the Community Banking group; the remainder originated from the Consumer Finance line of business within the National Banking group and has been in a runoff mode since the fourth quarter of 2007.  Figure 19 summarizes Key’s home equity loan portfolio by source at the end of each of the last five quarters, as well as certain asset quality statistics and yields on the portfolio as a whole.

Management expects the level of Key’s consumer loan portfolio to decrease in the future as a result of actions taken to exit low-return, indirect businesses. In December 2007, Key decided to exit dealer-originated home improvement lending activities, which are largely out-of-footprint. During the third quarter of 2008, Key decided to exit direct and indirect retail and floor-plan lending for marine and recreational vehicle products, and to limit new student loans to those backed by government guarantee.  68    Table of Contents  Loans held for sale As shown in Note 6 (“Loans and Loans Held for Sale”), which begins on page 21, Key’s loans held for sale were $1.5 billion at September 30, 2008, compared to $4.7 billion at December 31, 2007, and $4.8 billion at September 30, 2007. The decrease was attributable to the transfer of $3.3 billion of education loans from held-for-sale status to the loan portfolio, and sales of commercial real estate loans. Adjusting for the transfer, loans held for sale were relatively unchanged from the year-ago quarter. At September 30, 2008, Key’s loans held for sale included $718 million of commercial mortgage loans. In the absence of quoted market prices, management uses valuation models to measure the fair value of these loans and adjusts the amount recorded on the balance sheet if fair value falls below recorded cost. The models are based on assumptions related to prepayment speeds, default rates, funding cost and discount rates. In light of the volatility in the financial markets, management has reviewed Key’s assumptions and determined they reflect current market conditions. As a result, no significant adjustments to the assumptions were required during the first nine months of 2008. During the first nine months of 2008, Key recorded net unrealized losses of $53 million and net realized losses of $59 million on its loans held for sale portfolio. Key records these transactions in “net losses from loan securitizations and sales” on the income statement. Key has not been significantly impacted by market volatility in the subprime mortgage lending industry, having exited this business in the fourth quarter of 2006. Sales and securitizations As market conditions allow, Key continues to utilize alternative funding sources like loan sales and securitizations to support its loan origination capabilities. In addition, certain acquisitions completed over the past several years have improved Key’s ability under favorable market conditions to originate and sell new loans, and to securitize and service loans generated by others, especially in the area of commercial real estate. During the past twelve months, Key sold $2.6 billion of commercial real estate loans, $698 million of residential real estate loans, $279 million of commercial loans and leases, $144 million of education loans and $9 million of marine loans. Most of these sales came from the held-for-sale portfolio. Due to unfavorable market conditions, Key did not proceed with an education loan securitization during 2007 or the first nine months of 2008, and does not anticipate entering into any securitizations of this type during the remainder of 2008. Among the factors that Key considers in determining which loans to sell or securitize are:    ¨   whether particular lending businesses meet established performance standards or fit with Key’s relationship banking strategy;       ¨   Key’s asset/liability management needs;       ¨   whether the characteristics of a specific loan portfolio make it conducive to securitization;       ¨   the cost of alternative funding sources;       ¨   the level of credit risk;       ¨   capital requirements; and       ¨   market conditions and pricing.   69   Table of Contents  Figure 20 summarizes Key’s loan sales (including securitizations) for the first nine months of 2008 and all of 2007.

Key acquired the servicing for commercial mortgage loan portfolios with an aggregate principal balance of $738 million for the second quarter 2008, $345 million for the first quarter 2008, $5.3 billion for the fourth quarter 2007 and $21.1 billion for the third quarter 2007.    In the event of default by a borrower, Key is subject to recourse with respect to approximately $692 million of the $129.5 billion of loans administered or serviced at September 30, 2008. Additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in Note 13 (“Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) under the heading “Recourse agreement with Federal National Mortgage Association” on page 30.  Key derives income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are securitized or sold. Key earns noninterest income (recorded as “other income”) from fees for servicing or administering loans. This fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets. In addition, Key earns interest income from securitized assets retained and from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing of commercial real estate loans.  Securities  At September 30, 2008, the securities portfolio totaled $8.4 billion, compared to $7.9 billion at December 31, 2007, and $8.0 billion at September 30, 2007. At each of these dates, almost the entire securities portfolio consisted of securities available for sale, with the remainder consisting of held-to-maturity securities of less than $40 million.  Securities available for sale. The majority of Key’s securities available-for-sale portfolio consists of collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”). A CMO is a debt security that is secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities. Key’s CMOs generate interest income and serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements. At September 30, 2008, Key had $8.0 billion invested in CMOs and  70    Table of Contents  other mortgage-backed securities in the available-for-sale portfolio, compared to $7.6 billion at December 31, 2007, and $7.5 billion at September 30, 2007.  Management periodically evaluates Key’s securities available-for-sale portfolio in light of established asset/liability management objectives, changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio, and the level of interest rate risk to which Key is exposed. These evaluations may cause management to take steps to improve Key’s overall balance sheet positioning.  In March 2007, management completed a comprehensive evaluation of the securities available-for-sale portfolio and determined that a repositioning of the portfolio was appropriate to enhance future financial performance, particularly in the event of a decline in interest rates. As a result, Key sold $2.4 billion of shorter-maturity CMOs and reinvested the proceeds in mortgage-backed securities with higher yields and longer expected average maturities. The repositioning also reduced Key’s exposure to prepayment risk if interest rates were to have declined by replacing the CMOs sold with CMOs whose underlying mortgage loans have shorter maturities and lower coupon rates. At that time, Key maintained a relatively neutral exposure to near-term changes in interest rates. Neither funding nor capital levels were affected materially by this portfolio repositioning.  As a result of the sale of CMOs, Key recorded a net realized loss of $49 million ($31 million after tax, or $.08 per diluted common share) during the first quarter of 2007. This net loss was previously recorded in “net unrealized losses on securities available for sale” in the “accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component” of shareholders’ equity.  In addition to changing market conditions, the size and composition of Key’s securities available-for-sale portfolio could vary with Key’s needs for liquidity and the extent to which Key is required (or elects) to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits. Although Key generally uses debt securities for this purpose, other assets, such as securities purchased under resale agreements, are occasionally used when they provide more favorable yields or risk profiles.  As shown in Figure 22, all of Key’s mortgage-backed securities are issued by government sponsored enterprises or the Government National Mortgage Association, and are traded in highly liquid secondary markets. Management employs an outside bond pricing service to determine the fair value at which they should be recorded on the balance sheet. In performing the valuations, the pricing service relies on models that consider security-specific details as well as relevant industry and economic factors. The most significant of these inputs are quoted market prices, interest rate spreads on relevant benchmark securities and certain prepayment assumptions. The valuations derived from the models are reviewed by management for reasonableness to ensure they are consistent with the values placed on similar securities traded in the secondary markets.

These net gains include net unrealized gains of $113 million, caused by the decline in benchmark Treasury yields, offset in part by the widening of interest rate spreads on these securities.

They include direct investments (investments made in a particular company), as well as indirect investments (investments made through funds that include other investors). Principal investments are predominantly made in privately held companies and are carried at fair value ($1.0 billion at September 30, 2008, $993 million at December 31, 2007, and $970 million at September 30, 2007). In addition to principal investments, “other investments” include other equity and mezzanine instruments, such as certain real estate-related investments that are carried at fair value, as well as other types of investments that generally are carried at cost. Most of Key’s other investments are not traded on a ready market. Management determines the fair value at which these investments should be recorded based on the nature of the specific investment, and all available information and relevant facts about the issuer’s performance. Management’s review may encompass such factors as the issuer’s past financial performance and future potential, the values of public companies in comparable businesses, the risks associated with the particular business or investment type, current market conditions, the nature and duration of resale restrictions, the issuer’s payment history, management’s knowledge of the industry and other relevant factors. For the first nine months of 2008, net losses from Key’s principal investing activities totaled $29 million, which included $66 million of net unrealized losses. Key records these net losses as “net (losses) gains from principal investing” on the income statement. Deposits and other sources of funds Domestic deposits are Key’s primary source of funding. Other than certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more, these deposits generally are stable, have a relatively low cost and typically react more slowly to changes in interest rates than market-based deposits. During the third quarter of 2008, domestic deposits averaged $61.8 billion, and represented 69% of the funds Key used to support loans and other earning assets, compared to $58.0 billion and 69% during the same quarter in 2007. The composition of Key’s deposits is shown in Figure 9, which spans pages 58 and 59. The increase in average domestic deposits compared to the third quarter of 2007 was due primarily to growth in Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (“NOW”) and money market deposits accounts, certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more, and other time deposits, offset in part by a decline in noninterest-bearing deposits. The growth in and change in composition of domestic deposits were attributable to several factors.    ¨   The January 1, 2008, acquisition of U.S.B. Holding Co., Inc. added approximately $1.7 billion to Key’s average domestic deposits for the current quarter. Adjusting for the acquisition of U.S.B. Holding Co., Inc., average domestic deposits were up approximately $2.1 billion, or 4%, from the third quarter of 2007.      ¨   The increase in NOW and money market deposits accounts and the decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits reflect actions taken by Key in November 2007 to reduce its deposit reserve requirement by converting approximately $3.4 billion of noninterest-bearing deposits to NOW and money market deposit accounts.      ¨   Competition for deposits in the markets in which Key operates remains strong, and consumer preferences shifted more to certificates of deposit as a result of the declining interest rate environment.   Purchased funds, consisting of deposits in the foreign office and short-term borrowings, averaged $10.2 billion in the third quarter of 2008, compared to $11.5 billion during the year-ago quarter. The reduction reflected a $1.8 billion decrease in average deposits in the foreign office, offset in part by an increase in the level of bank notes and other short-term borrowings. 73   Table of Contents  Substantially all of KeyBank’s domestic deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. Accordingly, KeyBank is subject to deposit insurance premium assessments by the FDIC. Under current law, the FDIC is required to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) reserve ratio within the range of 1.15% to 1.50% of estimated insured deposits. Current law also requires the FDIC to implement a restoration plan when it determines that the DIF reserve ratio has fallen, or will fall within six months, below 1.15% of estimated insured deposits. As of June 30, 2008, the DIF reserve ratio was 1.01%. On October 7, 2008, the FDIC announced a restoration plan under which all depository institutions, regardless of risk, will pay a $.07 additional assessment for each $100 of domestic deposits for the first quarter of 2009. Effective April 1, 2009, under a new risk-based assessment system, which is proposed to be implemented as part of the FDIC’s restoration plan, assessments for all depository institutions will range from $.08 to $.775 for each $100 of domestic deposits based on the institution’s risk category. In addition to the assessment under the restoration plan, an annualized fee of 10 basis points will be assessed on noninterest-bearing transaction account balances in excess of $250,000 in conjunction with the transaction account guarantee part of the FDIC’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program discussed on page 78. As a result, management anticipates that Key’s total premium assessment on deposits may increase by a substantial amount in 2009. Capital Shareholders’ equity Total shareholders’ equity at September 30, 2008, was $8.7 billion, up $905 million from December 31, 2007. Factors contributing to the change in shareholders’ equity during the first nine months of 2008 are shown in the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders’ Equity presented on page 5. During the second quarter of 2008, Key took several actions to further strengthen its capital position in light of charges recorded in connection with the adverse federal court decision in the AWG Leasing Litigation. KeyCorp issued $650 million, or 6.5 million shares, of noncumulative perpetual convertible preferred stock with a liquidation value of $100 per share, and $1.0 billion, or 85.1 million shares, of additional common stock. Further, Key’s Board of Directors announced its intention to reduce the dividend on Key’s common shares by 50% to an annualized dividend of $.75 per share, commencing with the dividend payable in the third quarter of 2008. As part of the over-allotment granted by KeyCorp to the underwriters in conjunction with the issuance of preferred stock and common shares, Key issued 7 million additional common shares and 75,000 additional shares of noncumulative perpetual convertible preferred stock on July 11, 2008. The proceeds received as a result of these issuances totaled approximately $90 million. Common shares outstanding Figure 25 shows activities that caused the change in Key’s outstanding common shares over the past five quarters. Figure 25.

The program does not have an expiration date. Key did not repurchase any common shares during the first nine months of 2008. Further, in accordance with the provisions of the TARP Capital Purchase Program discussed on page 77, Key will not be permitted to repurchase additional common shares without the approval of the U.S. Treasury as long as the TARP preferred stock to be issued by Key under the program remains outstanding. At September 30, 2008, 14.0 million shares were remaining for repurchase under Board authority.  At September 30, 2008, Key had 89.3 million treasury shares. Management expects to reissue those shares as needed in connection with stock-based compensation awards and for other corporate purposes. On January 1, 2008, Key reissued 9.9 million of its common shares in connection with the acquisition of U.S.B. Holding Co., Inc. Additionally, during the first nine months of 2008, Key reissued 3.9 million shares under employee benefit plans.  Capital availability and management  As a result of recent market disruptions, the availability of capital (principally to financial services companies) has become significantly restricted. While some companies, such as Key, have been successful in raising additional capital, the cost of that capital has been substantially higher than the prevailing market rates prior to the volatility. Management cannot predict when or if the markets will return to more favorable conditions.  As discussed above, during the second and third quarters of 2008, Key raised additional capital of $1.74 billion through the issuance of both noncumulative perpetual convertible preferred stock and common shares. In addition, Key’s Board of Directors reduced the dividend on Key’s common shares commencing with the dividend payable in the third quarter of 2008. These actions were taken to further strengthen Key’s capital position and to position Key to respond to future business opportunities as they emerge.  During the third quarter of 2008, Key senior management formed a Capital Allocation Committee, which consists of senior finance, risk management and business executives. This committee determines how capital is to be strategically allocated among Key’s businesses to maximize returns and strengthen core relationship businesses. The committee will continue to emphasize Key’s relationship strategy and provide capital to the areas that consistently demonstrate the ability to grow and show positive returns above the cost of capital. Key’s third quarter 2008 decisions to exit direct and indirect retail and floor-plan lending for marine and recreational vehicle products, and to limit new student loans to those backed by government guarantees were made in accordance with this strategy.  Capital adequacy Capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance. Key’s ratio of total shareholders’ equity to total assets was 8.54% at September 30, 2008, compared to 7.89% at December 31, 2007, and 8.13% at September 30, 2007. Key’s ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets was 6.95% at September 30, 2008.  Banking industry regulators prescribe minimum capital ratios for bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries. Note 14 (“Shareholders’ Equity”), which begins on page 87 of Key’s 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, explains the implications of failing to meet these specific capital requirements.  Risk-based capital guidelines require a minimum level of capital as a percent of “risk-weighted assets.” Risk-weighted assets consist of total assets plus certain off-balance sheet items, subject to adjustment for predefined credit risk factors. Currently, banks and bank holding companies must maintain, at a minimum, Tier 1 capital as a percent of risk-weighted assets of 4.00%, and total capital as a percent of risk-weighted assets of 8.00%. As of September 30, 2008, Key’s Tier 1 capital ratio was 8.55%, and its total capital ratio was 12.40%.  75    Table of Contents  Another indicator of capital adequacy, the leverage ratio, is defined as Tier 1 capital as a percentage of average quarterly tangible assets. Leverage ratio requirements vary with the condition of the financial institution. Bank holding companies that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the Federal Reserve’s risk-adjusted measure for market risk — as KeyCorp has — must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 3.00%. All other bank holding companies must maintain a minimum ratio of 4.00%. As of September 30, 2008, Key had a leverage ratio of 9.28%.  Federal bank regulators group FDIC-insured depository institutions into five categories, ranging from “critically undercapitalized” to “well capitalized.” Key’s affiliate bank, KeyBank, qualified as “well capitalized” at September 30, 2008, since it exceeded the prescribed thresholds of 10.00% for total capital, 6.00% for Tier 1 capital and 5.00% for the leverage ratio. If these provisions applied to bank holding companies, Key also would qualify as “well capitalized” at September 30, 2008. The FDIC-defined capital categories serve a limited supervisory function. Investors should not treat them as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of KeyCorp or KeyBank.  Figure 26 presents the details of Key’s regulatory capital position at September 30, 2008, December 31, 2007, and September 30, 2007.  Figure 26.

Title I of the EESA, the Troubled Asset Relief Program (“TARP”), provides broad authority to the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury to restore liquidity and stability to the United States financial system, including the authority to purchase up to $700 billion of “troubled assets"— mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and certain other financial instruments.  While the key feature of TARP provides the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury the authority to purchase and guarantee types of troubled assets, other programs have emerged out of the authority and resources authorized by the EESA. Details of the programs being administered pursuant to the EESA by the U.S. Treasury and other regulatory bodies are still emerging.  The TARP Capital Purchase Program. On October 14, 2008, the U.S. Treasury announced that it will purchase up to $250 billion of perpetual preferred stock to be issued by U.S. banks, savings associations, bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies. Pursuant to the TARP Capital Purchase Program, the U.S. Treasury will provide qualifying financial institutions (“QFI”) with capital by subscribing for the perpetual preferred stock of these institutions (“TARP Preferred Stock”) in amounts between 1% and the lesser of 3% of a QFI’s risk-weighted assets, or $25 billion, subject to certain terms and conditions outlined in the TARP Public Term Sheet (“TARP Term Sheet”) available at the U.S. Treasury website (www.ustreas.gov/initiatives/eesa).  In early October 2008, nine large financial institutions agreed to participate in this program to signal the importance of the program to encouraging stability in the U.S. financial markets. Key believes that all participating financial institutions will be subject to the same terms and conditions.  On October 24, 2008, the U.S. Treasury informed KeyCorp that it had received preliminary approval to participate in the U.S. Treasury’s TARP Capital Purchase Program, under which the U.S. Treasury would purchase $2.5 billion of TARP preferred stock and warrants to purchase common shares of KeyCorp. Management believes KeyCorp’s participation in the TARP Capital Purchase Program is in the best interests of the corporation, its clients and shareholders, and that KeyCorp’s participation will contribute to the U.S. Treasury’s efforts to stabilize the U.S. financial system.  Pursuant to the TARP Term Sheet, the TARP Preferred Stock will: (1) be non-voting, other than class voting rights on matters that could adversely affect the shares; (2) pay a cumulative dividend rate of 5% per annum for the first five years, which will reset to a rate of 9% per annum after year five; and (3) be callable at par after three years. In conjunction with the purchase of TARP Preferred Stock from KeyCorp, the U.S. Treasury will receive warrants to purchase common shares with an aggregate market price equal to 15% of the TARP Preferred Stock investment.  The anticipated dilution from the TARP Preferred Stock investment by the U.S. Treasury is projected to be approximately 15% on an annualized basis. The dilution calculation considers the cost of the TARP Preferred Stock dividend payments, the accretion of the discount on the TARP Preferred Stock issued, and the additional common share equivalents created by the issuance of warrants on KeyCorp common shares, partially offset by the funding cost reduction provided by the additional $2.5 billion of investment funds.  Pursuant to an interim final rule issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on October 16, 2008, bank holding companies that issue new TARP Preferred Stock to the U.S. Treasury under the TARP Capital Purchase Program are permitted to include such capital instruments in Tier 1 capital for purposes of the Board’s risk-based and leverage capital rules and guidelines for bank holding companies.  Temporary increased deposit insurance limits. The EESA provides for a temporary increase in the FDIC standard maximum deposit insurance amount from $100,000 to $250,000. This temporary increase became effective on October 3, 2008, and expires December 31, 2009. Pursuant to the terms of the EESA,  77    Table of Contents  the FDIC may not take this temporary increase in limits into account when setting deposit insurance premium assessments.  FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program  Following the EESA being signed into law, the FDIC made a systemic risk recommendation with the written concurrence of the Federal Reserve, and the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, after consultation with President Bush. The determination of systemic risk allowed the FDIC, in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, to announce on October 14, 2008, its Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (“TLG Program”). The TLG Program, as described in the Interim Rule issued October 23, 2008 (with request for comments, but effective immediately), is intended to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system. Under the TLG Program, the FDIC will temporarily guarantee: (1) qualifying newly issued senior unsecured debt of insured depository institutions, their U.S. holding companies and certain other affiliates of insured depository institutions designated by the FDIC (“Debt Guarantee”), and (2) funds held at FDIC-insured depository institutions in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts in excess of the current standard maximum deposit insurance amount of $250,000 (“Transaction Account Guarantee”). The Transaction Account Guarantee is effective from October 14, 2008, until January 1, 2010, provided an institution does not opt-out.  Both guarantees are being provided to eligible entities, including KeyBank and KeyCorp, at no cost until December 5, 2008. Thereafter, and absent an effective opt-out from either or both of the Debt Guarantee or Transaction Account Guarantee parts of the program, an eligible entity continuing to participate in the Debt Guarantee initially will be assessed an annualized fee of 75 basis points for its participation, and an eligible entity continuing to participate in the Transaction Account Guarantee initially will be assessed an annualized fee of 10 basis points for its participation. To the extent that these initial assessments are insufficient to cover the expenses or losses arising under the program, the FDIC is required to impose an emergency special assessment on all FDIC-insured depository institutions as prescribed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Currently, management intends to continue participating in both the Debt Guarantee and Transaction Account Guarantee parts of the program following the initial period.  Under the Debt Guarantee, qualifying senior unsecured debt newly issued by a participating eligible entity during the period from October 14, 2008, to June 30, 2009, inclusive, is covered by an FDIC guarantee. The maximum amount of debt that an eligible entity can issue under the guarantee is 125% of the par value of the eligible entity’s qualifying senior unsecured debt, excluding debt extended to affiliates, outstanding as of September 30, 2008, and scheduled to mature by June 30, 2009. For FDIC-guaranteed debt issued on or before June 30, 2009, the Debt Guarantee will terminate on the earlier of the maturity of the debt or June 30, 2012. Based on Key’s qualifying debt outstanding at September 30, 2008, management estimates that at least $2.0 billion of newly issued senior unsecured KeyCorp and KeyBank debt, in the aggregate, would be covered under the Debt Guarantee, and possibly additional amounts depending upon certain factors. Qualifying senior unsecured debt means unsecured borrowing that is evidenced by a written agreement, has a specified and fixed principal amount to be paid on demand or on a date certain, is noncontingent, and is not by its terms subordinated to any other liability. Such senior unsecured debt includes, for example, federal funds purchased, promissory notes, commercial paper, unsubordinated unsecured notes, certificates of deposit standing to the credit of an insured depository institution or a depository institution regulated by a foreign bank supervisory agency, and Eurodollar deposits standing to the credit of an insured depository institution or a depository institution regulated by a foreign bank supervisory agency.  Under the Transaction Account Guarantee, a qualifying noninterest-bearing transaction account is a transaction account that is maintained at an FDIC-insured depository institution, with respect to which interest is neither paid nor accrued, and on which the institution does not reserve the right to require advance notice of an intended withdrawal. Such accounts typically include, but are not limited to, payment-processing accounts such as payroll accounts. In addition, in the case of funds swept from a qualifying noninterest-bearing transaction account to a noninterest-bearing savings deposit account, the FDIC will treat the swept funds as being in a noninterest-bearing transaction account and guaranteed under this part of the program.  78    Table of Contents  Risk Management Overview Like other financial services companies, Key engages in business activities with inherent risks. The ability to properly and effectively identify, measure, monitor and report such risks is essential to maintaining safety and soundness and to maximizing profitability. Management believes that the most significant risks facing Key are market risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and operational risk, and that these risks must be managed across the entire enterprise. Key continues to enhance its Enterprise Risk Management practices and program, and uses a risk adjusted capital framework to manage these risks. This framework is approved and managed by the Risk Capital Committee, which consists of senior finance, risk management and business executives. Each type of risk is defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section. Key’s Board of Directors has established and follows a corporate governance program that serves as the foundation for managing and mitigating risk. In accordance with this program, the Board focuses on the interests of shareholders, encourages strong internal controls, demands management accountability, mandates adherence to Key’s code of ethics and administers an annual self-assessment process. The Audit and Risk Management committees help the Board meet these risk oversight responsibilities. The responsibilities of these two committees are summarized on page 46 of Key’s 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders. Market risk management The values of some financial instruments vary not only with changes in market interest rates but also with changes in foreign exchange rates. Financial instruments also are susceptible to factors influencing valuations in the equity securities markets and other market-driven rates or prices. For example, the value of a fixed-rate bond will decline if market interest rates increase. Similarly, the value of the U.S. dollar regularly fluctuates in relation to other currencies. When the value of an instrument is tied to such external factors, the holder faces “market risk.” Most of Key’s market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations. Interest rate risk management Interest rate risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the economic value of equity. Such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. To minimize the volatility of net interest income and the economic value of equity, Key manages exposure to interest rate risk in accordance with guidelines established by the Asset/Liability Management Committee (“ALCO”). This committee, which consists of senior finance and business executives, meets monthly and periodically reports Key’s interest rate risk positions to the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors. Interest rate risk positions can be influenced by a number of factors other than changes in market interest rates, including economic conditions, the competitive environment within Key’s markets, consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products, and the level of interest rate exposure arising from basis risk, gap risk, yield curve risk and option risk. Each of these types of risk is defined in the discussion of market risk management, which begins on page 46 of Key’s 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders. Net interest income simulation analysis. The primary tool management uses to measure Key’s interest rate risk is simulation analysis. For purposes of this analysis, management estimates Key’s net interest income based on the composition of its on- and off-balance sheet positions and the current interest rate environment. The simulation assumes that growth in Key’s on- and off-balance sheet positions will reflect recent product trends, as well as consensus economic forecasts. 79   Table of Contents  The amount of net interest income at risk is measured by simulating the change in the level of net interest income that would occur if the federal funds target rate were to gradually increase or decrease by 200 basis points over the next twelve months, and term rates were to move in a similar fashion, but not as dramatically. Short-term interest rates were relatively low at September 30, 2008, and as a result management modified the standard rate scenario of a gradual decrease of 200 basis points over twelve months to a gradual decrease of 150 basis points over nine months and no change over the following three months. Management then compares the amount of net interest income at risk to the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment. The analysis also considers sensitivity to changes in a number of other variables, including other market interest rates and deposit mix. In addition, management assesses the potential effect of different shapes in the yield curve, including a sustained flat yield curve and an inverted slope yield curve. (The yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity.) Management also performs stress tests to measure the effect on net interest income of an immediate change in market interest rates, as well as changes in assumptions related to the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities, prepayments on loans and securities, and loan and deposit growth.  Simulation analysis produces only a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on assumptions and judgments related to balance sheet growth, customer behavior, new products, new business volume, pricing and anticipated hedging activities. Management tailors the assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled, and validates those assumptions on a periodic basis. Consistent with current practice, simulations are performed with the assumption that interest rate risk positions will be actively managed through the use of on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments to achieve the desired risk profile. Actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, actual hedging strategies employed, changes in balance sheet composition, and the possible effects of unanticipated or unknown events.  Figure 27 presents the results of the simulation analysis at September 30, 2008 and 2007. At September 30, 2008, Key’s simulated exposure to a change in short-term rates was modestly asset-sensitive. ALCO policy guidelines for risk management call for corrective measures if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual increase or decrease in short-term rates over the next twelve months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 2%. As shown in Figure 27, Key is operating within these guidelines.  Figure 27. Simulated Change in Net Interest Income                            September 30, 2008                       Basis point change assumption (short-term rates)     -150       +200     ALCO policy guidelines     -2.00 %     -2.00 %       Interest rate risk assessment     +.45 %     +.34 %                           September 30, 2007                       Basis point change assumption (short-term rates)     -200        +200     ALCO policy guidelines     -2.00 %     -2.00 %       Interest rate risk assessment     +1.65 %     -.52 %         From September 2007 through October 2008, the Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds target rate by 425 basis points. During 2007, Key’s interest rate risk exposure gradually changed from relatively neutral to modestly liability-sensitive. During the third quarter of 2008, Key’s exposure to rising interest rates shifted to modestly asset-sensitive as client preferences resulted in significant growth of fixed-rate certificates of deposit. Exposure to declining interest rates indicates that there is a modest level of potential benefit. Key’s current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the actual volume, mix and maturity of loan and deposit flows, the relationship between certain money market interest rates, the ability to administer pricing of certain deposit accounts as projected in the simulation model, and hedging opportunities. Any further hedging activities will be based upon an assessment of the competitive deposit pricing environment and the outlook for the interbank lending market. Key proactively evaluates the need to revise its interest rate risk profile as changes occur in business flows and the outlook for the economy.  80    Table of Contents  Management also conducts simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second year of a two-year horizon. These simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a twelve-month horizon. To capture longer-term exposures, management simulates changes to the economic value of equity as discussed in the following section.  Economic value of equity modeling. Economic value of equity (“EVE”) complements net interest income simulation analysis since it provides estimates of risk exposure beyond twelve and twenty-four month horizons. EVE measures the extent to which the economic values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to changes in interest rates. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates, and measuring the resulting change in the values of assets and liabilities. Under the current level of market interest rates, the calculation of EVE under an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest rates results in certain interest rates declining to zero percent, and a less than 200 basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points. This analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities. Those assumptions are based on historical behaviors, as well as management’s expectations. Management takes corrective measures so that Key’s EVE will not decrease by more than 15% in response to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates. Key is operating within these guidelines.  Management of interest rate exposure. Management uses the results of its various simulation analyses to formulate strategies to achieve the desired risk profile within the parameters of Key’s capital and liquidity guidelines. Specifically, management actively manages interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities, issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates, and using derivatives — predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps, which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities.  Figure 28 shows all swap positions held by Key for asset/liability management (“A/LM”) purposes. These positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. For example, fixed-rate debt is converted to a floating rate through a “receive fixed, pay variable” interest rate swap. The volume, maturity and mix of portfolio swaps changes frequently with changes in balance sheet positions selected to be hedged, and with changes to broader asset/liability management objectives. For more information about how Key uses interest rate swaps to manage its balance sheet, see Note 14 (“Derivatives and Hedging Activities”), which begins on page 32.  Figure 28. Portfolio Swaps by Interest Rate Risk Management Strategy                                                                      September 30, 2008     September 30, 2007         Notional     Fair     Maturity     Weighted-Average Rate     Notional     Fair     dollars in millions   Amount     Value     (Years)     Receive     Pay     Amount     Value           Receive fixed/pay variable — conventional A/LM a   $ 11,138     $ 73       1.5       3.9 %     2.5 %   $ 7,138     $ 35     Receive fixed/pay variable — conventional debt     5,894       197       19.9       5.6       3.1       4,814       (9 )   Receive fixed/pay variable — forward starting     —       —       —       —       —       4,100       32     Pay fixed/receive variable — conventional debt     874       (26 )     4.2       4.2       4.8       974       (7 )   Foreign currency — conventional debt     2,659       (215 )     2.2       5.3       3.0       2,707       313         Total portfolio swaps   $ 20,565     $ 29       7.0       4.6 %     2.8 %   $ 19,733     $ 364                                                                       (a)   Portfolio swaps designated as A/LM are used to manage interest rate risk tied to both assets and liabilities.    Trading portfolio risk management  Key’s trading derivatives portfolio is described in Note 14. Management uses a value at risk (“VAR”) simulation model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of Key’s trading portfolio. Using two years of historical information, the model estimates the maximum potential one-day loss with a 95% confidence level. Statistically, this means that losses will exceed VAR, on average, five out of 100 trading days, or three to four times each quarter.  81    Table of Contents  Key manages exposure to market risk in accordance with VAR limits for trading activity that have been approved by the Risk Capital Committee. At September 30, 2008, the aggregate one-day trading limit set by the committee was $6.4 million. Key is operating within these constraints. During the first nine months of 2008, Key’s aggregate daily average, minimum and maximum VAR amounts were $2.5 million, $1.7 million and $4.3 million, respectively. During the same period one year ago, Key’s aggregate daily average, minimum and maximum VAR amounts were $1.1 million, $.7 million and $2.1 million, respectively.  In addition to comparing VAR exposure against limits on a daily basis, management monitors loss limits, uses sensitivity measures and conducts stress tests. Risk Management reports Key’s market risk exposure to Key’s Risk Capital Committee and the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors.  Liquidity risk management  Key defines “liquidity” as the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences. Liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions. In addition, Key occasionally guarantees a subsidiary’s obligations in transactions with third parties. Management closely monitors the extension of such guarantees to ensure that Key retains ample liquidity to satisfy these obligations.  Key manages liquidity for all of its affiliates on an integrated basis. This approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity, as well as each entity’s capacity to manage through adverse conditions. It also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to money market funding.  Under ordinary circumstances, management monitors Key’s funding sources and measures its capacity to obtain funds in a variety of situations in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable cash. Management has established guidelines or target ranges for various types of wholesale borrowings, such as money market funding and term debt, at various maturities. In addition, management assesses whether Key will need to rely on wholesale borrowings in the future and develops strategies to address those needs.  From time to time, KeyCorp or its principal subsidiary, KeyBank, may seek to retire or repurchase outstanding debt of KeyCorp or KeyBank and trust preferred securities of KeyCorp through cash purchase, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such transactions, if any, depend on prevailing market conditions, Key’s liquidity and capital requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.  Key uses several tools as described on page 49 of the 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders to actively manage and maintain liquidity on an ongoing basis.  Key generates cash flows from operations, and from investing and financing activities. Since December 31, 2006, prepayments and maturities of securities available for sale have been the primary sources of cash from investing activities. Securities sold in connection with the repositioning of the securities portfolio also provided significant cash inflow during the first quarter of 2007. Investing activities such as lending and purchases of new securities have required the greatest use of cash.  Key relies on financing activities, such as increasing short-term or long-term borrowings, to provide the cash flow needed to support operating and investing activities if that need is not satisfied by deposit growth. Conversely, excess cash generated by operating, investing and deposit-gathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt. For example, during 2007, Key used short-term borrowings to pay down  82    Table of Contents  long-term debt, while the net increase in deposits funded the growth in portfolio loans and loans held for sale.  The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows on page 6 summarize Key’s sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2008 and 2007.  Key’s liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect circumstances. An example of a direct event would be a downgrade in Key’s public credit rating by a rating agency due to factors such as deterioration in asset quality, a large charge to earnings, a decline in profitability or other financial measures, or a significant merger or acquisition. Examples of indirect events unrelated to Key that could have an effect on Key’s access to liquidity would be terrorism or war, natural disasters, political events, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund or hedge fund. Similarly, market speculation or rumors about Key or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources.  Management performs stress tests to determine the effect that a potential downgrade in Key’s debt ratings or other market disruptions could have on liquidity over various time periods. These debt ratings, which are presented in Figure 29 on page 85, have a direct impact on Key’s cost of funds and ability to raise funds under normal as well as adverse conditions. The results of the stress tests indicate that, following the occurrence of an adverse event, Key could continue to meet its financial obligations and to fund its operations for at least one year. The stress test scenarios include major disruptions to Key’s access to funding markets and consider the potential adverse effect on cash flows. To compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures, management considers alternative sources of liquidity over different time periods to project how fluctuations on the balance sheet would be managed. Key actively manages several alternatives for enhancing liquidity, including generating client deposits, securitizing or selling loans, extending the level or maturity of wholesale borrowings, purchasing deposits from other banks, and developing relationships with fixed income investors in a variety of markets. Management also measures Key’s capacity to borrow using various debt instruments and funding markets.  Certain credit markets in which Key participates and relies upon as sources of funding have been significantly disrupted and highly volatile since July 2007. As a means of maintaining adequate liquidity, Key, like many other financial institutions, has relied more heavily on the liquidity and stability present in the short-term and secured credit markets since access to unsecured term debt has been restricted. Short-term funding has been available and cost effective. However, if further market disruption were to also reduce the cost effectiveness and availability of these funds for a prolonged period of time, management may need to secure other funding alternatives.  Key maintains a liquidity contingency plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis. The plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions. It also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for effectively managing liquidity through a problem period. Key has access to various sources of money market funding (such as federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and eurodollars), and also has secured borrowing facilities established at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, the U.S. Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland to facilitate short-term liquidity requirements. Key’s unused secured borrowing capacity as of October 1 was $20.6 billion at the Federal Reserve Bank and $1.8 billion at the Federal Home Loan Bank.  Liquidity for KeyCorp (the “parent company” or “parent”)  The parent company has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt; support customary corporate operations and activities (including acquisitions) at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences; and pay dividends to shareholders.  Management’s primary tool for assessing parent company liquidity is the net short-term cash position, which measures the ability to fund debt maturing in twelve months or less with existing liquid assets. Another key measure of parent company liquidity is the “liquidity gap,” which represents the difference between projected liquid assets and anticipated financial obligations over specified time horizons. Key  83    Table of Contents  generally relies upon the issuance of term debt to manage the liquidity gap within targeted ranges assigned to various time periods.  The parent company has met its liquidity requirements principally through receiving regular dividends from KeyBank. Federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval. A national bank’s dividend-paying capacity is affected by several factors, including net profits (as defined by statute) for the two previous calendar years and for the current year up to the date of dividend declaration. During the first nine months of 2008, KeyBank did not pay any dividends to the parent, and nonbank subsidiaries paid the parent a total of $11 million in dividends. As of the close of business on September 30, 2008, KeyBank would not have been permitted to pay dividends to the parent without prior regulatory approval since the bank had a year-to-date net loss of $898 million. During the third and second quarters of 2008, the parent made capital infusions of $100 million and $500 million, respectively, to KeyBank in the form of cash.  The parent company generally maintains excess funds in interest-bearing deposits in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over the next twelve months. At September 30, 2008, the parent company held $2.3 billion in short-term investments, which management projected to be sufficient to meet debt repayment obligations over a period of approximately 60 months.  During the first quarter of 2008, the KeyCorp Capital X trust issued $740 million of capital securities. In addition to increasing Key’s Tier I capital, this transaction created additional liquidity for the parent company.  During the second quarter of 2008, the parent company issued $650 million of noncumulative perpetual convertible preferred stock and $1.0 billion of additional common stock in light of the charges recorded in connection with an adverse federal court decision in the AWG Leasing Litigation. In addition to strengthening the company’s capital position, this transaction provided additional liquidity for the parent company.  As part of the over-allotment granted to the underwriters in conjunction with the issuance of preferred stock and common shares, the parent company issued 7 million additional common shares and 75,000 additional shares of noncumulative perpetual convertible preferred stock on July 11, 2008. The proceeds received as a result of these issuances totaled approximately $90 million.  On October 24, 2008, the U.S. Treasury informed KeyCorp that it has preliminary approval to participate in the U.S. Treasury’s TARP Capital Purchase Program. Under the TARP Capital Purchase Program, the U.S. Treasury would purchase $2.5 billion of senior preferred stock and warrants to purchase common shares of KeyCorp. KeyCorp anticipates receipt of the additional capital by December 31, 2008, based upon the U.S. Treasury’s previous announcements. Additional information related to the TARP Capital Purchase Program is included in the Capital section under the heading “Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008” on page 77.  Additional sources of liquidity  Management has implemented several programs, as described below, that enable the parent company and KeyBank to raise funding in the public and private markets when the capital markets are functioning normally. The proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. Each of the programs is replaced or renewed as needed. There are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs. In addition, certain KeyCorp subsidiaries maintain credit facilities with the parent company or third parties, which provide alternative sources of funding in light of current market conditions. KeyCorp is the guarantor of some of the third-party facilities.  Bank note program. KeyBank’s bank note program provides for the issuance of up to $20.0 billion of notes. These notes may have original maturities from thirty days up to thirty years. KeyBank issued $555  84    Table of Contents  million of notes under this program during the first nine months of 2008. At September 30, 2008, $17.5 billion was available for future issuance.  Euro medium-term note program. Under Key’s euro medium-term note program, the parent company and KeyBank may issue both long- and short-term debt of up to $10.0 billion in the aggregate ($9.0 billion by KeyBank and $1.0 billion by the parent company). The notes are offered exclusively to non-U.S. investors and can be denominated in U.S. dollars or foreign currencies. Key issued $26 million of notes under this program during the first nine months of 2008. At September 30, 2008, $7.3 billion was available for future issuance.  KeyCorp shelf registration, including medium-term note program. In June 2008, the parent company filed an updated shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission under revised rules that allow for the registration of various types of debt and equity securities without limitations on the aggregate amounts available for issuance. At September 30, 2008, KeyCorp’s Board had authority to issue up to $2.8 billion of additional debt and/or equity securities. In conjunction with the filing of the shelf registration, on June 20, 2008, the parent company filed an updated prospectus supplement, renewing its medium-term note program under which the company may issue notes with original maturities of nine months or more. The parent company issued $750 million of medium-term notes during the first nine months of 2008.  Commercial paper. The parent company has a commercial paper program that provides funding availability of up to $500 million. As of September 30, 2008, there were no borrowings outstanding under this program.  KeyBank has a separate commercial paper program at a Canadian subsidiary that provides funding availability of up to C$1.0 billion in Canadian currency. The borrowings under this program can be denominated in Canadian or U.S. dollars. As of September 30, 2008, borrowings outstanding under this commercial paper program totaled C$87 million in Canadian currency. As of September 30, 2008, there were no borrowings outstanding in U.S. currency.  Key’s debt ratings are shown in Figure 29. Management believes that these debt ratings, under normal conditions in the capital markets, will enable the parent company or KeyBank to effect future offerings of securities that would be marketable to investors at a competitive cost. Current conditions in the capital markets are not normal, and for regional banking institutions, such as Key, access to the capital markets for unsecured term debt continues to be severely restricted, with investors requiring historically wide spreads over “benchmark” U.S. Treasury obligations.

More specific information regarding this program and Key’s intention to participate is included in the Capital section under the heading “FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program” on page 78.  Credit risk management  Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from an obligor’s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms. Like other financial services institutions, Key makes loans, extends credit, purchases securities and enters into financial derivative contracts, all of which expose Key to credit risk.  Credit policy, approval and evaluation. Key manages credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program. Independent committees approve both retail and commercial credit policies. These policies are communicated throughout Key to foster a consistent approach to granting credit. For more information about Key’s credit policies, as well as related approval and evaluation processes, see the section entitled “Credit policy, approval and evaluation” on page 51 of Key’s 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders.  Key actively manages the overall loan portfolio in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives. This process entails the use of credit derivatives ¾ primarily credit default swaps ¾ to mitigate Key’s credit risk. Credit default swaps enable Key to transfer a portion of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit to a third party, and to manage portfolio concentration and correlation risks. At September 30, 2008, Key used credit default swaps with a notional amount of $1.3 billion to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending obligations. Occasionally, Key will provide credit protection to other lenders through the sale of credit default swaps. These credit default swaps ¾ primarily an investment-grade diversified dealer-traded basket of credit default swaps ¾ are used to offset or reduce the magnitude of any change in the fair value of the credit default swaps used to mitigate credit risk. These transactions may generate fee income and can diversify and reduce overall portfolio credit risk volatility. At September 30, 2008, the notional amount of credit default swaps sold by Key was $343 million.  Credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Related gains or losses, as well as the premium paid or received for credit protection, are included in the trading income component of noninterest income. These swaps added $3 million to Key’s operating results for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2008.  Other actions used to manage the loan portfolio include loan securitizations, portfolio swaps, or bulk purchases and sales. The overarching goal is to continually manage the loan portfolio within a specified range of asset quality.  Selected asset quality statistics for Key for each of the past five quarters are presented in Figure 30. The factors that drive these statistics are discussed in the remainder of this section.  86    Table of Contents  Figure 30.

Watch assets are troubled commercial loans with the potential to deteriorate in quality due to the client’s current financial condition and possible inability to perform in accordance with the terms of the underlying contract. Criticized assets are troubled loans and other assets that show additional signs of weakness that may lead, or have led, to an interruption in scheduled repayments from primary sources, potentially requiring Key to rely on repayment from secondary sources, such as collateral liquidation.  At September 30, 2008, the levels of watch assets and criticized assets were higher than they were a year earlier. Both watch and criticized levels increased in most of the commercial lines of business. The most significant increase occurred in the Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services line of business, due principally to deteriorating market conditions in the residential properties segment of Key’s commercial real estate construction portfolio.  Allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2008, was $1.554 billion, or 2.03% of loans, and included the impact of $32 million of allowance added in the January 1, 2008, acquisition of U.S.B. Holding Co., Inc. and an additional provision for loan losses recorded in connection with the March 2008 transfer of $3.3 billion of education loans from held-for-sale status to the loan portfolio. This compares to an allowance of $955 million, or 1.38%, at September 30, 2007. The allowance includes $193 million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of $678 million at September 30, 2008, compared to $11 million that was allocated for impaired loans of $35 million one year ago. For more information about impaired loans, see Note 9 (“Nonperforming Assets and Past Due Loans”) on page 24. At September 30, 2008, the allowance for loan losses was 160.70% of nonperforming loans, compared to 191.77% at September 30, 2007.  Management estimates the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses on at least a quarterly basis. The methodology used is described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Allowance for Loan Losses” on page 67 of Key’s 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders. Briefly, management estimates the appropriate level of Key’s allowance for loan losses by applying historical loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and by exercising judgment to assess the impact of factors, such as changes in economic conditions, changes in credit policies or underwriting standards, and changes in the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets. If an impaired loan has an outstanding balance greater than $2.5 million, management conducts further analysis to determine the probable loss content, and assigns a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate, considering the results of the analysis and other relevant factors. A specific allowance also may be assigned — even when sources of repayment appear sufficient — if management remains uncertain about whether the loan will be repaid in full. The allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2008, represents management’s best estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date.  87    Table of Contents  As shown in Figure 31, Key’s allowance for loan losses increased by $599 million, or 63%, during the past twelve months. This increase was attributable primarily to deteriorating conditions in the commercial real estate portfolio, and in the commercial and financial portfolio within the Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services line of business. Also contributing to the increase was the impact of the U.S.B. Holding Co., Inc. acquisition and the March 2008 transfer of education loans from held-for-sale status to the loan portfolio. During the third quarter of 2008, Key experienced further deterioration in the credit quality of those education loans that are not guaranteed by the federal government. Key also determined that it will limit new education loans to those backed by government guarantee, but continue to honor existing loan commitments.  Figure 31.

(b)   On March 31, 2008, Key transferred $3.3 billion of education loans from loans held for sale to the loan portfolio.    Key’s provision for loan losses from continuing operations was $407 million for the third quarter of 2008, compared to $69 million for the year-ago quarter. The increase in the provision was due primarily to a higher level of net loan charge-offs recorded in the commercial real estate portfolio. As previously reported, Key has undertaken a process to reduce its exposure in the residential properties segment of its construction loan portfolio through the planned sale of certain loans. In conjunction with these efforts, Key transferred $384 million of commercial real estate loans ($719 million, net of $335 million in net charge-offs) from the held-to-maturity loan portfolio to held-for-sale status in June. As of June 30, 2008, sales had closed on $44 million of these loans, and $340 million remained to be sold. During the third quarter, Key continued to work with bidders to finalize sales terms and documentation. However, continued disruption in the financial markets has precluded the ability of certain potential buyers to obtain the necessary funding. As shown in Figure 32, the balance of this portfolio was reduced to $133 million at September 30, 2008, as a result of cash proceeds received from loan sales, transfers to OREO, and both realized and unrealized losses. Key is continuing to pursue the sale of the remaining loans, all of which are on nonperforming status.  88    Table of Contents  Figure 32.

Net loan charge-offs for the third quarter of 2008 were $273 million, or 1.43% of average loans from continuing operations. These results compare to net charge-offs of $59 million, or .35%, for the same period last year. Figure 33 shows the composition of Key’s loan charge-offs and recoveries by type of loan, while the trend in Key’s net loan charge-offs by loan type is presented in Figure 34. As shown in Figure 34, the level of net charge-offs in each of the loan categories presented exceeded the level reported for the year-ago quarter, with the largest increase coming from the residential properties segment of the real estate construction portfolio. The higher level of net charge-offs in this portfolio reflects the actions taken by Key to sell certain loans. The largest increase in net charge-offs in the consumer portfolio derived from education loans, reflecting the weakening economic environment and the March 2008 transfer of $3.3 billion of education loans from loans held for sale to the loan portfolio.  89    Table of Contents  Figure 33.

(b)   On March 31, 2008, Key transferred $3.3 billion of education loans from loans held for sale to the loan portfolio.    Based on the general expectation for tight credit markets to continue, management expects Key’s net loan charge-offs for the fourth quarter of 2008 to be in the range of 1.40% to 1.70% of average loans.  Nonperforming assets. Figure 35 shows the composition of Key’s nonperforming assets. These assets totaled $1.239 billion at September 30, 2008, and represented 1.61% of portfolio loans, other real estate owned and other nonperforming assets, compared to $764 million, or 1.08%, at December 31, 2007, and $570 million, or .83%, at September 30, 2007.  As shown in Figure 35, the growth in nonperforming assets over the past twelve months was attributable to a higher level of nonperforming loans caused largely by deteriorating market conditions in the residential properties segment of Key’s commercial real estate construction portfolio. The majority of the increase in this segment relates to loans outstanding in Florida and southern California. Also contributing to the rise in nonperforming assets was an increase in the level of commercial loans (principally to businesses tied to residential construction) on nonaccrual status. The increase in commercial loans on nonperforming status that occurred during the third quarter of 2008 was due primarily to automobile floor-plan lending.  The decrease in nonperforming loans and the increase in nonperforming assets during the second quarter of 2008 were due primarily to the transfer of commercial real estate construction loans to held-for-sale status.  At September 30, 2008, Key’s 20 largest nonperforming loans totaled $432 million, representing 45% of total loans on nonperforming status. The level of Key’s delinquent loans rose over the past twelve months, reflecting the deterioration in the housing market.  91    Table of Contents  Figure 35.

Operational risk also encompasses compliance (legal) risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards. Resulting losses could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to Key’s reputation or forgone opportunities. Key seeks to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls.  Management continuously strives to strengthen Key’s system of internal controls to ensure compliance with laws, rules and regulations, and to improve the oversight of Key’s operational risk. For example, a loss-event database is used to track the amounts and sources of operational losses. This tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action. Management also relies upon sophisticated software programs designed to assist in monitoring Key’s control processes. This technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of Key’s controls to senior management and the Board of Directors.  Primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of Key’s various lines of business. Key’s Risk Review function periodically assesses the overall effectiveness of Key’s system of internal controls. Risk Review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the Audit Committee, and independently supports the Audit Committee’s oversight of these controls. A senior management committee, known as the Operational Risk Committee, oversees Key’s level of operational risk, and directs and supports Key’s operational infrastructure and related activities.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  As of the end of the period covered by this report, KeyCorp carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of KeyCorp’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of KeyCorp’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, KeyCorp’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, as of the end of the period covered by this report. No changes were made to KeyCorp’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, KeyCorp’s internal control over financial reporting.  94    Table of Contents     PART II.

Item 1A. Risk Factors  The following have been added to Key’s list of risk factors affecting its business since the filing of its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007.  Current levels of market volatility are unprecedented  The capital and credit markets, including the fixed income markets, have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than twelve months. In recent weeks, the volatility and disruption has reached unprecedented levels. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers without regard to those issuers’ underlying financial strength. If current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen, there can be no assurance that Key will not experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on its ability to access capital and on its business, financial condition and results of operations.  There can be no assurance that the EESA providing broad authority to the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury Department to restore liquidity and stability to the United States financial system will help stabilize the U.S. financial system  On October 3, 2008, President Bush signed into law the EESA. The legislation was in response to the ongoing financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions. Pursuant to the TARP provisions of the EESA, the U.S. Treasury Department has authority to, among other things, purchase up to $700 billion of mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial markets. There can be no assurance as to the actual impact that the EESA or its programs will have on the financial markets, including the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced. The failure of the EESA to help stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could materially and adversely affect Key’s business, financial condition, results of operations, access to credit or the trading price of Key’s common shares.  The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect Key  Key’s ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services to institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. Key has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional clients. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by Key or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose Key to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client. In addition, Key’s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by Key cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not  95    Table of Contents  sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due Key. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect Key’s results of operations.  Difficult market conditions have adversely affected the financial services industry, including Key’s business and results of operations  Dramatic declines in the housing market over the past fifteen months, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures, unemployment and under-employment, have negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage loans and resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions, including government-sponsored entities as well as major commercial and investment banks. The resulting write-downs to assets of financial institutions have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital, to merge with larger and stronger institutions and, in some cases, to seek government assistance or bankruptcy protection. Reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties, many lenders and institutional investors have reduced, and in some cases, ceased to provide funding to borrowers, including to other financial institutions. It is difficult to predict how long these economic conditions will exist, which of our markets, products or other businesses will ultimately be affected, and whether management’s actions will effectively mitigate these external factors. Accordingly, the resulting lack of available credit, lack of confidence in the financial sector, decreased consumer confidence, increased volatility in the financial markets and reduced business activity could materially and adversely affect Key’s business, financial condition and results of operations.  As a result of the challenges presented by economic conditions, Key may face the following risks in connection with these events:     ¨    Key expects to face increased regulation of its industry, including heightened legal standards and regulatory requirements or expectations imposed in connection with EESA. Compliance with such regulation will likely increase Key’s costs and may limit its ability to pursue business opportunities.      ¨    Key’s ability to assess the creditworthiness of its customers may be impaired if the models and approaches it uses to select, manage, and underwrite its customers become less predictive of future behaviors due to fundamental changes in economic conditions of the U.S. economy.      ¨    The process Key uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires difficult, subjective, and complex judgments, including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic predictions might impair the ability of Key’s borrowers to repay their loans, which may no longer be capable of accurate estimation which may, in turn, impact the reliability of the process.      ¨    Key’s ability to borrow from other financial institutions or to engage in securitization funding transactions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by further disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations.      ¨    Key expects competition to intensify among financial services companies due to the recent consolidation of certain competing financial institutions and the conversion of certain investment banks to bank holding companies. Should competition in the financial services industry intensify, Key’s ability to market its products and services may be adversely affected.      ¨    Key will likely be required to pay significantly higher FDIC premiums because market developments have significantly depleted the insurance fund of the FDIC and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits.    96    Table of Contents     Item 2.
