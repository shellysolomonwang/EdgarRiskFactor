Any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of subsequent events or circumstances. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider all risks and uncertainties disclosed in our SEC filings, including our reports on Forms 8-K, 10-Q, and 10-K, and our registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, all of which are or will upon filing be accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and on our website at www.key.com/ir.  Economic overview  The economy began to recover in the second quarter of 2014, as real gross domestic product (“GDP”) grew by an annualized 4% after a very disappointing first quarter. The improvement, however, has been modest, with data clearly more positive but often lagging expectations. Manufacturing data is showing the fundamentals necessary for a strong recovery, but the housing market remains mixed, with slow growth in residential construction and sales of both new and existing homes falling below year-ago levels. Consumer spending growth has remained modest, as very strong job growth has yet to translate into substantial wage growth, although consumers are now more confident than they have been since the Great Recession. Geopolitical tensions, prospective Federal Reserve actions, and mixed economic data for the most part kept markets in check throughout the second quarter.  In the second quarter, weak income growth remained an important constraint on consumption, although fundamentals appear to be strengthening. Real spending dropped for the second consecutive month in May 2014, led by declines in nondurable goods and services spending. Vehicle sales surged to an average of 16.5 million units in the second quarter of 2014, a jump from the 15.6 million units recorded in the first quarter of 2014. Retail sales were modest for the quarter, although showed a marked improvement from first quarter weakness. Consumer confidence increased, with the Conference Board measure ending the second quarter at 85.2%, up 3.0 points month-over-month to the highest level in over six years. Price gains accelerated, with the consumer price index finally eclipsing the 2% mark in April, and stayed there for consecutive months, driven by increases in energy and food prices. The core personal consumption expenditure index was up 1.5% year-over-year as of May 2014.  In the labor market, average monthly job gains rose to 272,000 during the second quarter of 2014, compared to average gains of 190,000 in the first quarter of 2014. Gains were across all job sectors and reflect a strong recovery in the labor market after a rough first quarter. The unemployment rate decreased sharply, finishing the quarter at 6.1%, driven by a 479,000 gain in household employment coupled with a 533,000 decrease in the labor force. Despite the improved health of the labor market, participation remains historically low at 62.8% as of June 30, 2014.  The housing market continues to be mixed, with different results between indicators and month-to-month. In June 2014, existing home sales eclipsed 5 million units for the first time since October 2013 but remained below year-ago levels. New home sales were disappointing, with an 11.5% year-over-year decrease in June 2014. Housing starts have yet to pick up, totaling a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 893,000 in June 2014, up 7.5% year-over-year but missing estimates significantly. Permits decreased, driven by multi-family data. Home price appreciation is slowing, with the CoreLogic Home Price Index up only 8.8% year-over-year in May 2014.  The Federal Reserve continued tapering of asset purchases in the second quarter, reducing purchases by $10 billion for the fifth consecutive meeting to a current pace of $35 billion per month. However, mixed economic data, geopolitical tensions, and cautious forward guidance by the Federal Reserve have kept rates in check. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury started the quarter at 2.77%, and slowly declined throughout the quarter, ending at 2.53%. At the current pace, the latest quantitative easing program (“QE3”) will end in the fourth quarter of 2014, with the federal funds rate not expected to increase until mid-to-late 2015.    92    Table of Contents Long-term financial goals  Our long-term financial goals are as follows:      •   Target a loan-to-core deposit ratio range of 90% to 100%;      •   Maintain a moderate risk profile by targeting a net loan charge-off ratio range of .40% to .60%;      •   Grow high quality and diverse revenue streams by targeting a net interest margin in excess of 3.50%, and a ratio of noninterest income to total revenue of greater than 40%;      •   Create positive operating leverage and target a cash efficiency ratio in the range of 60% to 65%; and      •   Achieve a return on average assets in the range of 1.00% to 1.25%.  Figure 2 shows the evaluation of our long-term financial goals for the second quarter and first six months of 2014.  Figure 2.

Strategic developments  We initiated the following actions during the first six months of 2014 to support our corporate strategy described in the “Introduction” section under the “Corporate Strategy” heading on page 38 of our 2013 Form 10-K.      •   Our positive operating leverage as compared to the prior year reflected the work we have done to improve efficiency, with initiatives targeted for both revenue and expense. Revenue benefited from solid loan growth, which continued to outpace the industry, and was driven by a 10.8% increase in average commercial, financial and agricultural loans. We continued to benefit from our business model – focusing on targeted industries – and areas where we have been investing, with investment banking and debt placement fees increasing 12.3% and mortgage servicing fees 23.8% higher. In addition, noninterest expense was down 2.9% from one year ago.      •   Our strong risk management practices and a more favorable credit environment resulted in another quarter of positive credit quality trends. Net loan charge-offs were .22% of average loans, well below our targeted range, and nonperforming assets decreased 40.8% from the year-ago quarter.    93    Table of Contents   •   Capital management remains a priority for the remainder of 2014. On March 26, 2014, the Federal Reserve announced that it did not object to our 2014 capital plan submitted as part of the annual CCAR process. The 2014 capital plan includes a common share repurchase program of up to $542 million. Share repurchases under the capital plan have been authorized by our Board and include repurchases to offset issuances of common shares under our employee compensation plans. Common share repurchases under the 2014 capital plan are expected to be executed through the first quarter of 2015. During the second quarter of 2014, we completed $108 million of common share repurchases under our 2014 capital plan authorization.      •   Our 2014 capital plan also proposed an 18% increase in our quarterly common share dividend to $.065 per share, which was approved by our Board in May 2014. Consistent with the 2014 capital plan, we made a dividend payment of $.065 per share on our common shares during the second quarter of 2014.      •   We continue to take actions to drive growth and efficiency. These actions include leadership changes to leverage our alignment, accelerate momentum, and drive growth. We are also focused on growing our commercial payments business and maximizing the return from our recent investments, which included the launch of purchase and prepaid cards in the first quarter of 2014. In addition to these new payment products, we continue to invest in, and build out, our online and mobile capabilities. During the first quarter of 2014, we expanded our online account-opening tools to include more products and services. During the second quarter of 2014, we introduced the new KeyBank Hassle-Free Account for banking customers who want straightforward ways to make deposits, track money, obtain cash, and make payments without worrying about potential overdraft fees or other unexpected fees. In addition, as part of our actions to drive efficiency, we closed 18 branches and reduced headcount in our fixed income trading business by 20% during the second quarter of 2014.      •   We also made progress on other strategic initiatives, including improving sales productivity and strengthening our business mix through targeted investments and exiting businesses that are not a strategic fit. In the Community Bank, we are strengthening our sales management process and have seen a lift in sales productivity. In the Corporate Bank, we continue to see growth in new and expanded client relationships. In the first quarter of 2014, we announced that we would be exiting our international leasing operation, which had limited scale and connectivity to our other businesses. This decision is consistent with our commitment to allocate our capital to businesses that fit our strategy and generate appropriate risk-adjusted returns. On July 17, 2014, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Pacific Crest Securities, a leading technology-focused investment bank and capital markets firm. This acquisition underscores our commitment to creating the leading corporate and investment bank serving middle market companies. The combined platforms bring together two firms with a shared vision of enhancing their differentiation in the market by capitalizing on the convergence of technology across traditional industry verticals. We expect this transaction to close during the third quarter of 2014, subject to regulatory approval, at which time Pacific Crest Securities will join KeyBanc Capital Markets, the corporate and investment banking business unit of Key.  Demographics  We have two major business segments: Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank.  Key Community Bank serves individuals and small to mid-sized businesses by offering a variety of deposit, investment, lending, credit card, and personalized wealth management products and business advisory services. These products and services are provided through our relationship managers and specialists working in our 12-state branch network, which is organized into eight internally defined geographic regions: Pacific, Rocky Mountains, Indiana, Western Ohio and Michigan, Eastern Ohio, Western New York, Eastern New York, and New England.    94    Table of Contents Figure 3 shows the geographic diversity of Key Community Bank’s average deposits, commercial loans, and home equity loans.

It was intended to address perceived deficiencies and gaps in the regulatory framework for financial services in the U.S., reduce the risks of bank failures, better equip the nation’s regulators to guard against or mitigate any future financial crises, and manage systemic risk through increased supervision of bank and nonbank SIFIs, such as KeyCorp and KeyBank. Further discussion concerning the Dodd-Frank Act, related regulatory developments, and the risks that they present to Key is available under the heading “Supervision and Regulation” in Item 1. Business and under the heading “II. Compliance Risks” in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2013 Form 10-K. Many proposed rules referenced in our prior reports remain pending. The following discussion provides a summary of relevant regulatory developments relating to the Dodd-Frank Act or that relate to our results this quarter.  Debit card and interchange fees and routing  On July 31, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a ruling in NACS v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, vacating the Federal Reserve’s Final Rule on Debit Card and Interchange Fees and Routing (the “Interchange Fee Rule”). Retail merchants and merchant groups challenged the Interchange Fee Rule, which had allowed debit card issuers to recover from merchants an interchange fee of $.21 per transaction, a fee of five basis points of the value of the transaction and an additional $.01 fraud prevention adjustment. The district court held that this fee structure, and the Interchange Fee Rule’s requirements regarding the number of networks over which each debit card transaction can be processed, did not comply with the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act. The Federal Reserve appealed. On March 21, 2014, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued its opinion overturning the district court’s decision and largely reinstating the Interchange Fee Rule. On July 7, 2014, the merchants and merchant groups filed with the U.S. Supreme Court an application to extend the time to file a Petition for Writ of Certiorari until August 18, 2014. The application was granted on July 9, 2014. We continue to monitor this litigation.   Regulatory capital rules  In October 2013, federal banking regulators published the final Basel III capital framework for U.S. banking organizations (the “Regulatory Capital Rules”). The Regulatory Capital Rules generally implement in the U.S. the Basel III capital framework published by the Basel Committee in December 2010 and revised in June 2011 (the “Basel III capital framework”). The Basel III capital framework and the U.S. implementation of the Basel III capital framework are discussed in more detail in Item 1. Business of our 2013 Form 10-K under the heading “Supervision and regulation—Basel III capital and liquidity frameworks.”  While the Regulatory Capital Rules became effective on January 1, 2014, the mandatory compliance date for Key as a “standardized approach” banking organization begins on January 1, 2015, subject to transitional provisions extending to January 1, 2019.    96    Table of Contents New minimum capital requirements  Under the Regulatory Capital Rules, “standardized approach” banking organizations, like Key, will be required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in Figure 4 below. At June 30, 2014, Key had an estimated Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 10.70% under the Regulatory Capital Rules. Also at June 30, 2014, based on the fully phased-in Regulatory Capital Rules, Key estimates that its capital and leverage ratios, after adjustment for market risk, would be as set forth in Figure 4.  Figure 4.

The table reconciles the GAAP performance measure to the corresponding non-GAAP measure, which provides a basis for period-to-period comparisons.    (b) Capital conservation buffer must consist of Common Equity Tier 1 capital. Key is not subject to the countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% imposed under the “advanced approaches” portion of the Regulatory Capital Rules.    (c) Because Key is not an “advanced approaches” banking organization under the Regulatory Capital Rules, it is not subject to the 3% supplemental leverage ratio or to the supplemental leverage buffer of more than 2% under a final rule adopted by the federal banking agencies in April 2014 or to the revision to the denominator of the supplementary leverage ratio proposed by these agencies under an NPR issued in April 2014 (the “Supplemental Leverage Requirements”).  Revised prompt corrective action standards  Under the Regulatory Capital Rules, the prompt corrective action capital category threshold ratios applicable to FDIC-insured depository institutions such as KeyBank will be revised effective January 1, 2015. Figure 5 identifies the capital category threshold ratios for a “well capitalized” and an “adequately capitalized” institution under the current rule and the Regulatory Capital Rules.  Figure 5. “Well Capitalized” and “Adequately Capitalized” Capital Category Ratios under Current and Revised Prompt Corrective Action Rules                         Prompt Corrective Action   Capital Category        Well Capitalized     Adequately Capitalized     Ratio   Revised     Current     Revised     Current     Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based     6.5 %      N/A       4.5 %      N/A     Tier 1 Risk-Based     8.0       6.0 %      6.0       4.0 %    Total Risk-Based     10.0       10.0       8.0       8.0     Tier 1 Leverage (a)     5.0       5.0       4.0       3.0 or 4.0        (a) As a “standardized approach” banking organization, KeyBank is not subject to the Supplemental Leverage Requirements.  We believe that, as of June 30, 2014, KeyBank would meet all “well capitalized” capital adequacy requirements under the Regulatory Capital Rules if such requirements were currently effective.    97    Table of Contents Highlights of Our Performance  Financial performance  For the second quarter of 2014, we announced net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $242 million, or $.27 per common share. Our second quarter of 2014 results compare to net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $193 million, or $.21 per common share, for the second quarter of 2013.  Our taxable-equivalent net interest income was $579 million for the second quarter of 2014, and the net interest margin was 2.98%. These results compare to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $586 million and a net interest margin of 3.13% for the second quarter of 2013. These decreases in net interest income and net interest margin were attributable to lower asset yields and a decrease in loan fees mostly due to the early termination of a leveraged lease. These decreases were partially offset by loan growth, the maturity of higher-rate certificates of deposit, and a more favorable mix of lower-cost deposits. For the full year of 2014, we expect net interest income to be relatively stable compared to 2013, with slight downward pressure due to the competitive environment.  Our noninterest income was $455 million for the second quarter of 2014, compared to $429 million for the year-ago quarter. We continued to see the benefits of our business model – focusing on targeted industries – with investment banking and debt placement fees increasing $15 million from the prior year. In addition, net gains from principal investing increased $20 million. Operating lease income and other leasing gains increased $13 million, due to a $17 million gain from the early termination of a leveraged lease. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $6 million in trust and investment services income, a decline in service charges on deposit accounts of $5 million due to lower non-sufficient funds and overdraft charges, and decreases in various other items. For the full year of 2014, we expect low single-digit growth in noninterest income compared to the prior year.  Our noninterest expense was $689 million for the second quarter of 2014, compared to $711 million for the same period last year. This decline reflects lower efficiency charges of $13 million. Excluding the impact of efficiency charges, the $9 million decrease in expenses was mostly due to a decline in salaries and employee benefits. For the full year of 2014, we expect a low to mid-single digit percentage decline in noninterest expense from 2013.  Average loans were $55.6 billion for the second quarter of 2014, an increase of $2.9 billion compared to the second quarter of 2013. The loan growth occurred primarily in the commercial, financial and agricultural portfolio, which increased $3 billion and was broad-based across our commercial lines of business. Consumer loans remained stable, as increases in home equity loans and direct term loans were mostly offset by run-off in our designated consumer exit portfolio. The growth in home equity and direct term loans was balanced across our geographic footprint. Our outlook for loan growth in 2014 remains consistent with our prior guidance of mid-single digit, full-year growth, driven by commercial, financial and agricultural loans.  Average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, totaled $66.5 billion for the second quarter of 2014, an increase of $1.6 billion compared to the year-ago quarter. Demand deposits increased by $993 million, and NOW and money market deposit accounts increased $1.4 billion, mostly due to growth related to commercial client inflows as well as increases related to the commercial mortgage servicing business. These increases were partially offset by run-off in certificates of deposit.  Our provision for loan and lease losses was $10 million for the second quarter of 2014, compared to $28 million for the year-ago quarter. Our ALLL was $814 million, or 1.46%, of total period-end loans at June 30, 2014, compared to 1.65% at June 30, 2013. We expect our provision for loan and lease losses to approximate the level of net loan charge-offs for the remainder of the year.  Net loan charge-offs for the second quarter of 2014 totaled $30 million, or .22% of average total loans, compared to .34% for the same period last year. We expect net loan charge-offs to average total loans to continue to be below our targeted range of .40% to .60% for the remainder of the year.  At June 30, 2014, our nonperforming loans totaled $396 million and represented .71% of period-end portfolio loans, compared to 1.23% at June 30, 2013. Nonperforming assets at June 30, 2014, totaled $410 million and represented .74% of period-end portfolio loans and OREO and other nonperforming assets, compared to 1.30% at June 30, 2013.  Our capital ratios remain strong. Our tangible common equity, Tier 1 common equity and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios at June 30, 2014, are 10.15%, 11.25%, and 11.99%, respectively, compared to 9.96%, 11.18%, and 11.93%, respectively, at    98    Table of Contents  June 30, 2013. We continue to return capital to our shareholders by repurchasing common shares and through our quarterly common share dividend. In the second quarter of 2014, we repurchased $108 million of common shares and paid a cash dividend of $.065 per common share under our 2014 capital plan authorization.

In September 2009, we decided to discontinue the education lending business conducted through Key Education Resources, the education payment and financing unit of KeyBank. In February 2013, we decided to sell Victory to a private equity fund. As a result of these decisions, we have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations. For further discussion regarding the income (loss) from discontinued operations, see Note 11 (“Acquisitions and Discontinued Operations”).    (b) EPS may not foot due to rounding.  Figure 7 presents certain non-GAAP financial measures related to “tangible common equity,” “return on tangible common equity,” “Tier 1 common equity,” “pre-provision net revenue,” “cash efficiency ratio,” and “Common Equity Tier 1 under the Regulatory Capital Rules (estimates).”  The tangible common equity ratio and the return on tangible common equity ratio have been a focus for some investors, and management believes these ratios may assist investors in analyzing Key’s capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Tier 1 common equity, a non-GAAP financial measure, is a component of Tier 1 risk-based capital. Tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by GAAP nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations applicable to us before January 1, 2015. However, since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity and Tier 1 common equity, we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases. Figure 7 also reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures.  Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and BHC capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. Since early 2009, the Federal Reserve has focused its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 capital known as Tier 1 common equity. Because the Federal Reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders’ equity (essentially Tier 1 risk-based capital less preferred stock, qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in Tier 1 risk-based capital, this focus on Tier 1 common equity is consistent with existing capital adequacy categories. The Regulatory Capital Rules, described in more detail under the section “Supervision and regulation” of this report, also make Tier 1 common equity a priority. The Regulatory Capital Rules change the regulatory capital standards that apply to BHCs by, among other changes, phasing out the treatment of trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred securities as Tier 1 eligible capital. By 2016, our trust preferred securities will only be included in Tier 2 capital.  Figure 7 also shows the computation for pre-provision net revenue, which is not formally defined by GAAP. We believe that eliminating the effects of the provision for loan and lease losses makes it easier to analyze our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis.  The cash efficiency ratio is a ratio of two non-GAAP performance measures. Accordingly, there is no directly comparable GAAP performance measure. The cash efficiency ratio excludes the impact of our intangible asset amortization from the calculation. We believe this ratio provides greater consistency and comparability between our results and those of our peer banks. Additionally, this ratio is used by analysts and investors as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis.    99    Table of Contents Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.    100    Table of Contents Figure 7.

(f) Includes the deferred tax asset subject to future taxable income for realization, primarily tax credit carryforwards, as well as the deductible portion of purchased credit card receivables.    102    Table of Contents   (g) The anticipated amount of regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets is based upon the federal banking agencies’ Regulatory Capital Rules (as fully phased-in on January 1, 2019); Key is subject to the Regulatory Capital Rules under the “standardized approach.”    (h) Item is included in the 10%/15% exceptions bucket calculation and is risk-weighted at 250%.    (i) For the six months ended June 30, 2014, and June 30, 2013, average intangible assets exclude $85 million and $114 million, respectively, of average ending purchased credit card receivables.    103    Table of Contents Results of Operations  Net interest income  One of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets (such as loans and securities) and loan-related fee income, and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. There are several factors that affect net interest income, including:      •   the volume, pricing, mix, and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities;      •   the volume and value of net free funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and equity capital;      •   the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk;      •   interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace; and      •   asset quality.  To make it easier to compare results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets (some taxable, some not), we present net interest income in this discussion on a “taxable-equivalent basis” (i.e., as if it were all taxable and at the same rate). For example, $100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as $154, an amount that — if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% — would yield $100.  Figure 8 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense, and their respective yields or rates over the past five quarters. This figure also presents a reconciliation of taxable-equivalent net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with GAAP for each of those quarters. The net interest margin, which is an indicator of the profitability of the earning assets portfolio less cost of funding, is calculated by dividing annualized taxable-equivalent net interest income by average earning assets.  Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $579 million for the second quarter of 2014, and the net interest margin was 2.98%. These results compare to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $586 million and a net interest margin of 3.13% for the second quarter of 2013. These decreases in net interest income and net interest margin were attributable to lower asset yields and a decrease in loan fees mostly due to the early termination of a leveraged lease. These decreases were partially offset by loan growth, the maturity of higher-rate certificates of deposit, and a more favorable mix of lower-cost deposits.  For the six months ended June 30, 2014, taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased $27 million and net interest margin declined by 19 basis points compared to the same period one year ago. The decreases in net interest income and net interest margin were attributable to lower asset yields and loan fees, offsetting the impact of loan growth. These decreases were also partially offset by the maturity of higher-rate certificates of deposit and a more favorable mix of lower-cost deposits.  Average earning assets totaled $77.8 billion for the second quarter of 2014, compared to $75.2 billion for the second quarter of 2013. Commercial, financial and agricultural loans grew by $3 billion over the year-ago quarter; this growth was broad-based across our commercial lines of business. Consumer loans remained stable, as increases in home equity loans and direct term loans were mostly offset by run-off in our designated consumer exit portfolio. The growth in home equity and direct term loans was balanced across our geographic footprint.  Average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, totaled $66.5 billion for the second quarter of 2014, an increase of $1.6 billion compared to the year-ago quarter. Demand deposits increased by $993 million, and NOW and money market deposit accounts increased $1.4 billion, mostly due to growth related to commercial client inflows as well as increases related to the commercial mortgage servicing business. These increases were partially offset by run-off in certificates of deposit.    104    Table of Contents As shown in Figure 8, the yield was impacted by lower spreads on commercial and consumer loans.

Noninterest income  As shown in Figure 10, noninterest income was $455 million for the second quarter of 2014, compared to $429 million for the year-ago quarter, an increase of $26 million, or 6.1%. We continued to see the benefits of our business model – focusing on targeted industries – with investment banking and debt placement fees increasing $15 million from the prior year. In addition, net gains from principal investing increased $20 million. Operating lease income and other leasing gains increased $13 million, due to a $17 million gain from the early termination of a leveraged lease. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $6 million in trust and investment services income, a decline in service charges on deposit accounts of $5 million due to lower non-sufficient funds and overdraft charges, and decreases in various other items.  For the six months ended June 30, 2014, noninterest income increased $36 million, or 4.2%, from the same period one year ago. Investment banking and debt placement fees increased $20 million. Operating lease income and other leasing gains increased $17 million, due to a gain from the early termination of a leveraged lease. Net gains from principal investing increased $36 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in service charges on deposit accounts of $11 million due to lower non-sufficient funds and overdraft charges. In addition, consumer mortgage income and other income each declined $9 million.    107    Table of Contents Figure 10.

(b) The allocation between proprietary and nonproprietary is made based upon whether the trade is conducted for the benefit of Key or Key’s clients rather than based upon rulemaking under the Volcker Rule. The prohibitions and restrictions on proprietary trading activities contemplated by the Volcker Rule were detailed in a final rule approved by federal banking regulators in December 2013, which became effective April 1, 2014. For more information, see the discussion under the heading “Other regulatory developments under the Dodd-Frank Act – ‘Volcker Rule’” in the section entitled “Supervision and Regulation” in Item 1 of our 2013 Form 10-K.    108    Table of Contents The following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest income and the factors that caused those elements to change.  Trust and investment services income  Trust and investment services income is our largest source of noninterest income and consists of brokerage commissions, trust and asset management commissions, and insurance income. The assets under management that primarily generate these revenues are shown in Figure 12. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, trust and investment services income decreased $6 million, or 6%, and $3 million, or 1.5%, respectively, as compared to the same periods one year ago.  A significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management. At June 30, 2014, our bank, trust, and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of $39.7 billion, compared to $35.5 billion at June 30, 2013. As shown in Figure 12, increases in the equity and securities lending portfolios were primarily attributable to market appreciation. Although total assets under management increased from one year ago, trust and investment services income declined due to a change in the mix of investment type, with the lower-fee portfolios increasing faster than the higher-fee portfolios.

Investment banking and debt placement fees increased $15 million, or 17.9%, for the second quarter of 2014 and $20 million, or 12.3%, for the six months ended June 30, 2014, as compared to the same periods one year ago. These increases reflect the benefits of our business model – focusing on targeted industries.  Service charges on deposit accounts  Service charges on deposit accounts declined $5 million, or 7%, and $11 million, or 7.9%, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, as compared to the same periods one year ago due to lower non-sufficient funds and overdraft charges.  Operating lease income and other leasing gains  Operating lease income and other leasing gains increased $13 million, or 59.1%, for the second quarter of 2014 and $17 million, or 36.2%, for the six months ended June 30, 2014, compared to the same periods one year ago. The increase was due to a $17 million gain on the early termination of a leveraged lease in the second quarter of 2014, partially offset by product run-off. Expense related to the rental of leased equipment is presented in Figure 13 as “operating lease expense.”  Cards and payments income  Cards and payments income, which consists of debit card, consumer and commercial credit card, and merchant services income, increased $1 million, or 2.4%, from the year-ago quarter, and $2 million, or 2.5%, for the six months ended June 30, 2014, as compared to the same period one year ago. These increases are due to higher credit card and merchant fees, partially offset by lower ATM debit card and surcharge income.  Consumer mortgage income  Consumer mortgage income decreased $4 million, or 66.7%, from the year-ago quarter, and $9 million, or 69.2%, for the six months ended June 30, 2014, as compared to the same period one year ago, primarily due to lower mortgage originations.    109    Table of Contents Mortgage servicing fees  Mortgage servicing fees decreased $2 million, or 15.4%, from the year-ago quarter and increased $5 million, or 23.8%, for the six months ended June 30, 2014, as compared to the same period one year ago due to higher levels of servicing fees as a result of the 2013 acquisition of a commercial mortgage servicing portfolio.  Other income  Other income, which consists primarily of gain on sale of certain loans, other service charges, and certain dealer trading income, decreased $1 million, or 10%, from the year-ago quarter and $9 million, or 28.1%, for the six months ended June 30, 2014, due to lower trading income, as shown in Figure 11.  Noninterest expense  As shown in Figure 13, noninterest expense was $689 million for the second quarter of 2014, compared to $711 million for the year-ago quarter, representing a decrease of $22 million, or 3.1%. This decline reflects lower efficiency charges of $13 million. Excluding the impact of efficiency charges, the $9 million decrease in expenses was mostly due to a decline in salaries and employee benefits.  For the six months ended June 30, 2014, noninterest expense decreased $41 million, or 2.9%, compared to the same period one year ago. Personnel expense declined $20 million, and nonpersonnel expense decreased $21 million from one year ago. This decline in noninterest expense reflects lower efficiency charges of $18 million. Excluding the impact of efficiency charges, the $23 million decrease in expenses was mostly due to declines in salaries, technology contract labor, net, and the provision (credit) for losses on lending-related commitments.

Personnel  As shown in Figure 14, personnel expense, the largest category of our noninterest expense, decreased by $17 million, or 4.2%, in the second quarter of 2014 when compared to the year-ago quarter. For the six months ended June 30, 2014, personnel expense declined $20 million, or 2.5%, from the same period one year ago. Salaries, technology contract labor, net, employee benefits, and severance all declined from one year ago. These decreases were partially offset by increases in incentive compensation and stock-based compensation.  Figure 14.

Income related to the rental of leased equipment is presented in Figure 10 as “operating lease income and other leasing gains.”  Other expense  Other expense is comprised of various miscellaneous expense items. The $1 million, or 1.2% increase in the current quarter compared to the year-ago quarter and the $4 million, or 2.4%, decrease in the first six months of 2014 as compared to the same period one year ago reflects fluctuations in several of those line items.  Income taxes  We recorded tax expense from continuing operations of $76 million for the second quarter of 2014 and $72 million for the second quarter of 2013. For the first six months of 2014, we recorded tax expense from continuing operations of $168 million, compared to $142 million for the same period last year.  Our federal tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate, primarily because we generate income from investments in tax-advantaged assets, such as corporate-owned life insurance, earn credits associated with investments in low-income housing projects, and make periodic adjustments to our tax reserves. In addition, during the second quarter of 2014, our effective tax rate was lower due to the early termination of certain leveraged leases that resulted in nontaxable gains pursuant to a prior settlement with the IRS.  Additional information pertaining to how our tax expense (benefit) and the resulting effective tax rates were derived are included in Note 12 (“Income Taxes”) beginning on page 175 of our 2013 Form 10-K.    111    Table of Contents Line of Business Results  This section summarizes the financial performance and related strategic developments of our two major business segments (operating segments): Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. Note 18 (“Line of Business Results”) describes the products and services offered by each of these business segments, provides more detailed financial information pertaining to the segments, and explains “Other Segments” and “Reconciling Items.”  Figure 15 summarizes the contribution made by each major business segment to our “taxable-equivalent revenue from continuing operations” and “income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Key” for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2014, and June 30, 2013.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $21 million, or 5.5%, from the second quarter of 2013. Average loans and leases grew 3.0% driven by increases in commercial, financial and agricultural loans, while average deposits increased 1.4% from one year ago. However, these volume-related increases were offset by declines in the deposit spread as a result of the continued low-rate environment.  Noninterest income declined by $12 million, or 6%, from the year-ago quarter. Other noninterest income decreased $6 million from prior year primarily due to declines in consumer mortgage income, corporate services income, and trading income. Service charges on deposit accounts declined $5 million due to lower non-sufficient funds and overdraft charges.  The provision for loan and lease losses decreased by $18 million, or 43.9%, from the second quarter of 2013. Net loan charge-offs decreased $9 million from the same period one year ago.  Noninterest expense declined by $19 million, or 4.1%, from the year-ago quarter as a result of Key’s continued focus on expense management. Personnel expense decreased $6 million primarily due to declines in salaries and employee benefits. Nonpersonnel expense decreased $13 million primarily due to decreases in outside loan servicing, and computer processing, equipment, and other miscellaneous costs related to branch closures.    112    Table of Contents Figure 16.

Average loan balances up 14.5% from the prior year      •   Average deposits up 3.3% from the prior year      •   Investment banking and debt placement fees increased 18.3% from the prior year   As shown in Figure 17, Key Corporate Bank recorded net income attributable to Key of $118 million for the second quarter of 2014, compared to $121 million for the same period one year ago.  Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $11 million, or 5.6%, compared to the second quarter of 2013. Average earning assets increased $3.1 billion, or 14.6%, from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by loan growth in commercial, financial and agricultural and real estate commercial mortgage. This growth in earning assets drove an increase of $7 million in earning asset spread and a $2 million increase in loan fees. Average deposit balances increased $521 million, or 3.3%, from the year-ago quarter, driven by increases in Public Sector as well as increases related to the commercial mortgage servicing acquisition.    113    Table of Contents Noninterest income increased by $5 million, or 2.7%, from the second quarter of 2013. The increase in investment banking and debt placement fees of $15 million was partially offset by declines in trust and investment services income, mortgage servicing fees, and other miscellaneous fees from the year-ago quarter.  The provision for loan and lease losses increased $7 million compared to the second quarter of 2013. There were net recoveries of $2 million for the second quarter of 2014 compared to net recoveries of $4 million for the same period one year ago.  Noninterest expense increased by $14 million, or 7.2%, from the second quarter of 2013. Increased personnel costs and higher expenses related to low-income housing tax credit investments were the primary drivers.  Figure 17.

Other Segments generated net income attributable to Key of $72 million for the second quarter of 2014, compared to net income attributable to Key of $49 million for the same period last year. These results were primarily attributable to an increase in net gains (losses) from principal investing of $20 million and higher operating lease income and other leasing gains of $17 million due to the early termination of a leveraged lease.    114    Table of Contents Financial Condition  Loans and loans held for sale  At June 30, 2014, total loans outstanding from continuing operations were $55.6 billion, compared to $54.5 billion at December 31, 2013, and $53.1 billion at June 30, 2013. Loans related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business, which are excluded from total loans at June 30, 2014, December 31, 2013, and June 30, 2013, totaled $4.2 billion, $4.5 billion, and $5.0 billion, respectively. The increase in our outstanding loans from continuing operations over the past twelve months results primarily from increased lending activity in our commercial, financial and agricultural portfolio. For more information on balance sheet carrying value, see Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the headings “Loans” and “Loans Held for Sale” on pages 117-118 of our 2013 Form 10-K.  Commercial loan portfolio  Commercial loans outstanding were $39.6 billion at June 30, 2014, an increase of $2.5 billion, or 6.9%, compared to June 30, 2013.  Commercial, financial and agricultural. Our commercial, financial and agricultural loans, also referred to as “commercial and industrial,” represented 47% of our total loan portfolio at June 30, 2014, 46% at December 31, 2013, and 45% at June 30, 2013, and are the largest component of our total loans. These loans are originated by both Key Corporate Bank and Key Community Bank and consist of fixed and variable rate loans to our large, middle market, and small business clients.   Figure 18 provides our commercial, financial and agricultural loans by industry classification at June 30, 2014, December 31, 2013, and June 30, 2013.  Figure 18.

We have experienced growth in new high credit quality loan commitments, and utilization with clients in our middle market segment and Institutional and Capital Markets business. Our two largest industry classifications—services and manufacturing—increased by 8.9% and 11.4%, respectively, when compared to one year ago. The services and manufacturing industries represented 23% and 17%, respectively, of the total commercial, financial and agricultural loan portfolio at June 30, 2014, and June 30, 2013. At the end of each period provided in Figure 18 above, loans in the services and manufacturing industry classifications accounted for over 40% of our total commercial, financial and agricultural loan portfolio.  Services, manufacturing, and public utilities are focus areas where we maintain dedicated industry verticals that are staffed by relationship managers who possess deep industry experience and knowledge. Our loans in the services classification grew by $492 million, or 8.9%, compared to last year. The growth in the services loan portfolio was in large part due to increases in lending to large corporate, middle market, and business banking clients, and was partially offset by decreases in loans to    115    Table of Contents  clients in private bank and real estate. Loans in the manufacturing classification grew by $469 million, or 11.4%, compared to the same period one year ago. Increases in lending to large corporate, middle market, and business banking clients accounted for the majority of the growth in this classification. Loans in the public utilities classification grew by $134 million, or 7.7%, compared to last year.  Commercial real estate loans. Our commercial real estate (“CRE”) lending business is conducted through two primary sources: our 12-state banking franchise, and KeyBank Real Estate Capital, a national line of business that cultivates relationships with owners of CRE located both within and beyond the branch system. This line of business deals primarily with nonowner-occupied properties (generally properties for which at least 50% of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties) and accounted for approximately 59% of our average year-to-date CRE loans, compared to 55% one year ago. KeyBank Real Estate Capital generally focuses on larger owners and operators of CRE.   CRE loans represented 16% of our total loan portfolio at June 30, 2014, and June 30, 2013. These loans, which include both owner- and nonowner-occupied properties, represented 23% of our commercial loan portfolio at June 30, 2014, and June 30, 2013. These loans were $9.0 billion at June 30, 2014, compared to $8.5 billion at June 30, 2013. We have been de-risking the portfolio by changing our focus from developers to owners of completed and stabilized CRE.  Figure 19 includes commercial mortgage and construction loans in both Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. As shown in Figure 19, this loan portfolio is diversified by both property type and geographic location of the underlying collateral.  As presented in Figure 19, at June 30, 2014, our CRE portfolio included mortgage loans of $7.9 billion and construction loans of $1.1 billion, representing 14% and 2%, respectively, of our total loans. At June 30, 2014, nonowner-occupied loans represented 11% of our total loans and owner-occupied loans represented 5% of our total loans. The average size of mortgage loans originated during the second quarter of 2014 was $4.1 million, and our largest mortgage loan at June 30, 2014, had a balance of $105 million. At June 30, 2014, our average construction loan commitment was $6 million. Our largest construction loan commitment was $59.8 million, and our largest construction loan amount outstanding was $52.7 million.    116    Table of Contents Also shown in Figure 19, 69% of our CRE loans at June 30, 2014, were for nonowner-occupied properties compared to 65% at June 30, 2013. Approximately 14% of these loans were construction loans at June 30, 2014, compared to 16% at June 30, 2013. Typically, these properties are not fully leased at the origination of the loan. The borrower relies upon additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide the cash flow necessary to support debt service payments. A significant decline in economic growth, and in turn, rental rates and occupancy would adversely affect our portfolio of construction loans.  Figure 19.

Our nonowner-occupied CRE portfolio has increased by 13.1%, or approximately $718 million, since June 30, 2013.  If the economic recovery stalls, it may weaken the CRE market fundamentals (i.e., vacancy rates, the stability of rental income, and asset values), leading to reduced cash flow to support debt service payments. Reduced client cash flow would adversely affect our ability to collect such payments. Accordingly, the value of our CRE loan portfolio could be adversely affected.  Commercial lease financing. We conduct commercial lease financing arrangements through our KEF line of business and have both the scale and array of products to compete in the equipment lease financing business. Commercial lease financing receivables represented 11% of commercial loans at June 30, 2014, and 13% at June 30, 2013.  Commercial loan modification and restructuring  We modify and extend certain commercial loans in the normal course of business for our clients. Loan modifications vary and are handled on a case by case basis with strategies responsive to the specific circumstances of each loan and borrower. In many cases, borrowers have other resources and can reinforce the credit with additional capital, collateral, guarantees, or income sources.  Modifications are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan credit quality while at the same time meeting our clients’ financing needs. Modifications made to loans of creditworthy borrowers not experiencing financial difficulties and under circumstances where ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt are not classified as TDRs. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, a loan is classified as a TDR only when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a creditor concession has been granted.  Our concession types are primarily interest rate reductions, forgiveness of principal, and other modifications. Loan extensions are sometimes coupled with these primary concession types. Because economic conditions have improved modestly and we have restructured loans to provide the optimal opportunity for successful repayment by the borrower, certain of our restructured loans have returned to accrual status and consistently performed under the restructured loan terms over the past year.    117    Table of Contents If loan terms are extended at less than normal market rates for similar lending arrangements, our Asset Recovery Group is consulted to help determine if any concession granted would result in designation as a TDR. Transfer to our Asset Recovery Group is considered for any commercial loan determined to be a TDR. During the first six months of 2014, there were $3 million of new restructured commercial loans.  For more information on concession types for our commercial accruing and nonaccruing TDRs, see Note 4 (“Asset Quality”).  Figure 20.

First, we create an A note. Since the objective of this TDR note structure is to achieve a fully performing and well-rated A note, we focus on sizing that note to a level that is supported by cash flow available to service debt at current market terms and consistent with our customary underwriting standards. This note structure typically will include a debt coverage ratio of 1.2 or better of cash flow to monthly payments of market interest, and principal amortization of generally not more than 25 years. (These metrics are adjusted from time to time based upon changes in long-term markets and “take-out underwriting standards” of our various lines of business.) Appropriately sized A notes are more likely to return to accrual status, allowing us to resume recognizing interest income. As the borrower’s payment performance improves, these restructured notes typically also allow for an upgraded internal quality risk rating classification. Moreover, the borrower retains ownership and control of the underlying collateral (typically, CRE), the borrower’s capital structure is strengthened (often to the point that fresh capital is attracted to the transaction), and local markets are spared distressed/fire sales.  The B note typically is an interest-only note with no required amortization until the property stabilizes and generates excess cash flow. This excess cash flow customarily is applied directly to the principal of the A note. We evaluate the B note when we consider returning the A note to accrual status. In many cases, the B note is charged off at the same time the A note is returned to accrual status. Alternatively, both A and B notes may be simultaneously returned to accrual if credit metrics are supportive.  Restructured nonaccrual loans may be returned to accrual status based on a current, well-documented evaluation of the credit, which would include analysis of the borrower’s financial condition, prospects for repayment under the modified terms, and alternate sources of repayment such as the value of loan collateral. We wait a reasonable period (generally a minimum of six months) to establish the borrower’s ability to sustain historical repayment performance before returning the loan to accrual status. Sustained historical repayment performance prior to the restructuring also may be taken into account. The primary consideration for returning a restructured loan to accrual status is the reasonable assurance that the full contractual principal balance of the loan and the ongoing contractually required interest payments will be fully repaid. Although our policy is a guideline, considerable judgment is required to review each borrower’s circumstances.  All loans processed as TDRs, including A notes and any non-charged-off B notes, are reported as TDRs during the calendar year in which the restructure took place.  Additional information regarding TDRs is provided in Note 4 (“Asset Quality”).  Extensions. Project loans typically are refinanced into the permanent commercial loan market at maturity, but sometimes they are modified and extended. Extension terms take into account the specific circumstances of the client relationship, the status of the project, and near-term prospects for both the client and the collateral. In all cases, pricing and loan structure are reviewed and, where necessary, modified to ensure the loan has been priced to achieve a market rate of return and loan terms that are appropriate for the risk. Typical enhancements include one or more of the following: principal pay down, increased amortization, additional collateral, increased guarantees, and a cash flow sweep. Some maturing construction loans have automatic extension options built in; in those cases, pricing and loan terms cannot be altered.    118    Table of Contents Loan pricing is determined based on the strength of the borrowing entity and the strength of the guarantor, if any. Therefore, pricing for an extended loan may remain the same because the loan is already priced at or above current market.  We do not consider loan extensions in the normal course of business (under existing loan terms or at market rates) as TDRs, particularly when ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt and no concession has been made. In the case of loan extensions where either collection of all principal and interest is uncertain or a concession has been made, we would analyze such credit under the applicable accounting guidance to determine whether it qualifies as a TDR. Extensions that qualify as TDRs are measured for impairment under the applicable accounting guidance.  Guarantors. We conduct a detailed guarantor analysis (1) for all new extensions of credit, (2) at the time of any material modification/extension, and (3) typically annually, as part of our on-going portfolio and loan monitoring procedures. This analysis requires the guarantor entity to submit all appropriate financial statements, including balance sheets, income statements, tax returns, and real estate schedules.  While the specific steps of each guarantor analysis may vary, the high-level objectives include determining the overall financial conditions of the guarantor entities, including size, quality, and nature of asset base; net worth (adjusted to reflect our opinion of market value); leverage; standing liquidity; recurring cash flow; contingent and direct debt obligations; and near-term debt maturities.  Borrower and guarantor financial statements are required at least annually within 90-120 days of the calendar/fiscal year end. Income statements and rent rolls for project collateral are required quarterly. We may require certain information, such as liquidity, certifications, status of asset sales or debt resolutions, and real estate schedules, to be provided more frequently.  We routinely seek performance from guarantors of impaired debt if the guarantor is solvent. We may not seek to enforce the guaranty if we are precluded by bankruptcy or we determine the cost to pursue a guarantor exceeds the value to be returned given the guarantor’s verified financial condition. We often are successful in obtaining either monetary payment or the cooperation of our solvent guarantors to help mitigate loss, cost, and the expense of collections.  As of June 30, 2014, we had $3.4 million of mortgage and construction loans that had a loan-to-value ratio greater than 1.0, and were accounted for as performing loans. These loans were not considered impaired due to one or more of the following factors: (i) underlying cash flow adequate to service the debt at a market rate of return with adequate amortization; (ii) a satisfactory borrower payment history; and (iii) acceptable guarantor support.  Consumer loan portfolio  Consumer loans outstanding decreased by $39 million, or .2%, from one year ago. The home equity portfolio is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio. Approximately 97% of this portfolio at June 30, 2014, was originated from our Key Community Bank within our 12-state footprint. The remainder of the portfolio, which has been in an exit mode since the fourth quarter of 2007, was originated from the Consumer Finance line of business and is now included in Other Segments. Home equity loans in Key Community Bank increased by $206 million, or 2%, over the past twelve months as a result of stabilized home values, improved employment, and favorable borrowing conditions.  As shown in Figure 16, we held the first lien position for approximately 59% of the Key Community Bank home equity portfolio at June 30, 2014, and 57% at June 30, 2013. For consumer loans with real estate collateral, we track borrower performance monthly. Regardless of the lien position, credit metrics are refreshed quarterly, including recent Fair Isaac Corporation scores as well as original and updated loan-to-value ratios. This information is used in establishing the ALLL. Our methodology is described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses” beginning on page 118 of our 2013 Form 10-K.  Regulatory guidance issued in January 2012 addressed specific risks and required actions within home equity portfolios associated with second lien loans. At June 30, 2014, 41% of our home equity portfolio was secured by second lien mortgages. On at least a quarterly basis, we continue to monitor the risk characteristics of these loans when determining whether our loss estimation methods are appropriate.    119    Table of Contents Figure 21 summarizes our home equity loan portfolio by source at the end of each of the last five quarters, as well as certain asset quality statistics and yields on the portfolio as a whole.

At June 30, 2014, loans held for sale included $181 million of commercial, financial and agricultural loans, which increased by $159 million from June 30, 2013, $221 million of commercial mortgage loans, which decreased $97 million from June 30, 2013, and $23 million of residential mortgage loans, which decreased $25 million from June 30, 2013.  Loan sales  As shown in Figure 22, during the first six months of 2014, we sold $1.2 billion of CRE loans, $177 million of residential real estate loans, $168 million of commercial loans, and $84 million of commercial lease financing loans. Most of these sales came from the held-for-sale portfolio; however, $67 million of these loan sales related to the held-to-maturity portfolio.  Loan sales classified as held for sale generated net gains of $40 million in the first six months of 2014 and are included in “investment banking and debt placement fees” and “other income” on the income statement.  Among the factors that we consider in determining which loans to sell are:      •   our business strategy for particular lending areas;      •   whether particular lending businesses meet established performance standards or fit with our relationship banking strategy;      •   our A/LM needs;      •   the cost of alternative funding sources;      •   the level of credit risk;      •   capital requirements; and      •   market conditions and pricing.    120    Table of Contents Figure 22 summarizes our loan sales for the first six months of 2014 and all of 2013.

Additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in Note 15 (“Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) under the heading “Recourse agreement with FNMA.”  We derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold. We earn noninterest income (recorded as “mortgage servicing fees”) from fees for servicing or administering loans. This fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets. In addition, we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing of commercial real estate loans.  Securities  Our securities portfolio totaled $17.4 billion at June 30, 2014, compared to $17.1 billion at December 31, 2013, and $18 billion at June 30, 2013. Available-for-sale securities were $12.2 billion at June 30, 2014, compared to $12.3 billion at December 31, 2013, and $13.3 billion at June 30, 2013. Held-to-maturity securities were $5.2 billion at June 30, 2014, compared to $4.8 billion at December 31, 2013, and $4.7 billion at June 30, 2013. Essentially all of our held-to-maturity securities portfolio was invested in CMOs at June 30, 2014.    121    Table of Contents As shown in Figure 24, all of our mortgage-backed securities, which include both securities available for sale and held-to-maturity securities, are issued by government-sponsored enterprises or GNMA, and are traded in liquid secondary markets. These securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value for the available-for-sale portfolio and at cost for the held-to-maturity portfolio. For more information about these securities, see Note 5 (“Fair Value Measurements”) under the heading “Qualitative Disclosures of Valuation Techniques,” and Note 6 (“Securities”).  Figure 24.

Securities available for sale  The majority of our securities available-for-sale portfolio consists of CMOs, which are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities. CMOs generate interest income and serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements. At June 30, 2014, we had $12.2 billion invested in CMOs and other mortgage-backed securities in the available-for-sale portfolio, compared to $12.3 billion at December 31, 2013, and $13.2 billion at June 30, 2013.  We periodically evaluate our securities available-for-sale portfolio in light of established A/LM objectives, changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio, the regulatory environment, and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. These evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning.  In addition, the size and composition of our securities available-for-sale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required (or elect) to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits. Although we generally use debt securities for this purpose, other assets, such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit, are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles.  Throughout 2013 and the first half of 2014, our investing activities continued to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs. Our actions to not reinvest the monthly security cash flows at various times during this time period served to provide the liquidity necessary to address our funding requirements. These funding requirements included ongoing loan growth and occasional debt maturities. At other times, we may make additional investments that go beyond the replacement of maturities or mortgage security cash flows as our liquidity position and/or interest rate risk management strategies may require. Lastly, our focus on investing in GNMA-related securities is also related to liquidity management strategies as we continue to make progress in preparing for expected future regulatory requirements.    122    Table of Contents Figure 25 shows the composition, yields, and remaining maturities of our securities available for sale.

(b) Excludes $5 million of securities at June 30, 2014, that have no stated yield.    123    Table of Contents Other investments  Principal investments — investments in equity and mezzanine instruments made by our Principal Investing unit — represented 61% of other investments at June 30, 2014. They include direct investments (investments made in a particular company) as well as indirect investments (investments made through funds that include other investors). Principal investments are predominantly made in privately-held companies and are carried at fair value. The fair value of the direct investments was $146 million at June 30, 2014, $141 million at December 31, 2013, and $186 million at June 30, 2013, while the fair value of the indirect investments was $399 million at June 30, 2014, $413 million at December 31, 2013, and $426 million at June 30, 2013. Under the requirements of the Volcker Rule, we will be required to dispose of some or all of our indirect principal investments. The implementation date of the Volcker Rule is July 21, 2015. Key is permitted to file for two one-year extensions, and an additional extension of up to five years for illiquid funds, to retain the indirect investments for a longer period of time. We plan to apply for the extensions and hold the investments. As of June 30, 2014, we have not committed to a plan to sell these investments. For more information about the Volcker Rule, see the discussion under the heading “Other regulatory developments under the Dodd-Frank Act— ‘Volcker Rule’” in the section entitled “Supervision and Regulation” in Item 1 of our 2013 Form 10-K.  In addition to principal investments, “other investments” include other equity and mezzanine instruments, such as certain real estate-related investments that are carried at fair value, as well as other types of investments that generally are carried at cost. There are indirect real-estate-related investments valued at $16 million at June 30, 2014, $23 million at December 31, 2013, and $32 million at June 30, 2013, that may be subject to the disposal requirements under the Volcker Rule, as described in the previous paragraph.  Most of our other investments are not traded on an active market. We determine the fair value at which these investments should be recorded based on the nature of the specific investment and all available relevant information. This review may encompass such factors as the issuer’s past financial performance and future potential, the values of public companies in comparable businesses, the risks associated with the particular business or investment type, current market conditions, the nature and duration of resale restrictions, the issuer’s payment history, our knowledge of the industry, third-party data, and other relevant factors. During the first six months of 2014, net gains from our principal investing activities (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) totaled $51 million, which includes $32 million of net unrealized gains. These net gains are recorded as “net gains (losses) from principal investing” on the income statement. Additional information regarding these investments is provided in Note 5 (“Fair Value Measurements”).  Deposits and other sources of funds  Domestic deposits are our primary source of funding. During the second quarter of 2014, average domestic deposits were $66.5 billion and represented 85% of the funds we used to support loans and other earning assets, compared to $64.9 billion and 86% during the second quarter of 2013. The composition of our average deposits is shown in Figure 8 in the section entitled “Net interest income.”  The increase in average domestic deposits from the second quarter of 2013 to the second quarter of 2014 was due to increases in demand deposits of $993 million and NOW and money market deposit accounts of $1.4 billion. These increases were mostly due to growth related to commercial client inflows as well as increases related to the commercial mortgage servicing business. This growth was partially offset by run-off in certificates of deposit.  Wholesale funds, consisting of deposits in our foreign office and short-term borrowings, averaged $2.7 billion during the second quarter of 2014, compared to $2.8 billion during the second quarter of 2013. The change from the second quarter of 2013 was caused by a $375 million decrease in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, partially offset by a $178 million increase in bank notes and other short-term borrowings and an $89 million increase in foreign office deposits.    124    Table of Contents Capital  At June 30, 2014, our shareholders’ equity was $10.5 billion, up $201 million from December 31, 2013. The following sections discuss certain factors that contributed to this change. For other factors that contributed to the change, see the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity (Unaudited).  CCAR and capital actions  As part of its ongoing supervisory process, the Federal Reserve requires BHCs like KeyCorp to submit an annual comprehensive capital plan and to update that plan to reflect material changes in the BHC’s risk profile, business strategies, or corporate structure, including but not limited to changes in planned capital actions. In January 2014, we submitted to the Federal Reserve and provided to the OCC our 2014 capital plan under the annual CCAR process. On March 26, 2014, the Federal Reserve announced that it did not object to our 2014 capital plan submitted as part of the annual CCAR process. The 2014 capital plan includes a common share repurchase program of up to $542 million. Share repurchases under the capital plan have been authorized by our Board and include repurchases to offset issuances of common shares under our employee compensation plans. Common share repurchases under the 2014 capital plan are expected to be executed through the first quarter of 2015.  During the second quarter of 2014, we repurchased $108 million of common shares under our 2014 capital plan authorization.  Dividends  As previously reported, our 2014 capital plan also proposed an increase in our quarterly common share dividend from $.055 to $.065 per share, which was approved by our Board of Directors in May 2014. Other changes to future dividends may be evaluated by the Board based upon our earnings, financial condition, and other factors, including regulatory review. Further information regarding the capital planning process and CCAR is included in the “Supervision and Regulation” section of our 2013 Form 10-K in Item 1. Business under the heading “Regulatory capital and liquidity.”  Consistent with the 2014 capital plan, we made a dividend payment of $.065 per share, or $57 million, on our common shares during the second quarter of 2014.  We also made a quarterly dividend payment of $1.9375 per share, or $5 million, on our Series A Preferred Stock during the second quarter of 2014.  Common shares outstanding  Our common shares are traded on the NYSE under the symbol KEY with 29,635 holders of record at June 30, 2014. Our book value per common share was $11.65 based on 876.8 million shares outstanding at June 30, 2014, compared to $11.25 per common share based on 890.7 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2013, and $10.89 per common share based on 912.9 million shares outstanding at June 30, 2013. At June 30, 2014, our tangible book value per common share was $10.50, compared to $10.11 per common share at December 31, 2013, and $9.77 per common share at June 30, 2013.  Figure 27 shows activities that caused the change in outstanding common shares over the past five quarters.  Figure 27.

Going forward we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stock-based compensation awards and for other corporate purposes.  Information on repurchases of common shares by KeyCorp is included in Part II, Item 2. “Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds” of this report.  Capital adequacy  Capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance. All of our capital ratios remain in excess of regulatory requirements at June 30, 2014. Our capital and liquidity levels are intended to position us to weather an adverse credit cycle while continuing to serve our clients’ needs, as well as to meet the Regulatory Capital Rules described in the “Supervision and regulation” section of Item 2 of this report. Our shareholders’ equity to assets ratio was 11.44% at June 30, 2014, compared to 11.09% at December 31, 2013, and 11.29% at June 30, 2013. Our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 10.15% at June 30, 2014, compared to 9.80% at December 31, 2013, and 9.96% at June 30, 2013.  Banking industry regulators prescribe minimum capital ratios for BHCs like KeyCorp and their banking subsidiaries. Risk-based capital guidelines require a minimum level of capital as a percent of “risk-weighted assets.” Risk-weighted assets consist of total assets plus certain off-balance sheet and market risk items, subject to adjustment for predefined credit risk factors. Currently, banks and BHCs must maintain, at a minimum, Tier 1 capital as a percent of risk-weighted assets of 4.00% and total capital as a percent of risk-weighted assets of 8.00%. As of June 30, 2014, our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and our total risk-based capital ratio were 11.99% and 14.14%, respectively, compared to 11.96% and 14.33%, respectively, at December 31, 2013, and 11.93% and 14.65%, respectively, at June 30, 2013.  Another indicator of capital adequacy, the leverage ratio, is defined as Tier 1 capital as a percentage of average quarterly tangible assets. BHCs that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the Federal Reserve’s risk-adjusted measure for market risk — as we have — must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 3.00%. All other BHCs must maintain a minimum ratio of 4.00%. As of June 30, 2014, our leverage ratio was 11.24%, compared to 11.11% at December 31, 2013, and 11.25% at June 30, 2013.  The adoption of the Regulatory Capital Rules changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to BHCs by phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities as eligible Tier 1 capital. The phase-out period, beginning January 1, 2015, for standardized approach banking organizations such as Key, will result in our trust preferred securities issued by the KeyCorp capital trusts being treated only as Tier 2 capital by 2016. These changes apply the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to depository institutions to BHCs, savings and loan holding companies, and nonbank financial companies identified as systemically important. Given our strong capital position, we expect to be able to satisfy the capital framework established under the Regulatory Capital Rules by our compliance date of January 1, 2015. The section titled “Supervision and Regulation” under Item 1. Business of our 2013 Form 10-K contains more detailed information regarding the Regulatory Capital Rules.  As of June 30, 2014, our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, leverage ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio were 11.99%, 11.24%, and 14.14%, respectively. The trust preferred securities issued by the KeyCorp capital trusts contribute $339 million, or 40, 38, and 40 basis points, to our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio, respectively, as of June 30, 2014. The new minimum capital ratios under the Regulatory Capital Rules together with the estimated capital ratios of Key at June 30, 2014, calculated on a fully phased-in basis are set forth in Figure 4 of this report.  Federal banking regulations group FDIC-insured depository institutions into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories, ranging from “well capitalized” to “critically undercapitalized.” A “well capitalized” institution must meet or exceed the prescribed threshold ratios of 6.00% for Tier 1 risk-based capital, 5.00% for Tier 1 leverage capital, and 10.00% for total risk-based capital and must not be subject to any written agreement, order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. If these provisions applied to BHCs, we believe we would qualify as “well capitalized” at June 30, 2014, and we believe there has not been any change in condition or event since that date that would cause a change in capital category. Analysis on an estimated basis, accounting for the phase-out of our trust preferred securities as Tier 1 eligible (and therefore as Tier 2 instead) as of June 30, 2014, also determines that we would qualify as “well capitalized” under current regulatory guidelines (Basel I), with the estimated Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, estimated leverage ratio, and estimated total risk-based capital ratio being 11.59%, 10.87%, and 14.14%, respectively. Figure 5 in the “Supervision and Regulation” section above, describes the new threshold capital ratios for a “well capitalized” and an “adequately capitalized” institution under the Regulatory Capital Rules. The regulatory defined capital categories serve a    126    Table of Contents  limited supervisory function. Investors should not use our estimated ratios as a representation of our overall financial condition or prospects of KeyCorp. A discussion of the regulatory capital standards and other related capital adequacy regulatory standards is included in the section “Supervision and Regulation” under Item 1. Business of our 2013 Form 10-K under the heading “Regulatory capital and liquidity.”  Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and BHC capital adequacy based on both the amount and composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. As a result of the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has intensified its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 risk-based capital, known as Tier 1 common equity, and its review of the consolidated capitalization of systemically important financial companies, including KeyCorp. The capital modifications mandated by the Regulatory Capital Rules are consistent with the renewed focus on Tier 1 common equity and the consolidated capitalization of banks, BHCs, and covered nonbank financial companies, which resulted from the financial crisis. Tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by GAAP nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations; this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. Figure 7 in the “Highlights of Our Performance” section reconciles Key shareholders’ equity, the GAAP performance measure, to Tier 1 common equity, the corresponding non-GAAP measure. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio was 11.25% at June 30, 2014, compared to 11.22% at December 31, 2013, and 11.18% at June 30, 2013.  Generally, for risk-based capital purposes, deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income are limited to the lesser of: (i) the amount of deferred tax assets that a financial institution expects to realize within one year of the calendar quarter-end date, based on its projected future taxable income for the year, or (ii) 10% of the amount of an institution’s Tier 1 capital. At June 30, 2014, and June 30, 2013, we had no net deferred tax assets deducted from Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets. At June 30, 2014, for Key’s consolidated operations, we had a federal net deferred tax asset of $137 million and a state deferred tax asset of $6 million, compared to a federal deferred tax asset of $184 million and a state deferred tax asset of $7 million at December 31, 2013, and a federal net deferred tax asset of $151 million and a state deferred tax liability of $4 million at June 30, 2013. We have recorded a valuation allowance of $1 million against the gross deferred tax assets associated with certain state net operating loss carryforwards and state credit carryforwards.    127    Table of Contents Figure 28 represents the details of our regulatory capital position at June 30, 2014, December 31, 2013, and June 30, 2013, under the existing regulatory capital standards.

The most significant risks we face are credit, compliance, liquidity, operational, market, reputation, strategic, and model risks. Our risk management activities are focused on ensuring we properly identify, measure and manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability. Certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section.  The KeyCorp Board of Directors (the “Board”) serves in an oversight capacity ensuring that Key’s risks are managed in a manner that is effective and balanced and adds value for the shareholders. The Board understands Key’s risk philosophy, approves the risk appetite, inquires about risk practices, reviews the portfolio of risks, compares the actual risks to the risk appetite and is apprised of significant risks, both actual and emerging, and determines whether management is responding appropriately. The Board challenges management and ensures accountability.  The Board’s Audit Committee assists the Board in oversight of financial statement integrity, regulatory and legal compliance, independent auditors’ qualifications and independence, and all risk review functions, including internal audit. The Audit Committee meets with management and approves significant policies related to risk assessment and risk management and the processes related to risk review, operational risk, and compliance. The Audit Committee has responsibility over internal audit, financial reporting, compliance risk and legal matters, the implementation, management and evaluation of operational risk controls and information, security and fraud risk, and associated reputation and strategic risks.  The Board’s Risk Committee assists the Board in oversight of strategies, policies, procedures and practices relating to the assessment and management of enterprise-wide risk, including credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, and model risk, as well as reputational and strategic risks. The Risk Committee also assists the Board in overseeing capital adequacy, capital planning, capital actions and other material financial matters. The Risk Committee reviews and provides oversight of management’s activities and approves significant policies related to enterprise-wide risks, which includes reviewing management and Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) reports, the ERM Policy, including the Risk Appetite Statement, as well as approving any material changes to the charter of the ERM Committee.  The Audit and Risk Committees meet jointly, as appropriate, to discuss matters that relate to each committee’s responsibilities. In addition to regularly scheduled bi-monthly meetings, the Audit Committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases. Committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting. All members of the Board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months.  Our ERM Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer and comprised of other senior level executives, is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite. The ERM Program encompasses our risk philosophy, policy, framework and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company. The ERM Committee reports to the Board’s Risk Committee. Annually, the Board reviews and approves the ERM Policy, as well as the risk appetite, including corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories. We use a risk-adjusted capital framework to manage risks. This framework is approved and managed by the ERM Committee.  Tier 2 Risk Governance Committees support the ERM Committee by identifying early warning events and trends, escalating emerging risks and discussing forward-looking assessments. Membership of the Risk Governance Committees includes representatives from each of the Three Lines of Defense. The First Line of Defense is the Line of Business primarily responsible to accept, own, proactively identify, monitor and manage risk. The Second Line of Defense comprises Risk Management representatives who provide independent, centralized oversight over all risk categories by aggregating, analyzing and reporting risk information. Risk Review provides the Third Line of Defense in their role to provide independent assessment and testing of the effectiveness, appropriateness and adherence to KeyCorp’s risk management policies, practices and controls.  The Chief Risk Officer ensures that relevant risk information is properly integrated into strategic and business decisions, ensures appropriate ownership of risks, provides input into performance and compensation decisions, assesses aggregate enterprise risk, monitors capabilities to manage critical risks, and executes appropriate Board and stakeholder reporting.    129    Table of Contents Federal banking regulators continue to emphasize with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution. We believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks, and conform to regulatory expectations.  Market risk management  Market risk is the risk that movements in market risk factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, credit spreads, and volatilities will reduce Key’s income and the value of its portfolios. These factors influence prospective yields, values, or prices associated with the instrument. For example, the value of a fixed-rate bond will decline when market interest rates increase, while the cash flows associated with a variable rate loan will increase when interest rates increase. The holder of a financial instrument is exposed to market risk when either the cash flows or the value of the instrument is tied to such external factors.  We are exposed to market risk both in our trading and nontrading activities, which include asset and liability management activities. Our trading positions are carried at fair value with changes recorded in the income statement. These positions are subject to various market-based risk factors that impact the fair value of the financial instruments in the trading category. Our traditional banking loan and deposit products as well as long-term debt and certain short-term borrowings are nontrading positions. These positions are generally carried at the principal amount outstanding for assets and the amount owed for liabilities. The nontrading positions are subject to changes in economic value due to varying market conditions, primarily changes in interest rates.  Trading market risk  Key incurs market risk as a result of trading, investing, and client facilitation activities, principally within our investment banking and capital markets business. Key has exposures to a wide range of interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and commodity prices, as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads. Our primary market risk exposures are a result of trading activities in the derivative and fixed income markets and maintaining positions in these instruments. We maintain modest trading inventories to facilitate customer flow, make markets in securities, and hedge certain risks. The majority of our positions are traded in active markets.  Management of trading market risks. Market risk management is an integral part of Key’s risk culture. Oversight of trading market risks is governed by the Risk Committee of our Board, the ERM Committee, and the Market Risk Committee. These committees regularly review and discuss market risk reports prepared by our Market Risk Management group (“MRM”) that contain our market risk exposures and results of monitoring activities. Market risk policies and procedures have been defined and approved by the Market Risk Committee, a Tier 2 Risk Governance Committee, and take into account our tolerance for risk and consideration for the business environment.  MRM is an independent risk management function that partners with the lines of business to identify, measure, and monitor market risks throughout our company. MRM is responsible for ensuring transparency of significant market risks, monitoring compliance with established limits, and escalating limit exceptions to appropriate senior management. The various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well-managed and prudent. Market risk is monitored through various measures, such as VaR, and through routine stress testing, sensitivity, and scenario analyses. MRM conducts stress tests for each covered position using historical worst case and standard shock scenarios. VaR, stressed VaR, and other analyses are prepared daily and distributed to appropriate management.  Covered positions. We monitor the market risk of our covered positions, which includes all of our trading positions as well as all foreign exchange and commodity positions, regardless of whether the position is in a trading account. The trading account includes on- and off-balance sheet positions in financial instruments acquired with the intent to profit from price variations. All positions in the trading account are recorded at fair value, and changes in fair value are reflected in our consolidated statements of income. Information regarding our fair value policies, procedures and methodologies is provided in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Fair Value Measurements” beginning on page 119 of our 2013 Form 10-K and Note 5 (“Fair Value Measurements”) in this report. Instruments that are used to hedge nontrading activities, such as bank-issued debt and loan portfolios, equity positions that are not actively traded, and securities financing activities, do not meet the definition of a covered position. MRM is responsible for identifying our portfolios as either covered or non-covered. The Covered Position Working Group develops the final list of covered positions, and a summary is provided to the Market Risk Committee.    130    Table of Contents Our significant portfolios of covered positions are detailed below. We analyze market risk by portfolios of covered positions, and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type. The descriptions below incorporate the respective risk types associated with each of these portfolios.        •   Fixed income includes those instruments associated with our capital markets business and the trading of securities as a dealer. These instruments include positions in municipal bonds, bonds backed by the U.S. government, agency and corporate bonds, certain mortgage-backed securities, securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, money markets, and certain CMOs. The activities and instruments within the fixed income portfolio create exposures to interest rate and credit spread risks.        •   Interest rate derivatives include interest rate swaps, caps and floors, which are transacted primarily to accommodate the needs of commercial loan clients. In addition, we enter into interest rate derivatives to offset or mitigate the interest rate risk related to the client positions. The activities within this portfolio create exposures to interest rate risk.        •   Credit derivatives include credit default swaps, which are used to mitigate loan portfolio credit risk, and credit default swap indexes, which are used to manage the credit risk exposure associated with anticipated sales of certain commercial real estate loans. The transactions within the credit derivatives portfolio result in exposure to credit risk.  VaR and stressed VaR. VaR is the estimate of the maximum amount of loss on an instrument or portfolio due to adverse market conditions during a given time interval within a stated confidence level. Stressed VaR is used to assess the extreme conditions on market risk within our trading portfolios. MRM calculates VaR and stressed VaR on a daily basis, and the results are distributed to appropriate management. VaR and stressed VaR results are also provided to our regulators and utilized in regulatory capital calculations.  We use a historical VaR model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions. Historical scenarios are customized for specific covered positions, and numerous risk factors are incorporated in the calculation. VaR is calculated using daily observations over a one-year time horizon, and approximates a 95% confidence level. Statistically, this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than VaR, on average, five out of 100 trading days, or three to four times each quarter. We also calculate VaR and stressed VaR at a 99% confidence level. We also utilize factors to estimate the exposures that contain optionality features, such as options and cancellable provisions.  The VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of possible gains and losses on our covered positions. However, there are limitations inherent in the VaR model since it uses historical results over a given time interval to estimate future performance. Historical results may not be indicative of future results, and changes in the market or composition of our portfolios could have a significant impact on the accuracy of the VaR model. We regularly review and enhance the modeling techniques, inputs and assumptions used. Our market risk policy includes the independent validation of our VaR model by Key’s Risk Management Group on an annual basis. The Model Risk Management Committee oversees the Model Validation Program, and results of validations are discussed with the ERM Committee.  MRM backtests our VaR model on a daily basis to evaluate its predictive power. The test compares VaR model results at the 99% confidence level to observed daily profit and loss. Results of backtesting are provided to the Market Risk Committee. Backtesting exceptions occur when trading losses exceed VaR. Actual losses did not exceed daily trading VaR on any day during the quarters ended June 30, 2014, and June 30, 2013.  We do not engage in correlation trading, or utilize the internal model approach for measuring default and credit migration risk. Our net VaR approach incorporates diversification, but our VaR calculation does not include the impact of counterparty risk and our own credit spreads on derivatives.  The aggregate VaR at the 99% confidence level for all covered positions was $1.1 million at June 30, 2014, and $1.7 million at June 30, 2013. The decrease in aggregate VaR was primarily due to reduced exposures in credit and interest rate derivatives. Figure 29 summarizes our VaR at the 99% confidence level for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended June 30, 2014, and June 30, 2013.    131    Table of Contents Figure 29.

Market risk is a component of our internal capital adequacy assessment. Our risk-weighted assets include a market risk-equivalent asset position, which consists of a VaR component, stressed VaR component, a de minimis exposure amount, and a specific risk add-on, which are added together to arrive at total market risk equivalent assets. Specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments, which is not accounted for by changes in broad market risk factors and is measured through a standardized approach. Specific risk calculations are run quarterly by MRM, and approved by the Chief Market Risk Officer.  Nontrading market risk  Most of our nontrading market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations and its impacts on our traditional loan and deposit products, as well as investments, hedging relationships, long-term debt, and certain short-term borrowings. Interest rate risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the EVE. Such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. We manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the EVE in accordance with our risk appetite, and within Board approved policy limits.  Interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of consumer preferences for loan and deposit products, economic conditions, the competitive environment within our markets, and changes in market interest rates that affect client activity and our hedging, investing, funding and capital positions. The primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of gap risk, basis risk, yield curve risk and option risk.  The management of nontrading market risk is centralized within Corporate Treasury. Oversight and governance is provided by the Risk Committee of our Board, the ERM Committee and the ALCO. These committees review reports on the components of interest rate risk described above as well as sensitivity analyses of these exposures. These committees have various responsibilities related to managing nontrading market risk, including recommending, approving, and monitoring strategies that maintain risk positions within approved tolerance ranges. The Asset Liability Management policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of interest rate risk and is administered by the ALCO. Internal and external emerging issues are monitored on a daily basis. The Market Risk Management Group, as the second line of defense, provides additional oversight.      •   “Gap risk” is the exposure to changes in interest rates and occurs when the volume of interest-bearing liabilities and the volume of interest-earning assets they fund (for example, deposits used to fund loans) do not mature or reprice at the same time.    132    Table of Contents   •   “Basis risk” is the exposure to asymmetrical changes in interest rate indexes and occurs when floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities reprice at the same time, but in response to different market factors or indexes.      •   “Yield curve risk” is the exposure to non-parallel changes in the slope of the yield curve (where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity) and occurs when interest-bearing liabilities and the interest-earning assets that they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve.      •   “Option risk” is the exposure to a customer or counterparty’s ability to take advantage of the interest rate environment and terminate or reprice one of our assets, liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments prior to contractual maturity without a penalty. Option risk occurs when exposures to customer and counterparty early withdrawals or early prepayments are not mitigated with an offsetting position or appropriate compensation.  Net interest income simulation analysis. The primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis. For purposes of this analysis, we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on- and off-balance sheet positions, accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity. The analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments, including a most likely macro-economic scenario. Simulation modeling assumes that residual risk exposures will be managed to within the risk appetite.   We measure the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if the federal funds target rate were to gradually increase or decrease over the next twelve months, and term rates were to move in a similar fashion. Our standard rate scenarios encompass a gradual increase or decrease of 200 basis points, but due to the low interest rate environment, we have modified the standard to a gradual decrease of 25 basis points over two months with no change over the following ten months. After calculating the amount of net interest income at risk to interest rate changes, we compare that amount with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment. We also perform regular stress tests and sensitivities on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments. One set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of interest rate inputs on simulated exposures. Assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve, including a sustained flat yield curve, an inverted slope yield curve, changes in credit spreads, an immediate parallel change in market interest rates, and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates. Another set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of loan and deposit assumptions and assumed discretionary strategies on simulated exposures. Assessments are performed on changes to the following assumptions: the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities; changes in lending spreads; prepayments on loans and securities; other loan and deposit balance shifts; investment, funding and hedging activities; and liquidity and capital management strategies.  Simulation analysis produces only a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on judgments related to assumption inputs into the simulation model. We tailor assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled, and validate those assumptions on a regular basis. Our simulations are performed with the assumption that interest rate risk positions will be actively managed through the use of on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments to achieve the desired residual risk profile. However, actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition, customer behavior, product pricing, market interest rates, investment, funding and hedging activities, and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events.   133    Table of Contents Figure 31 presents the results of the simulation analysis at June 30, 2014, and June 30, 2013. At June 30, 2014, our simulated exposure to changes in interest rates was moderately asset sensitive, and net interest income would benefit over time from either an increase in short-term or intermediate-term interest rates. Tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual increase or decrease in short-term interest rates over the next twelve months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 4%. As shown in Figure 31, we are operating within these levels as of June 30, 2014.  Figure 31. Simulated Change in Net Interest Income                 June 30, 2014             Basis point change assumption (short-term rates)     -25       +200     Tolerance level     -4.00 %      -4.00 %                          Interest rate risk assessment     -1.52 %      3.00 %                          June 30, 2013             Basis point change assumption (short-term rates)     -25       +200     Tolerance level     -4.00 %      -4.00 %                          Interest rate risk assessment     -1.12 %      2.30 %                         The results of additional sensitivity analysis of alternate interest rate paths and loan and deposit behavior assumptions indicates that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results presented in Figure 31. Net interest income is highly dependent on the timing, magnitude, frequency, and path of interest rate increases and the associated assumptions for deposit repricing relationships, lending spreads, and the balance behavior of transaction accounts. The unprecedented low level of interest rates increases the uncertainty of assumptions for deposit balance behavior and deposit repricing relationships to market interest rates. Our historical deposit repricing betas in the last rising rate cycle ranged between 50% and 60% for interest-bearing deposits, and we continue to make similar assumptions in our modeling. The sensitivity testing of these assumptions supports our confidence that actual results are likely to be within a 75 basis point range of modeled results.  To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the FOMC expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens, and in particular expects to keep the federal funds rate at exceptionally low levels. Key will continue to monitor balance sheet flows and expects the benefit from rising rates to increase prior to any increase in the federal funds rate. Our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume, mix, maturity, and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows. As changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy, management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile. We also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a three-year horizon. These simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a twelve-month horizon. To capture longer-term exposures, we calculate exposures to changes to the EVE as discussed in the following section.  Economic value of equity modeling. EVE complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond twelve-, twenty-four and thirty-six month horizons. EVE modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates, measuring the resulting change in the values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, and comparing those amounts with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment. Because the calculation of EVE under an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest rates in the current low rate environment results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than 200 basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points, we have modified the standard declining rate scenario to an immediate 100 basis point decrease. This analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with non-contractual maturities. Those assumptions are based on historical behaviors, as well as our expectations. We develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our EVE will decrease by more than 15% in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates. We are operating within these guidelines as of June 30, 2014.  Management of interest rate exposure. We use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate A/LM strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures. Specifically, we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities, issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates, and using derivatives — predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps, which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities.     134    Table of Contents Figure 32 shows all swap positions that we hold for A/LM purposes. These positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. For example, fixed-rate debt is converted to a floating rate through a “receive fixed/pay variable” interest rate swap. The volume, maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader A/LM objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile, see Note 7 (“Derivatives and Hedging Activities”).  Figure 32.

(b) Excludes accrued interest of $61 million and $64 million for June 30, 2014, and June 30, 2013, respectively.  Liquidity risk management  We define “liquidity” as the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences. Liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions.  Governance structure  We manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis. This approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity, as well as each entity’s capacity to manage through adverse conditions. The approach also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding.  The management of consolidated liquidity risk is centralized within Corporate Treasury. Oversight and governance is provided by the Risk Committee of our Board, the ERM Committee, and the ALCO. The Asset Liability Management Policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of liquidity risk and is administered by the ALCO. The Market Risk Management group, as the second line of defense, provides additional oversight. Our current liquidity risk management practices are largely consistent with the Federal Reserve Board’s Enhanced Prudential Standards, and further enhancements are underway that will put us in compliance with these standards.  These committees regularly review liquidity and funding summaries, liquidity trends, peer comparisons, variance analyses, liquidity projections, hypothetical funding erosion stress tests and goal tracking reports. The reviews generate a discussion of positions, trends and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of our decisions. When liquidity pressure is elevated, positions are monitored more closely and reporting is more intensive. To ensure that emerging issues are identified, we also communicate with individuals inside and outside of the company on a daily basis.  Factors affecting liquidity  Our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events. An example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency. Examples of indirect events (events unrelated to us) that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war, natural disasters, political events, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund or hedge fund. Similarly, market speculation, or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources.    135    Table of Contents Our credit ratings at June 30, 2014, are shown in Figure 33. We believe these credit ratings, under normal conditions in the capital markets, will enable the parent company or KeyBank to issue fixed income securities to investors.  Figure 33.

Liquidity risk is also derived from our deposit gathering activities and the ability of our customers to withdraw funds that do not have a stated maturity or to withdraw funds before their contractual maturity. Liquidity risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by our ability to accommodate liability maturities, deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund new business opportunities at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, and without adverse consequences. These assessments are measured under the assumption of normal operating conditions as well as under a stressed environment. We manage these exposures in accordance with our risk appetite, and within Board approved policy limits.  We regularly monitor our liquidity position and funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of hypothetical scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding. In the normal course of business, we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both KeyCorp and KeyBank. In a “heightened monitoring mode,” we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently, and use assumptions to reflect the changed market environment. Our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies. Erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods. Ultimately, they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations. To compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures, we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed.  We maintain a Contingency Funding Plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis. The plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions. It also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for managing liquidity through a problem period. As part of the plan, we maintain a liquidity reserve through balances in our liquid asset portfolio. During a problem period, that reserve could be used as a source of funding to provide time to develop and execute a longer-term strategy. The liquid asset portfolio at June 30, 2014, totaled $10.4 billion, consisting of $7.5 billion of unpledged securities, $1.0 billion of securities available for secured funding at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, and $1.9 billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our Federal Reserve account. The liquid asset portfolio can fluctuate due to excess liquidity, heightened risk, or prefunding of expected outflows, such as debt maturities. Additionally, as of June 30, 2014, our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was $19.5 billion at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and $2.8 billion at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati (FHLB). During the second quarter of 2014, Key’s outstanding FHLB advances increased by $241 million due to additional advances of $252 million and repayments of $11 million.  Long-term liquidity strategy  Our long-term liquidity strategy is to be predominantly funded by core deposits. However, we may use wholesale funds to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio, meet daily cash demands, and allow management flexibility to execute business initiatives. Key’s client-based relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base which, in conjunction with intermediate and long-term wholesale funds managed to a diversified maturity structure and investor base, supports our liquidity risk management strategy. We use the loan to deposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies. Our target loan to deposit ratio is 90-100% (at June 30, 2014, our loan to deposit ratio was 87%), which we calculate as total loans, loans held for sale, and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by domestic deposits.    136    Table of Contents Sources of liquidity  Our primary sources of liquidity include customer deposits, wholesale funding and liquid assets. If the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances, we rely on wholesale funding or liquid assets. Conversely, excess cash generated by operating, investing and deposit-gathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets.  Liquidity programs  We have several liquidity programs, which are described in Note 18 (“Long-Term Debt”) beginning on page 200 of our 2013 Form 10-K, that are designed to enable the parent company and KeyBank to raise funds in the public and private markets. The proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. These liquidity programs are reviewed from time to time by the Board of Directors and are renewed and replaced as necessary. There are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs. During the second quarter of 2014, the KeyCorp shelf registration, including the Medium-Term Note Program, was updated. In connection with the updated Medium-Term Note Program, the Board of Directors authorized KeyCorp to issue up to $4 billion of debt, and revoked all prior issuance authority under previous KeyCorp shelf registration statements including through previous medium-term note programs. During the three-month period ended June 30, 2014, KeyCorp and KeyBank did not issue any debt, and no debt matured.  Liquidity for KeyCorp  The primary source of liquidity for KeyCorp is from subsidiary dividends, primarily from KeyBank. KeyCorp has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt; support customary corporate operations and activities (including acquisitions); support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries’ obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, and without adverse consequences; and pay dividends to shareholders.  We use a cash coverage metric as the primary measure to assess parent company liquidity. The cash coverage metric measures the months into the future where projected obligations can be met with the current amount of liquidity to meet all projected obligations. We generally issue term debt to supplement dividends from KeyBank to manage our liquidity position at or above our targeted levels. The parent company generally maintains cash and short-term investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over at least the next 24 months. At June 30, 2014, KeyCorp held $2.0 billion in short-term investments, which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations, including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our risk tolerance.  Typically, KeyCorp meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from KeyBank, supplemented with term debt. Federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval. A national bank’s dividend-paying capacity is affected by several factors, including net profits (as defined by statute) for the two previous calendar years and for the current year, up to the date of dividend declaration. During the second quarter of 2014, KeyCorp subsidiaries did not make any dividend payments to the parent, and KeyCorp did not make any capital infusions to KeyBank. As of June 30, 2014, KeyBank had fully utilized its regulatory capacity to pay dividends to KeyCorp.  Our liquidity position and recent activity  Over the past three months our liquid asset portfolio, which includes overnight and short-term investments, as well as unencumbered, high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios, has increased as a result of net customer loan and deposit flows and an increase in unpledged securities. The liquid asset portfolio continues to exceed the amount that we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a longer-term solution.  From time to time, KeyCorp or KeyBank may seek to retire, repurchase or exchange outstanding debt, capital securities, preferred shares or common shares through cash purchase, privately negotiated transactions or other means. Additional information on repurchases of common shares by KeyCorp is included in Part II, Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
