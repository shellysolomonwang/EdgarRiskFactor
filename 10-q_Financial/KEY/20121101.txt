Item 1A: Risk Factors in our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of subsequent events or circumstances. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider all risks and uncertainties disclosed in our SEC filings, including our reports on Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q and our registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, all of which are accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and at www.key.com/IR.  Economic overview  During the third quarter of 2012 a modest economic recovery continued in the United States. Job creation improved as employers added workers amid several economic uncertainties. Payrolls increased 437,000 in the third quarter of 2012, compared to the 200,000 increase in the second quarter of 2012 and the 677,000 increase in the first quarter of 2012. The average unemployment rate for the third quarter of 2012 fell to 8.1%, slightly better than the average 8.2% in the second quarter of 2012 but considerably higher than the 10-year average unemployment rate of 6.7%.  Inflationary pressures rose slightly in the third quarter of 2012 as consumer prices in September 2012 increased at an annual rate of 2%, up from the 1.7% annual increase in June 2012 but down from the 3.2% average increase for all of 2011. Gasoline prices also continued to be one of the major contributors to elevated prices as the national average price for a regular gallon of gasoline in the U.S. was approximately 13.7% higher at the end of September 2012 than in June 2012. However, U.S. consumers were resilient as the average monthly rate of consumer spending increased 0.6% for the third quarter of 2012 compared to a flat second quarter.  The improvement in the labor market coincided with a better housing market. September new home sales were up 27.1% from September 2011, while the median price of new homes increased by 11.7% over the same period. Building activity is at its highest levels since 2008 as housing starts at the end of the quarter increased 44.5% from a year earlier. Existing home sales also showed signs of improvement as low mortgage rates continue to encourage buyers back into the market. September 2012 existing home sales were up 11% from the same month one year ago while the median home values increased 11.3% from the same time period.  The weaker economic outlook from the second quarter of 2012 sparked a response from the Federal Reserve as it took further actions in the third quarter of 2012 to strengthen its commitment to accommodative monetary policy. As part of these actions, the Federal Reserve stated it would keep the federal funds rate at exceptionally low levels at least through mid-2015. Furthermore, in an attempt to lower longer-term borrowing rates applicable to consumers and businesses, the Federal Reserve decided to undertake a third round of quantitative easing. The Federal Reserve believes that a highly accommodative stance on monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens. The benchmark two-year U.S. Treasury yield declined from 0.30% at June 30, 2012 to 0.23% at September 30, 2012. The ten-year Treasury yield, which began the third quarter of 2012 at 1.65%, declined 0.02% to close the third quarter of 2012 at 1.63%.  Long-term financial goals  Our long-term financial goals are as follows:      ¿ Target a loan to core deposit ratio range of 90% to 100%;      ¿ Return to a moderate risk profile by targeting a net charge-off ratio range of .40% to .50%;      ¿ Grow high quality and diverse revenue streams by targeting a net interest margin in excess of 3.50%, and ratio of noninterest income to total revenue of greater than 40%;      ¿ Create positive operating leverage and target an efficiency ratio in the range of 60 to 65%; and      ¿ Achieve a return on average assets in the range of 1.00% to 1.25%.

Strategic developments  We initiated the following actions during the first nine months of 2012 to support our corporate strategy described in the “Introduction” section under the “Corporate Strategy” heading on page 39 of our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.      t As previously announced, we committed $5 billion in lending capital to small- and medium-sized businesses by the end of 2014. We began this program in September of 2011, and we have already met this goal well ahead of our scheduled lending pledge.      t We have made progress on our previously announced company-wide efficiency initiatives goal. We are committed to achieving an expense run rate reduction of $150 to $200 million by December 2013, of which $30 million to $50 million of run rate reductions are expected to occur by the end of 2012. Using our current levels of revenue and expense, these initiatives are intended to move us to our long-term efficiency ratio target range of 60% to 65%.      t As previously reported, on July 13, 2012, we completed our acquisition of 37 retail banking branches in Western New York. We added approximately $2 billion in assets and deposits. Additionally, as part of this acquisition, we added credit card receivables of approximately $69 million and assumed a related reward liability of $1 million on September 14, 2012. This acquisition provides us an opportunity to leverage our existing cost structure across a larger base. The liquidity provided by this acquisition was used to pay maturing debt and fund organic growth.      t On August 1, 2012, approximately $718 million (based on estimated fair value at acquisition date) in Key-branded credit card assets were acquired from Elan Financial Services as part of our strategy to diversify our revenue stream and to provide opportunities for future growth.      t During the third quarter of 2012, we continued to take advantage of the low interest rate environment and nontaxable treatment of gains – pursuant to a previous settlement with the IRS – through the early termination of leveraged leases. These terminations resulted in gains in noninterest income of $39 million, offset by $13 million in net interest income write-offs of fees and capitalized loan origination costs.      t  During the third quarter of 2012, we continued our commitment to disciplined capital management. We completed repurchases of approximately $82 million of Common Shares, representing 9.6 million shares, pursuant to a repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors. This program was also included in our 2012 capital plan submitted to the Federal Reserve as part of CCAR and not objected to by the Federal Reserve. With the repurchases completed through    80    Table of Contents      September 30, 2012, we have remaining authority to repurchase up to $177 million of our Common Shares. Our existing repurchase program does not have an expiration date. Common Share repurchases under the current authorization are expected to be executed through the first quarter of 2013. Additionally, at the regular July Board meeting, the Board declared a third quarter cash dividend of $.05 per share payable on September 14, 2012 to shareholders of record on August 28, 2012.      ¿ As previously reported, we redeemed trust preferred securities issued by KeyCorp Capital VII and KeyCorp Capital X totaling approximately $707 million.  Demographics  We have two major business segments: Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank.  Key Community Bank serves individuals and small to mid-sized businesses by offering a variety of deposit, investment, lending, and personalized wealth management products and business advisory services. These products and services are provided through our relationship managers and specialists working in our 14-state branch network, which is organized into three internally defined geographic regions: Rocky Mountains and Northwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast.  Figure 3 shows the geographic diversity of Key Community Bank’s average deposits, commercial loans, and home equity loans.  Figure 3.

Key Corporate Bank includes three lines of business that operate nationally, within and beyond our 14-state branch network: Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services; Equipment Finance; and Institutional and Capital Markets.  The Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services business consists of two business units.      ¿ Real Estate Capital professionals who are located in select markets across the country provide financial services for public and private owners, investors, and developers of nonowner-occupied commercial real estate properties. In addition to direct loans, this business unit is a Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriter and Servicer, Freddie Mac Program Plus Seller/Servicer, and FHA-approved mortgagee. KeyBank Real Estate Capital is also one of the nation’s largest and highest rated commercial mortgage servicers. Figure 19, which appears later in this report in the “Loans and loans held for sale” section, shows the diversity of our commercial real estate lending business based on industry type and location.      ¿ Corporate Banking Services provides cash management, interest rate derivatives, and foreign exchange products and services to existing clients. Through its Public Sector and Financial Institutions businesses, Corporate Banking Services also provides a full array of commercial banking products and services to government and not-for-profit entities and to community banks. A variety of commercial payment products are provided through the Enterprise Commercial Payments Group.  Equipment Finance meets the equipment financing needs of companies domestically and in Europe by providing equipment manufacturers, distributors and resellers with funding options for their clients. Equipment Finance specializes in the technology, healthcare, and renewable energy markets as well as other capital assets.  The Institutional and Capital Markets business consists of two business units.    81    Table of Contents   ¿ KeyBanc Capital Markets provides commercial lending, treasury management, investment banking, derivatives, foreign exchange, equity and debt underwriting and trading, and syndicated finance products and services, primarily to emerging and middle-market companies in the Industrial, Consumer, Real Estate, Energy, Technology, and Healthcare sectors. This business unit’s focused industry expertise and its consistent, integrated team approach help our clients achieve their strategic objectives.      ¿ Victory Capital Management is an investment advisory firm that manages or offers advice regarding investment portfolios. This business unit’s national client base consists of both institutional and retail clients derived from four primary channels: public plans, Taft-Hartley plans, corporations, and endowments and foundations.  Additional information regarding the products and services offered by our Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank segments are described further in this report in Note 16 (“Line of Business Results”).    82    Table of Contents Supervision and Regulation  Regulatory reform developments  On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. This Act is intended to address perceived deficiencies and gaps in the regulatory framework for financial services in the United States, reduce the risks of bank failures, and better equip the nation’s regulators to guard against or mitigate any future financial crises, and manage systemic risk through increased supervision of systemically important financial companies (including nonbank financial companies), such as KeyCorp and KeyBank. The Dodd-Frank Act implements numerous and far-reaching changes across the financial landscape affecting financial companies, including banks and BHCs such as Key. Further discussion concerning the Dodd-Frank Act and the risks that it presents to Key is available in our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “II. Compliance Risks” beginning on page 15 in Item 1A “Risk Factors.” A number of proposed rules referenced in our prior reports continue to remain pending. The following provides a summary of pertinent regulatory developments relating to the Dodd-Frank Act or that relate to our results this quarter.  Stress Testing  The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve to conduct an annual stress test on certain banking organizations including Key to evaluate whether such organizations have sufficient capital, on a total consolidated basis, to absorb losses as a result of adverse economic conditions. On October 12, 2012, the Federal Reserve published its final rule on supervisory stress tests. The rule is effective on November 15, 2012, by which date the stress testing scenarios (including those describing hypothetical baseline, adverse, and severely adverse economic and financial conditions) are expected to be published. A summary of the results of the stress tests will be publicly disclosed by the Federal Reserve no later than March 31, 2013. Under the final rule, we are required to consider the results of the stress test as part of our capital planning process and must update our resolution plan as the Federal Reserve determines appropriate based on the results of the stress test.  Company-run stress tests are also required under the Dodd-Frank Act. On October 12, 2012, and October 9, 2012, the Federal Reserve and OCC published their final rules on company-run stress tests that apply to banking organizations such as KeyCorp and KeyBank. The Federal Reserve’s rule is effective on November 15, 2012, and the OCC’s rule became effective on October 9, 2012. Stress testing scenarios (including those describing hypothetical baseline, adverse, and severely adverse economic and financial conditions) are expected to be published by November 15, 2012. Results of these stress tests must be reported to the Federal Reserve and OCC (the first results reports are due by January 5, 2013), and publicly disclosed (the first public disclosure is required by the rules to be made between March 15 and 31, 2013).  Interchange fees  As previously reported, the Federal Reserve approved Regulation II, Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing (“Regulation II”), which limits debit card issuer interchange fees for electronic debit transactions and implements provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The relevant portions of Regulation II became effective on October 1, 2011. Our debit interchange revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 was $42 million, compared to $84 million for the same period in 2011, which is consistent with our expectations originally reported in our Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2011.  Enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements  On January 5, 2012, the Federal Reserve published in the Federal Register its proposed rule on Enhanced Prudential Standards and Early Remediation Requirements for covered companies, as part of its efforts to implement a regulatory scheme pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act applicable to systemically important financial companies. The proposed rule provides more specific requirements to complement the Federal Reserve’s existing efforts to enhance the supervisory framework for covered companies. The proposed rule applies to U.S. BHCs with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, like KeyCorp, and includes a wide range of measures addressing issues such as capital, liquidity, credit exposure limits, risk management and early remediation. Comments to this proposed rule were due by April 30, 2012. We continue to monitor implementation of this rule.  U.S. Implementation of Basel III  On August 30, 2012, the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OCC jointly published three separate NPRs seeking comment on proposed rules that would revise and replace their current capital rules in a manner consistent both with relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act as well as the implementation of Basel III. The comment period on these NPRs ended on October 22, 2012. Also on August 30, 2012, these agencies published their joint final market risk capital rule which applies to Key and KeyBank and becomes effective on January 1, 2013.    83    Table of Contents One NPR (the “Basel III NPR”) proposes the majority of the revisions to international capital standards in Basel III, including a more restrictive definition of regulatory capital (such as providing for the phase-out of trust preferred securities by January 1, 2016), higher minimum regulatory capital requirements, and the imposition of capital conservation and countercyclical capital buffers. It also proposes limitations on certain distributions and discretionary bonuses as well as revisions to the agencies’ prompt corrective action regulations. Another NPR (the “Standardized Approach NPR”) proposes new methodologies for determining risk-weighted assets, such as by expanding the number and type of exposure categories, providing a more comprehensive recognition of collateral and guarantees, and introducing or applying more risk-sensitive treatment for certain exposures (including certain high-volatility commercial real estate, corporate, equity, foreign, securitization, derivative, residential mortgage, and 90 day or more past due exposures). It also proposes detailed qualitative and quantitative public disclosure requirements relating to capital adequacy. The final NPR (the “Advanced Approaches NPR”) proposes to revise the current advanced approaches risk-based capital rule to incorporate certain aspects of Basel III as well as certain other revisions to the Basel capital framework published by the Basel Committee between 2009-2011. While Key and KeyBank are subject to the Basel III and Standardized Approach NPRs, they are not subject to the Advanced Approaches NPR.  The NPRs are consistent with the discussion of the Basel III capital framework in our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Implementation of the Basel III final capital framework is proposed to begin on January 1, 2013, with minimum capital ratios and prompt corrective action requirements implemented by January 1, 2015, and the capital conservation buffer phased-in from January 1, 2016 through January 1, 2019.  New Minimum Capital Requirements  Beginning January 1, 2013, banking organizations subject to the Basel III and Standardized Approach NPRs, like Key, would be required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in Figure 4. At September 30, 2012, Key had a Tier 1 common equity ratio of 11.30%, under current Basel I. Also at September 30, 2012, based on the fully phased-in Basel III and Standardized Approach NPRs, Key estimates that its capital and leverage ratios, after required adjustment for market risk pursuant to the new final market risk rule effective January 1, 2013, would be as set forth in Figure 4.  Figure 4.

Key is not subject to the proposed countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% imposed under the Advanced Approaches NPR.      (b) Key is not subject to the proposed 3% supplemental leverage ratio requirement imposed under the Advanced Approaches NPR.  Revised Prompt Corrective Action Standards  Under the Basel III NPR, the prompt corrective action capital category threshold ratios applicable to FDIC-insured depository institutions, such as KeyBank, are proposed to be revised effective January 1, 2015. Figure 5 identifies the proposed capital category threshold ratios for a well capitalized and an adequately capitalized institution under current law and the Basel III and Standardized Approach NPRs.    84    Table of Contents Figure 5.

There can be no guarantee that the Basel III and Standardized Approach NPRs will be adopted in their current form, what changes may be made before adoption, or when ultimate adoption will occur.  Highlights of Our Performance  Financial performance  For the third quarter of 2012, we announced net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $214 million, or $.23 per Common Share. Our third quarter of 2012 results compare to net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $229 million, or $.24 per Common Share, for the third quarter of 2011. For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders was $634 million, or $.67 per Common Share, compared to $656 million or $.71 per Common Share for the same period one year ago. The results for the nine months ended September 30, 2011, included a deemed dividend of $49 million, or $.06 per diluted Common Share, related to the accelerated amortization of the discount on the repurchased preferred shares from the U.S. Treasury.  Our taxable-equivalent net interest income was $578 million for the third quarter of 2012, and the net interest margin was 3.23%. These results compare to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $555 million and a net interest margin of 3.09% for the third quarter of 2011. The increase in net interest income and the net interest margin was primarily a result of a change in funding mix from the redemption of certain trust preferred securities and the continued maturity of higher-costing certificates of deposit and long-term debt during the third quarter of 2012. This funding was replaced with lower-cost deposits obtained through our branch acquisition, and an overall increase in demand deposits. The improvement in net interest income and the net interest margin was partially offset by a $13 million reduction to net interest income from the write-off of capitalized loan origination costs due to the early termination of leveraged leases, resulting in a seven basis point decline in the net interest margin for the third quarter of 2012.  Our noninterest income was $544 million for the third quarter of 2012, compared to $483 million for the year-ago quarter. Gains on leased equipment increased $39 million compared to the same period one year ago, primarily related to the early terminations of leveraged leases. Net gains from loan sales also increased $21 million from the year-ago quarter. Other income was $48 million higher due to a $54 million gain associated with the redemption of certain trust preferred securities in the third quarter of 2012. Investment banking and capital markets income also increased $13 million from one year ago. These increases in noninterest income were partially offset by a $23 million decrease in net gains from principal investing (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests), a $15 million decrease in electronic banking fees as a result of government pricing controls on debit transactions that went into effect October 1, 2011, and a $13 million decline in operating lease income.  Our noninterest expense was $734 million for the third quarter of 2012, compared to $692 million for the same period last year. Personnel expense increased $29 million due to increased salaries and incentive compensation expense resulting from the hiring of client-facing personnel and our acquisition of 37 branches in Western New York, which closed on July 13, 2012. Nonpersonnel expense increased $13 million from one year ago and included an increase of $8 million related to the amortization of the intangible assets associated with the third quarter 2012 acquisitions of the previously discussed credit card portfolio as well as the branches. Various other expenses also increased $14 million. These increases in noninterest expense were partially offset by a $10 million decrease in operating lease expense compared to the same period one year ago. The provision (credit) for losses on lending-related commitments was a credit of $8 million compared to a credit of $1 million for the year-ago quarter.    85    Table of Contents As previously announced, we are implementing a number of efficiency initiatives which are intended to enhance our competitive position by lowering our cost structure and aligning it with our current operating environment. We continue to make progress on our expense initiative goal of $150 to $200 million in annual reductions by the end of 2013. We expect to capture $30 million to $50 million of annual expense reductions by the end of 2012.  Average loans were $50.7 billion for the third quarter of 2012, an increase of $2.7 billion compared to the third quarter of 2011. Commercial, financial and agricultural loans grew by $4.1 billion over the year-ago quarter, with strong growth across Key’s commercial and middle market segments. This growth was partially offset by decline in the commercial real estate portfolio, termination of certain leveraged leases in the equipment lease exit portfolio, and run-off of consumer loans in the designated exit portfolio.  Average deposits totaled $62.7 billion for the third quarter of 2012, an increase of $3.8 billion compared to the year-ago quarter. The growth reflects an increase in business demand deposits and the impact of Key’s branch acquisition. The growth in non-time deposits more than offset the maturities in certificates of deposit.  Our provision for loan and lease losses was $109 million for the third quarter of 2012, compared to $10 million for the year-ago quarter. Our allowance for loan and lease losses was $888 million, or 1.73% of total period-end loans at September 30, 2012, compared to 2.35% at September 30, 2011. As a result of the acquisition of the credit card portfolio and the loans associated with the branch acquisition, Key established an allowance for loan and lease losses above the discount related to these acquired portfolios in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. This provision for loan and lease losses was approximately $32 million during the third quarter.  At September 30, 2012, our nonperforming loans totaled $653 million and represented 1.27% of period-end portfolio loans, compared to 1.64% at September 30, 2011. Nonperforming assets at September 30, 2012, totaled $718 million and represented 1.39% of portfolio loans and OREO and other nonperforming assets, compared to 1.89% at September 30, 2011. Due to recently updated regulatory guidance, all performing secured loans that were discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not formally reaffirmed were designated as troubled-debt restructurings and written down to the collateral’s fair market value less selling costs while unsecured loans were charged off. As a result of this guidance, the provision for loan and lease losses and the net loan charge-offs both increased $45 million for the third quarter of 2012. The net carrying amount of these secured loans, $38 million, was classified as TDRs and included in nonperforming loans at September 30, 2012.  Despite the Chapter 7 loans discussed above, nonperforming assets continued to decrease during the third quarter of 2012, representing the twelfth consecutive quarterly decline.  During the first nine months of 2012, we originated approximately $27.6 billion in new or renewed lending commitments to consumers and businesses, an increase of $1.5 billion from the same period one year ago.  Our capital ratios remain strong. Our tangible common equity, Tier 1 common equity and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios at September 30, 2012, are 10.39%, 11.30%, and 12.10%, respectively, compared to 9.82%, 11.28%, and 13.49%, respectively, at September 30, 2011. In addition to leveraging our strong capital position through recent acquisitions, we have continued to return capital to our shareholders by repurchasing stock and by maintaining our dividend. In the third quarter, we repurchased 9.6 million common shares at an average cost of $8.36 per share and redeemed $707 million in trust preferred securities. Additionally, we estimate that our Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio under the Federal Reserve’s NPR as of September 30, 2012 at 10.41%, which we believe will place us in a strong capital position relative to our peers on this measure.  Figure 6 shows our continuing and discontinued operating results for the current, past and year-ago quarters. Our financial performance for each of the past five quarters is summarized in Figure 1.    86    Table of Contents Figure 6.

In September 2009, we decided to discontinue the education lending business conducted through Key Education Resources, the education payment and financing unit of KeyBank. As a result of these decisions, we have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations. The income (loss) from discontinued operations for the periods presented was primarily attributable to fair value adjustments related to the education lending securitization trusts.

Figure 7 presents certain non-GAAP financial measures related to “tangible common equity,” “return on tangible common equity” and “Tier 1 common equity.” Tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by GAAP nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations; this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity and Tier 1 common equity, we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases. Figure 7 also reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures.  Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and BHC capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. Beginning in early 2009, the Federal Reserve has focused its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 risk-based capital known as Tier 1 common equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Because the Federal Reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders’ equity (essentially Tier 1 risk-based capital less preferred stock, qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in Tier 1 risk-based capital, this focus on Tier 1 common equity is consistent with existing capital adequacy categories. This increased focus on Tier 1 common equity is also present in the Basel Committee’s final Basel III framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation, which U.S. regulators have recently proposed to implement in the near future. The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act also changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to BHCs by requiring regulators to create rules phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities as Tier 1 eligible capital. This three year phase-out period, which commences January 1, 2013, will ultimately result in our trust preferred securities being treated only as Tier 2 capital. The Supervision and Regulation section of this report contains information about the Basel III NPR, which provides for this three year phase-out period.  The table also shows the computation for pre-provision net revenue, which is not formally defined by GAAP. Management believes that eliminating the effects of the provision for loan and lease losses makes it easier to analyze our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis.  The cash efficiency ratio performance measure removes the impact of our intangible asset amortization from the calculation. Management believes this ratio provides greater consistency and comparability between our results and those of our peer banks. Additionally, this ratio is used by analysts and investors to assist in the development of their earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis.  Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are not necessarily comparable to similar measures that may be represented by other companies.    87    Table of Contents Figure 7.

Net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets (such as loans and securities) and loan-related fee income, and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. There are several factors that affect net interest income, including:      ¿ the volume, pricing, mix and maturity of earning assets, and interest-bearing liabilities;      ¿ the volume and value of net free funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and equity capital;      ¿ the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk;      ¿ interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace; and      ¿ asset quality.  To make it easier to compare results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets (some taxable, some not), we present net interest income in this discussion on a “taxable-equivalent basis” (i.e., as if it were all taxable and at the same rate). For example, $100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as $154, an amount that — if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% — would yield $100.  Figure 8 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense, and their respective yields or rates over the past five quarters. This figure also presents a reconciliation of taxable-equivalent net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with GAAP for each of those quarters. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized taxable-equivalent net interest income by average earning assets.  Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $578 million for the third quarter of 2012, and the net interest margin was 3.23%. These results compare to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $555 million and a net interest margin of 3.09% for the third quarter of 2011. The increase in net interest income and the net interest margin was primarily a result of a change in funding mix from the redemption of certain trust preferred securities and the continued maturity of higher-costing certificates of deposit and long-term debt during the third quarter of 2012. This funding was replaced with lower-cost deposits obtained through our branch acquisition, and an overall increase in demand deposits. The improvement in net interest income and the net interest margin was partially offset by a $13 million reduction to net interest income from the write-off of capitalized loan origination costs due to the early termination of leveraged leases, resulting in a seven basis point decline in the net interest margin for the third quarter of 2012.  Compared to the second quarter of 2012, taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $34 million, and the net interest margin improved by 17 basis points. The improvement was driven largely by lower funding costs, the redemption of trust preferred securities, the maturity of long-term debt in both the second and third quarters of 2012, and the maturity of higher rate certificates of deposit. The favorable impact of our credit card portfolio acquisition in the third quarter was largely offset by lower reinvestment yields on investment securities and other loans. The write-off of fees and capitalized loan origination costs from the early termination of leveraged leases was $13 million in both the second and third quarters of 2012.  Average earning assets for the third quarter of 2012, totaled $71.8 billion, compared to $72.3 billion for the third quarter of 2011. This slight decline was primarily due to decreases in our average available-for-sale securities, other investments and consumer other loans offset by increases in our average held-to-maturity securities, average commercial loans, home equity loans due and credit card loans.  As shown in Figure 8, the yield was impacted by the credit card acquisition and early termination of leveraged leases, which resulted in the write off of $13 million of capitalized loan origination costs.    90    Table of Contents Figure 8.

Noninterest income  Our noninterest income was $544 million for the third quarter of 2012, compared to $483 million for the year-ago quarter, an increase of $61 million, or 12.6%. Gains on leased equipment increased $39 million due primarily to early terminations in the leverage lease portfolio, net gains from loan sales increased by $21 million, investment banking and capital markets income increased by $13 million due primarily to increased equity originations income, other income increased $48 million due primarily to an increase in gains on the redemption of trust preferred securities as well as increases in various other items. These increases were partially offset by a $13 million decrease in operating lease income, a $15 million decline in electronic banking fees as a result of government pricing controls on debit transactions that went into effect on October 1, 2011, and a $23 million decrease from principal investing (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests).  For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, noninterest income increased $107 million, or 7.7%, from the same period one year ago. Gains on leased equipment increased $93 million due primarily to early terminations in the leveraged lease portfolio, net gains from loan sales increased $45 million, and other income increased $71 million due primarily to an increase in gains on the redemption of trust preferred securities. These increases were partially offset by a $38 million decrease in operating lease income, and a $42 million decline in electronic banking fees as a result of government pricing controls on debit transactions that went into effect on October 1, 2011 as well as a $13 million decrease in trust and investment services income and a $16 million decrease from principal investing (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests).    93    Table of Contents Figure 10.

The primary components of revenue generated by these services are shown in Figure 11. During the third quarter of 2012, income generated by these services remained essentially flat. For the nine months ended September 30, 2012, trust and investment services income decreased $13 million as compared to the same period one year ago due primarily to lower income from institutional asset management and custody fees.

At September 30, 2012, our bank, trust and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of $49.7 billion, compared to $51.6 billion at September 30, 2011. As shown in Figure 12, the decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in the securities lending and money market portfolios, partially offset from growth in equity and fixed income assets under management. The previously announced plan to liquidate the Victory Money Market Mutual Funds was completed in late April 2012. The assets in these funds were transferred back to Key in the form of non-time deposits, alternative investments, other Money Market Mutual Funds, or the assets were transferred back to the clients. Our securities lending business has been declining due to our de-emphasis of this business resulting in lower transaction volumes, client departures, and fewer assets under management. The liquidation of our portfolio of hedge funds is attributable to our second quarter 2009 decision to wind down the operations of Austin (results included in discontinued operations).  Figure 12.

Operating lease income  Operating lease income decreased $13 million, or 43.3%, for the third quarter of 2012 and decreased $38 million, or 39.2%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 in our Equipment Finance line of business due to product run-off. Accordingly, as shown in Figure 14, operating lease expense also declined.  Investment banking and capital markets income (loss)  As shown in Figure 13, income from investment banking and capital markets activities increased $13 million, or 52.0%, from the year ago quarter and $8 million, or 7.3%, from the nine-month period ended one year ago.  Investment banking income doubled compared to the year ago quarter due primarily to equity origination income, while it increased $10 million, or 14.9%, when compared to the nine-month period ended one year ago, due primarily to advisory fees.    95    Table of Contents Income from other investments decreased by $4 million from the year-ago quarter and decreased $7 million from the nine-month period ended one year ago due to fluctuations in asset sales made by our Funds Management Group.  Dealer trading and derivatives income increased $3 million from the year-ago quarter and increased $9 million from the nine-month period ended one year ago. The increase associated with proprietary activities is due primarily to volatility in fixed income sales, while the decrease in nonproprietary activities reflects volatility in fixed income trading as well as an increase in the provision for losses related to customer derivatives.  Foreign exchange income decreased by $2 million from the year-ago quarter and decreased $4 million from the nine-month period ended one year ago due to lower transaction volume.  Figure 13.

For the quarter ended September 30, 2012, income related to foreign exchange and interest rate derivative trading was less than $1 million and was offset by losses from Key’s credit portfolio management activities. For the quarter ended September 30, 2011, income related to foreign exchange and interest rate derivative trading was less than $2 million and was offset by losses from Key’s credit portfolio management activities.      (b) The allocation between proprietary and nonproprietary is made based upon whether the trade is conducted for the benefit of Key or Key’s clients rather than based upon the proposed rulemaking under the Volcker Rule. The prohibitions and restrictions on proprietary trading activities contemplated by the Volcker Rule and the rules proposed thereunder are not yet final. Therefore, the ultimate impact of the rules proposed under the Volcker Rule is not yet known.  Other income  Other income increased $48 million, or 85.7%, from the year-ago quarter and increased $71 million, or 62.3%, from the nine-month period ended one year ago due primarily to a $41 million increase in gains during the third quarter 2012, from the redemption of trust preferred securities as well as increases in various other items.  Noninterest expense  As shown in Figure 14, noninterest expense was $734 million for the third quarter of 2012, compared to $692 million for the year-ago quarter representing an increase of $42 million or 6.1%. The amount of this increase attributable to our acquisition of 37 branches in Western New York and our acquired credit card portfolio is $26 million spread across several expense categories. Increases in personnel expense of $29 million and other expense of $14 million were partially offset by a $10 million decrease in operating lease expense and a $7 million decrease in the provision (credit) for losses on lending-related commitments. Included in the current quarter is amortization of the intangible assets related to the credit card portfolio acquisition of $6 million and acquisition of 37 branches in Western New York of $2 million.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2012 noninterest expense increased $78 million, or 3.8%, compared to the same period a year ago. The amount of this increase attributable to our acquisition of 37 branches in Western New York and our acquired credit card portfolio is $30 million spread across several expense categories. Increases in personnel expense of $52 million, the provision (credit) for losses on lending-related comments of $15 million, and other expense of $25 million were partially offset by a $31 million decline in operating lease expense and a $22 million decrease in FDIC assessments. Business services and professional fees also increased $9 million, partially related to the company-wide efficiency initiatives. Marketing expense was $12 million higher partially due to the spring home equity loan campaign and the branch acquisition. Included in the nine months ended September 30, 2012 is amortization of the intangible asset related to the credit card portfolio acquisition of $6 million and acquisition of 37 branches in Western New York of $2 million.    96    Table of Contents Figure 14.

The following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest expense and the factors that caused those elements to change.  Personnel  As shown in Figure 15, personnel expense, the largest category of our noninterest expense, increased by $29 million, or 7.6%, when compared to the year-ago quarter and increased $52 million, or 4.6%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared to the same period a year ago due primarily to increased hiring of client-facing personnel, annual merit increases, our acquisition of 37 branches in Western New York, and higher levels of contract labor on technology initiatives. Incentive compensation increased $11 million, or 14.1%, when compared to the year-ago quarter, yet remained essentially flat for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared to the same period a year ago. A $6 million increase in stock-based compensation essentially offset a $5 million decrease in severance for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared to the same period a year ago.

Income related to the rental of leased equipment is presented in Figure 10 as “operating lease income.”  FDIC Assessment  FDIC insurance remained unchanged compared to the year-ago quarter and decreased $22 million in the first nine months of 2012 as compared to the same period a year ago, as a result of the change in the calculation method for deposit insurance assessments as discussed in the “Deposits and other sources of funds” section under the “The Dodd-Frank Act reform of deposit insurance” heading on page 70 of our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.    97    Table of Contents Other expense  Other expense is comprised of various miscellaneous expense items. The $14 million increase in the current quarter compared to the year-ago quarter and the $25 million increase in the nine months ended September 30, 2012, compared to the same period a year ago reflect fluctuations in several of those line items.  Income taxes  We recorded tax expense from continuing operations of $52 million for the third quarter of 2012, $57 million for the second quarter of 2012 and $95 million for the third quarter of 2011. For the first nine months of 2012, we recorded tax expense from continuing operations of $184 million, compared to tax expense of $300 million for the same period last year.  Our federal tax expense differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate, primarily because we generate income from investments in tax-advantaged assets, such as corporate-owned life insurance, earn credits associated with investments in low-income housing projects and make periodic adjustments to our tax reserves. In addition, during the third quarter and the first nine months of 2012, our effective tax rate was lower due to the early termination of certain leveraged leases that resulted in nontaxable gains pursuant to a prior settlement with the IRS.  Additional information pertaining to how our tax expense (benefit) and the resulting effective tax rates were derived is included in Note 12 (“Income Taxes”) on page 165 of our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in Note 10 (“Income Taxes”) of this report.    98    Table of Contents Line of Business Results  This section summarizes the financial performance and related strategic developments of our two major business segments (operating segments), Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. Note 16 (“Line of Business Results”) describes the products and services offered by each of these business segments, provides more detailed financial information pertaining to the segments and certain lines of business, and explains “Other Segments” and “Reconciling Items.”  Figure 16 summarizes the contribution made by each major business segment to our “taxable-equivalent revenue from continuing operations” and “income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Key” for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2012 and 2011.

The net loss for the third quarter of 2012 is attributable to additional provision expense for loan and lease losses related to the acquisitions completed and implementing the updated regulatory guidance on debts discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  Taxable-equivalent net interest income declined by $6 million, or 1.6%, from the third quarter of 2011. Average loans and leases grew 8.1% while average deposits increased 3.9% from one year ago. The branch and credit card portfolio acquisitions contributed $26 million to net interest income, $696 million to average loans and leases, and $1.6 billion to deposits. Given the prolonged low-rate environment, the value derived from deposits was less in the current period compared to the same period one year ago.  Noninterest income increased by $17 million, or 8.8%, from the year-ago quarter. Credit card fees and trust and investment services income each increased $6 million primarily due to the credit card portfolio and branch acquisitions. Miscellaneous income also increased $15 million primarily due to gains realized on the sale of certain tax credits. Net gains (losses) from loan sales were also $4 million higher. These increases in noninterest income were partially offset by a $15 million decline in electronic banking fees resulting from government pricing controls on debit transactions that went into effect October 1, 2011.    99    Table of Contents The provision for loan and lease losses increased by $81 million, or 207.7%, compared to the third quarter of 2011. The application of recently updated regulatory guidance related to debts discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy increased the provision $45 million, and the acquisition of the credit card portfolio and the loans associated with the branch acquisition increased the provision $32 million. Net loan charge-offs were $93 million for the third quarter of 2012, up $33 million from the same period one year ago, primarily due to the application of recently updated regulatory guidance discussed above.  Noninterest expense increased by $55 million, or 12%, from the year-ago quarter. Key’s third quarter 2012 branch and credit card portfolio acquisitions contributed $26 million to the increase in noninterest expense spread across several expense categories. Personnel expense was $13 million higher than one year ago. Amortization of the intangible assets associated with the third quarter 2012 acquisitions of the previously discussed credit card portfolio and the branches and internally-allocated support costs each increased $8 million, and other miscellaneous expenses also increased $21 million from the same period one year ago.

prior quarter      •    Average deposits up 22.1% from the prior year and 3.7% from the prior quarter  As shown in Figure 18, Key Corporate Bank recorded net income attributable to Key of $118 million for the third quarter of 2012, compared to net income attributable to Key of $123 million for the same period one year ago.    Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $10 million, or 5.8%, compared to the third quarter of 2011. Average earning assets increased $1.8 billion, or 9.7%, from the year-ago quarter, resulting in an increase in earning asset spread of $4 million. Average deposit balances increased $2.3 billion, or 22.1%, from one year ago, resulting in an increase in deposit spread of $6 million.  Noninterest income increased by $13 million, or 6.6%, from the third quarter of 2011. Net gains (losses) from loan sales increased $20 million, and investment banking and capital markets income increased $16 million. These improvements in noninterest income were partially offset by a decrease in operating lease income of $8 million as that portfolio continues to run down. Trust and investment services income also declined $6 million, and other miscellaneous income items decreased $8 million compared to the year-ago quarter.  The provision for loan and lease losses in the third quarter of 2012 was a credit of $3 million compared to a credit of $40 million for the same period one year ago. The portfolio’s asset quality continued to improve for the twelfth consecutive quarter. Net loan charge-offs in the third quarter of 2012 were $8 million compared to $22 million for the same period one year ago.  Noninterest expense decreased by $7 million, or 3.2%, from the third quarter of 2011. The provision (credit) for losses on lending-related commitments was a credit of $6 million compared to a charge of $1 million one year ago. Also contributing to the decline in noninterest expense were decreases in operating lease expense of $7 million and various other miscellaneous expenses of $6 million. These decreases in noninterest expense were partially offset by an increase in personnel expense of $13 million.  Figure 18.

Other Segments  Other Segments consist of Corporate Treasury, Key’s Principal Investing unit, and various exit portfolios. Other Segments generated net income attributable to Key of $102 million for the third quarter of 2012, compared to net income attributable to Key of $52 million for the same period last year. These results were primarily attributable to an increase in other income of $71 million due to a $54 million gain on the redemption of certain trust preferred securities and a $26 million net gain resulting from the early terminations of leveraged leases in the third quarter of 2012 (a $39 million gain on leased equipment less a $13 million charge for the write-off of capitalized loan origination costs). These results were partially offset by a decrease in net gains (losses) from principal investing of $23 million.    102    Table of Contents Financial Condition  Loans and loans held for sale  At September 30, 2012, total loans outstanding from continuing operations were $51.4 billion, compared to 49.6 billion at December 31, 2011 and $48.2 billion at September 30, 2011. Loans related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business, which are excluded from total loans at September 30, 2012, December 31, 2011, and September 30, 2011, totaled $5.3 billion, $5.8 billion, and $6.0 billion, respectively. The increase in our outstanding loans from continuing operations over the past twelve months results primarily from increased lending activity in our commercial, financial and agricultural portfolio along with the previously discussed credit card portfolio and branch acquisition. For more information on balance sheet carrying value, see Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the headings “Loans” and “Loans Held for Sale” on pages 116-117 of our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Commercial loan portfolio  Commercial loans outstanding were $35.5 billion at September 30, 2012, an increase of $2.3 billion, or 7.0%, compared to September 30, 2011.  Commercial, financial and agricultural. Our Commercial, Financial and Agricultural loans, also referred to as “Commercial and Industrial,” represent 42.7% of our total loan portfolio at September 30, 2012, 39.9% at December 31, 2011 and 37% at September 30, 2011 and are the largest component of our total loans. These loans are comprised of fixed and variable rate loans to our large, middle market and small business clients. These period end loans increased $4.1 billion or 23.1% from the same period one year ago. This growth in our commercial and industrial portfolio is primarily attributable to our clients in the manufacturing, technology and healthcare industries. We are experiencing growth in new high credit quality loan commitments, and utilization with clients in our middle market segment, and in our Institutional and Capital Markets business. Additionally, we are increasing loans to real estate investment trust (“REIT”) clients and Institutionally backed CRE Funds. REITs and Institutional CRE Funds effectively enable us to lend to entities that generally have more diverse cash flows, lower debt levels and better access to the capital markets than private owners or developers.  Commercial real estate loans. Our Commercial real estate (“CRE”) lending business is conducted through two primary sources: our 14-state banking franchise, and KeyBank Real Estate Capital, a national line of business that cultivates relationships with owners of CRE located both within and beyond the branch system. This line of business deals primarily with nonowner-occupied properties (generally properties for which at least 50% of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties) and accounted for approximately 54.3% of our average year-to-date commercial real estate loans, compared to 55.9% one year ago. KeyBank Real Estate Capital generally focuses on larger owners and operators of commercial real estate.  CRE loans represent 16.7% of our total loan portfolio at September 30, 2012 compared to 19.5% one year ago. These loans include both owner and nonowner occupied properties which at September 30, 2012 represented 24.2% of our commercial loan portfolio compared to 28.3% one year ago. These loans have decreased $818 million, or 8.7%, to $8.6 billion at September 30, 2012, from $9.4 billion at September 30, 2011. This decrease in our CRE portfolio has resulted from many of our clients taking advantage of historically low long-term interest rates to refinance their loans in the permanent loan market. We have also been de-risking the portfolio by changing our focus from developers to owners of completed and stabilized CRE.  Figure 19 includes commercial mortgage and construction loans in both Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. As shown in Figure 19, this loan portfolio is diversified by both property type and geographic location of the underlying collateral.  As shown in Figure 19, at September 30, 2012, our CRE portfolio included mortgage loans of $7.5 billion and construction loans of $1.1 billion, representing 14.6% and 2.1%, respectively, of our total loans. Nonowner-occupied loans represented 10.7% of our total loans and owner-occupied loans represented 6.0% of our total loans. The average size of mortgage loans originated during the third quarter of 2012 was $2.9 million, and our largest mortgage loan at September 30, 2012, had a balance of $73 million. At September 30, 2012, our average construction loan commitment was $3.8 million. Our largest construction loan commitment was $56.2 million, and our largest construction loan amount outstanding was $41.1 million.  Also shown in Figure 19, at September 30, 2012, 64.2% of our commercial real estate loans were for nonowner-occupied properties compared to 63.8% at September 30, 2011. Approximately 16.3% and 20.9% of these loans were construction    103    Table of Contents  loans at September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Typically, these properties are not fully leased at the origination of the loan. The borrower relies upon additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide the cash flow necessary to support debt service payments. A significant decline in economic growth, and in turn, rental rates and occupancy would adversely affect our portfolio of construction loans.  Figure 19.

Since September 30, 2011, our nonowner occupied commercial real estate portfolio has been reduced by approximately $494 million, or 8.2%, as many of our clients have taken advantage of opportunities to permanently refinance their loans at historically low interest rates.  If the economic recovery stalls, it may weaken the commercial real estate market fundamentals (i.e., vacancy rates, the stability of rental income and asset values), leading to reduced cash flow to support debt service payments. Reduced client cash flow would adversely affect our ability to collect such payments. Accordingly, the value of our commercial real estate loan portfolio could be adversely affected.  Commercial lease financing. We conduct commercial lease financing arrangements through our Key Equipment Finance line of business and have both the scale and array of products to compete in the equipment lease financing business. Commercial lease financing receivables represented 14% of commercial loans at September 30, 2012, and 17.9% at September 30, 2011.  Commercial loan modification and restructuring  Certain commercial loans are modified and extended in the normal course of business for our clients. Loan modifications vary and are handled on a case by case basis with strategies responsive to the specific circumstances of each loan and borrower. In many cases, borrowers have other resources and can reinforce the credit with additional capital, collateral, guarantees or income sources.  Modifications are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan credit quality while at the same time meeting our clients’ financing needs. Modifications made to loans of creditworthy borrowers not experiencing financial    104    Table of Contents  difficulties and under circumstances where ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt are not classified as TDRs. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, TDR classification occurs when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a creditor concession has been granted.  Our concession types are primarily categorized as interest rate reductions, principal deferral, or forgiveness of principal. Loan extensions are sometimes coupled with these primary concession types. As a result of modestly improving economic conditions combined with the restructuring of these loans to provide the optimal opportunity for successful repayment by the borrower, we have seen certain of our restructured loans returning to accrual status and consistent performance under the restructured loan terms for each primary type of concession over the past year.  In cases where the loan terms were extended at less than normal market rates for similar lending arrangements, we have transferred these loans to the Asset Recovery Group for resolution. During the first nine months of 2012, there were $192 million of new restructured loans included in nonperforming loans, of which $33 million related to commercial real estate.  For more information on concession types for our commercial accruing and nonaccruing TDRs, see Note 4 (“Asset Quality”).  Figure 20 quantifies restructured loans and TDRs. As of September 30, 2012, $38 million of secured loans discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower were reclassified as TDRs. Regardless of delinquency status, these loans were transferred at the collateral’s fair market value less selling costs, classified as nonaccrual, and are included in nonperforming loans.  Figure 20.

Right-sizing the A note to sustainable cash flow should ultimately allow for its return to accrual status and thereupon a resumption of interest income recognition. Similarly, appropriately-sized A notes will allow for upgraded credit classification based on rehabilitated credit metrics, including demonstrated payment performance. Other benefits include the borrower’s retention of ownership and control of the asset, deleveraged and sustainable capital structure (often sufficient to attract fresh capital into the transaction) and rehabilitation of local markets by minimizing distressed/fire sales.  We use an A-B note structure for our TDRs, breaking the existing loan into two tranches. First, we create an A note. As the objective of this TDR note structure is to achieve a fully performing and well-rated A note, we focus on sizing that note to a level that is supported by cash flow available to service debt at current market terms and consistent with our customary underwriting standards. This note structure will typically include a debt coverage ratio of 1.2 or better of cash flow to monthly payments of market interest, and principal amortization of generally not more than 25 years. (These metrics are adjusted from time to time based upon changes in long-term markets and take out underwriting standards of our various lines of business.) Appropriately sized A notes are more likely to return to accrual status, allowing us to resume recognizing interest income. As the borrower’s payment performance improves, these restructured notes also typically allow for upgraded internal quality risk rating classification. Moreover, as noted above, the borrower retains ownership and control of the underlying collateral (typically, commercial real estate), the borrower’s capital structure is strengthened (often to the point that fresh capital is attracted to the transaction), and local markets are spared distressed/fire sales.  The B note is typically an interest-only note with no required amortization until the property stabilizes and generates excess cash flow. This excess cash flow is customarily applied directly to the principal of the A note. We evaluate the B note when we consider returning the A note to accrual status. In many cases, the B note is charged off at the same time the A note is returned to accrual status. Alternatively, both A and B notes may be simultaneously returned to accrual if credit metrics are supportive.    105    Table of Contents Restructured nonaccrual loans may be returned to accrual status based on a current, well documented evaluation of the credit, which would include analysis of the borrower’s financial condition, prospects for repayment under the modified terms and/or alternate sources of repayment such as the value of loan collateral. Establishment of the borrower’s ability to sustain historical repayment performance would require a reasonable period (generally a minimum of six months) prior to the date on which the loan is returned to accrual status. Sustained historical repayment performance for a reasonable time prior to the restructuring may be taken into account. The primary consideration for returning a restructured loan to accrual status is the reasonable assurance that the full contractual principal balance of the loan along with ongoing contractually required interest payments can be expected to be fully repaid. Although our policy is a guideline, considerable judgment is required to review each borrower’s circumstances.  All loans processed as a TDR, including A notes and any non-charged-off B notes, are reported as TDRs during the calendar year in which the restructure took place.  Extensions. Certain commercial loans are modified and extended in the normal course of business for our clients. Project loans are typically refinanced into the permanent commercial loan market at maturity but are sometimes modified and extended, depending on the circumstances. Extension terms take into account the specific circumstances of the client relationship, the status of the project and near-term prospects for both the client and the collateral. In all cases, pricing and loan structure are reviewed and (where necessary) modified to ensure the loan has been priced to achieve a market rate of return and loan terms (i.e., amortization, covenants and term) that are appropriate for the risk. Typical enhancements include one or more of the following: principal paydown, increased amortization, additional collateral, increased guarantees, and/or a cash flow sweep. As previously mentioned, some maturing construction loans have automatic extension options built in and in those cases where the borrower qualifies for the extension option, pricing and loan terms cannot be altered. Most project loans by their nature are “collateral-dependent” as cash flow from the project loans or the sale of the real estate provides for repayment of the loan.  Pricing of a loan is determined based on the strength of the borrowing entity and the strength of the guarantor, if any. Therefore, pricing may remain the same (e.g., the loan is already priced at or above current market). We do not consider loan extensions in the normal course of business (under existing loan terms or at market rates) as TDRs, particularly when ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt and no concession has been made. In the case of loan extensions outside of the normal course of business—where either collection of all principal and interest is uncertain or a concession has been made—we would analyze such credit under the accounting guidance to determine whether it qualifies as a TDR. Extensions that qualify as TDRs are measured for impairment under the applicable accounting guidance.  Guarantors. A detailed guarantor analysis is conducted (1) for all new extensions of credit, (2) at the time of any material modification/extension, and (3) typically annually, as part of our on-going portfolio and loan monitoring procedures. This analysis includes submission by the guarantor entity of all appropriate financial statements, including balance sheets, income statements, tax returns, and real estate schedules.  While the specific steps of each guarantor analysis may have some minor differences, the high level objectives include reaching a conclusion regarding the overall financial conditions of the guarantor entities, including: size, quality, and nature of asset base; net worth (adjusted to reflect our opinion of market value); leverage; standing liquidity; recurring cash flow; contingent and direct debt obligations; and near term debt maturities.  Borrower and guarantor financial statements are required at least annually within 90-120 days of the calendar/fiscal year end. Income statements and rent rolls for project collateral are required quarterly. In some cases, disclosure of certain information including liquidity, certifications, status of asset sales or debt resolutions, and real estate schedules may be required more frequently.  We routinely seek performance from guarantors of impaired debt, if the guarantor is solvent. In limited circumstances, we would not seek to enforce the guaranty, including situations in which we are precluded by bankruptcy and/or it is determined the cost to pursue a guarantor exceeds the value to be returned given the guarantor’s verified financial condition. We are often successful in obtaining either monetary payment and/or the cooperation of our solvent guarantors to help mitigate loss, cost and the expense of collections.    106    Table of Contents As of September 30, 2012, we had $54 million of mortgage and construction loans that had a loan to value ratio greater than 1.0, and were accounted for as performing loans. These loans were not considered impaired due to one or more of the following factors: (i) underlying cash flow adequate to service the debt at a market rate of return with adequate amortization; (ii) a satisfactory borrower payment history; and (iii) acceptable guarantor support.  Consumer loan portfolio  Consumer loans outstanding increased by $908 million, or 6.1%, from one year ago. The home equity portfolio is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio. Approximately 96% of this portfolio at September 30, 2012 is derived from our Key Community Bank. The remainder of the portfolio, which has been in an exit mode since the fourth quarter of 2007, was originated from the Consumer Finance line of business and is now included in Other Segments. Home equity loans from our Key Community Bank increased by $421 million, or 4.5%, over the past twelve months as a result of our 2012 spring home equity loan campaign.  As shown in Figure 17, we hold the first lien position for approximately 54% of the Key Community Bank home equity portfolio at September 30, 2012 and 53% at September 30, 2011. For consumer loans with real estate collateral, we track borrower performance monthly. Credit metrics are refreshed quarterly, including recent Fair Isaac Corporation scores as well as original and updated loan to value ratio regardless of lien position. This information is used in establishing the ALLL. Our methodology is described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses” on page 117 of our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Regulatory guidance issued in January 2012 addressed specific risks and required actions within home equity portfolios associated with second lien loans. At September 30, 2012, 46% of our home equity portfolio is secured by second lien mortgages. Approximately $4.9 billion of second lien home equity loans were reviewed by a third party service to determine the payment status of the associated first lien. The resulting data identified approximately $36 million second lien home equity loans with an associated first lien that is 120 days or more past due; in foreclosure; or when the first mortgage delinquency timeframe is unknown. The classification of certain of these second liens as nonperforming loans did not have an impact on the ALLL in the third quarter of 2012 because, as noted above, we have previously considered the risk characteristics of this portfolio of loans in our loss estimation methodology. On at least a quarterly basis, we will continue to monitor the risk characteristics of these loans when determining the appropriateness of our loss estimation methods. This policy related to the classification of second lien home equity loans was implemented prospectively, and therefore prior periods were not presented.  In conjunction with this regulatory guidance, during the third quarter of 2012, home equity loans include $38 million of performing secured loans that were discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not formally re-affirmed.  Figure 21 summarizes our home equity loan portfolio by source at the end of each of the last five quarters, as well as certain asset quality statistics and yields on the portfolio as a whole.

Such loans have been designated as nonperforming and TDRs.      (c) From continuing operations.    107    Table of Contents Loans held for sale  As shown in Note 3 (“Loans and Loans Held for Sale”), our loans held for sale decreased to $628 million at September 30, 2012 from $728 million at December 31, 2011 and totaled $479 million at September 30, 2011. There were no loans held for sale related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business at September 30, 2012, December 31, 2011 and September 30, 2011.  At September 30, 2012, loans held for sale included $484 million of commercial mortgages, which increased by $159 million from September 30, 2011, and $117 million of residential mortgage loans, which increased $38 million from September 30, 2011.  Loan sales  As shown in Figure 22, during the first nine months of 2012, we sold $2.3 billion of commercial real estate loans, $1.3 billion of residential real estate loans, and $106 million of commercial loans. Most of these sales came from the held-for-sale portfolio.  Figure 22 summarizes our loan sales for the first nine months of 2012 and all of 2011.  Figure 22.

Additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in Note 12 (“Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) under the heading “Recourse agreement with FNMA.”  We derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold. We earn noninterest income (recorded as “other income”) from fees for servicing or administering loans. This fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets. In addition, we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing of commercial real estate loans.    108    Table of Contents Securities  Our securities portfolio totaled $16.1 billion at September 30, 2012, compared to $18.1 billion at December 31, 2011, and $18.8 billion at September 30, 2011. Available-for-sale securities were $12 billion at September 30, 2012, compared to $16 billion at December 31, 2011, reflecting the liquidity needs arising from changes in our loan and deposit balances and investments in held-to-maturity securities. Held-to-maturity securities were $4.1 billion at September 30, 2012, compared to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2011, primarily reflecting increases in agency mortgage-backed securities as we continue to prepare for potential future changes in regulatory capital rules. Essentially all of our held-to-maturity securities portfolio was invested in CMOs at September 30, 2012.  As shown in Figure 24, all of our mortgage-backed securities, which include both securities available for sale and held-to-maturity securities, are issued by government-sponsored enterprises or GNMA, and are traded in highly liquid secondary markets. These securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value for the available-for-sale portfolio and at cost for the held-to-maturity portfolio. For more information about these securities, see Note 5 (“Fair Value Measurements”) under the heading “Qualitative Disclosures of Valuation Techniques” and Note 6 (“Securities”).  Figure 24.

Securities available for sale  The majority of our securities available-for-sale portfolio consists of CMOs, which are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities. CMOs generate interest income and serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements. At September 30, 2012, we had $11.9 billion invested in CMOs and other mortgage-backed securities in the available-for-sale portfolio, compared to $15.9 billion at December 31, 2011, and $17.5 billion at September 30, 2011.  We periodically evaluate our securities available-for-sale portfolio in light of established A/LM objectives, changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio, and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. These evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning.  In addition, the size and composition of our securities available-for-sale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required (or elect) to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits. Although we generally use debt securities for this purpose, other assets, such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit, are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles.  During the third quarter of 2012, our investing activities continued to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs. For most of the first half of 2011, we chose not to reinvest the monthly security cash flows and also sold approximately $1.6 billion of CMOs. These actions provided the liquidity necessary to address the funding requirements arising from the loss of certain escrow deposit balances related to commercial mortgage securitizations serviced by Key and rated by Moody’s, and also contributed funds for our TARP repayment in March 2011.

(b) Excludes $5 million of securities at September 30, 2012, that have no stated yield.    110    Table of Contents Other investments  Principal investments — investments in equity and mezzanine instruments made by our Principal Investing unit — represented 60% of other investments at September 30, 2012. They include direct investments (investments made in a particular company) as well as indirect investments (investments made through funds that include other investors). Principal investments are predominantly made in privately held companies and are carried at fair value ($669 million at September 30, 2012, $709 million at December 31, 2011, and $759 million at September 30, 2011). During the first half of 2011, employees who managed our various principal investments formed two independent entities that now serve as investment managers of these investments. Under this arrangement, which was mutually agreeable to both parties, these individuals are no longer employees of Key. As a result of these changes, which were made during the second quarter of 2011, we deconsolidated certain of these direct and indirect investments, totaling $234 million.  In addition to principal investments, “other investments” include other equity and mezzanine instruments, such as certain real estate-related investments that are carried at fair value, as well as other types of investments that generally are carried at cost.  Most of our other investments are not traded on an active market. We determine the fair value at which these investments should be recorded based on the nature of the specific investment and all available relevant information. This review may encompass such factors as the issuer’s past financial performance and future potential, the values of public companies in comparable businesses, the risks associated with the particular business or investment type, current market conditions, the nature and duration of resale restrictions, the issuer’s payment history, our knowledge of the industry, third party data and other relevant factors. During the first nine months of 2012, net gains from our principal investing activities (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) totaled $70 million, which includes $21 million of net unrealized gains. These net gains are recorded as “net gains (losses) from principal investing” on the income statement. Additional information regarding these investments is provided in Note 5 (“Fair Value Measurements”).  Deposits and other sources of funds  Domestic deposits are our primary source of funding. During the third quarter of 2012, average domestic deposits were $62 billion and represented 86% of the funds we used to support loans and other earning assets, compared to $58.2 billion and 81% during the same quarter of 2011. The composition of our average deposits is shown in Figure 8 in the section entitled “Net interest income.”  The increase in average domestic deposits in the third quarter of 2012, compared to the third quarter of 2011, was due to the growth from demand deposits, as increases in interest-bearing liquid deposits were largely offset by declines in certificates of deposit ($100,000 or more) and other time deposits. The Western New York branch acquisition added approximately $1.6 billion of mostly non-time consumer deposits to the third quarter 2012 average balances.  Approximately $2.1 billion of our certificates of deposit outstanding at September 30, 2012, mature over the next quarter at a 1.50% average cost. Re-pricing opportunities will continue to benefit our net interest margin. Improved funding mix and previous maturities of our certificates of deposit have reduced the cost of total deposits, which is down from the third quarter of 2011.  Wholesale funds, consisting of deposits in our foreign office and short-term borrowings, averaged $2.9 billion during the third quarter of 2012, compared to $3 billion during the year-ago quarter. The change from the third quarter of 2011 resulted from a $9 million decrease in foreign office deposits and a $208 million decrease in bank notes and other short-term borrowings, which was partially offset by a $98 million increase in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase.    111    Table of Contents Capital  At September 30, 2012, our shareholders’ equity was $10.3 billion, up $346 million from December 31, 2011. The following sections discuss certain factors that contributed to this change. For other factors that contributed to the change, see the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity.  As previously reported, on January 1, 2010, we adopted new consolidation accounting guidance which required us to consolidate our education loan securitization trusts (classified as discontinued assets and liabilities). As a result, we consolidated our education loan securitization trusts and made a corresponding $45 million cumulative effect adjustment. That consolidation added $2.8 billion in discontinued assets, and the same amount of liabilities and equity to our balance sheet; loans constituted $2.6 billion of the assets. During the third quarter of 2011, we determined that the $45 million cumulative effect adjustment made related to the consolidation of these trusts on January 1, 2010 was incorrect. Further information regarding this error and its correction is provided in Note 11 (“Acquisitions and Discontinued Operations”).  CCAR and capital actions  As part of its ongoing supervisory process, the Federal Reserve requires a BHC to submit an annual comprehensive capital plan as well as to update such plan to reflect material changes in a firm’s risk profile, business strategies, or corporate structure, including but not limited to changes in planned capital actions. As previously reported, as authorized by our Board and pursuant to our 2012 capital plan submitted to the Federal Reserve as part of CCAR and not objected to by the Federal Reserve, beginning in the second quarter of 2012, KeyCorp had authority to repurchase up to $344 million of our Common Shares for general repurchase and repurchases in connection with employee elections under our compensation and benefit programs.  During the third quarter of 2012, we completed $82 million of Common Share repurchases. Following completion of these repurchases (as well as our Common Share repurchases during the second quarter of 2012), we have remaining authority to repurchase up to $177 million of our Common Shares for general repurchase and repurchases in connection with employee elections under our compensation and benefit programs. Our existing repurchase program does not have an expiration date. Common Share repurchases under the current authorization are expected to be executed through the first quarter of 2013.  As previously reported, our 2012 capital plan also included an increase in our quarterly Common Share dividend from $.03 to $.05 per share. At the regular July Board of Directors meeting, the Board declared a third-quarter cash dividend of $.05 per Common Share payable on September 14, 2012, to shareholders of record on August 28, 2012. Future dividends will be evaluated by the Board of Directors based upon our earnings, financial condition, and other factors, including regulatory review. Further information regarding the capital plan process and CCAR is included in the “Supervision and Regulation” section under the heading “Capital Assessment and Review of Capital Actions” beginning on page 8 of our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the Basel III NPR provide for the phase-out of Tier 1 capital treatment for capital securities beginning in 2013. As a result, our outstanding trust preferred securities will eventually become Tier 2 capital. The Supervision and Regulation section of this report contains more detailed information about the Basel III NPR.  On July 12, 2012, KeyCorp redeemed all of the enhanced trust preferred securities of KeyCorp Capital X in the amount of $568 million and all of the trust preferred securities of KeyCorp Capital VII in the amount of $139 million.  Repurchase of TARP CPP preferred stock, warrant and completion of equity and debt offerings  As previously reported during 2011, we completed the repurchase of the $2.5 billion of Series B Preferred Stock and corresponding warrant issued to the U.S. Treasury Department. As a result of the repurchase, we recorded a $49 million one-time deemed dividend in the first quarter of 2011 related to the remaining difference between the repurchase price and the carrying value of the preferred shares at the time of repurchase. On April 20, 2011 we repurchased the warrant directly from the U.S. Treasury for $70 million. Beginning with the second quarter of 2011, the repurchase resulted in the elimination of quarterly dividends of $31 million and discount amortization of $4 million, or $140 million on an annual basis, related to these preferred shares. In total, we paid $2.867 billion to the U.S. Treasury during the investment period in the form of dividends, principal and repurchase of the warrant, resulting in a return to the U.S. Treasury of $367 million above the initial investment of $2.5 billion on November 14, 2008.  Dividends  During the third quarter of 2012, we made a dividend payment of $.05 per share, or $47 million, on our Common Shares.    112    Table of Contents Also during the third quarter of 2012, we made a dividend payment of $1.9375 per share, or $5 million, on our Series A Preferred Stock.  Common shares outstanding  Our Common Shares are traded on the NYSE under the symbol KEY with 32,484 holders of record at September 30, 2012. At September 30, 2012 our book value per Common Share was $10.64 based on 936.2 million shares outstanding at September 30, 2012, compared to $10.09 based on 953.0 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2011, and $10.09 based on 952.8 million shares outstanding at September 30, 2011. At September 30, 2012 our tangible book value per Common Share was $9.54 compared to $9.11 at December 31, 2011, and $9.10 at September 30, 2011.  Figure 27 shows activities that caused the change in outstanding Common Shares over the past five quarters.  Figure 27.

At September 30, 2012, we had 80.8 million treasury shares, compared to 64.0 million treasury shares at December 31, 2011 and 64.2 million treasury shares at September 30, 2011. Going forward we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stock-based compensation awards and for other corporate purposes.  Information on KeyCorp’s Common Share repurchase program is included in Part II, Item 2. “Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds” of this report.  Capital adequacy  Capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance. All of our capital ratios remain in excess of regulatory requirements at September 30, 2012. Our capital and liquidity are intended to position us well to weather an adverse credit cycle while continuing to serve our clients’ needs, as well as to adjust to the regulations currently being proposed by the federal banking agencies to implement Basel III and provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Our shareholders’ equity to assets ratio was 11.79% at September 30, 2012, compared to 11.16% at December 31, 2011 and 11.09% at September 30, 2011. Our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 10.39% at September 30, 2012, compared to 9.88% at December 31, 2011 and 9.82% at September 30, 2011.  Banking industry regulators prescribe minimum capital ratios for BHCs and their banking subsidiaries. Risk-based capital guidelines require a minimum level of capital as a percent of “risk-weighted assets.” Risk-weighted assets consist of total assets plus certain off-balance sheet and market risk items, subject to adjustment for predefined credit risk factors. Currently, banks and BHCs must maintain, at a minimum, Tier 1 capital as a percent of risk-weighted assets of 4.00% and total capital as a percent of risk-weighted assets of 8.00%. As of September 30, 2012, our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and our total risk-based capital ratios were 12.10% and 15.17%, respectively, compared to 12.99% and 16.51%, respectively, at December 31, 2011 and 13.49% and 17.05%, respectively at September 30, 2011.  Another indicator of capital adequacy, the leverage ratio, is defined as Tier 1 capital as a percentage of average quarterly tangible assets. BHCs that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the Federal Reserve’s risk-adjusted measure for market risk — as we have — must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 3.00%. All other bank holding companies must maintain a minimum ratio of 4.00%. As of September 30, 2012, our leverage ratio was 11.37% compared to 11.79% at December 31, 2011 and 11.93% at September 30, 2011.  The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to BHCs by requiring regulators to create rules phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities as eligible Tier 1 risk-based    113    Table of Contents  capital. Under the Basel III NPR, this three year phase-out period, which commences January 1, 2013, will ultimately result in our trust preferred securities issued by the KeyCorp capital trusts being treated only as Tier 2 capital. These changes in effect apply the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to depository institutions to BHCs, savings and loan holding companies, and nonbank financial companies identified as systemically important. The Supervision and Regulation section of this report contains more detailed information about the Basel III NPR.  As of September 30, 2012, our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, leverage ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio were 12.10%, 11.37%, and 15.17%, respectively. The trust preferred securities issued by the KeyCorp capital trusts contribute $339 million or 43, 40, and 43 basis points to our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio, respectively, as of September 30, 2012. Figure 4 set forth under the New Minimum Capital Requirements heading of the Supervision and Regulation section of this report discloses the proposed new minimum capital ratios together with the estimated capital ratios of Key at September 30, 2012, calculated on a fully phased-in basis under the Basel III and Standardized Approach NPRs.  Federal bank regulators group FDIC-insured depository institutions into five categories, ranging from “well-capitalized” to “critically undercapitalized.” A “well-capitalized” institution must meet or exceed the prescribed threshold ratios of 6.00% for Tier 1 risk-based capital, 5.00% for Tier 1 leverage capital, and 10.00% for total risk-based capital and must not be subject to any written agreement, order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. If these provisions applied to BHCs, we believe we would qualify as “well-capitalized” at September 30, 2012, and since that date, we believe there has not been any change in condition or event that would cause a change in capital category. Analysis on an estimated basis, accounting for the phase-out of our trust preferred securities as Tier 1 eligible (and therefore as Tier 2 instead) as of September 30, 2012, also determines that we would qualify as “well-capitalized” under current regulatory guidelines (Basel I), with the estimated Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, estimated leverage ratio, and estimated total risk-based capital ratio being 11.67%, 10.97%, and 15.17%, respectively. Figure 5 set forth under the Revised Prompt Corrective Action Standards heading of the Supervision and Regulation section of this report discloses the proposed new threshold capital ratios for a well capitalized and an adequately capitalized institution. The regulatory defined capital categories serve a limited supervisory function. Investors should not use our estimated ratios as a representation of our overall financial condition or prospects of KeyCorp. A discussion of the regulatory capital standards and other related capital adequacy regulatory standards is included in “Item 1. Business” in the “Supervision and Regulation” section under the heading “Capital” beginning on page 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and BHC capital adequacy based on both the amount and composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. As a result of the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has intensified its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 risk-based capital, known as Tier 1 common equity, and its review of the consolidated capitalization of systemically important financial companies, including KeyCorp. The capital modifications mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act and set forth in Basel III, which the Federal banking agencies have recently proposed to implement, are consistent with the renewed focus on Tier 1 common equity and the consolidated capitalization of banks, BHCs, and covered nonbank financial companies, which resulted from the financial crisis. Tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by GAAP nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations, this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. Figure 7 in the “Highlights of Our Performance” section reconciles Key shareholders’ equity, the GAAP performance measure, to Tier 1 common equity, the corresponding non-GAAP measure. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio was 11.30% at September 30, 2012, compared to 11.26% at December 31, 2011 and 11.28% at September 30, 2011.  Generally, for risk-based capital purposes, deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income are limited to the lesser of: (i) the amount of deferred tax assets that a financial institution expects to realize within one year of the calendar quarter-end date, based on its projected future taxable income for the year, or (ii) 10% of the amount of an institution’s Tier 1 capital. As we anticipated, at September 30, 2012, December 31, 2011, and September 30, 2011, we had no net deferred tax assets deducted from Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets. At September 30, 2012, on all Key’s consolidated operations we had a federal net deferred tax asset of $41 million and a state deferred tax liability of $29 million compared to a federal deferred tax asset of $60 million and a state deferred tax liability of $24 million at December 31, 2011, and federal net deferred tax asset of $62 million and a state deferred tax liability of $29 million at September 30, 2011.  Basel III  A detailed discussion of current rulemaking underway in the U.S. to implement Basel III is in the “Supervision and Regulation” discussion of this report. Figure 4 set forth under the New Minimum Capital Requirements heading of the Supervision and Regulation section of this report discloses the proposed new minimum capital ratios together with the    114    Table of Contents  estimated capital ratios of Key at September 30, 2012, calculated on a fully phased-in basis under the Basel III and Standardized Approach NPRs. Given our strong capital position, we expect to be able to satisfy the Basel III capital framework when U.S. capital regulations corresponding to it are finalized. While we also have a strong liquidity position, the Basel III liquidity framework could require us and other U.S. banks to initiate additional liquidity management initiatives, including adding additional liquid assets, issuing term debt, and modifying our product pricing for loans, commitments, and deposits.  Figure 28 represents the details of our regulatory capital position at September 30, 2012, December 31, 2011, and September 30, 2011 under the existing Basel I standards.  Figure 28.

The most significant risks we face are credit, liquidity, market, compliance, operational, strategic, and reputation risks. We must properly and effectively identify, assess, measure, monitor, control, and report such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness, and maximize profitability. Certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section.  Our ERM Committee, which consists of the Chief Executive Officer and other Senior Executives, is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite. The ERM Program encompasses our risk philosophy, policy, framework and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company. The ERM Committee reports to the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors. Annually, the Board of Directors reviews and approves the ERM Program, as well as the risk appetite and corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories. We use a risk-adjusted capital framework to manage risks. This framework is approved and managed by the ERM Committee.  Our Board of Directors serves in an oversight capacity with the objective of managing our enterprise-wide risks in a manner that is effective, balanced, and adds value for the shareholders. The Board inquires about risk practices, reviews the portfolio of risks, compares actual risks to the risk appetite and tolerances, and receives regular reports about significant risks — both actual and emerging. To assist in these efforts, the Board has delegated primary oversight responsibility for risk to the Audit Committee and the Risk Committee.  The Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for internal audit; financial reporting; compliance risk and legal matters; the implementation, management and evaluation of operational risk and controls; information security; and fraud risk. The Audit Committee also is responsible for evaluating the qualifications and independence of the independent auditors. The Audit Committee discusses policies related to risk assessment and risk management and the processes related to risk review and compliance.  The Risk Committee has responsibility for overseeing the management of credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk, including the actions taken to mitigate these risks, as well as reputational and strategic risks. The Risk Committee also oversees the maintenance of appropriate regulatory and economic capital, reviews the ERM reports, and approves any material changes to the charter of the ERM Committee.  The Audit and Risk Committees meet jointly, as appropriate, to discuss matters that relate to each committee’s responsibilities. In addition to regularly scheduled bi-monthly meetings, the Audit Committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases. Committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting. All members of the Board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months.  Federal banking regulators are reemphasizing with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution. We believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks, and comport with regulatory expectations.    116    Table of Contents Market risk management  The cash flows and values of financial instruments change as a function of changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, and other market factors that influence prospective yields, values, or prices associated with the instrument. For example, the value of a fixed-rate bond will decline if market interest rates increase, while the cash flows associated with a variable rate loan will increase when interest rates increase. The holder of a financial instrument is exposed to “market risk” when the cash flows or value of the instrument is tied to such external factors. Most of our market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations.  Interest rate risk management  Interest rate risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the EVE. Such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates, and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. We manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the EVE in accordance with our risk appetite, and within policy limits established by the ERM Committee.  Interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of consumer preferences for loan and deposit products, economic conditions, the competitive environment within our markets and changes in market interest rates that affect client activity and our hedging, investing, funding and capital positions. The primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of gap risk, basis risk, yield curve risk and option risk.      ¿ “Gap risk” is the exposure to changes in interest rates and occurs when the volume of interest-bearing liabilities and the volume of interest-earning assets they fund (for example, deposits used to fund loans) do not mature or reprice at the same time      ¿ “Basis risk” is the exposure to asymmetrical changes in interest rate indexes and occurs when floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities reprice at the same time, but in response to different market factors or indices.      ¿ “Yield curve risk” is the exposure to non-parallel changes in the slope of the yield curve (where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity) and occurs when interest-bearing liabilities and the interest-earning assets they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve.      ¿ “Option risk” is the exposure to a customer or counterparty’s ability to take advantage of the interest rate environment and terminate or reprice one of our assets, liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments prior to contractual maturity without a penalty. Option risk occurs when exposures to customer and counterparty early withdrawals or early prepayments are not mitigated with an offsetting position or appropriate compensation.  Net interest income simulation analysis. The primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis. For purposes of this analysis, we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on- and off-balance sheet positions accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity. The analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments, including a most likely macro economic scenario. Simulation modeling assumes that residual risk exposures will be managed to within the risk appetite.  Typically, the amount of net interest income at risk is measured by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if the federal funds target rate were to gradually increase or decrease by 200 basis points over the next twelve months, and term rates were to move in a similar fashion. In light of the low interest rate environment, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, we modified the standard rate scenario of a gradual decrease of 200 basis points over twelve months to a gradual decrease of 25 basis points over two months with no change over the following ten months. After calculating the amount of net interest income at risk to interest rate changes, we compare that amount with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment. We also perform regular stress tests and sensitivities on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments. One set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of interest rate inputs on simulated exposures. Assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve, including a sustained flat yield curve, an inverted slope yield curve, changes in credit spreads, an immediate parallel change in market interest rates and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates. Another set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of loan and deposit assumptions and assumed discretionary strategies on simulated exposures. Assessments are performed on changes to the following assumptions: the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities, changes in lending spreads, prepayments on loans and securities, other loan and deposit balance shifts, investment, funding and hedging activities, and liquidity and capital management strategies.    117    Table of Contents Simulation analysis produces only a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on judgments related to assumption inputs into the simulation model. We tailor assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled, and validate those assumptions on a regular basis. Our simulations are performed with the assumption that interest rate risk positions will be actively managed through the use of on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments to achieve the desired residual risk profile. However, actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition, customer behavior, product pricing, market interest rates, investment, funding and hedging activities, and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events. Figure 29 presents the results of the simulation analysis at September 30, 2012 and 2011. At September 30, 2012, our simulated exposure to a change in short-term interest rates was moderately asset sensitive. ALCO policy limits for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual increase or decrease in short-term interest rates over the next twelve months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 4%. As shown in Figure 29, we are operating within these limits.  Figure 29. Simulated Change in Net Interest Income                 September 30, 2012                   Basis point change assumption (short-term rates)     -25       +200     ALCO policy limits     -4.00  %      -4.00   %          Interest rate risk assessment     -.85  %      1.39   %              September 30, 2011                   Basis point change assumption (short-term rates)     -25        +200     ALCO policy limits     -4.00  %      -4.00   %          Interest rate risk assessment     -.65  %      2.67   %         The Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee has indicated it anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2015. We continued to execute investment and hedging activities to migrate toward a more modest asset-sensitive position. Hedging activities reflect the changes in the growth, mix, and maturity of customer deposits. Our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume, mix, maturity and re-pricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows. As changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy, management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile. The results of additional simulation analyses that make use of alternative interest rate paths and customer behavior assumptions indicate that net interest income improvement in a rising rate environment could be diminished, and actual results may be different than the policy simulation results in Figure 29. Net interest income improvements are highly dependent on the timing, magnitude, frequency and path of interest rate increases and assumption inputs for deposit repricing relationships, lending spreads and the balance behavior of transaction accounts.  We also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a three-year horizon. These simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a twelve-month horizon. To capture longer-term exposures, we calculate exposures to changes to the EVE as discussed in the following section.  Economic value of equity modeling. EVE complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond twelve-, twenty-four and thirty-six month horizons. EVE modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates, and measuring the resulting change in the values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments and comparing those amounts with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment. Because the calculation of EVE under an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest rates in the current low rate environment results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than 200 basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points, we have modified the standard declining rate scenario to an immediate 100 basis point decrease. This analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities. Those assumptions are based on historical behaviors, as well as our expectations. We develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our EVE will decrease by more than 15% in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates. We are operating within these guidelines.    118    Table of Contents Management of interest rate exposure. We use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate A/LM strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures. Specifically, we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities, issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates, and using derivatives — predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps, which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities.  Figure 30 shows all swap positions that we hold for A/LM purposes. These positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. For example, fixed-rate debt is converted to a floating rate through a “receive fixed/pay variable” interest rate swap. The volume, maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader A/LM objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile, see Note 7 (“Derivatives and Hedging Activities”).  Figure 30.

(b)  Excludes accrued interest of $38 million and $42 million for September 30, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  Derivatives not designated in hedge relationships  Our derivatives that are not designated in hedge relationships are described in Note 7 (“Derivatives and Hedging Activities”). We use a VAR simulation model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and credit spreads on the fair value of this portfolio. Using two years of historical information, the model estimates the maximum potential one-day loss with a 95% confidence level. Statistically, this means that losses will exceed VAR, on average, five out of 100 trading days, or three to four times each quarter.  We manage exposure to market risk in accordance with VAR limits for trading activity that have been approved by our Market Risk Committee as part of our ERM Program. At September 30, 2012, the aggregate one-day trading limit set by the committee was $6.2 million. We are operating within these constraints. During the first nine months of 2012, our aggregate daily average, minimum and maximum VAR amounts were $1.1 million, $.9 million and $1.4 million, respectively. During the same period one year ago, our aggregate daily average, minimum and maximum VAR amounts were $1.4 million, $1 million and $2 million, respectively.  In addition to comparing VAR exposure against limits on a daily basis, we monitor loss limits, use sensitivity measures and conduct stress tests. We report our market risk exposure to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.  Liquidity risk management  We define “liquidity” as the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences. Liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions.  Governance structure  We manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis. This approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity, as well as each entity’s capacity to manage through adverse conditions. The approach also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding.    119    Table of Contents Oversight of the liquidity risk management process is governed by the Risk Committee of the KeyCorp Board of Directors, the KeyBank Board of Directors, the ERM Committee and the ALCO. These groups regularly review various liquidity reports, including liquidity and funding summaries, liquidity trends, peer comparisons, variance analyses, liquidity projections, hypothetical funding erosion stress tests and goal tracking reports. The reviews generate a discussion of positions, trends and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of the decisions that we make. When liquidity pressure is elevated, positions are monitored more closely and reporting is more intensive. We communicate with individuals within and outside of the company on a daily basis to discuss emerging issues. In addition, we use a variety of daily liquidity reports to monitor the flow of funds.  Factors affecting liquidity  Our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events. An example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency. Examples of indirect events (events unrelated to us) that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war, natural disasters, political events, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund or hedge fund. Similarly, market speculation, or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources.  On March 8, 2012, Fitch (a credit rating agency that rates KeyCorp and KeyBank debt securities) downgraded KeyCorp’s Series A Preferred Stock to BB and KeyCorp’s trust preferred securities to BB+. These rating downgrades were a result of Fitch’s change in its rating criteria applicable to these types of securities issued by bank and BHCs. A variety of financial institutions’ securities ratings have been similarly affected by Fitch’s ratings criteria change.  During the first quarter of 2011, Moody’s (a credit rating agency that rates KeyCorp and KeyBank debt securities) indicated to KeyBank that certain escrow deposits associated with our mortgage servicing operations had to be moved to another financial institution that meets Moody’s minimum ratings threshold. As a result of this decision by Moody’s, on March 7, 2011, KeyBank transferred approximately $1.5 billion of these escrow deposit balances to an acceptably-rated institution, which resulted in an immaterial impairment of the related mortgage servicing assets. KeyBank had ample liquidity reserves to offset the loss of these deposits.  Our credit ratings at September 30, 2012, are shown in Figure 31. We believe that these credit ratings, under normal conditions in the capital markets, will enable the parent company or KeyBank to issue fixed income securities to investors.  Figure 31.

In the normal course of business, we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both KeyCorp and KeyBank. In a “heightened monitoring mode,” we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently, and use assumptions so the stress tests are more strenuous and reflect the changed market environment. Our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies. Erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods. Ultimately, they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations. To compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures, we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed.    120    Table of Contents At September 30, 2012, we have no secured borrowings outstanding. However, we retain the capacity to utilize secured borrowings as a contingent funding source.  We maintain a Contingency Funding Plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis. The Plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions. It also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for managing liquidity through a problem period. As part of the Plan, we maintain a liquidity reserve through balances in our liquid asset portfolio. During a problem period, that reserve could be used as a source of funding to provide time to develop and execute a longer-term strategy. The liquid asset portfolio at September 30, 2012, totaled $8.6 billion, consisting of $5.6 billion of unpledged securities, $1.5 billion of securities available for secured funding at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and $1.5 billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our Federal Reserve account. The liquid asset portfolio can fluctuate over time due to excess liquidity, heightened risk, or prefunding of expected outflows, such as debt maturities. Additionally, as of September 30, 2012, our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was $13.6 billion at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and $5.3 billion at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati.  Long-term liquidity strategy  Our long-term liquidity strategy is to be predominantly funded by core deposits. However, wholesale funds may be used to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio, meet daily cash demands, and allow management flexibility to execute business initiatives. Key’s client-based relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base which, in conjunction with intermediate and long-term wholesale funds managed to a diversified maturity structure and investor base, supports our liquidity risk management strategy. We use the loan to deposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies. Our target loan to deposit ratio is 90-100% (at September 30, 2012 our loan to deposit ratio was 86%), which we calculate as total loans, loans held for sale, and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by domestic deposits.  Sources of liquidity  Our primary sources of liquidity include customer deposits, wholesale funding and liquid assets. If the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances, we rely on wholesale funding or liquid assets. Conversely, excess cash generated by operating, investing and deposit-gathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets.   Liquidity programs  We have several liquidity programs, which are described in Note 15 (“Long-Term Debt”) on page 173 of our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K, that enable the parent company and KeyBank to raise funds in the public and private markets when the capital markets are functioning normally. The proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. Each of the programs is replaced or renewed as needed. There are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs.  In August 2012, KeyBank updated its $20 billion Global Bank Note Program. This program is similar to other existing KeyBank debt programs and allows KeyBank to issue notes with original maturities of seven days or more for senior notes or five years or more for subordinated notes. Each note will be the sole obligation of KeyBank.  During the third quarter of 2012, Key reduced its debt by $1.4 billion. Maturities of $350 million in medium term notes and $300 million in subordinated notes occurred for KeyBank, while KeyCorp undertook an early pay off of subordinated debt totaling $712 million, whereby $707 million represented redeemed trust preferred securities.  Liquidity for KeyCorp  The parent company has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt; support customary corporate operations and activities (including acquisitions) and occasional guarantees of subsidiaries’ obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences; and pay dividends to shareholders.  Our primary tools for assessing parent company liquidity are the net cash position, which measures the ability to fund debt maturing in 24 months or less with existing liquid assets, and a cash coverage metric, which measures the ability to meet all projected obligations. Another key measure of parent company liquidity is the “liquidity gap,” which represents the difference between projected liquid assets and anticipated financial obligations over several time horizons. We generally rely upon the issuance of term debt to manage our liquidity position within targeted ranges. The parent company generally maintains cash and short-term investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over the next 24 months.    121    Table of Contents At September 30, 2012, KeyCorp held $2 billion in short-term investments, which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations, including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our policies.  Typically, the parent company meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from KeyBank. Federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval. A national bank’s dividend-paying capacity is affected by several factors, including net profits (as defined by statute) for the two previous calendar years and for the current year, up to the date of dividend declaration. During the first nine months of 2012, KeyBank paid the parent $1.4 billion in dividends, while nonbank subsidiaries did not make any dividend payments to the parent. During the first nine months of 2012, the parent did not make any capital infusions to KeyBank. Based upon existing regulatory guidance, KeyBank has capacity to pay $628 million in dividends to KeyCorp at September 30, 2012.  During the first quarter of 2011, KeyCorp completed a $625 million equity offering at a price of $8.85 per Common Share. In conjunction with the equity offering, KeyCorp issued $1 billion, 5.1% Senior Medium-Term Notes, Series I, during the first quarter of 2011. The proceeds from the sale of Common Shares and medium-term notes were used, along with other available funds, to repurchase the Series B Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury. The repurchase eliminated future quarterly dividends of $31 million and discount amortization (non-cash) of $4 million, or $140 million on an annual basis, related to these preferred shares.  Our liquidity position and recent activity  Over the past twelve months our liquid asset portfolio, which includes overnight and short-term investments, as well as unencumbered, high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios, has decreased as a result of trust preferred securities redemptions and net customer loan and deposit flows. However, the liquid asset portfolio still continues to exceed the amount we estimate would be necessary to manage through a liquidity event. Liquidity stress scenarios include the loss of access to either unsecured or secured funding sources, as well as draws on unfunded commitments and significant deposit withdrawals.  From time to time, KeyCorp or its principal subsidiary, KeyBank, may seek to retire, repurchase or exchange outstanding debt, capital securities, preferred shares or Common Shares through cash purchase, privately negotiated transactions or other means. We have periodically repurchased Common Shares in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions under a repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors. Additional information on KeyCorp’s Common Share repurchase program is included in Part II, Item 2. “Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities or Use of Proceeds” of this report. Such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity and capital requirements, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and other factors. The amounts involved may be material, individually or collectively.  We generate cash flows from operations, and from investing and financing activities. We have approximately $241 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in international tax jurisdictions as of September 30, 2012. As we consider alternative long-term strategic and liquidity plans, opportunities to repatriate these amounts would result in approximately $29 million in taxes to be paid. If we were to cease operations in all international tax jurisdictions, the total amount of taxes to be paid would increase to approximately $52 million. Accordingly, we have included the total amount as a deferred tax liability at September 30, 2012.  The consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2012, and 2011.   Credit risk management  Credit risk is the risk of loss to us arising from an obligor’s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms. Like other financial services institutions, we make loans, extend credit, purchase securities and enter into financial derivative contracts, all of which have related credit risk.  Credit policy, approval and evaluation  We manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program. The Credit Risk Committee approves both retail and commercial credit policies. These policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit.  Our credit risk management team is responsible for credit approval, is independent of our lines of business, and consists of senior officers who have extensive experience in structuring and approving loans. Only credit risk management members are    122    Table of Contents  authorized to grant significant exceptions to credit policies. It is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate but most major lending units have been assigned specific thresholds to keep exceptions at a manageable level.  Loan grades are assigned at the time of origination, verified by the credit risk management team and periodically reevaluated thereafter. Most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or scoring. This risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling. Commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings. The first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation; the second rating reflects expected recovery rates on the credit facility. Default probability is determined based on, among other factors, the financial strength of the borrower, an assessment of the borrower’s management, the borrower’s competitive position within its industry sector, and our view of industry risk within the context of the general economic outlook. Types of exposure, transaction structure and collateral, including credit risk mitigants, affect the expected recovery assessment.  Our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans. These models, known as scorecards, forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant. The scorecards are embedded in the application processing system, which allows for real-time scoring and automated decisions for many of our products. We periodically validate the loan grading and scoring processes.  We maintain an active concentration management program to encourage diversification in our credit portfolios. For individual obligors, we employ a sliding scale of exposure, known as hold limits, which is dictated by the strength of the borrower. Our legal lending limit is approximately $2 billion for any individual borrower. However, internal hold limits generally restrict the largest exposures to less than 20% of that amount. As of September 30, 2012, we had five client relationships with loan commitments net of credit default swaps of more than $200 million. The average amount outstanding on these five individual net obligor commitments was $68 million at September 30, 2012. In general, our philosophy is to maintain a diverse portfolio with regard to credit exposures.  We actively manage the overall loan portfolio in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives, including the use of credit derivatives — primarily credit default swaps — to mitigate credit risk. Credit default swaps enable us to transfer a portion of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit to a third party. At September 30, 2012, we used credit default swaps with a notional amount of $701 million to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending obligations. We also sell credit derivatives — primarily index credit default swaps — to diversify and manage portfolio concentration and correlation risks. At September 30, 2012, the notional amount of credit default swaps sold by us for the purpose of diversifying our credit exposure was $466 million.  Credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Related gains or losses, as well as the premium paid or received for credit protection, are included in the trading income component of noninterest income.  We also manage the loan portfolio using portfolio swaps and bulk purchases and sales. Our overarching goal is to manage the loan portfolio within a specified range of asset quality.  Allowance for loan and lease losses  At September 30, 2012, the ALLL was $888 million, or 1.73% of loans, compared to $1.1 billion, or 2.35%, at September 30, 2011. The allowance includes $39 million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of $428 million at September 30, 2012, compared to $44 million that was allocated for impaired loans of $441 million one year ago. For more information about impaired loans, see Note 4 (“Asset Quality”). At September 30, 2012, the allowance for loan and lease losses was 135.99% of nonperforming loans, compared to 143.53% at September 30, 2011.  Selected asset quality statistics for each of the past five years are presented in Figure 32. The factors that drive these statistics are discussed in the remainder of this section.    123    Table of Contents Figure 32.

(b) September 30, 2012 excludes $25 million of PCI loans acquired in July 2012.  We estimate the appropriate level of the ALLL on at least a quarterly basis. The methodology used is described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses” on page 117 of our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Briefly, we apply expected loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions, changes in credit policies or underwriting standards, and changes in the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets.  For all commercial and consumer TDRs, regardless of size, as well as impaired commercial loans with an outstanding balance greater than $2.5 million, we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss content and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate. We estimate the extent of impairment by comparing the recorded investment of the loan with the estimated present value of its expected cash flows, the fair value of its underlying collateral or the loan’s observable market price. A specific allowance also may be assigned — even when sources of repayment appear sufficient — if we remain uncertain about whether the loan will be repaid in full. On at least a quarterly basis, we evaluate the appropriateness of our loss estimation methods to reduce differences between estimated incurred losses and actual losses. The ALLL at September 30, 2012, represents our best estimate of the probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date.  As shown in Figure 33, our ALLL decreased by $243 million, or 21.5%, during the past twelve months. This contraction was associated with the improvement in credit quality of the loan portfolio, which has trended more favorably over the past twelve months. Asset quality is improving and has resulted in favorable risk rating migration and a reduction in our general allowance. Our delinquency trends continue to decline while our roll rates keep improving. We attribute this improvement to a more moderate level of economic activity, more favorable conditions in the capital markets, improvement in client income statements and continued run off in our exit loan portfolio. Our liability for credit losses on lending-related commitments decreased by $13 million to $43 million at September 30, 2012, compared to the same period one year ago. When combined with our allowance for loan and lease losses, our total allowance for credit losses represented 1.81% of loans at the end of the third quarter of 2012 compared to 2.46% at the end of the third quarter of 2011. We expect the allowance to decrease as a percent of total loans during the fourth quarter of 2012 as a result of the continued improvement in credit quality that is anticipated.    124    Table of Contents Figure 33.

Our provision for loan and lease losses was a provision of $109 million for the third quarter of 2012, compared to a provision of $10 million for the year-ago quarter. Our net loan and lease charge-offs were $109 million for the third quarter of 2012 which was the same amount as the net charge-offs in the same quarter one year ago. Our net charge-offs for the third quarter of 2012 included $45 million of charge-offs reported in accordance with updated regulatory guidance requiring loans discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower to be charged-off to the collateral’s fair market value less selling costs and classified and leases as nonaccrual regardless of their delinquency. Additionally, we continue to work our exit loans and leases, and reduce exposure in our higher-risk businesses including the residential properties portion of our construction loan portfolio, Marine/RV financing, and other selected leasing portfolios through the sale of certain loans, payments from borrowers or net charge-offs.    125    Table of Contents Net loan charge-offs  Net loan charge-offs for the third quarter of 2012 totaled $109 million, or .86% of average loans, including $45 million (.35% of average loans) of incremental net loan charge-offs reported in accordance with updated regulatory guidance requiring loans discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower to be charged off to the collateral’s fair market value less selling costs and classified as nonaccrual regardless of their delinquency status. The current period net loan charge-offs compare to $109 million, or .90% net charge-offs to average loans for the same period last year. Figure 34 shows the trend in our net loan charge-offs by loan type, while the composition of loan charge-offs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in Figure 35.  Compared to the second quarter of 2012, net loan charge-offs increased $32 million. As shown in Figure 37, our exit loan portfolio accounted for $6 million, or 5.5%, of total net loan charge-offs for the third quarter of 2012. Net charge-offs in the exit loan portfolio decreased by $13 million from the second quarter of 2012 due to decreases in the commercial and consumer loan portfolios.  Figure 34.

(b) Restructured loans (i.e., TDRs) are those for which Key, for reasons related to a borrower’s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. These concessions are made to improve the collectability of the loan and generally take the form of a reduction of the interest rate, extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance.  As shown in Figure 36, nonperforming assets decreased during the third quarter of 2012, which represents the twelfth consecutive quarterly decline. Most of the reduction came from nonperforming loans held for sale and OREO sales in the Real Estate Capital line of business. As shown in Figure 37, our exit loan portfolio accounted for $77 million, or 10.7%, of our total nonperforming assets at September 30, 2012, compared to $75 million, or 10%, at June 30, 2012.  At September 30, 2012, the carrying amount of our commercial nonperforming loans outstanding represented 59% of their contractual amount owed, and total nonperforming loans outstanding represented 70% of their contractual amount owed and nonperforming assets in total were carried at 67% of their original contractual amount.  At September 30, 2012, our 20 largest nonperforming loans totaled $202 million, representing 31% of total nonperforming loans.  Figure 37 shows the composition of our exit loan portfolio at September 30, 2012 and June 30, 2012, the net charge-offs recorded on this portfolio for the third quarter of 2012 and the second quarter of 2012, and the nonperforming status of these loans at September 30, 2012 and June 30, 2012. The exit loan portfolio represented 5.9% of total loans and loans held for sale at September 30, 2012.

These events include, among other things, threats to our cybersecurity, as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct our business activities.  Operational risk also encompasses compliance risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules and regulations, prescribed practices, and ethical standards. Due to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, large financial companies like Key will be subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation due to their systemic importance. This heightened level of regulation will increase our operational risk. We have created work teams to respond to and analyze the regulatory requirements that will be promulgated as a result of the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. Resulting operational risk losses and/or additional regulatory compliance costs could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation or foregone opportunities.  We seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk, alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance, and a system of internal controls and reporting. We continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws, rules and regulations. For example, an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses. This tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action. We also rely upon software programs designed to assist in the assessment of operational risk and monitoring our control processes. This technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the Board of Directors.  Primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business. Our Operational Risk Management function manages the Operational Risk Management Program which provides the framework for the structure, governance, roles and responsibilities as well as the content to manage operational risk for Key. The Operational Risk Committee, a senior management committee, oversees our level of operational risk, and directs and supports our operational infrastructure and related activities. This committee and the Operational Risk Management function are an integral part of our ERM Program. Our Risk Review function periodically assesses the overall effectiveness of our Operational Risk Management Program and our system of internal controls. Risk Review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the Audit Committee, and independently supports the Audit Committee’s oversight of these controls.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Our business is dynamic and complex. Consequently, we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies. These choices are critical: not only are they necessary to comply with GAAP, they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance. All accounting policies are important, and all policies described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) beginning on page 113 of our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance.  In our opinion, some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility. These policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance, or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. Because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances, they may prove to be inaccurate, or we may find it necessary to change them.  We rely heavily on the use of judgment, assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions, including accounting for the allowance for loan and lease losses; contingent liabilities, guarantees and income taxes; derivatives and related hedging activities; and assets and liabilities that involve valuation methodologies. In addition, we may employ outside valuation experts to assist us in determining fair values of certain assets and liabilities. A brief discussion of each of these areas appears on pages 122 through 124 of our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  At September 30, 2012, $14.5 billion, or 16.7%, of our total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Approximately 95.0% of these assets, before netting adjustments, were classified as Level 1 or Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. At September 30, 2012, $1.4 billion, or 1.9%, of our total liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Substantially all of these liabilities were classified as Level 1 or Level 2.    131    Table of Contents During the third quarter of 2012, $99 million, or .1%, of our total assets were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Approximately 15.2% of these assets were classified as Level 1 or Level 2. At September 30, 2012, there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  In addition, the education lending securitization trusts assets and liabilities were included on the balance sheet at September 30, 2012 at fair value, in the amount of $2.5 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, as a result of their consolidation on January 1, 2010. During the third quarter of 2011, we determined that the $45 million cumulative effect adjustment made related to the consolidation of these trusts on January 1, 2010, was incorrect. Further information regarding this error and its correction is provided in Note 11 (“Acquisitions and Discontinued Operations”).  During the first nine months of 2012, we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates.    132    Table of Contents European Sovereign Debt Exposures  Our total European sovereign and non-sovereign debt exposure is presented in Figure 42.

Our credit risk exposure is largely concentrated in developed countries with emerging market exposure essentially limited to commercial facilities. At-risk exposures in the rest of the world, which are actively monitored by management total less than $1 million.    133    Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk  The information presented in the “Market risk management” section of the Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition & Results of Operations is incorporated herein by reference.  Item 4. Controls and Procedures  As of the end of the period covered by this report, KeyCorp carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of KeyCorp’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of KeyCorp’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, KeyCorp’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, as of the end of the period covered by this report, in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. No changes were made to KeyCorp’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, KeyCorp’s internal control over financial reporting.  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  Item 1. Legal Proceedings  As of September 30, 2012, KeyCorp and its subsidiaries are defendants or putative defendants in a variety of legal proceedings, in the form of regulatory/government investigations as well as private, civil litigation and arbitration proceedings. The private, civil litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both government agencies and self-regulatory bodies. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation and involve a variety of claims (including common law tort, contract claims, securities, ERISA, and consumer protection claims). At times, these legal proceedings may present novel claims or legal theories.  On at least a quarterly basis, we assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings utilizing the latest information available. For those matters where it is probable that we will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements. These legal reserves may be increased or decreased to reflect any relevant developments on a quarterly basis. Where a loss is not probable or the amount of the loss is not estimable, we have not accrued legal reserves, consistent with applicable accounting guidance. Because the outcome of legal proceedings is inherently uncertain, based on information currently available to us, advice of counsel, and the availability of insurance coverage and indemnification from third parties, we believe that our established reserves are adequate and the liabilities arising from the legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the inherent uncertainty in legal proceedings there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution will not exceed established reserves. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter, or a combination of matters, may be material to our results of operation for a particular period, depending upon the size of the loss or our income for that particular period.  The information presented in the Legal Proceedings section of Note 12 (“Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements is incorporated herein by reference.
