Item 1A. Risk Factors.Regulatory capital requirementIn July 2013, the U.S. banking agencies adopted a final rule to implement the Basel III international capital framework (“Basel III”) with an effective date of January 1, 2015, and a multi-year transition period ending on December 31, 2018 (“Regulatory Capital Rules”). Consistent with Basel III, the Regulatory Capital Rules further restrict the type of instruments that may be recognized in Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital (including the phase out of trust preferred securities from tier 1 capital for BHCs above a certain asset threshold, like KeyCorp), establish a minimum Tier 1 Common Equity Capital ratio requirement of 4.5% and capital buffers to address procyclicality concerns and absorb losses during periods of financial stress, and refine several of the methodologies used for determining risk-weighted assets. The Regulatory Capital Rules provide additional requirements for large banking organizations with over $250 billion in total consolidated assets or $10 billion in foreign exposure, but those additional requirements do not apply to KeyCorp nor to KeyBank. Accordingly, for purposes of the Regulatory Capital Rules, KeyCorp and KeyBank are treated as “standardized approach” banking organizations.The Basel III capital framework and the U.S. implementation of the Basel III capital framework are discussed in more detail in Item 1. Business of our 2016 Form 10-K under the heading “Supervision and Regulation - Regulatory capital requirements.”Under the Regulatory Capital Rules, “standardized approach” banking organizations, like KeyCorp, are required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in Figure 3 below. At June 30, 2017, Key had an estimated Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 9.82% under the fully phased-in Regulatory Capital Rules. Also at June 30, 2017, based on the fully phased-in Regulatory Capital Rules, Key estimates that its capital and leverage ratios, after adjustment for market risk, would be as set forth in Figure 3.Figure 3.

The table reconciles the GAAP performance measure to the corresponding non-GAAP measure, which provides a basis for period-to-period comparisons.(b)Capital conservation buffer must consist of Common Equity Tier 1 capital. As a standardized approach banking organization, KeyCorp is not subject to the countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% imposed upon an advanced approaches banking organization under the Regulatory Capital Rules.(c)As a standardized approach banking organization, KeyCorp is not subject to the 3% supplemental leverage ratio requirement, which becomes effective January 1, 2018.10Table of ContentsRevised prompt corrective action framework The federal prompt corrective action (“PCA”) framework under the FDIA groups FDIC-insured depository institutions into one of five capital categories: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and “critically undercapitalized,” for purposes of determining whether a bank should be required to establish a capital restoration plan and become subject to limitations on the bank’s activities, capital actions, and payment of management fees.In addition to implementing Basel III in the United States, the Regulatory Capital Rules also revised the capital category thresholds under the PCA framework for FDIC-insured depository institutions such as KeyBank. The revised PCA framework table in Figure 4 identifies the capital category thresholds for a “well capitalized” and an “adequately capitalized” institution under the Regulatory Capital Rules. Figure 4.

However, investors should not regard this determination as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of KeyBank because the PCA framework is intended to serve a limited supervisory function. Moreover, it is important to note that the PCA framework does not apply to BHCs, like KeyCorp.Capital planning and stress testingOn January 30, 2017, the Federal Reserve released a final rule to revise the capital plan and stress test rules as they apply to large, noncomplex BHCs and U.S. intermediaries of foreign banks. Under the final rule, a large noncomplex BHC is one with total consolidated assets of more than $50 billion but less than $250 billion, and nonbank assets of less than $75 billion (“covered BHCs”). This includes KeyCorp.The final rule provides relief from the compliance requirements associated with the Federal Reserve’s capital plan and stress test rules. Specifically, the final rule relieves covered BHCs from the qualitative assessment portion of the Federal Reserve’s CCAR program and modifies the reporting requirements for these organizations by reducing the reporting requirements applicable to covered BHCs under the FR Y-14A and by raising the materiality thresholds for specific portfolio reporting requirements. The final rule also limits the amount of capital a covered BHC is authorized to distribute in excess of the amount set forth in its capital plan without Federal Reserve approval (the “de minimis exception”), and establishes a one-quarter blackout period during which a BHC is not permitted to submit a notice to use the de minimis exception or seek prior approval to make a capital distribution in an amount that exceeds the de minimis exception level. If exigent circumstances arise during the blackout period that require a capital distribution, a covered BHC may resubmit its capital plan and request expedited review from the Federal Reserve; however, the Federal Reserve is not required to expedite the review process.The final rule also requires covered BHCs to measure nonbank assets on a monthly basis and report the monthly average to the Federal Reserve on a quarterly basis beginning March 31, 2017.The final rule became effective 30 days after publication in the Federal Register, and therefore, the relief provided under the final rule from the qualitative assessment portion of the CCAR program is effective for the 2017 CCAR cycle.On June 9, 2017, the Federal Reserve released a proposal and request for comment on certain information collection activities conducted under the series FR Y-14 schedules and reports that are used in connection with the CCAR program. As they would pertain to Key, the proposed revisions to the FR Y-14A and FR Y-14Q generally consist of modifications to reported items and 11Table of Contentsinstructions that would clarify the intended reporting of those items, and seek to further align reported items with the methodology, standards, and treatment in other regulatory reports or with the FR Y-14 schedules. In addition, the Federal Reserve has proposed to eliminate two schedules from the FR Y-14A to reduce the burden, but also to add a new sub-schedule to supplement the existing information collection around business plan change information. Other aspects of the proposal that do not pertain to Key would require the U.S. intermediate holding companies of foreign banks to apply the global market shock adjustment to certain reporting schedules under the FR Y-14A and FR Y-14Q. The comment period for the proposed rule ends on August 8, 2017. If the proposal is adopted in final form, it is expected to have a neutral-to-low impact on Key’s reporting and compliance obligations.Liquidity requirementsIn October 2014, the federal banking agencies published a final rule to implement the Basel III liquidity coverage ratio (“Basel III LCR”) for U.S. banking organizations (the “Liquidity Coverage Rules”) that establishes a minimum LCR for certain internationally active bank and nonbank financial companies (excluding KeyCorp) and a modified version of the LCR (“Modified LCR”) for BHCs and other depository institution holding companies with over $50 billion in consolidated assets that are not internationally active (including KeyCorp). KeyBank will not be subject to the LCR or the Modified LCR under the Liquidity Coverage Rules unless the OCC affirmatively determines that application to KeyBank is appropriate in light of KeyBank’s asset size, level of complexity, risk profile, scope of operations, affiliation with foreign or domestic covered entities, or risk to the financial system.Under the Liquidity Coverage Rules, KeyCorp must calculate a Modified LCR on a monthly basis, and was required to satisfy a minimum Modified LCR requirement of 100% by January 1, 2017. At June 30, 2017, Key’s estimated Modified LCR was above 100%. In the future, KeyCorp may change the composition of our investment portfolio, increase the size of the overall investment portfolio, and modify product offerings to enhance or optimize our liquidity position.Net stable funding ratioThe federal banking agencies commenced the U.S. implementation of the Basel III net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) in April and May 2016, with the release of a proposed rule to implement a NSFR requirement for certain internationally active banking organizations (excluding KeyCorp) and a modified version of the minimum NSFR requirement (“Modified NSFR”) for BHCs and other depository institution holding companies with over $50 billion in consolidated assets that are not internationally active (including KeyCorp), together with quarterly public disclosure requirements. The proposed rule would require banking organizations to satisfy a minimum NSFR requirement of 1.0 on an ongoing basis. However, banking organizations subject to the Modified NSFR (like KeyCorp) would be required to maintain a lower minimum amount of available stable funding, equal to 70% of the required stable funding under the NSFR. The proposed rule would be effective on January 1, 2018. The comment period for the NPR expired on August 5, 2016. If the proposed NSFR requirement is adopted as a final rule, then similar to actions taken in connection with the implementation of the Liquidity Coverage Rules, KeyCorp may adjust its balance sheet or modify product offerings to enhance its liquidity position.Resolution and recovery planningBHCs with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, like KeyCorp, are required to periodically submit to the Federal Reserve and FDIC a plan discussing how the company could be rapidly and efficiently resolved if the company failed or experienced material financial distress. Insured depository institutions with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, like KeyBank, are also required to submit a resolution plan to the FDIC. These plans are due annually. KeyCorp and KeyBank were not required to submit resolution plans for 2016 because the FDIC and Federal Reserve deferred such requirement until December 2017. By letter dated March 24, 2017, KeyCorp received guidance from the Federal Reserve and the FDIC regarding the information requirements for certain aspects of KeyCorp’s December 2017 resolution plan submission. That letter is publicly available on the Federal Reserve’s website, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20170324a.htm.The Federal Reserve and FDIC make available on their websites the public sections of resolution plans for the companies, including KeyCorp and KeyBank, that submitted plans. The public section of the resolution plans of KeyCorp and KeyBank is available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/resolution-plans.htm and https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/reform/resplans/.On September 28, 2016, the OCC released final guidelines that establish standards for recovery planning by certain large OCC-regulated institutions, including KeyBank. The guidelines require such institutions to establish a comprehensive framework for 12Table of Contentsevaluating the financial effects of severe stress events, and recovery actions an institution may pursue to remain a viable, going concern during a period of severe financial stress. Under the final guidelines, an institution’s recovery plan must include triggers to alert the institution of severe stress events, escalation procedures, recovery options, and a process for periodic review and approval by senior management and the board of directors. The recovery plan should be tailored to the complexity, scope of operations, and risk profile of the institution.Because KeyBank had average total consolidated assets of greater than $100 billion but less than $750 billion as reported on KeyBank’s Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income for the four most recent consecutive quarters prior to January 1, 2017, it must be in compliance with the guidelines not later than January 1, 2018.Deposit insurance and assessmentsAs required under the Dodd-Frank Act, in March 2015, the FDIC approved a final rule to impose a surcharge on the quarterly deposit insurance assessments of insured depository institutions having total consolidated assets of at least $10 billion (like KeyBank). The surcharge is 4.5 cents per $100 of the institution’s assessment base (after making certain adjustments). The final rule became effective on July 1, 2016. As of July 1, 2016, KeyBank must pay a surcharge to assist in bringing the reserve ratio to the statutory minimum of 1.35%. Surcharges will continue through the quarter that the DIF reserve ratio reaches or exceeds 1.35%, but not later than December 31, 2018. If the reserve ratio does not reach 1.35% by December 31, 2018 (provided it is at least 1.15%), the FDIC will impose a shortfall assessment on March 31, 2019, on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more (like KeyBank).In December 2016, the FDIC issued a final rule that imposes recordkeeping requirements on insured depository institutions with two million or more deposit accounts (including KeyBank) in order to facilitate rapid payment of insured deposits to customers if the institutions were to fail. The rule requires those insured depository institutions to: (i) maintain complete and accurate data on each depositor’s ownership interest by right and capacity for all of the institution’s deposit accounts; and (ii) develop the capability to calculate the insured and uninsured amounts for each deposit owner within 24 hours of failure. The FDIC will conduct periodic testing of compliance with these requirements, and institutions subject to the rule must submit to the FDIC a certification of compliance, signed by the KeyBank CEO, and deposit insurance coverage summary report on or before the mandatory compliance date and annually thereafter. The final rule became effective on April 1, 2017, with a mandatory compliance date of April 1, 2020.Single counterparty credit limitsIn March 2016, the Federal Reserve issued an NPR proposing to establish single counterparty credit limits for BHCs with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. This proposal would implement a provision in the Dodd-Frank Act and replaces proposals on this subject issued by the Federal Reserve in 2011 and 2012. Under the proposal, a covered BHC (including KeyCorp) would not be allowed to have an aggregate net credit exposure to any unaffiliated counterparty that exceeds 25% of the consolidated capital stock and surplus of the covered BHC. Globally, systemically important banks and certain other large BHCs (excluding KeyCorp) would be subject to stricter limits under the proposal. A covered BHC such as KeyCorp would be required to comply with the proposed limits and quarterly reporting to show such compliance starting two years after the effective date of a final rule. The comment period for the NPR expired on June 3, 2016.ERISA fiduciary standardIn April 2016, the Department of Labor published final rules and amendments to certain prohibited transaction exemptions regarding which service providers would be regarded as fiduciaries under ERISA for making investment advice recommendations to: (i) certain retirement plan fiduciaries, participants, or beneficiaries; and (ii) owners or beneficiaries of individual retirement accounts and health savings accounts, among other retirement plans. The purpose of the rules is to place fiduciary obligations, rather than the lesser legal obligations that currently apply, on these service providers. Accordingly, the rules subject any financial institution making recommendations for either the purchase or sale of investments in or rollover of the respective retirement plan to certain fiduciary obligations under ERISA such as an impartial conduct standard and not selling certain investment products whose compensation may raise a conflict of interest for the advisor without entering into a contract providing certain disclosures and legal remedies to the customer. Under the Department of Labor’s original rules, the impartial standard requirement for financial institutions and their advisors was to become effective April 10, 2017. However, in response to a Presidential Order, the Department of Labor extended the effective date to June 9, 2017. The contract provisions must be in place by January 1, 2018. The Department of Labor will continue to review whether to modify, further delay, or rescind these rules in whole or in part. 13Table of ContentsHighlights of Our PerformanceFinancial performanceFor the second quarter of 2017, we announced net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $393 million, or $.36 per common share. Our second quarter of 2017 results compare to net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $193 million, or $.23 per common share, for the second quarter of 2016. During the second quarter of 2017, our results included a number of notable items, including a gain related to our merchant services business, the finalization of purchase accounting, merger-related charges, and a charitable contribution. These notable items had a pre-tax net benefit of $43 million, or $.02 per common share, for the second quarter of 2017.Second quarter 2017 net interest income included $100 million of purchase accounting accretion related to the acquisition of First Niagara, including $42 million related to the finalization of previous purchase accounting estimates.Our taxable-equivalent net interest income was $987 million for the second quarter of 2017, and the net interest margin was 3.30%, compared to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $605 million and a net interest margin of 2.76% for the second quarter of 2016, reflecting the benefit from the First Niagara acquisition, including purchase accounting accretion, as well as higher earning asset yields and balances. For the full year of 2017, we expect net interest income to be in the range of $3.8 billion to $3.9 billion. Our outlook does not include any additional rate increases in 2017.Our noninterest income was $653 million for the second quarter of 2017, compared to $473 million for the year-ago quarter. Growth was largely driven by the acquisition of First Niagara, as well as core business momentum and a $64 million one-time gain from acquiring the remaining ownership interest in a merchant services joint venture. Investment banking and debt placement fees grew $37 million, related to strong commercial mortgage banking, underwriting, and advisory fees. For the full year of 2017, we expect noninterest income to be in the range of $2.35 billion to $2.45 billion.Our noninterest expense was $995 million for the second quarter of 2017, which included $44 million of merger-related charges. Merger-related charges for the quarter were made up of $31 million of personnel expense and $13 million of nonpersonnel expense, largely reflected in business services and professional fees and marketing expense. During the second quarter of 2016, we incurred $45 million of merger-related charges.Excluding merger-related charges, noninterest expense was $245 million higher than the second quarter of last year. The increase from the prior year, reflected in both personnel and non-personnel expense, was primarily driven by the acquisition of First Niagara. Higher incentive compensation related to stronger capital markets performance also contributed to the year-over-year increase. For the full year of 2017, we expect noninterest expense excluding merger-related charges to be in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion.Average loans were $86.5 billion for the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $25.4 billion compared to the second quarter of 2016, primarily reflecting the impact of the First Niagara acquisition as well as growth in commercial and industrial loans which was broad-based and spread across Key's commercial lines of business. During the second quarter of 2017, our Community Bank middle market segment lending grew 4% from the first quarter of 2016. We anticipate low-end of mid-single digit (4%-6%) loan growth from the fourth quarter of 2016, which translates to $87 billion to $88 billion for fiscal year 2017 average balances.Average deposits totaled $102.8 billion for the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $28.9 billion compared to the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting the acquisition of First Niagara and core retail and commercial deposit growth. Our consolidated loan-to-deposit ratio was 87.2% at June 30, 2017, compared to 85.3% at June 30, 2016. We anticipate average deposits to be in the range of $102.5 billion to $103 billion for the fiscal year 2017.Our provision for credit losses was $66 million for the second quarter of 2017, compared to $52 million for the second quarter of 2016. Our allowance for loan and lease losses was $870 million, or 1.01% of total period-end loans, at June 30, 2017, compared to 1.38% at June 30, 2016. For the remainder of 2017, we expect the provision for credit losses to slightly exceed net loan charge-offs to provide for loan growth.Net loan charge-offs for the second quarter of 2017 totaled $66 million, or .31% of average total loans, compared to $43 million, or .28%, for the second quarter of 2016. For the remainder of 2017, we expect net loan charge-offs to average loans to remain below our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points.14Table of ContentsAt June 30, 2017, our nonperforming loans totaled $507 million, which represented .59% of period-end portfolio loans, compared to $619 million, or 1.00% of period-end portfolio loans, at June 30, 2016. Nonperforming assets at June 30, 2017, totaled $556 million and represented .64% of period-end portfolio loans and OREO and other nonperforming assets, compared to $637 million, or 1.03% of period-end portfolio loans and OREO and other nonperforming assets, at June 30, 2016.Our capital ratios remain strong. Our tangible common equity and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios at June 30, 2017, are 8.56% and 10.73%, respectively, compared to 9.95% and 11.41%, respectively, at June 30, 2016. In addition, our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio is 9.91% at June 30, 2017, compared to 11.10% at June 30, 2016. The decrease in our capital ratios was driven by the acquisition of First Niagara. We continue to return capital to our shareholders by repurchasing Common Shares and through our quarterly common share dividend. In the second quarter of 2017, we completed $94 million of Common Share repurchases, including $88 million of common share repurchases in the open market and $6 million of Common Share repurchases related to employee equity compensation programs and paid a cash dividend of $.095 per Common Share, under our 2016 capital plan authorization.Figure 5 shows our continuing and discontinued operating results for the current, past, and year-ago quarters. Our financial performance for each of the past five quarters is summarized in Figure 1.Figure 5.

As a result of this decision, we have accounted for these business as a discontinued operation. For further discussion regarding the income (loss) from discontinued operations, see Note 12 (“Acquisition, Divestiture, and Discontinued Operations”).(b)EPS may not foot due to rounding.Figure 6 presents certain non-GAAP financial measures related to “tangible common equity,” “return on tangible common equity,” “Common Equity Tier 1,” “cash efficiency ratio,” certain financial measures excluding notable items, and “Common Equity Tier 1 under the Regulatory Capital Rules (estimates).”Notable items include certain revenue or expense items that may occur in a reporting period which management does not consider indicative of ongoing financial performance. Management believes it is useful to consider certain financial metrics with and without merger-related charges and/or other notable items in order to enable a better understanding of Company results, increase comparability of period-to-period results, and to evaluate and forecast those results.The tangible common equity ratio and the return on tangible common equity ratio have been a focus for some investors, and management believes that these ratios may assist investors in analyzing Key’s capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and BHC capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. The Federal Reserve focuses its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 capital known as Common Equity Tier 1. Because the Federal Reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders’ equity (essentially Tier 1 risk-based capital less preferred stock and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in Tier 1 risk-based capital, this focus on Common Equity Tier 1 is consistent with existing capital adequacy categories. The Regulatory Capital Rules, described in more detail under the section “Supervision and Regulation” in Item 2 of this report, also make Common Equity Tier 1 a priority. The Regulatory Capital Rules change the regulatory capital standards that apply to BHCs by, among other changes, phasing out the treatment of trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred securities as Tier 1 eligible capital. Starting in 2016, our trust preferred securities are only included in Tier 2 capital. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity and Common Equity Tier 1, we believe it is useful to enable 15Table of Contentsinvestors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases. Figure 6 reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures.As disclosed in Note 2 (“Business Combination”) and Note 12 (“Acquisition, Divestiture, and Discontinued Operations”), KeyCorp completed its purchase of First Niagara on August 1, 2016. The definitive agreement and plan of merger to acquire First Niagara was originally announced on October 30, 2015. As a result of this transaction, we’ve recognized merger-related charges. Figure 6 shows the computation of pre provision net revenue excluding notable items and return on average assets from continuing operations excluding notable items. For the second quarter of 2017, merger-related charges are included in the total for “notable items,” the detail of which is provided in Figure 6. We believe that eliminating the effects of the notable items makes it easier to analyze our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis with our prior results.The cash efficiency ratio is a ratio of two non-GAAP performance measures. Accordingly, there is no directly comparable GAAP performance measure. The cash efficiency ratio excludes the impact of our intangible asset amortization from the calculation. We also disclose the cash efficiency ratio excluding notable items. We believe these ratios provide greater consistency and comparability between our results and those of our peer banks. Additionally, these ratios are used by analysts and investors as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis.Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, nor as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.16Table of ContentsFigure 6.

Net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets (such as loans and securities) and loan-related fee income, and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. There are several factors that affect net interest income, including: •the volume, pricing, mix, and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities;•the volume and value of net free funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and equity capital;•the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk;•interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace; and•asset quality.To make it easier to compare both the results across several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets (some taxable, some not), we present net interest income in this discussion on a “taxable-equivalent basis” (i.e., as if all income were taxable and at the same rate). For example, $100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as $154, an amount that, if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35%, would yield $100.Figure 7 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense, and their respective yields or rates over the past five quarters. This figure also presents a reconciliation of TE net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with GAAP for each of those quarters. The net interest margin, which is an indicator of the profitability of the earning assets portfolio less cost of funding, is calculated by dividing annualized TE net interest income by average earning assets.Second quarter 2017 net interest income included $100 million of purchase accounting accretion related to the acquisition of First Niagara, including $42 million related to the finalization of previous purchase accounting estimates. First quarter 2017 results included $53 million of purchase accounting accretion.TE net interest income was $987 million for the second quarter of 2017, and the net interest margin was 3.30%, compared to TE net interest income of $605 million and a net interest margin of 2.76% for the second quarter of 2016, reflecting benefit from the First Niagara acquisition, including purchase accounting accretion, as well as higher earning asset yields and balances.Compared to the first quarter of 2017, TE net interest income increased by $58 million, and the net interest margin increased by 17 basis points. The increase in net interest income and the net interest margin reflects an increase in purchase accounting accretion and higher earning asset yields, partly offset by a decline in loan fees and higher interest-bearing deposit costs, largely the result of an increase in commercial deposit rates and growth in higher-yielding deposit products. Net interest income also benefited from one additional day in the second quarter of 2017.For the six months ended June 30, 2017, TE net interest income was $1.9 billion and the net interest margin was 3.21%, compared to TE net interest income of $1.2 billion and a net interest margin of 2.83% for the prior year, reflecting the benefit from the First Niagara acquisition, growth in our core earning asset balances, and higher interest rates.Average loans were $86.5 billion for the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $25.4 billion compared to the second quarter of 2016, primarily reflecting the impact of the First Niagara acquisition, as well as growth in commercial and industrial loans, which was broad-based and spread across our commercial lines of business. During the second quarter of 2017, Key finalized the fair value of the First Niagara acquired loan portfolio, adjusting the discount from $548 million to $603 million. At June 30, 2017, $345 million of the fair value discount remained. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, average loans increased by $369 million. Commercial and industrial loans increased $664 million, with strength in middle market lending. Consumer loans decreased $110 million, mostly from continued declines in the home equity loan portfolio, largely the result of paydowns on home equity lines of credit.Average deposits totaled $102.8 billion for the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $28.9 billion compared to the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting the acquisition of First Niagara and core retail and commercial deposit growth.Compared to the first quarter of 2017, average deposits increased by $701 million, driven by growth in certificates of deposits and NOW and money market deposit accounts, partly offset by a decline in escrow deposits. During the quarter, Key also experienced a shift in deposit mix from noninterest-bearing and low-cost interest-bearing deposits to higher-yielding deposit 19Table of Contentsproducts. On a period end basis, total deposits decreased $1.1 billion compared to the linked-quarter, largely the result of seasonal deposit growth that occurred in the first quarter of 2017.20Table of ContentsFigure 7.

The assets under management that primarily 23Table of Contentsgenerate these revenues are shown in Figure 10. For the three months ended June 30, 2017, trust and investment services income increased $24 million, or 21.8%, compared to the same period one year ago, primarily due to the acquisition of First Niagara and assets under management market growth. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, trust and investment services income decreased $1 million, or .7%, due to lower insurance and brokerage commissions.For the six months ended June 30, 2017, trust and investment services income was up $50 million, or 22.8%, from the six months ended June 30, 2016, primarily due to the acquisition of First Niagara.A significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management. At June 30, 2017, our bank, trust, and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of $37.6 billion, compared to $34.5 billion at June 30, 2016. The increase in assets under management, as shown in Figure 10, was primarily attributable to the acquisition of First Niagara and growth in equity investments.Figure 10.

Investment banking and debt placement fees increased $37 million, or 37.8%, for the second quarter of 2017, related to strong commercial mortgage banking, underwriting, and advisory fees. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, investment banking and debt placement fees increased $8 million, or 6.3%, related to strong advisory fees. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, investment banking and debt placement fees increased $93 million, or 55.0%, from the same period one year ago. This increase is primarily due to improved capital market conditions and activity compared to the first six months of 2016. Service charges on deposit accountsService charges on deposit accounts increased $22 million, or 32.4%, for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared to the same period one year ago. The increase from the three months ended June 30, 2016, was primarily due to the acquisition of First Niagara. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, service charges on deposit accounts increased $3 million, or 3.4%, primarily due to an increase in account analysis and other fees.For the six months ended June 30, 2017, service charges on deposits accounts increased $44 million, or 33.1%, from the first half of 2016. In all fee categories, this increase was primarily due to the acquisition of First Niagara.Cards and payments incomeCards and payments income, which consists of debit card, consumer and commercial credit card, and merchant services income, increased $18 million, or 34.6%, from the year-ago quarter. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of First Niagara and to higher purchase and prepaid card fees in Key Corporate Bank. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, cards and payments income increased $5 million, or 7.7%, due to increased volume driving higher interchange income.For the six months ended June 30, 2017, cards and payments income was $135 million, an increase of $37 million, or 37.8%, from the same period one year ago. This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of First Niagara and higher purchase and prepaid card fees in Key Corporate Bank.24Table of ContentsOther incomeOther income, which consists primarily of gains on sales of loans held for sale, other service charges, and certain dealer trading income, was up $63 million, or 286.4%, from the year-ago quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, other income increased $54 million, or 174.2%. This increase was primarily attributable to a $64 million one-time gain from acquiring the remaining ownership in a merchant services joint venture.For the six months ended June 30, 2017, other income was up $63 million, or 118.9%, from the same period one year ago. This increase was driven by a $64 million one-time gain related to our merchant services business.Noninterest expenseAs shown in Figure 11, noninterest expense was $995 million for the second quarter of 2017 compared to $751 million for the second quarter of 2016. The second quarter of 2017 included $44 million of merger-related charges compared to $45 million for the second quarter of 2016. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, noninterest expense was $2.0 billion compared to $1.5 billion for the same period one year ago. Merger-related charges for the six months ended June 30, 2017, were $125 million compared to $69 million for the same period one year ago.Figure 11.

This increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of First Niagara. Higher incentive compensation related to stronger capital markets performance also contributed to the year-over-year increase. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, personnel expense decreased $5 million, or .9%. Incentive and stock-based compensation and salaries expense increased but were more than offset by lower employee benefits expense. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, personnel expense was up $276 million, or 33.2%, from the first half of 2016. This increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of First Niagara and higher incentive and stock-based compensation related to stronger capital markets performance.Figure 13.

This increase was primarily due to the acquisition of First Niagara. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, net occupancy expense decreased $9 million, or 10.3%, primarily attributable to lower property reserve expenses and seasonal trends.For the six months ended June 30, 2017, net occupancy expense increased $45 million, or 37.5%, from the six months ended June 30, 2016, primarily due to the acquisition of First Niagara.Other expenseOther expense comprises various miscellaneous expense items. The $36 million, or 34.0%, increase in the current quarter compared to the same period one year ago reflects the impact of the First Niagara acquisition and other miscellaneous expenses. Other notable items which impacted the second quarter included a $20 million charitable contribution and $4 million benefit from purchase accounting finalization, both of which are reflected in other expense. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, other expense decreased $11 million, or 7.2%, primarily due to decreases in other miscellaneous expenses.For the six months ended June 30, 2017, other expense increased $99 million, or 50.5%, from the six months ended June 30, 2016, primarily due to the impact of First Niagara, an increase in other miscellaneous expenses, and the $20 million charitable contribution made in the six months ended June 30, 2017.Income taxesWe recorded tax expense from continuing operations of $158 million for the second quarter of 2017 and $69 million for the second quarter of 2016. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, we recorded tax expense from continuing operations of $252 million, compared to $125 million for the same period one year ago.Our federal tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate, primarily because we generate income from investments in tax-advantaged assets, such as corporate-owned life insurance and credits associated with renewable energy and low-income housing investments, and make periodic adjustments to our tax reserves. Tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2017, and June 30, 2016, was affected by net discrete income tax benefits of $3 million and detriments of $6 million, respectively. The tax expense for the second quarter of 2017 was also impacted due to notable items of $1 million. Excluding those expenses, the tax expense for the second quarter of 2017 was $157 million.26Table of ContentsAdditional information pertaining to how our tax expense (benefit) and the resulting effective tax rates were derived is included in Note 13 (“Income Taxes”) beginning on page 170 of our 2016 Form 10-K.Line of Business ResultsThis section summarizes the financial performance and related strategic developments of our two major business segments (operating segments): Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank.

Key Community Bank summary of operations•Positive operating leverage from prior year •Net income increased $117 million, or 146.3%, from prior year •Average commercial and industrial loans increased $5.4 billion, or 41.2%, from the prior year•Average deposits increased $25.9 billion, or 48.2%, from the prior yearAs shown in Figure 15, Key Community Bank recorded net income attributable to Key of $197 million for the second quarter of 2017, compared to $80 million for the year-ago quarter, benefiting from momentum in Key's core businesses, as well as the impact of the First Niagara acquisition.TE net interest income increased by $284 million, or 72.4%, from the second quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of First Niagara, as well as benefit from the Federal Reserve rate increase. Average loans and leases increased $16.5 billion, or 53.3%, largely driven by a $5.4 billion, or 41.2%, increase in commercial and industrial loans. Additionally, average deposits increased $25.9 billion, or 48.2%, from one year ago.Noninterest income increased $130 million, or 63.1%, from the year-ago quarter, driven by the acquisition of First Niagara, including the addition of Key Insurance and Benefits Services. Strength in cards and payments and higher assets under management balances from market growth also contributed to the increase. The increase in other noninterest income was largely driven by the one-time gain related to Key’s merchant services business. 27Table of ContentsThe provision for credit losses increased by $22 million, or 88.0%, and net loan charge-offs increased $30 million, from the second quarter of 2016, primarily related to the acquisition of First Niagara.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $91 million, or 41.2%, compared to the second quarter of 2016 driven by higher earning asset yields and balances. Average loan and lease balances increased $9.1 billion, or 32.0%, from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by the First Niagara acquisition as well as growth in commercial and industrial loans. Average deposit balances increased $2.0 billion, or 10.5%, from the year-ago quarter, mostly driven by the First Niagara acquisition.Noninterest income was up $54 million, or 23.5%, from the prior year. This growth was mostly due to $40 million of higher investment banking and debt placement fees related to stronger commercial mortgage banking, underwriting, and advisory fees, as well as an increase of $7 million in operating lease income and other leasing gains related to higher originations. Additional increases of $4 million in both cards and payments income and other noninterest income were partially offset by a $2 million decrease in trust and investment services income. The provision for credit losses decreased $11 million, or 36.7%, compared to the second quarter of 2016 due to $8 million of lower net loan charge-offs and improvement in the oil and gas portfolio. Noninterest expense increased by $40 million, or 15.4%, from the second quarter of 2016. The increase from the prior year, reflected in both personnel and nonpersonnel expense, was largely driven by the acquisition of First Niagara, higher performance-based compensation and various other items, including operating lease, FDIC, and cards and payments expenses.Figure 16.

At June 30, 2017, $345 million of the fair value discount remained. For more information on the financial sattement impact of the finalization of the First Niagara acquired loan portforlio, see Note 2 (“Business Combination”).Commercial loan portfolioCommercial loans outstanding were $62.6 billion at June 30, 2017, an increase of $723 million, or 1.2%, compared to December 31, 2016, primarily driven by an increase in commercial and industrial loans.

Our commercial and industrial loans represented 47% of our total loan portfolio at June 30, 2017, and 46% at December 31, 2016, and are the largest component of our total loans. These loans are originated by both Key Corporate Bank and Key Community Bank and consist of fixed and variable rate loans to our large, middle market, and small business clients.Commercial and industrial loans increased $1.1 billion, or 2.9%, from December 31, 2016, with Key Corporate Bank increasing $459 million, Key Community Bank up $731 million, and Other Segments decreasing $44 million. This growth was partially attributable to growth within our middle market segment driven by increased production and productivity.Our largest commercial and industrial loan industry classification, commercial real estate, increased by 10.0%, when compared to December 31, 2016. We experienced growth in our transportation, business products, and construction materials and contractors commercial and industrial loan classifications, increasing 53.1%, 47.8%, and 36.1%, respectively, from December 31, 2016. Partially offsetting these increases, the materials manufacturing and mining and healthcare commercial and industrial loan classifications, which represented approximately 5% and 8%, respectively, of the commercial and industrial loan portfolio at June 30, 2017, decreased 28.8% and 11.0%, respectively, from December 31, 2016. Commercial real estate loans. Our commercial real estate lending business is conducted through two primary sources: our 15-state banking franchise, and KeyBank Real Estate Capital, a national line of business that cultivates relationships with owners of commercial real estate located both within and beyond the branch system. This line of business deals primarily with nonowner-occupied properties (generally properties for which at least 50% of the debt service is provided by rental income 32Table of Contentsfrom nonaffiliated third parties) and accounted for approximately 70% of our average year-to-date commercial real estate loans for the three months ended June 30, 2017, and June 30, 2016. KeyBank Real Estate Capital generally focuses on larger owners and operators of commercial real estate.Commercial real estate loans totaled $17.0 billion at June 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, and represented 20% of our total loan portfolio at June 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively. The $475 million decrease from December 31, 2016, was due to an increase in paydowns and payoffs in our real estate—commercial mortgage loan portfolio. These loans, which include both owner- and nonowner-occupied properties, represented 27% or our commercial loan portfolio at June 30, 2017, and 28% at December 31, 2016. Figure 18 includes commercial mortgage and construction loans in both Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. As shown in Figure 18, this loan portfolio is diversified by both property type and geographic location of the underlying collateral.As presented in Figure 18, at June 30, 2017, our commercial real estate portfolio included commercial mortgage loans of $14.8 billion and construction loans of $2.2 billion, representing 17% and 3%, respectively, of our total loans. At June 30, 2017, nonowner-occupied loans represented 16% of our total loans and owner-occupied loans represented 4% of our total loans. The average size of commercial mortgage loans originated during the second quarter of 2017 was $4.8 million, and our largest commercial mortgage loan at June 30, 2017, had a balance of $98 million. At June 30, 2017, our average construction loan commitment was $9.3 million, our largest construction loan commitment was $65 million, and our largest construction loan amount outstanding was $60.6 million.Also shown in Figure 18, 79% of our commercial real estate loans at June 30, 2017, were for nonowner-occupied properties compared to 78% at December 31, 2016. Approximately 15% of these loans were construction loans at June 30, 2017, and 17% were construction loans at December 31, 2016. Typically, these properties are not fully leased at the origination of the loan. The borrower relies upon additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide the cash flow necessary to support debt service payments. A significant decline in economic growth, and in turn in rental rates and occupancy, would adversely affect our portfolio of construction loans.Figure 18.

Our nonowner-occupied commercial real estate portfolio has decreased by 1.8%, or approximately $244 million, since December 31, 2016. The decline reflects overall business activity and payoffs in our KeyBank Real Estate Capital line of business.Commercial lease financing. We conduct commercial lease financing arrangements through our KEF line of business. Commercial lease financing receivables represented 8% of commercial loans at June 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016.Commercial TDRsWe modify and extend certain commercial loans in the normal course of business for our clients. Loan modifications vary and are handled on a case-by-case basis with strategies responsive to the specific circumstances of each loan and borrower. In many cases, borrowers have other resources and can reinforce the credit with additional capital, collateral, guarantees, or other income sources. For more information on concession types for our commercial accruing and nonaccruing TDRs, see Note 5 (“Asset Quality”), and the section titled “Loans and loans held for sale” in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” on page 57 of our 2016 Form 10-K.Figure 19.

Approximately 99% of this portfolio at June 30, 2017, was originated from our Key Community Bank within our 15-state footprint. The remainder of the portfolio, which has been in an exit mode since the fourth quarter of 2007, was originated from the Consumer Finance line of business and is now included in Other Segments. As shown in Figure 15, we held the first lien position for approximately 60% of the Key Community Bank home equity portfolio at June 30, 2017, and 61% at June 30, 2016. At June 30, 2017, 40% of the Key Community Bank home equity portfolio was secured by second lien mortgages. For consumer loans with real estate collateral, we track borrower performance monthly. Regardless of the lien position, credit metrics are refreshed quarterly, including recent FICO scores as well as original and updated loan-to-value ratios. This information is used in establishing the ALLL. Our methodology is described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses” beginning on page 109 of our 2016 Form 10-K.34Table of ContentsLoans held for saleAs shown in Note 4 (“Loans and Loans Held for Sale”), our loans held for sale increased to $1.7 billion at June 30, 2017, from $1.1 billion at December 31, 2016. At June 30, 2017, loans held for sale included $338 million of commercial and industrial loans, which increased $319 million from December 31, 2016; $1.3 billion of commercial mortgage loans, which increased $310 million from December 31, 2016; $63 million of residential mortgage loans, which increased $1 million from December 31, 2016; and $10 million of commercial lease financing, which increased $10 million from December 31, 2016.Loan salesAs shown in Figure 20, during the first six months of 2017, we sold $4.1 billion of commercial real estate loans, $424 million of residential real estate loans, $97 million of commercial lease financing loans, and $254 million of commercial loans. Most of these sales came from the held-for-sale portfolio; however, $77 million of these loan sales related to the held-to-maturity portfolio.Loan sales classified as held for sale generated net gains of $74 million in the first six months of 2017 and are included in “investment banking and debt placement fees” and “other income” on the income statement.Among the factors that we consider in determining which loans to sell are: •our business strategy for particular lending areas;•whether particular lending businesses meet established performance standards or fit with our relationship banking strategy;•our A/LM needs;•the cost of alternative funding sources;•the level of credit risk;•capital requirements; and•market conditions and pricing.Figure 20 summarizes our loan sales for the first six months of 2017 and all of 2016.Figure 20.

Additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in Note 16 (“Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) under the heading “Recourse agreement with FNMA.”We derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold. We earn noninterest income (recorded as “mortgage servicing fees”) from fees for servicing or administering loans. This fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets. In addition, we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing of commercial real estate loans.SecuritiesOur securities portfolio totaled $28.7 billion at June 30, 2017, compared to $30.4 billion at December 31, 2016. Available-for-sale securities were $18.0 billion at June 30, 2017, compared to $20.2 billion at December 31, 2016. Held-to-maturity securities were $10.6 billion at June 30, 2017, and $10.2 billion at December 31, 2016.As shown in Figure 22, all of our mortgage-backed securities, which include both securities available for sale and held-to-maturity securities, are issued by government-sponsored enterprises or GNMA and traded in liquid secondary markets. These securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value for the available-for-sale portfolio and at cost for the held-to-maturity portfolio. For more information about these securities, see Note 6 (“Fair Value Measurements”) under the heading “Qualitative Disclosures of Valuation Techniques,” and Note 7 (“Securities”).Figure 22.

CMOs are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities. These mortgage securities generate interest income, serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements, and provide liquidity value under regulatory requirements. At June 30, 2017, we had $17.8 billion invested in CMOs and other mortgage-backed securities in the available-for-sale portfolio, compared to $20.0 billion at December 31, 2016.We periodically evaluate our securities available for sale portfolio in light of established A/LM objectives, changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio, the regulatory environment, and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. These evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning.In addition, the size and composition of our securities available for sale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required (or elect) to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits. Although we generally use debt securities for this purpose, other assets, such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit, are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles.36Table of ContentsOur investing activities continue to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs. Our actions to not reinvest the monthly security cash flows at various times provide the liquidity necessary to address our funding requirements. These funding requirements include ongoing loan growth and occasional debt maturities. At other times, we may make additional investments that go beyond the replacement of maturities or mortgage security cash flows as our liquidity position and/or interest rate risk management strategies may require. Lastly, our focus on investing in high quality liquid assets, including GNMA securities, is related to liquidity management strategies to satisfy regulatory requirements.Figure 23 shows the composition, yields, and remaining maturities of our securities available for sale.

They include direct investments (investments made in a particular company) as well as indirect investments (investments made through funds that include other investors). Principal investments are predominantly made in privately held companies and are carried at fair value. The fair value of the direct investments was $15 million at June 30, 2017, and $27 million at December 31, 2016, while the fair value of the indirect investments was $148 million at June 30, 2017, and $158 million at December 31, 2016. Under the requirements of the Volcker Rule, we will be required to dispose of some or all of our indirect principal investments. The Federal Reserve extended the conformance period to July 21, 2017, for all banking entities with respect to covered funds. On January 13, 2017, Key filed for an additional extension for illiquid funds, to retain certain indirect investments until the earlier of the date on which the investment is conformed or is expected to mature, or July 21, 2022. The application for an extension was approved on February 14, 2017. As of June 30, 2017, we have not committed to a plan to sell these investments. Therefore, these investments continue to be valued using the net asset value per share methodology. For more information about the Volcker Rule, see the discussion in Item 1 under the heading “Other Regulatory Developments under the Dodd-Frank Act — ‘Volcker Rule’” in the section entitled “Supervision and Regulation” beginning on page 16 of our 2016 Form 10-K.Prior to June 30, 2017, “other investments” included real estate-related investments that were carried at fair value, as well as other types of investments that generally were carried at cost, in addition to principal investments. These real estate-related investments were valued $6 million at December 31, 2016. Additional information pertaining to the equity investment is included in the “Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis” section of Note 6 (“Fair Value Measurements”).Most of our other investments are not traded on an active market. We determine the fair value at which these investments should be recorded based on the nature of the specific investment and all available relevant information. This review may encompass such factors as the issuer’s past financial performance and future potential, the values of public companies in comparable businesses, the risks associated with the particular business or investment type, current market conditions, the nature and duration of resale restrictions, the issuer’s payment history, our knowledge of the industry, third-party data, and other relevant factors. During the first six months of 2017, net gains from our principal investing activities (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) totaled $1 million, which includes $13 million of net unrealized losses. These net gains are recorded as “net gains (losses) from principal investing” on the income statement. Additional information regarding these investments is provided in Note 6 (“Fair Value Measurements”).Deposits and other sources of fundsDomestic deposits are our primary source of funding. The composition of our average deposits is shown in Figure 7 in the section entitled “Net interest income.” During the second quarter of 2017, average deposits totaled $102.8 billion, an increase of $28.9 billion compared to the year-ago quarter, primarily reflecting the acquisition of First Niagara and core retail and commercial deposit growth. Compared to the first quarter of 2017, average deposits increased by $701 million, driven by growth in certificates of deposits and NOW and money market deposit accounts, partly offset by a decline in escrow deposits. During the quarter, Key also experienced a shift in deposit mix from noninterest-bearing and low-cost interest-bearing deposits to higher-yielding deposit products. On a period end basis, total deposits decreased $1.1 billion compared to the linked-quarter, largely the result of seasonal deposit growth that occurred in the first quarter of 2017. As of June 30, 2017, period-end deposits represented 87.2% of the funds we used to support loans and other earning assets, compared to 85.2% at December 31, 2016.Wholesale funds, consisting of short-term borrowings, averaged $1.7 billion during the second quarter of 2017, compared to $1.0 billion during the second quarter of 2016. The change from the second quarter of 2016 was caused by increases of $129 million in federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements, and $522 million in bank notes and other short-term borrowings.CapitalAt June 30, 2017, our shareholders’ equity was $15.3 billion, up $13 million from December 31, 2016. The following sections discuss certain factors that contributed to this change. For other factors that contributed to the change, see the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity and Note 18 (“Shareholders' Equity”).38Table of ContentsCCAR and capital actions As part of its ongoing supervisory process, the Federal Reserve requires BHCs like KeyCorp to submit an annual comprehensive capital plan and to update that plan to reflect material changes in the BHC’s risk profile, business strategies, or corporate structure, including but not limited to changes in planned capital actions. The 2016 capital plan, which was effective through the second quarter of 2017, included a Common Share repurchase program of up to $350 million, which included repurchases to offset issuances of common shares under our employee compensation plans. We completed $94 million of Common Share repurchases, including $88 million of Common Share repurchases in the open market and $6 million of Common Share repurchases related to employee equity compensation programs in the second quarter of 2017 under this authorization. In April 2017, we submitted to the Federal Reserve and provided to the OCC our 2017 capital plan under the annual CCAR process. On June 28, 2017, the Federal Reserve announced that it did not object to our 2017 capital plan. For more information on our 2017 capital plan actions, see Note 18 (“Shareholders' Equity “).DividendsAs previously reported, our 2016 capital plan proposed an increase in our quarterly common share dividend from $.085 to $.095 per Common Share for the second quarter of 2017 which was approved by our Board in May 2017. Other changes to future dividends may be evaluated by the Board based upon our earnings, financial condition, and other factors, including regulatory review. Further information regarding the capital planning process and CCAR is included under the heading “Capital planning and stress testing” in the “Supervision and Regulation” section beginning on page 12 of our 2016 Form 10-K.Consistent with the 2016 capital plan, we made a dividend payment of $.095 per share, or $104 million, on our Common Shares during the second quarter of 2017. During the second quarter of 2017, we made the following dividend payments on our preferred stock:•$12.50 per depositary share, or $6 million, on the depositary shares related to our Series D Preferred Stock; and•$.382813 per depositary share, or $8 million, on the depositary shares related to our Series E Preferred Stock.Common shares outstandingOur Common Shares are traded on the NYSE under the symbol KEY with 33,735 holders of record at June 30, 2017. Our book value per Common Share was $13.02 based on 1.093 billion shares outstanding at June 30, 2017, compared to $12.58 per Common Share based on 1.079 billion shares outstanding at December 31, 2016. At June 30, 2017, our tangible book value per Common Share was $10.40, compared to $9.99 per Common Share at December 31, 2016.Figure 25 shows activities that caused the change in outstanding common shares over the past five quarters.Figure 25.

This decrease was primarily due to common share repurchases under our 2016 capital plan.At June 30, 2017, we had 164.0 million treasury shares, compared to 177.4 million treasury shares at December 31, 2016. Going forward we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stock-based compensation awards and for other corporate purposes.Information on repurchases of Common Shares by KeyCorp is included in Part II, Item 2. “Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds” of this report.39Table of ContentsCapital adequacyCapital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance. All of KeyCorp’s capital ratios remained in excess of regulatory requirements at June 30, 2017. Our capital and liquidity levels are intended to position us to weather an adverse credit cycle while continuing to serve our clients’ needs, as well as to meet the Regulatory Capital Rules described in the “Supervision and regulation” section of Item 2 of this report. Our shareholders’ equity to assets ratio was 11.23% at June 30, 2017, compared to 11.17% at December 31, 2016. Our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.56% at June 30, 2017, compared to 8.09% at December 31, 2016.The capital modifications mandated by the Regulatory Capital Rules, which became effective on January 1, 2015, for KeyCorp, require higher and better-quality capital and introduced a new capital measure, “Common Equity Tier 1.” The Rules phased outthe treatment of certain capital securities and cumulative preferred securities as eligible Tier 1 capital. The phase-out period, which began January 1, 2015, for “standardized approach” banking organizations such as KeyCorp, resulted in our trust preferred securities issued by the KeyCorp capital trusts and acquired from First Niagara, being treated only as Tier 2 capital starting in 2016. The new minimum capital and leverage ratios under the Regulatory Capital Rules, together with the estimated ratios of KeyCorp at June 30, 2017, calculated on a fully phased-in basis, are set forth under the heading “New minimum capital and leverage ratio requirements” in the “Supervision and regulation” section in Item 2 of this report. Beginning with the implementation of the Regulatory Capital Rules, deferred tax assets that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are deductible from Common Equity Tier 1 on a phase-in basis.As of January 1, 2016, KeyCorp (and its banking subsidiaries) were each required to maintain, on a consolidated basis, a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. At June 30, 2017, our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, and Tier 1 leverage ratio were 9.91%, 10.73%, 12.64%, and 9.95%, respectively, compared to 9.54%, 10.89%, 12.85%, and 9.90%, respectively, at December 31, 2016. Information regarding the regulatory capital ratios of KeyCorp’s banking subsidiaries is presented annually, in Note 23 (“Shareholders' Equity”) beginning on page 198 of our 2016 Form 10-K. Figure 26 presents more detail on the risk based capital ratios.40Table of Contents Figure 26.

The most significant risks we face are credit, compliance, operational, liquidity, market, reputation, strategic, and model risks. Our risk management activities are focused on ensuring that we properly identify, measure, and manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness, and to maximize profitability.The Board serves in an oversight capacity, ensuring that Key’s risks are managed in a manner that is not only effective and balanced, but also adds value for the shareholders. The Board understands Key’s risk philosophy, approves the risk appetite, inquires about risk practices, reviews the portfolio of risks, compares the actual risks to the risk appetite, and is apprised of significant risks, both actual and emerging, and determines whether management is responding appropriately. The Board challenges management and ensures accountability.The Board’s Audit Committee assists the Board in oversight of financial statement integrity, regulatory and legal requirements, independent auditors’ qualifications and independence, and the performance of the internal audit function and independent auditors. The Audit Committee meets with management and approves significant policies relating to the risk areas overseen by 41Table of Contentsthe Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has responsibility over all risk review functions, including internal audit, as well as financial reporting, legal matters, and fraud risk. The Audit Committee also receives reports on enterprise risk. In addition to regularly scheduled bi-monthly meetings, the Audit Committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases.The Board’s Risk Committee assists the Board in oversight of strategies, policies, procedures, and practices relating to the assessment and management of enterprise-wide risk, including credit, market, liquidity, model, operational, compliance, reputation, and strategic risks. The Risk Committee also assists the Board in overseeing risks related to capital adequacy, capital planning, and capital actions. The Risk Committee reviews and provides oversight of management’s activities related to the enterprise-wide risk management framework, which includes review of the ERM Policy, including the Risk Appetite Statement, and management and ERM reports. The Risk Committee also approves any material changes to the charter of the ERM Committee and significant policies relating to risk management.The Audit and Risk Committees meet jointly, as appropriate, to discuss matters that relate to each committee’s responsibilities. Committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting. All members of the Board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months.Our ERM Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer and comprising other senior level executives, is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite. The ERM Program encompasses our risk philosophy, policy, framework, and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company. The ERM Committee reports to the Board’s Risk Committee. Annually, the Board reviews and approves the ERM Policy, as well as the risk appetite, including corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories. We use a risk-adjusted capital framework to manage risks. This framework is approved and managed by the ERM Committee.Tier 2 Risk Governance Committees support the ERM Committee by identifying early warning events and trends, escalating emerging risks, and discussing forward-looking assessments. Risk Governance Committees include attendees from each of the Three Lines of Defense. The First Line of Defense is the line of business primarily responsible to accept, own, proactively identify, monitor, and manage risk. The Second Line of Defense comprises Risk Management representatives who provide independent, centralized oversight over all risk categories by aggregating, analyzing, and reporting risk information. Risk Review, our internal audit function, provides the Third Line of Defense in its role to provide independent assessment and testing of the effectiveness of, appropriateness of, and adherence to KeyCorp’s risk management policies, practices, and controls. The Chief Risk Officer ensures that relevant risk information is properly integrated into strategic and business decisions, ensures appropriate ownership of risks, provides input into performance and compensation decisions, assesses aggregate enterprise risk, monitors capabilities to manage critical risks, and executes appropriate Board and stakeholder reporting.Federal banking regulators continue to emphasize with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution. We believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks, and conform to regulatory expectations.Market risk managementMarket risk is the risk that movements in market risk factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, credit spreads, and volatilities will reduce Key’s income and the value of its portfolios. These factors influence prospective yields, values, or prices associated with the instrument. For example, the value of a fixed-rate bond will decline when market interest rates increase, while the cash flows associated with a variable rate loan will increase when interest rates increase. The holder of a financial instrument is exposed to market risk when either the cash flows or the value of the instrument is tied to such external factors.We are exposed to market risk both in our trading and nontrading activities, which include asset and liability management activities. Our trading positions are carried at fair value with changes recorded in the income statement. These positions are subject to various market-based risk factors that affect the fair value of the financial instruments in the trading category. Our traditional banking loan and deposit products, as well as long-term debt and certain short-term borrowings are nontrading positions. These positions are generally carried at the principal amount outstanding for assets and the amount owed for liabilities. The nontrading positions are subject to changes in economic value due to varying market conditions, primarily changes in interest rates.42Table of ContentsTrading market riskKey incurs market risk as a result of trading, investing, and client facilitation activities, principally within our investment banking and capital markets businesses. Key has exposures to a wide range of interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and commodity prices, as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads. Our primary market risk exposures are a result of trading activities in the derivative and fixed income markets, and of maintaining positions in these instruments. We maintain modest trading inventories to facilitate customer flow, make markets in securities, and hedge certain risks. The majority of our positions are traded in active markets.Management of trading market risks. Market risk management is an integral part of Key’s risk culture. The Risk Committee of our Board provides oversight of trading market risks. The ERM Committee and the Market Risk Committee regularly review and discuss market risk reports prepared by our MRM that contain our market risk exposures and results of monitoring activities. Market risk policies and procedures have been defined and approved by the Market Risk Committee, a Tier 2 Risk Governance Committee, and take into account our tolerance for risk and consideration for the business environment.The MRM, as the second line of defense, is an independent risk management function that partners with the lines of business to identify, measure, and monitor market risks throughout our company. The MRM is responsible for ensuring transparency of significant market risks, monitoring compliance with established limits, and escalating limit exceptions to appropriate senior management. The various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well-managed and prudent. Market risk is monitored through various measures, such as VaR, and through routine stress testing, sensitivity, and scenario analyses. The MRM conducts stress tests for each covered position using historical worst case and standard shock scenarios. VaR, stressed VaR, and other analyses are prepared daily and distributed to appropriate management.Covered positions. We monitor the market risk of our covered positions as defined in Market Risk Rule, which includes all of our trading positions as well as all foreign exchange and commodity positions, regardless of whether the position is in a trading account. All positions in the trading account are recorded at fair value, and changes in fair value are reflected in our consolidated statements of income. Information regarding our fair value policies, procedures, and methodologies is provided in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Fair Value Measurements” on page 110 of our 2016 Form 10-K and Note 6 (“Fair Value Measurements”) in this report. Instruments that are used to hedge nontrading activities, such as bank-issued debt and loan portfolios, equity positions that are not actively traded, and securities financing activities, do not meet the definition of a covered position. The MRM is responsible for identifying our portfolios as either covered or noncovered. The Covered Position Working Group develops the final list of covered positions, and a summary is provided to the Market Risk Committee.Our significant portfolios of covered positions are detailed below. We analyze market risk by portfolios of covered positions, and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type. The descriptions below incorporate the respective risk types associated with each of these portfolios. •Fixed income includes those instruments associated with our capital markets business and the trading of securities as a dealer. These instruments may include positions in municipal bonds, bonds backed by the U.S. government, agency and corporate bonds, certain mortgage-backed securities, securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, money markets, and certain CMOs. The activities and instruments within the fixed income portfolio create exposures to interest rate and credit spread risks.•Interest rate derivatives include interest rate swaps, caps, and floors, which are transacted primarily to accommodate the needs of commercial loan clients. In addition, we enter into interest rate derivatives to offset or mitigate the interest rate risk related to the client positions. The activities within this portfolio create exposures to interest rate risk.•Credit derivatives generally include credit default swap indices, which are used to manage the credit risk exposure associated with anticipated sales of certain commercial real estate loans. The transactions within the credit derivatives portfolio result in exposure to counterparty credit risk and market risk.VaR and stressed VaR. VaR is the estimate of the maximum amount of loss on an instrument or portfolio due to adverse market conditions during a given time interval within a stated confidence level. Stressed VaR is used to assess extreme conditions on market risk within our trading portfolios. MRM calculates VaR and stressed VaR on a daily basis, and the results are distributed to appropriate management. VaR and stressed VaR results are also provided to our regulators and utilized in regulatory capital calculations.We use a historical simulation VaR model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions and other non-covered positions. Historical 43Table of Contentsscenarios are customized for specific positions, and numerous risk factors are incorporated in the calculation. Additional consideration is given to the risk factors to estimate the exposures that contain optionality features, such as options and cancelable provisions. VaR is calculated using daily observations over a one-year time horizon, and approximates a 95% confidence level. Statistically, this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than VaR, on average, five out of 100 trading days, or three to four times each quarter. We also calculate VaR and stressed VaR at a 99% confidence level.The VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of possible gains and losses on our covered positions. However, there are limitations inherent in the VaR model since it uses historical results over a given time interval to estimate future performance. Historical results may not be indicative of future results, and changes in the market or composition of our portfolios could have a significant impact on the accuracy of the VaR model. We regularly review and enhance the modeling techniques, inputs and assumptions used. Our market risk policy includes the independent validation of our VaR model by Key’s internal model validation group on an annual basis. The Model Risk Management Committee oversees the Model Validation Program, and results of validations are discussed with the ERM Committee.Actual losses for the total covered positions did not exceed aggregate daily VaR on any day during the quarters ended June 30, 2017, and June 30, 2016. The MRM backtests our VaR model on a daily basis to evaluate its predictive power. The test compares VaR model results at the 99% confidence level to daily held profit and loss. Results of backtesting are provided to the Market Risk Committee. Backtesting exceptions occur when trading losses exceed VaR. We do not engage in correlation trading, or utilize the internal model approach for measuring default and credit migration risk. Our net VaR approach incorporates diversification, but our VaR calculation does not include the impact of counterparty risk and our own credit spreads on derivatives.The aggregate VaR at the 99% confidence level for all covered positions was $1.2 million at June 30, 2017, and $.8 million at June 30, 2016. The increase in aggregate VaR was primarily due to the increased exposure in our fixed income and CMBS portfolios. Figure 27 summarizes our VaR at the 99% confidence level for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended June 30, 2017, and June 30, 2016. During these periods, none of our significant portfolios daily trading VaR numbers exceeded their VaR limits. Only one of our significant portfolios stress VaR number exceeded the stress VaR limit on May 4, 2017. This was an immaterial stress VaR limit breach for Fixed Income portfolio. We followed our escalation procedures and the breach was immediately remediated during the same business day.Figure 27.

Market risk is a component of our internal capital adequacy assessment. Our risk-weighted assets include a market risk-equivalent asset amount, which consists of a VaR component, stressed VaR component, a de minimis exposure amount, and a specific risk add-on, which are added together to arrive at total market risk equivalent assets. Specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments, which is not accounted for by changes in broad market 44Table of Contentsrisk factors and is measured through a standardized approach. Specific risk calculations are run quarterly by the MRM, and approved by the Chief Market Risk Officer.Nontrading market riskMost of our nontrading market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations and its impacts on our traditional loan and deposit products, as well as investments, hedging relationships, long-term debt, and certain short-term borrowings. Interest rate risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the EVE. Such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. We manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the EVE in accordance with our risk appetite and within Board-approved policy limits.Interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of customer preferences for loan and deposit products, economic conditions, the competitive environment within our markets, changes in market interest rates that affect client activity, and our hedging, investing, funding, and capital positions. The primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of reprice risk, basis risk, yield curve risk, and option risk.•Reprice risk is the exposure to changes in the level of interest rates and occurs when the volume of interest-bearing liabilities and the volume of interest-earning assets they fund (e.g., deposits used to fund loans) do not mature or reprice at the same time.•Basis risk is the exposure to asymmetrical changes in interest rate indices and occurs when floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities reprice at the same time, but in response to different market factors or indices.•Yield curve risk is the exposure to nonparallel changes in the slope of the yield curve (where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity) and occurs when interest-bearing liabilities and the interest-earning assets that they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve.•Option risk is the exposure to a customer or counterparty’s ability to take advantage of the interest rate environment and terminate or reprice one of our assets, liabilities, or off-balance sheet instruments prior to contractual maturity without a penalty. Option risk occurs when exposures to customer and counterparty early withdrawals or prepayments are not mitigated with an offsetting position or appropriate compensation.The management of nontrading market risk is centralized within Corporate Treasury. The Risk Committee of our Board provides oversight of nontrading market risk. The ERM Committee and the ALCO review reports on the components of interest rate risk described above as well as sensitivity analyses of these exposures. These committees have various responsibilities related to managing nontrading market risk, including recommending, approving, and monitoring strategies that maintain risk positions within approved tolerance ranges. The A/LM policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of interest rate risk and is administered by the ALCO. Internal and external emerging issues are monitored on a daily basis. The MRM, as the second line of defense, provides additional oversight.Net interest income simulation analysis. The primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis. For purposes of this analysis, we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on- and off-balance sheet positions, accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity. The analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments, and balance sheet growth projections based on a most likely macroeconomic view. While simulation modeling assumes that residual risk exposures are managed within the risk appetite and Board approved policy limits, the results also reflect management’s desired interest rate risk positioning. Achieving the current modeled position typically requires purchases of investment securities to replace security cash flows and the execution of new interest rate swaps to replace maturing interest rate swaps. The simulation model estimates the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if interest rates were to gradually increase or decrease over the next 12 months. Our standard rate scenarios encompass a gradual, parallel increase or decrease of 200 basis points, but due to the low interest rate environment, we have modified the standard decrease scenario to a gradual, parallel decrease of 125 basis points over eight months with no change over the following four months. After calculating the amount of net interest income at risk to interest rate changes, we compare that amount with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment.Figure 29 presents the results of the simulation analysis at June 30, 2017, and June 30, 2016. At June 30, 2017, our simulated impact to changes in interest rates was modestly asset–sensitive. In June 2017, the Federal Reserve increased the range for the 45Table of ContentsFederal Funds Target Rate, which led to an increase in the magnitude of the declining rate scenario to 125 basis points. Tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual, parallel 200 basis point increase or 125 basis point decrease in interest rates over the next 12 months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 5.5%. As a result of the change in the Federal Reserve’s June 2017 interest rate increase, our modeled exposure to declining rates increased. As shown in Figure 29, we are operating within these levels as of June 30, 2017.Figure 29. Simulated Change in Net Interest Income June 30, 2017    Basis point change assumption (short-term rates)-125 +200 Tolerance level-5.50%-5.50%Interest rate risk assessment-4.94%.91%June 30, 2016    Basis point change assumption (short-term rates)-50 +200 Tolerance level-4.00%-4.00%Interest rate risk assessment-3.37%2.22%Simulation analysis produces a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on judgments related to assumptions input into the model. We tailor certain assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled, and validate those assumptions on a regular basis. However, actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition, customer behavior, product pricing, market interest rates, changes in management’s desired interest rate risk positioning, investment, funding and hedging activities, and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events.We also perform regular stress tests and sensitivity analyses on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments. Assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve, including steepening or flattening of the yield curve, changes in credit spreads, immediate changes in market interest rates, and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates. Assessments are also performed on changes to the following assumptions: loan and deposit balances, the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities, changes in lending spreads, prepayments on loans and securities, investment, funding and hedging activities, and liquidity and capital management strategies.The results of additional assessments indicate that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results presented in Figure 29. Net interest income is highly dependent on the timing, magnitude, frequency, and path of interest rate increases and the associated assumptions for deposit repricing relationships, lending spreads, and the balance behavior of transaction accounts. The modeling is sensitive to the volume of fixed-rate assets and liabilities incorporated. The modeling currently assumes approximately $24.7 billion of investment security purchases and swap executions over the next three years. For every immediate reduction in fixed-rate assets of $1 billion, the modeled benefit to rising rates would increase by approximately 30 basis points. The low level of interest rates increases the uncertainty of assumptions for deposit balance behavior and deposit repricing relationships to market interest rates. Our historical deposit repricing betas in the last rising rate cycle ranged between 50% and 60% for interest-bearing deposits, and we continue to make similar assumptions in our modeling, with the modeled betas varying by customer segment and product type. Recent deposit repricing has been lower than our modeled assumptions. In the modeling, if the deposit beta for the first 25 basis point increase in the Federal Funds Target Rate was zero, then returned to the standard modeled betas for the next 175 basis points of rate increases, our modeled asset sensitive benefit would increase by approximately 200 basis points. The sensitivity testing of assumptions supports our confidence that actual results are likely to be within 100 basis points of modeled results.Our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume, mix, maturity, and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows. Treasury discretionary activities related to funding, investing, and hedging may also change as a result of changes in customer business flows, or changes in management’s desired interest rate risk positioning. As changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy, management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile.We also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a three-year horizon. These simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a 12-month horizon. To capture longer-term exposures, we calculate exposures to changes of the EVE as discussed in the following section.Economic value of equity modeling. EVE complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond 12-, 24-, and 36-month horizons. EVE modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets, liabilities 46Table of Contentsand off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates, measuring the resulting change in the values of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet instruments, and comparing those amounts with the base case of the current interest rate environment. Because the calculation of EVE under an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest rates in the current low rate environment results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than 200 basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points, we have modified the standard declining rate scenario to an immediate 125 basis point decrease. This analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with non-contractual maturities. Those assumptions are based on historical behaviors, as well as our expectations. We develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our EVE will decrease by more than 15% in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates. We are operating within these guidelines as of June 30, 2017.Management of interest rate exposure. We use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate A/LM strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures. Specifically, we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities, issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates, and using derivatives — predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps, which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities.Figure 30 shows all swap positions that we hold for A/LM purposes. These positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. For example, fixed-rate debt is converted to a floating rate through a “receive fixed/pay variable” interest rate swap. The volume, maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader A/LM objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile, see Note 8 (“Derivatives and Hedging Activities”).Figure 30.

Liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions.Governance structureWe manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis. This approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity, as well as each entity’s capacity to manage through adverse conditions. The approach also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding.The management of consolidated liquidity risk is centralized within Corporate Treasury. Oversight and governance is provided by the Board, the ERM Committee, the ALCO, and the Chief Risk Officer. The Asset Liability Management Policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of liquidity risk and is administered by the ALCO. The MRM, as the Second Line of Defense, provides additional oversight. Our current liquidity risk management practices are in compliance with the Federal Reserve’s Enhanced Prudential Standards and the OCC’s Heightened Standards for Large Insured National Banks.47Table of ContentsThese committees regularly review liquidity and funding summaries, liquidity trends, peer comparisons, variance analyses, liquidity projections, hypothetical funding erosion stress tests, and goal tracking reports. The reviews generate a discussion of positions, trends, and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of our decisions. When liquidity pressure is elevated, positions are monitored more closely and reporting is more intensive. To ensure that emerging issues are identified, we also communicate with individuals inside and outside of the company on a daily basis.Factors affecting liquidityOur liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events. An example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency. Examples of indirect events (events unrelated to us) that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war, natural disasters, political events, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund or hedge fund. Similarly, market speculation, or rumors about us or the banking industry in general, may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources.Our credit ratings at June 30, 2017, are shown in Figure 31. We believe these credit ratings, under normal conditions in the capital markets, would enable KeyCorp or KeyBank to issue fixed income securities to investors. Figure 31.

Liquidity risk is also derived from our deposit gathering activities and the ability of our customers to withdraw funds that do not have a stated maturity or to withdraw funds before their contractual maturity. The assessments of liquidity risk are measured under the assumption of normal operating conditions as well as under a stressed environment. We manage these exposures in accordance with our risk appetite, and within Board-approved policy limits.We regularly monitor our liquidity position and funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of hypothetical scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding. In the normal course of business, we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both KeyCorp and KeyBank. In a “heightened monitoring mode,” we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently, and use assumptions to reflect the changed market environment. Our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies. Erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods. Ultimately, they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations. To compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures, we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed.We maintain a Contingency Funding Plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis. The plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions. It also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for managing liquidity through a problem period. As part of the plan, we maintain on-balance sheet liquid reserves referred to as our liquid asset portfolio, which consists of high quality liquid assets. During a problem period, that reserve could be used as a source of funding to provide time to develop and execute a longer-term strategy. The liquid asset portfolio at June 30, 2017, totaled $23.4 billion, consisting of $20.9 billion of unpledged securities, $352 million of securities available for secured funding at the FHLB, and $2.2 billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our Federal Reserve account. The liquid asset portfolio can fluctuate due to excess liquidity, heightened risk, or prefunding of expected outflows, such as debt maturities. Additionally, as of June 30, 2017, our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was $23.4 billion at the Federal 48Table of ContentsReserve Bank of Cleveland and $6.0 billion at the FHLB. During the second quarter of 2017, Key’s outstanding FHLB of Cincinnati advances were increased by $343 million as term advances were added.Final U.S. liquidity coverage ratioUnder the Liquidity Coverage Rules, we are required to calculate the Modified LCR for Key. For the second quarter of 2017, our Modified LCR was above 100%. In the future, we may change the composition of our investment portfolio, increase the size of the overall investment portfolio, and modify product offerings to enhance or optimize our liquidity position.Additional information about the LCR is included in the “Supervision and regulation” section under the heading “Liquidity requirements” in Item 2 of this report.Long-term liquidity strategyOur long-term liquidity strategy is to be predominantly funded by core deposits. However, we may use wholesale funds to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio, meet daily cash demands, and allow management flexibility to execute business initiatives. Key’s client-based relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base that, in conjunction with intermediate and long-term wholesale funds managed to a diversified maturity structure and investor base, supports our liquidity risk management strategy. We use the loan-to-deposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies. Our target loan-to-deposit ratio is 90-100% (at June 30, 2017, our loan-to-deposit ratio was 87%) which we calculate as total loans, loans held for sale, and nonsecuritized discontinued loans, divided by domestic deposits.Sources of liquidityOur primary sources of liquidity include customer deposits, wholesale funding, and liquid assets. If the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances, we rely on wholesale funding or on-balance sheet liquid reserves. Conversely, excess cash generated by operating, investing, and deposit-gathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets.Liquidity programsWe have several liquidity programs, which are described in Note 19 (“Long-Term Debt”) beginning on page 191 of our 2016 Form 10-K, that are designed to enable KeyCorp and KeyBank to raise funds in the public and private debt markets. The proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. These liquidity programs are reviewed from time to time by the Board and are renewed and replaced as necessary. There are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs.On June 9, 2017, KeyBank issued $600 million of 2.40% Senior Bank Notes due June 9, 2022, under its Global Bank Note Program.Liquidity for KeyCorp The primary source of liquidity for KeyCorp is from subsidiary dividends, primarily from KeyBank. KeyCorp has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt, support customary corporate operations and activities (including acquisitions), support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries’ obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, and without adverse consequences, and pay dividends to shareholders.We use a parent cash coverage months metric as the primary measure to assess parent company liquidity. The parent cash coverage months metric measures the months into the future where projected obligations can be met with the current amount of liquidity. KeyCorp generally issues term debt to supplement dividends from KeyBank to manage our liquidity position at or above our targeted levels. The parent company generally maintains cash in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over at least the next 24 months. At June 30, 2017, KeyCorp held $2.3 billion in cash, which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations, including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our risk tolerance.Typically, KeyCorp meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from KeyBank and other non-bank subsidiaries, supplemented with term debt. Federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval. A national bank’s dividend-paying capacity is affected by several factors, including net profits (as defined by statute) for the two previous calendar years and for the current year, up to the date of dividend 49Table of Contentsdeclaration. During the second quarter of 2017, KeyBank paid $125 million in dividends to KeyCorp. As of June 30, 2017, KeyBank had regulatory capacity to pay $746 million in dividends to KeyCorp without prior regulatory approval.Our liquidity position and recent activityOver the past quarter, our liquid asset portfolio, which includes overnight and short-term investments, as well as unencumbered, high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios, has increased as a result of an increase in unpledged securities. The liquid asset portfolio continues to exceed the amount that we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a longer-term solution.From time to time, KeyCorp or KeyBank may seek to retire, repurchase, or exchange outstanding debt, capital securities, preferred shares, or Common Shares through cash purchase, privately negotiated transactions or other means. Additional information on repurchases of Common Shares by KeyCorp is included in Part II, Item 2. “Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds” of this report and in Part II, Item 5. “Market for the Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” on page 28 of our 2016 Form 10-K. Such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity and capital requirements, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material, individually or collectively.We generate cash flows from operations and from investing and financing activities. We have approximately $166 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments in international tax jurisdictions as of June 30, 2017. As we consider alternative long-term strategic and liquidity plans, opportunities to repatriate these amounts would result in approximately $3 million in taxes to be paid. We have included the appropriate amount as a deferred tax liability at June 30, 2017.The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2017, and June 30, 2016.Credit risk managementCredit risk is the risk of loss arising from an obligor’s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms. Like other financial services institutions, we make loans, extend credit, purchase securities, and enter into financial derivative contracts, all of which have related credit risk.Credit policy, approval, and evaluationWe manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program. The Credit Risk Committee and the Commercial Credit Policy Committee approve retail and commercial credit policies. Significant policies are reviewed periodically with our Executive Risk Management Committee and the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors on a prescribed schedule. These policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit.Our credit risk management team and individuals within our lines of business to whom credit risk management has delegated authority are responsible for credit approval. Individuals with assigned credit authority are authorized to grant exceptions to credit policies. It is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate, however, a corporate tolerance has been established to keep exceptions at an acceptable level based upon portfolio and economic considerations.Most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or scoring. Loan grades are assigned to commercial loans at the time of origination, verified by the credit risk management team and periodically reevaluated thereafter. This risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling. Commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings. The first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation; the second rating reflects expected loss rates on the credit facility. Default probability is determined based on, among other factors, the financial strength of the borrower, an assessment of the borrower’s management, the borrower’s competitive position within its industry sector, and our view of industry risk within the context of the general economic outlook. Types of exposure, transaction structure and collateral, including credit risk mitigants, affect the expected loss assessment.Our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans. These models, known as scorecards, forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant. The scorecards are embedded in the application processing system, which allows for real-time scoring and automated decisions for many of our products. We periodically validate the loan grading and scoring processes.50Table of ContentsWe maintain an active concentration management program to monitor concentration risk in our credit portfolios. For aggregate credit relationships, we employ a sliding scale of exposure, known as hold limits, which is dictated by the type of loan and strength of the borrower. Our legal lending limit is approximately $2.1 billion. However, internal hold limits generally restrict the largest exposures to less than 20% of that amount. As of June 30, 2017, we had nine client relationships with loan commitments net of credit default swaps of more than $200 million. The average amount outstanding on these nine individual net obligor commitments was $51 million at June 30, 2017. In general, our philosophy is to maintain a diverse portfolio with regard to credit exposures.We actively manage the overall loan portfolio in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives and concentration risk tolerances to mitigate excess portfolio credit risk. We utilize credit default swaps on a limited basis to transfer a portion of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit to a third party. At June 30, 2017, we used credit default swaps with a notional amount of $183 million to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending obligations. We may also sell credit derivatives — primarily single name credit default swaps — to offset our purchased credit default swap position prior to maturity. At June 30, 2017, we did not have any sold credit default swaps outstanding.Credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Related gains or losses, as well as the premium paid or received for credit protection, are included in the “corporate services income” and “other income” components of noninterest income.Allowance for loan and lease lossesAt June 30, 2017, the ALLL was $870 million, or 1.01% of period-end loans, compared to $858 million, or 1.00%, at December 31, 2016. The allowance includes $36 million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of $391 million at June 30, 2017, compared to $37 million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of $501 million at December 31, 2016. For more information about impaired loans, see Note 5 (“Asset Quality”). At June 30, 2017, the ALLL was 171.6% of nonperforming loans, compared to 137.3% at December 31, 2016.Selected asset quality statistics for each of the past five quarters are presented in Figure 32. The factors that drive these statistics are discussed in the remainder of this section.Figure 32.

The June 30, 2017 PCI loan balances increased from the March 31, 2017 balances, as a result of the finalization of the First Niagara Acquisition Date loan valuation, which increased the PCI Acquisition Date fair value by $105 million from the provisional estimate recorded in the 2016 10-K. We estimate the appropriate level of the ALLL on at least a quarterly basis. The methodology used is described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses” beginning on page 109 of our 2016 Form 10-K. Briefly, our allowance applies expected loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics. We exercise judgment to assess any adjustment to the expected loss rates for the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions, lending policies including underwriting standards, and the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets.For all commercial and consumer loan TDRs, regardless of size, as well as impaired commercial loans with an outstanding balance of $2.5 million or greater, we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss content and assign a specific 51Table of Contentsallowance to the loan. We estimate the extent of the individual impairment for commercial loans and TDRs by comparing the recorded investment of the loan with the estimated present value of its future cash flows, the fair value of its underlying collateral, or the loan’s observable market price. Secured consumer loan TDRs that are discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not formally re-affirmed are adjusted to reflect the fair value of the underlying collateral, less costs to sell. Other consumer loan TDRs are combined in homogenous pools and assigned a specific allocation based on the estimated present value of future cash flows using the effective interest rate. A specific allowance also may be assigned — even when sources of repayment appear sufficient — if we remain uncertain about whether the loan will be repaid in full. On at least a quarterly basis, we evaluate the appropriateness of our loss estimation methods to reduce differences between estimated incurred losses and actual losses. The ALLL at June 30, 2017, represents our best estimate of the probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date.As shown in Figure 33, our ALLL from continuing operations increased by $12 million, or 1.4%, from December 31, 2016. Our allowance applies expected loss rates to our existing loans with similar risk characteristics as well as any adjustments to reflect our current assessment of qualitative factors, such as changes in economic conditions, underwriting standards, and concentrations of credit. Our commercial ALLL increased by $24 million, or 3.3%, from December 31, 2016, primarily because of loan growth in certain segments of the commercial loan portfolio as well as credit quality migration. Our consumer ALLL decreased by $12 million, or 8.4%, from December 31, 2016, primarily due to continued improvement in credit quality metrics, including improved delinquency trends, which have decreased expected loss rates. These trends align with the continued stability in the economy and labor markets, proactive credit risk management practices, and strong credit quality originations.Our liability for credit losses on lending-related commitments decreased by $7 million from December 31, 2016, to $48 million at June 30, 2017. When combined with our ALLL, our total allowance for credit losses represented 1.06% of period-end loans at June 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016.Figure 33.

Compared to the first six months of 2016, oil and gas prices have stabilized, leading to improved credit quality metrics. We continue to reduce our exposure in our higher-risk businesses, including the residential properties portion of our construction loan portfolio, marine/RV financing, and other selected leasing portfolios through the sale of certain loans, payments from borrowers, or net loan charge-offs.Net loan charge-offs Net loan charge-offs for the second quarter of 2017 totaled $66 million, or .31% of average loans, compared to net loan charge-offs of $43 million, or .28%, for the same period last year. Figure 34 shows the trend in our net loan charge-offs by loan type, while the composition of loan charge-offs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in Figure 35.Over the past 12 months, net loan charge-offs increased $23 million. This increase is attributable to growth in our loan portfolio and lower levels of recoveries coupled with high levels of charge-offs over the same period.52Table of ContentsFigure 34.

These concessions are made to improve the collectability of the loan and generally take the form of a reduction of the interest rate, extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance.As shown in Figure 36, nonperforming assets at June 30, 2017, decreased $120 million from December 31, 2016. This decrease was reflected in both our commercial and consumer loan portfolios. 55Table of ContentsFigure 37 shows the types of activity that caused the change in our nonperforming loan balance during each of the last five quarters.Figure 37.

These events include, among other things, threats to our cybersecurity, as we are reliant upon information systems and the Internet to conduct our business activities. Operational risk also encompasses compliance risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules and regulations, prescribed practices, and ethical standards. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, large financial companies like Key are subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation. This heightened level of regulation has increased our operational risk. Resulting operational risk losses and/or additional regulatory compliance costs could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation, or foregone opportunities.We seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk, alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance, and a system of internal controls and reporting. We continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws, rules, and regulations. For example, an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses. This tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action. We also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes. This technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the Board.The Operational Risk Management Program provides the framework for the structure, governance, roles, and responsibilities, as well as the content, to manage operational risk for Key. The Compliance Risk Committee serves the same function in managing compliance risk for Key. Primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business. The Operational Risk Committee and Compliance Risk Committee are senior management committees that oversee our level of operational and compliance risk and direct and support our operational and compliance infrastructure and related activities. These committees and the Operational Risk Management and Compliance functions are an integral part of our ERM Program. Our Risk Review function regularly assesses the overall effectiveness of our Operational Risk Management and Compliance Programs and our system of internal controls. Risk Review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the Risk and Audit Committees and independently supports the Risk Committee’s oversight of these controls.CybersecurityWe maintain comprehensive Cyber Incident Response Plans, and we devote significant time and resources to maintaining and regularly updating our technology systems and processes to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks, and other technology assets against attempts by third parties to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems, or cause other damage. We and many other U.S. financial institutions have experienced distributed denial-of-service attacks from technologically sophisticated third parties. These attacks are intended to disrupt or disable online banking services and prevent banking transactions. We also periodically experience other attempts to breach the security of our systems and data. These cyberattacks have not, to date, resulted in any material disruption of our operations or material harm to our customers, and have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations.56Table of ContentsCyberattack risks may also occur with our third-party technology service providers, and may interfere with their ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us, with attendant potential for financial loss or liability that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Recent high-profile cyberattacks have targeted retailers and other businesses for the purpose of acquiring the confidential information (including personal, financial, and credit card information) of customers, some of whom are customers of ours. We may incur expenses related to the investigation of such attacks or related to the protection of our customers from identity theft as a result of such attacks. Risks and exposures related to cyberattacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking, and other technology-based products and services by us and our clients.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur business is dynamic and complex. Consequently, we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies. These choices are critical – not only are they necessary to comply with GAAP, they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance. All accounting policies are important, and all policies described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) beginning on page 106 of our 2016 Form 10-K should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance.In our opinion, some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility. These policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance, or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. Because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances, they may prove to be inaccurate, or we may find it necessary to change them.We rely heavily on the use of judgment, assumptions, and estimates to make a number of core decisions, including accounting for the ALLL; contingent liabilities, guarantees and income taxes; derivatives and related hedging activities; and assets and liabilities that involve valuation methodologies. In addition, we may employ outside valuation experts to assist us in determining fair values of certain assets and liabilities. A brief discussion of each of these areas appears on pages 92 through 95 of our 2016 Form 10-K. At June 30, 2017, $20.0 billion, or 15%, of our total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Approximately 99% of these assets, before netting adjustments, were classified as Level 1 or Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. At June 30, 2017, $1.2 billion, or 1%, of our total liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. All of these liabilities were classified as Level 1 or Level 2.At June 30, 2017, $21 million, or less than 1% of our total assets were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. All of these assets were classified as Level 3. At June 30, 2017, there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.During the first six months of 2017, we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates. 57Table of ContentsEuropean Sovereign and Nonsovereign Debt ExposuresOur total European sovereign and Nonsovereign debt exposure is presented in Figure 38.Figure 38.

Financial Statements (Unaudited).63Table of ContentsNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of KeyCorp and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Some previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to current reporting practices.The consolidated financial statements include any voting rights entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations, we consolidate a VIE if we have: (i) a variable interest in the entity; (ii) the power to direct activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the entity’s economic performance; and (iii) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE (i.e., we are considered to be the primary beneficiary). Variable interests can include equity interests, subordinated debt, derivative contracts, leases, service agreements, guarantees, standby letters of credit, loan commitments, and other contracts, agreements, and financial instruments. See Note 10 (“Variable Interest Entities”) for information on our involvement with VIEs.We use the equity method to account for unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or VIEs if we have significant influence over the entity’s operating and financing decisions (usually defined as a voting or economic interest of 20% to 50%, but not controlling). Unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or VIEs in which we have a voting or economic interest of less than 20% generally are carried at cost. Investments held by our registered broker-dealer and investment company subsidiaries (principal investing entities and Real Estate Capital line of business) are carried at fair value.We believe that the unaudited consolidated interim financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature and disclosures that are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full year. The interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our 2016 Form 10-K.In preparing these financial statements, subsequent events were evaluated through the time the financial statements were issued. Financial statements are considered issued when they are widely distributed to all shareholders and other financial statement users, or filed with the SEC.Accounting Guidance Adopted in 2017Consolidation. In October 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that amends the previous consolidation guidance issued in February 2015, to require a decision maker that holds an interest in a VIE through an entity under common control to only consider its proportionate indirect interest in the VIE in determining whether the decision maker is the VIE’s primary beneficiary. This new guidance eliminates the requirement that a decision maker treat the common control party’s interest in the VIE as if the decision maker held the interest itself, an approach referred to as “full attribution.” The new guidance was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (effective January 1, 2017, for us) on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this accounting guidance did not affect our financial condition or results of operations.Stock-based compensation. In March 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that simplifies the accounting for several aspects of share-based payment transactions, including the related income tax consequences, the classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and the presentation on the statement of cash flows. This accounting guidance was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (effective January 1, 2017, for us). The method of transition was dependent upon the particular amendment within the new guidance. During the six months ended June 30, 2017, we recognized $22 million in excess tax benefits within “income taxes” on our income statement that pertained to share-based payment arrangements. In prior periods, such excess tax benefits were recorded within “capital surplus” on our balance sheet. Under the new guidance, generally, if our share price increases over an award’s vesting period, the resulting tax windfall will decrease “income taxes.” In a like manner, if our share price decreases over an award’s vesting period, the resulting tax shortfall will increase “income taxes.” This change also removed the impact of the excess tax benefits and deficiencies from the calculation of diluted EPS and is required to be applied on a prospective basis. The adoption of this accounting standard did not materially affect our statement of cash flows, nor did it affect retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. We elected to retain our existing accounting policy of estimating award forfeitures upon the award’s grant date. Equity method investments. In March 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that simplifies the transition to equity method accounting by eliminating the requirement for an investor to make retroactive adjustments to the investment, results of 64Table of Contentsoperations, and retained earnings on a step-by-step basis when an investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. Instead, when an investment qualifies for the equity method due to an increase in ownership or degree of influence, an equity method investor is required to add the cost of acquiring the additional interest to the current basis of the previously held interest, and to adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for the equity method. This accounting guidance became effective prospectively for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (effective January 1, 2017, for us). The adoption of this accounting guidance did not affect our financial condition or results of operations. This guidance will only affect our financial condition or results of operations if there is an applicable change in an investment resulting in the investment’s qualifying for equity method accounting.Derivatives and hedging. In March 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that requires an entity to use a four-step decision model when assessing contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments to determine whether they are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts. This accounting guidance was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (effective January 1, 2017, for us) on a modified retrospective basis. The adoption of this accounting guidance did not affect our financial condition or results of operations.Derivatives and hedging. In March 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedging instrument does not, by itself, require dedesignation, but all other hedge accounting criteria must be met. This accounting guidance was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (effective January 1, 2017, for us) and was implemented using a prospective method. The adoption of this accounting guidance did not affect our financial condition or results of operations.Accounting Guidance Pending Adoption at June 30, 2017 Compensation. In May 2017, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that clarifies when changes to terms and conditions for share-based payment awards should be accounted for as modifications. According to the new guidance, entities should apply the modification guidance unless the fair value of the modified award is the same as the fair value of the original award immediately before modification, the vesting conditions of the modified award are the same as the vesting conditions of the original award immediately before modification and the classification of the modified award (as equity or liability instrument) is the same as the classification of the original award immediately before modification. This accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (effective January 1, 2018, for us). The guidance should be applied on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted, including in interim periods. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.Receivables. In March 2017, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that shortens the amortization period to the earliest call date for certain callable debt securities held at a premium. Securities held at a discount will continue to be amortized to maturity. This accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (effective January 1, 2019, for us). The guidance should be applied on a modified retrospective basis using a cumulative-effect adjustment. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.Compensation. In March 2017, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that requires service cost to be included in the same line item as certain other compensation costs related to services rendered by employees. We record compensation costs under personnel expense on the income statement. Other elements of net benefit cost should be presented separately. This accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (effective January 1, 2018, for us). The guidance should be applied on a retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted within the first interim period if the entity issues interim financial statements. The adoption of this guidance will result in a reclass of certain net benefit cost components from personnel expense to other expense on the income statement. There would be no material impact to our financial condition or results of operations.Other income. In February 2017, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that clarifies the scope of asset derecognition guidance and accounting for partial sales of nonfinancial assets. The guidance clarifies that financial assets may be within scope of the derecognition guidance if they are promised to a counterparty in a contract and substantially all the fair value of the assets in the contract are concentrated in nonfinancial assets, which are collectively referred to as in substance nonfinancial assets. The guidance requires entities to derecognize a nonfinancial asset or in substance nonfinancial asset when a counterparty obtains controls of it, and in a partial sale transaction when it does not have a controlling financial interest in the legal entity that holds the asset and when it transfers control of the asset. This accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (effective January 1, 2018, for us). The guidance may be applied on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning 65Table of Contentsafter December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact that this accounting guidance may have on our financial condition or results of operations.Goodwill and Other Intangibles. In January 2017, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that simplifies the test for goodwill impairment by eliminating the second step of the current two-step method. Under the new guidance, entities will compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, the entity is required to recognize an impairment charge for this amount. Current guidance requires an entity to proceed to a second step, whereby the entity would determine the fair value of its assets and liabilities. The new method applies to all reporting units. The option to perform a qualitative assessment is still allowable. This accounting guidance is effective prospectively for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 (effective January 1, 2020, for us). Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this accounting guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Business combinations. In January 2017, the FASB issued accounting guidance that clarifies the definition of a business and removes the requirement for a market participant to consider whether it could replace missing elements in an integrated set of assets and activities. The guidance states that if substantially all of the fair value of the assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. This accounting guidance will be effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (effective January 1, 2018, for us) and should be implemented using a prospective approach. Early application is allowed for transactions for which the acquisition date occurs before the issuance date or effective date of the amendments, as long as the transaction has not been reported in financial statements that have been issued or made available for issuance, and for transactions in which a subsidiary is deconsolidated or a group of assets is derecognized that occurs before the issuance date or effective date of the amendments, as long as the transaction has not been reported in financial statements that have been issued or made available for issuance. This guidance will not affect our financial condition or results of operations unless we acquire or dispose of a business subsequent to the date of adoption. Statement of cash flows. In November 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance requiring restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents to be included with other cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts presented on the statement of cash flows. This accounting guidance will be effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (effective January 1, 2018, for us) and should be implemented using a retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this accounting guidance may affect the presentation in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Income taxes. In October 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance requiring an entity to recognize any deferred taxes from an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. This accounting guidance will be effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (effective January 1, 2018, for us) and should be implemented using a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted but only as of the beginning of an annual reporting period for which financial statements have not yet been issued. The adoption of this accounting guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Statement of cash flows. In August 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that clarifies how cash receipts and cash payments in certain specific transactions should be presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. These specific transactions include, but are not limited to, debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, contingent considerations made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, and distributions from equity method investees. This guidance also clarifies that in instances of cash flows with multiple aspects that cannot be separately identified, classification should be based on the activity that is likely to be the predominant source of or use of cash flow. This accounting guidance will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (effective January 1, 2018, for us) and should be implemented using a retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this accounting guidance may affect the presentation in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.Financial instruments. In June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that changes the methodology for recognizing credit losses related to financial instruments. Under current GAAP, a credit loss is not recognized until it is probable that the loss has been incurred. The new accounting guidance eliminates that threshold and expands the information required for an entity to consider when developing an estimate of expected credit losses, including the use of forecast information. Entities will be required to present financial assets measured on an amortized cost basis at the net amount that is expected to be collected. This new guidance will impact the accounting for our loans, debt securities available for sale, and liability for credit losses on unfunded lending-related commitments, as well as purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit 66Table of Contentsdeterioration since origination. This accounting guidance will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 (effective January 1, 2020, for us). Early adoption is permitted but only for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. This guidance must be implemented using a modified retrospective basis except that a prospective approach must be used for debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized before the effective date. A prospective transition approach also should be used for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. We are currently evaluating the impact that this accounting guidance may have on our financial condition or results of operations and related disclosures.Leases. In February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that requires a lessee to recognize a liability to make lease payments, and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use an underlying asset during the lease term for both finance and operating leases. The definition of a lease was modified to exemplify the concept of control over an asset identified in the lease. Lease classification criteria remain substantially similar to criteria in current lease guidance. The guidance defines which payments can be used in determining lease classification. For short-term leases with a term of 12 months or less, lessees can make a policy election not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Lessor accounting is largely unchanged. Leveraged leases that commenced before the effective date of the new guidance are grandfathered. New disclosures are required, and certain practical expedients are allowed upon adoption. This accounting and disclosure guidance will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (effective January 1, 2019, for us) and should be implemented using the modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently working to identify our complete lease population, including potential embedded leases. We expect the adoption of this standard to result in additional assets and liabilities, as we will be required to recognize operating leases on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Other implementation matters to be addressed include, but are not limited to, the determination of effects on our financial and capital ratios and the quantification of the impacts that this accounting guidance may have on our financial condition or results of operations.Financial instruments. In January 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that requires equity investments, except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or consolidated, to be measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income. If there is no readily determinable fair value, the guidance allows entities the ability to measure investments at cost less impairment, whereby impairment is based on a qualitative assessment. The guidance eliminates the requirement to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost and changes the presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities on the balance sheet or in the footnotes. If an entity has elected the fair value option to measure liabilities, the new accounting guidance requires the portion of the change in the fair value of a liability resulting from credit risk to be presented in OCI. We have not elected to measure any of our liabilities at fair value, and therefore, this aspect of the guidance is not applicable to us. This accounting and disclosure guidance will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (effective January 1, 2018, for us). For the guidance that is applicable to us, the accounting will be implemented on a modified retrospective basis though a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet, except for the guidance related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values, which should be applied on a prospective basis. Except under certain instances, early adoption is not permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.Revenue recognition. In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance that revises the criteria for determining when to recognize revenue from contracts with customers and expands disclosure requirements. The core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance provides a five-step model to be followed in making this determination. This accounting guidance can be implemented using either a retrospective method or a cumulative-effect approach. This new guidance will be effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (effective January 1, 2018, for us). Early adoption is permitted but only for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We have elected to implement this new accounting guidance using a cumulative-effect approach. We have identified the revenue line items within scope of the new guidance and are currently finalizing our in-depth contract testing related to card and ATM fees, investment management and trust fees, insurance commissions and fees and investment services fees. Based on the completed contract reviews thus far, the adoption of this accounting guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition nor results of operations. We are still evaluating the related disclosures and gross versus net reporting of revenues and expenses related to card interchange arrangements as well as underwriting services provided by our broker-dealer. 672. Business Combination First NiagaraOn August 1, 2016 (the “Acquisition Date”), we acquired all of the outstanding common shares of First Niagara, the parent company of First Niagara Bank, for total consideration of approximately $4.0 billion and thereby acquired First Niagara Bank’s approximately 390 branch locations across New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. The merger with First Niagara enabled us to expand in the New England market and into the Pennsylvania market, improve our core deposit base, and add additional scale in our banking operations. The results of First Niagara’s operations are included in our consolidated financial statements from the Acquisition Date.Under the terms of the merger agreement, each outstanding share of First Niagara common stock was converted into the rightto receive 0.680 KeyCorp Common Shares and $2.30 in cash, for a total per-share value of $10.26, based on the $11.70 closing price of KeyCorp’s stock on July 29, 2016. In the aggregate, First Niagara stockholders received 240 million shares of KeyCorp common stock. Also under the terms of the merger agreement, First Niagara employee stock options and restricted stock awards converted into options to purchase and receive KeyCorp common stock. These options and restricted stock awards had a fair value of $26 million on the Acquisition Date. Our methodology for valuing employee stock options is disclosed in Note 16 (“Stock-Based Compensation”) under the heading “Stock Options” on page 179 of our 2016 Form 10-K. Our methodology for valuing restricted stock awards is disclosed in Note 16 (“Stock-Based Compensation”) under the heading “Long-Term Incentive Compensation Program” on page 180 of our 2016 Form 10-K.In addition, at the time of the merger, each share of First Niagara preferred stock, Series B, was converted into the right to receive a share of KeyCorp preferred stock, Series C, a newly created series of KeyCorp preferred stock. Additional information on this series of preferred stock is provided in Note 18 (“Shareholders' Equity”) of this report.On October 7, 2016, First Niagara Bank merged with and into KeyBank, with KeyBank as the surviving entity. Systems and client conversion also occurred during the fourth quarter of 2016 in connection with the bank merger. The acquisition of First Niagara constituted a business combination and was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and the consideration paid were recorded at their estimated fair value as of the Acquisition Date. The following table provides the final purchase price calculation as of the Acquisition Date and the identifiable assets purchased and the liabilities assumed at their fair value. These fair value measurements were based on internal and third-party valuations.in millions  Consideration paid:  KeyCorp common stock issued $2,831Cash payments to First Niagara stockholders 811Exchange of First Niagara preferred stock for KeyCorp preferred stock 350Total consideration paid $3,992   Statement of Net Assets Acquired at Fair Value:  ASSETS  Cash and due from banks and short-term investments$620 Investment securities9,012 Other investments297 Loans23,590 Premises and equipment245 Other intangible assets385 Accrued income and other assets1,467 Total assets$35,616    LIABILITIES  Deposits$28,994 Bank notes and other short-term borrowings2,698 Accrued expense and other liabilities490 Long-term debt846 Total liabilities$33,028    Net identifiable assets acquired 2,588Goodwill $1,404   68Measurement Period AdjustmentsWe estimated the fair value of loans acquired from First Niagara by utilizing the discounted cash flow method within the income approach. This methodology aggregates the purchased loans by category and risk rating. Cash flows for each category were determined by estimating future credit losses and the rate of prepayments. Projected monthly cash flows were then discounted to present value based on a market rate for similar loans. There was no carryover of First Niagara’s ALLL associated with the loans we acquired. The valuation of the acquired loans was final at June 30, 2017. Based on the final valuations, we updated our fair values within our Consolidated Balance Sheet with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill. These changes are reflected in the following table:in millions    Acquired AssetBalance Sheet Line ItemProvisional EstimateFinalIncrease (Decrease)LoansLoans$23,645$23,590$(55)Tax adjustment on previous fair value measurement (a)Accrued income and other assets1,4491,46718Unfunded lending-related commitmentsAccrued expense and other liabilities6765(2)Deferred compensation (a)Accrued expense and other liabilities39412(a)The fair value adjustment did not have any impact on the income statement for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017.The finalization of the fair values also impacted various income statement line items on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The estimated cash flows not expected to be collected at the Acquisition Date were $500 million. These amounts do not include loans held for sale and the loans that were divested as part of the 18 First Niagara Bank branches that were sold on September 9, 2016.Intangible assets consisted of the core deposit intangible, the commercial purchased credit card relationships, the consumer purchased credit card relationships, and other intangible assets. The core deposit intangible asset of $356 million recognized as part of the First Niagara merger is being amortized over its estimated useful life of approximately ten years utilizing an accelerated method. The commercial purchased credit card relationships recognized as part of the First Niagara merger are being amortized over their estimated useful life of approximately six years utilizing an accelerated method. The consumer purchased credit card relationships recognized as part of the First Niagara merger are being amortized over their estimated useful life of approximately nine years utilizing an accelerated method.Goodwill of $1.4 billion was recorded as a result of the transaction and is not amortized for book purposes. Of this total, $1.1 billion of goodwill was assigned to our Key Community Bank segment and $280 million of goodwill was assigned to our Key Corporate Bank segment. The goodwill recorded is not deductible for tax purposes.

The fair values of savings and transaction deposit accounts acquired from First Niagara were assumed to approximate the carrying value as these accounts have no stated maturity and are payable on demand. These cash flows were discounted based on a market rate for a certificate of deposit with a corresponding maturity.Direct acquisition costs related to the First Niagara acquisition were expensed as incurred and amounted to less than $1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017. These direct acquisition costs are part of our total merger-related charges.The following table presents unaudited pro forma information as if the acquisition of First Niagara had occurred on January 1, 2015. This pro forma information gives effect to certain adjustments, including purchase accounting fair value adjustments, amortization of core deposit and other intangibles, and related income tax effects. Merger-related charges related to the First Niagara merger that we incurred during the six months ended June 30, 2016, are not reflected in the unaudited pro forma amounts. The pro forma information does not necessarily reflect the results of operations that would have occurred had KeyCorp merged with First Niagara at the beginning of 2015.

Earnings Per Common Share Basic earnings per share is the amount of earnings (adjusted for dividends declared on our preferred stock) available to each common share outstanding during the reporting periods. Diluted earnings per share is the amount of earnings available to each common share outstanding during the reporting periods adjusted to include the effects of potentially dilutive common shares. Potentially dilutive common shares include stock options and other stock-based awards. Potentially dilutive common shares are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in the periods where the effect would be antidilutive. On March 20, 2017, all outstanding Series A Preferred Stock was converted into KeyCorp common shares. Prior to this conversion, for diluted earnings per share, net income available to common shareholders could have been affected by the conversion of our convertible Series A Preferred Stock. Where the effect of this conversion would have been dilutive, net income available to common shareholders was adjusted by the amount of preferred dividends associated with our Series A Preferred Stock.Our basic and diluted earnings per common share are calculated as follows: Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30,dollars in millions, except per share amounts20172016 20172016EARNINGS     Income (loss) from continuing operations$407$198 $732$385Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests—(1) 1(1)Income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Key407199 731386Less: Dividends on Preferred Stock146 4211Income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders393193 689375Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes (a)53 54Net income (loss) attributable to Key common shareholders$398$196 $694$379WEIGHTED-AVERAGE COMMON SHARES     Weighted-average common shares outstanding (000)1,076,203831,899 1,083,486829,640Effect of convertible preferred stock—— ——Effect of common share options and other stock awards16,8366,597 15,8087,138Weighted-average common shares and potential common shares outstanding (000) (b)1,093,039838,496 1,099,294836,778EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE     Income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders$.36$.23 $.64$.45Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes (a)—— ——Net income (loss) attributable to Key common shareholders (c).37.23 .64.45      Income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders — assuming dilution$.36$.23 $.63$.44Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes (a)—— ——Net income (loss) attributable to Key common shareholders — assuming dilution (c).36.23 .63.45(a)In September 2009, we decided to discontinue the education lending business conducted through Key Education Resources, the education payment and financing unit of KeyBank.

Asset Quality We assess the credit quality of the loan portfolio by monitoring net credit losses, levels of nonperforming assets, delinquencies, and credit quality ratings as defined by management. Nonperforming loans are loans for which we do not accrue interest income, and include commercial and consumer loans and leases, as well as current year TDRs and nonaccruing TDR loans from prior years. Nonperforming assets include nonperforming loans, nonperforming loans held for sale, OREO, and other nonperforming assets. Nonimpaired acquired loans are placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming or past due using the same criteria applied to the originated portfolio. PCI loans cannot be classified as nonperforming loans or TDRs.Our nonperforming assets and past due loans were as follows:in millionsJune 30, 2017December 31, 2016Total nonperforming loans (a)$507$625OREO (b)4851Other nonperforming assets1—Total nonperforming assets$556$676Nonperforming assets from discontinued operations—education lending (c)$5$5TDRs included in nonperforming loans193141TDRs with an allocated specific allowance (d)7259Specifically allocated allowance for restructured loans (e)2527Accruing loans past due 90 days or more$85$87Accruing loans past due 30 through 89 days340404 (a)Nonperforming loan balances exclude $835 million and $865 million of PCI loans at June 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively.(b)Includes carrying value of foreclosed residential real estate of approximately $29 million and $29 million at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.(c)Restructured loans of approximately $24 million and $22 million are included in discontinued operations at June 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively. See Note 12 (“Acquisition, Divestiture, and Discontinued Operations”) for further discussion.(d)Included in individually impaired loans allocated a specific allowance.(e)Included in allowance for individually evaluated impaired loans.We evaluate purchased loans for impairment in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. Purchased loans that have evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination and for which it is probable, at acquisition, that all contractually required payments will not be collected are deemed PCI. Several factors are considered when evaluating whether a loan is considered a PCI loan, including the delinquency status of the loan, updated borrower credit status, and updated LTV ratios. In accordance with ASC 310-30, excluded from the purchased impaired loans are leases, revolving credit arrangements, and loans held for sale. We estimated the fair value of loans acquired from First Niagara by utilizing the discounted cash flow method within the income approach. See Note 2 (“Business Combination”) for further discussion of the fair value methodology used. There was no carryover of First Niagara’s ALLL associated with the loans we acquired.The excess of a PCI loan’s contractually required payments over the amount of its undiscounted cash flows expected to be collected is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. The nonaccretable difference, which is not accreted into income, reflects estimated future credit losses and uncollectible contractual interest expected to be incurred over the life of the PCI loan or pool. The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the carrying amount of the PCI loans or pools is referred to as the accretable yield. This amount is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the PCI loans or pools using the level yield method. Over the life of PCI loans or pools, Key evaluates the remaining contractually required payments receivable and estimates cash flows expected to be collected. Contractually required payments receivable may increase or decrease for a variety of reasons, such as, when the contractual terms of the loan agreement are modified, when interest rates on variable rate loans change, or when principal and/or interest payments are received. Cash flows expected to be collected on PCI loans are estimated by incorporating several primary assumptions similar to the initial estimate of fair value. These primary assumptions include probability of default, loss given default, and prepayment rate. Increases in expected cash flows of PCI loans or pools subsequent to acquisition are recognized prospectively through adjustment of the yield on the loans or pools over its remaining life, while decreases in expected cash flows are recognized as impairment through a provision for credit losses and an increase in the ALLL. The difference between the fair value of a nonimpaired acquired loan and contractual amounts due at the Acquisition Date is accreted into income over the estimated life of the loan or pool. Contractually required payments represent the total undiscounted amount of all uncollected principal and interest payments. 73Table of ContentsThe following table presents the PCI loans receivable balance at the First Niagara Acquisition Date:August 1, 2016PCIin millionsContractual required payments receivable$1,434Nonaccretable difference173Expected cash flows1,261Accretable yield172Fair value$1,089  At the First Niagara Acquisition Date, the contractual required payments receivable on the purchased non-impaired loans totaled $22.5 billion, with a corresponding estimated fair value of $22.0 billion. The estimated cash flows not expected to be collected at the Acquisition Date were $500 million. These amounts do not include loans held for sale and the loans that were divested as part of the 18 branches that were sold on September 9, 2016.In addition to the PCI loans acquired with the First Niagara acquisition in the third quarter of 2016, Key has PCI loans from an earlier acquisition in 2012. At the 2012 acquisition date, the estimated gross contractual amount receivable of all PCI loans totaled $41 million. The estimated cash flows not expected to be collected (the nonaccretable amount) were $11 million, and the accretable amount was approximately $5 million. The following tables present the roll-forward of the accretable yield and the beginning and ending outstanding unpaid principal balance and carrying amount of all PCI loans for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, and the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The roll-forward of the accretable yield for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, reflects the impact of prospective purchase accounting adjustments resulting from the finalization of the First Niagara Acquisition Date loan valuation.

Acquired loans that were previously modified in a TDR are no longer classified as TDRs at the Acquisition Date. An acquired loan may only be classified as a TDR if a modification meeting the above TDR criteria is performed after the Acquisition Date. PCI loans cannot be classified as TDRs. All commercial and consumer loan TDRs, regardless of size, are individually evaluated for impairment to determine the probable loss content and are assigned a specific loan loss allowance. This designation has the effect of moving the loan from the general reserve methodology (i.e., collectively evaluated) to the specific reserve methodology (i.e., individually evaluated) and may impact the ALLL through a charge-off or increased loan loss provision. These components affect the ultimate allowance level. Additional information regarding TDRs for discontinued operations is provided in Note 12 (“Acquisition, Divestiture, and Discontinued Operations”). Commercial loan TDRs are considered defaulted when principal and interest payments are 90 days past due. Consumer loan TDRs are considered defaulted when principal and interest payments are more than 60 days past due. During the three months ended June 30, 2017, there were no commercial loan TDRs and 52 consumer loan TDRs with a combined recorded investment of $2 million that experienced payment defaults after modifications resulting in TDR status during 2016. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, there were no commercial loan TDRs and 41 consumer loan TDRs with a combined recorded investment of $2 million that experienced payment defaults after modifications resulting in TDR status during 2015. During the six months ended June 30, 2017, there were no commercial loan TDRs and 55 consumer loan TDRs with a combined recorded investment of $2 million that experienced payment defaults after modifications resulting in TDR status during 2016. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, there were no commercial loan TDRs and 91 consumer TDRs with a combined recorded investment of $4 million that experienced payment defaults after modifications resulting in TDR status during 2015.As TDRs are individually evaluated for impairment under the specific reserve methodology, subsequent defaults do not generally have a significant additional impact on the ALLL. Commitments outstanding to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loan terms have been modified in TDRs are $26 million and $14 million at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.Our loan modifications are handled on a case-by-case basis and are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan collectability and meet the borrower’s financial needs. Our concession types are primarily interest rate 77Table of Contentsreductions, forgiveness of principal, and other modifications. The commercial TDR other concession category includes modification of loan terms, covenants, or conditions. The consumer TDR other concession category primarily includes those borrowers’ debts that are discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not been formally re-affirmed. At June 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, the recorded investment of consumer residential mortgage loans in the process of foreclosure was approximately $142 million and $141 million, respectively.The following table shows the post-modification outstanding recorded investment by concession type for our commercial and consumer accruing and nonaccruing TDRs that occurred during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, and June 30, 2016.

Evaluation of this risk is stratified and monitored by the loan risk rating grades assigned for the commercial loan portfolios and the refreshed FICO score assigned for the consumer loan portfolios. Most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or scoring. Loan grades are assigned at the time of origination, verified by credit risk management, and periodically re-evaluated thereafter. This risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling. Commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings. The first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation; the second rating reflects expected recovery rates on the credit facility. Default probability is determined based on, among other factors, the financial strength of the borrower, an assessment of the borrower’s management, the borrower’s competitive position within its industry sector, and our view of industry risk in the context of the general economic outlook. Types of exposure, transaction structure, and collateral, including credit risk mitigants, affect the expected recovery assessment.Commercial Credit Exposure — Excluding PCICredit Risk Profile by Creditworthiness Category (a), (b) in millionsCommercial and industrialRE — CommercialRE — ConstructionCommercial leaseTotal June 30,December 31,June 30,December 31,June 30,December 31,June 30,December 31,June 30,December 31,RATING2017201620172016201720162017201620172016Pass$38,977$37,845$14,084$14,308$2,105$2,287$4,654$4,632$59,820$59,072Criticized (Accruing)1,6571,514400455303072452,1592,044Criticized (Nonaccruing)178297342642118227333Total$40,812$39,656$14,518$14,789$2,139$2,319$4,737$4,685$62,206$61,449           (a)Credit quality indicators are updated on an ongoing basis and reflect credit quality information as of the dates indicated.(b)The term criticized refers to those loans that are internally classified by Key as special mention or worse, which are asset quality categories defined by regulatory authorities.

The scores are obtained from a nationally recognized consumer rating agency and are presented in the above table at the dates indicated.We determine the appropriate level of the ALLL on at least a quarterly basis. The methodology for this determination is described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses” beginning on page 109 of our 2016 Form 10-K. We apply expected loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of qualitative factors such as changes in economic conditions, changes in credit policies or underwriting standards, and changes in the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets.For all commercial and consumer loan TDRs, regardless of size, as well as for impaired commercial loans with an outstanding balance of $2.5 million or greater, we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss content and assign a specific allowance to the loan. We estimate the extent of the individual impairment for commercial loans and TDRs by comparing the recorded investment of the loan with the estimated present value of its future cash flows, the fair value of its underlying collateral, or the loan’s observable market price. Secured consumer loan TDRs that are discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not formally re-affirmed are adjusted to reflect the fair value of the underlying collateral, less costs to sell. Non-Chapter 7 consumer loan TDRs are combined in homogenous pools and assigned a specific allocation based on the estimated present value of future cash flows using the loan’s effective interest rate. A specific allowance also may be assigned, even when sources of repayment appear sufficient, if we remain uncertain about whether the loan will be repaid in full. On at least a quarterly basis, we evaluate the appropriateness of our loss estimation methods to reduce differences between estimated incurred losses and actual losses. 80Table of ContentsCommercial loans are generally charged off in full or charged down to the fair value of the underlying collateral when the borrower’s payment is 180 days past due. Consumer loans are generally charged off when payments are 120 days past due. Home equity and residential mortgage loans are generally charged down to net realizable value when payment is 180 days past due. Credit card loans and similar unsecured products are charged off when payments are 180 days past due.The ALLL on the acquired non-impaired loan portfolio is estimated using the same methodology as is used for the originated portfolio, however, the estimated ALLL is compared to the remaining accretable yield to determine if any incremental ALLL must be recorded. For PCI loans, Key estimates cash flows expected to be collected quarterly. Decreases in expected cash flows are recognized as impairment through a provision for credit losses and an increase in the ALLL. The ALLL at June 30, 2017, represents our best estimate of the probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date.A summary of the changes in the ALLL for the periods indicated is presented in the table below: Three months ended June 30,Six months ended June 30,in millions2017201620172016Balance at beginning of period — continuing operations$870$826$858$796     Charge-offs(82)(64)(159)(124)Recoveries16213535Net loans and leases charged off(66)(43)(124)(89)     Provision for loan and lease losses from continuing operations6671136147Balance at end of period — continuing operations$870$854$870$854     The changes in the ALLL by loan category for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, and June 30, 2016, are as follows:Three months ended June 30, 2017:in millionsMarch 31, 2017ProvisionCharge-offsRecoveriesJune 30, 2017Commercial and Industrial $512$54$(40)$2$528Commercial real estate:     Real estate — commercial mortgage1461(3)—144Real estate — construction29(1)——28Total commercial real estate loans175—(3)—172Commercial lease financing401(1)—40Total commercial loans72755(44)2740Real estate — residential mortgage18(6)(4)19Home equity loans53(7)(9)542Consumer direct loans247(8)225Credit cards3816(12)244Consumer indirect loans101(5)410Total consumer loans14311(38)14130Total ALLL — continuing operations87066(82)16870Discontinued operations23—(4)221Total ALLL — including discontinued operations$893$66$(86)$18$891      Three months ended June 30, 2016:in millionsMarch 31, 2016Provision Charge-offsRecoveriesJune 30, 2016Commercial and Industrial $477$68 $(35)$3$513Commercial real estate:      Real estate — commercial mortgage135(4) (2)6135Real estate — construction23(6) ——$17Total commercial real estate loans158(10) (2)6152Commercial lease financing433 (3)245Total commercial loans67861 (40)11710Real estate — residential mortgage20(1) (1)—18Home equity loans644 (7)465Consumer direct loans203 (6)219Credit cards316 (8)130Consumer indirect loans13(2) (2)312Total consumer loans14810 (24)10144Total ALLL — continuing operations82671(a) (64)21854Discontinued operations24— (6)220Total ALLL — including discontinued operations$850$71 $(70)$23$874       (a) Excludes a credit for losses on lending-related commitments of $19 million.81Table of ContentsSix months ended June 30, 2017:in millionsDecember 31, 2016Provision Charge-offsRecoveriesJune 30, 2017Commercial and Industrial $508$85 $(72)$7$528Commercial real estate:      Real estate — commercial mortgage1443 (3)—144Real estate — construction225 —1$28Total commercial real estate loans1668 (3)1172Commercial lease financing424 (8)240Total commercial loans71697 (83)10740Real estate — residential mortgage17(9) (2)39Home equity loans54(3) (17)842Consumer direct loans2416 (18)325Credit cards3826 (23)344Consumer indirect loans99 (16)810Total consumer loans14239 (76)25130Total ALLL — continuing operations858136(a) (159)35870Discontinued operations243 (10)421Total ALLL — including discontinued operations$882$139 $(169)$39$891       (a) Excludes a credit for losses on lending-related commitments of $7 million.Six months ended June 30, 2016: in millionsDecember 31, 2015Provision Charge-offsRecoveriesJune 30, 2016Commercial and Industrial $450$118 $(61)$6$513Commercial real estate:      Real estate — commercial mortgage134(4) (3)8135Real estate — construction25(9) —1$17Total commercial real estate loans159(13) (3)9152Commercial lease financing472 (6)245Total commercial loans656107 (70)17710Real estate — residential mortgage181 (3)218Home equity loans5718 (17)765Consumer direct loans208 (12)319Credit cards3212 (16)230Consumer indirect loans131 (6)412Total consumer loans14040 (54)18144Total ALLL — continuing operations796147(a) (124)35854Discontinued operations282 (15)520Total ALLL — including discontinued operations$824$149 $(139)$40$874       (a) Excludes a credit for losses on lending-related commitments of $6 million.Our allowance applies expected loss rates to our existing loans with similar risk characteristics as well as any adjustments to reflect our current assessment of qualitative factors, such as changes in economic conditions, underwriting standards, and concentrations of credit.

Fair Value MeasurementsFair Value DeterminationAs defined in the applicable accounting guidance, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in our principal market. We have established and documented our process for determining the fair values of our assets and liabilities, where applicable. Fair value is based on quoted market prices, when available, for identical or similar assets or liabilities. In the absence of quoted market prices, we determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities using valuation models or third-party pricing services. Both of these approaches rely on market-based parameters, when available, such as interest rate yield curves, option volatilities, and credit spreads, or on unobservable inputs. Unobservable inputs may be based on our judgment, assumptions, and estimates related to credit quality, liquidity, interest rates, and other relevant inputs.Valuation adjustments, such as those pertaining to counterparty and our own credit quality and liquidity, may be necessary to ensure that assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value. Credit valuation adjustments are made when market pricing does not accurately reflect the counterparty’s or our own credit quality. We make liquidity valuation adjustments to the fair value of certain assets to reflect the uncertainty in the pricing and trading of the instruments when we are unable to observe recent market transactions for identical or similar instruments. Liquidity valuation adjustments are based on the following factors: •the amount of time since the last relevant valuation;•whether there is an actual trade or relevant external quote available at the measurement date; and•volatility associated with the primary pricing components.We ensure that our fair value measurements are accurate and appropriate by relying upon various controls, including: •an independent review and approval of valuation models and assumptions;•recurring detailed reviews of profit and loss; and•a validation of valuation model components against benchmark data and similar products, where possible.We recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period. Quarterly, we review any changes to our valuation methodologies to ensure they are appropriate and justified, and refine our valuation methodologies if more market-based data becomes available. The Fair Value Committee, which is governed by ALCO, oversees the valuation process. Various working groups that report to the Fair Value Committee analyze and approve the underlying assumptions and valuation adjustments. Changes in valuation methodologies for Level 1 and Level 2 instruments are presented to the Accounting Policy group for approval. Changes in valuation methodologies for Level 3 instruments are presented to the Fair Value Committee for approval. The working groups are discussed in more detail in the qualitative disclosures within this note. Formal documentation of the fair valuation methodologies is prepared by the lines of business and support areas as appropriate. The documentation details the asset or liability class and related general ledger accounts, valuation techniques, fair value hierarchy level, market participants, accounting methods, valuation methodology, group responsible for valuations, and valuation inputs.Additional information regarding our accounting policies for determining fair value is provided in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Fair Value Measurements” beginning on page 110 of our 2016 Form 10-K.Qualitative Disclosures of Valuation TechniquesLoans. Most loans recorded as trading account assets are valued based on market spreads for similar assets since they are actively traded. Therefore, these loans are classified as Level 2 because the fair value recorded is based on observable market data for similar assets.Securities (trading and available for sale). We own several types of securities, requiring a range of valuation methods: •Securities are classified as Level 1 when quoted market prices are available in an active market for the identical securities. Level 1 instruments include exchange-traded equity securities.84Table of Contents•Securities are classified as Level 2 if quoted prices for identical securities are not available, and fair value is determined using pricing models (either by a third-party pricing service or internally) or quoted prices of similar securities. These instruments include municipal bonds, bonds backed by the U.S. government, corporate bonds, agency residential and CMBS, securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, money markets, and certain agency and corporate CMOs. Inputs to the pricing models include standard inputs (i.e. yields, benchmark securities, bids, and offers), actual trade data (i.e., spreads, credit ratings, and interest rates) for comparable assets, spread tables, matrices, high-grade scales, and option-adjusted spreads.•Securities are classified as Level 3 when there is limited activity in the market for a particular instrument. To determine fair value in such cases, depending on the complexity of the valuations required, we use internal models based on certain assumptions or a third-party valuation service. At June 30, 2017, our Level 3 instruments consist of two convertible preferred securities. Our Corporate Strategy group is responsible for reviewing the valuation model and determining the fair value of these investments on a quarterly basis. The securities are valued using a cash flow analysis of the associated private company issuers. The valuations of the securities are negatively affected by projected net losses of the associated private companies and positively affected by projected net gains.The fair values of our Level 2 securities available for sale are determined by a third-party pricing service. The valuations provided by the third-party pricing service are based on observable market inputs, which include benchmark yields, reported trades, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data obtained from market research publications. Inputs used by the third-party pricing service in valuing CMOs and other mortgage-backed securities also include new issue data, monthly payment information, whole loan collateral performance, and “To Be Announced” prices. In valuations of securities issued by state and political subdivisions, inputs used by the third-party pricing service also include material event notices.On a monthly basis, we validate the pricing methodologies utilized by our third-party pricing service to ensure that the fair value determination is consistent with the applicable accounting guidance and that our assets are properly classified in the fair value hierarchy. To perform this validation, we: •review documentation received from our third-party pricing service regarding the inputs used in their valuations and determine a level assessment for each category of securities;•substantiate actual inputs used for a sample of securities by comparing the actual inputs used by our third-party pricing service to comparable inputs for similar securities; and•substantiate the fair values determined for a sample of securities by comparing the fair values provided by our third-party pricing service to prices from other independent sources for the same and similar securities. We analyze variances and conduct additional research with our third-party pricing service and take appropriate steps based on our findings.Principal investments. Principal investments consist of investments in equity and debt instruments made by our principal investing entities. They include direct investments (investments made in a particular company) and indirect investments (investments made through funds that include other investors). Our principal investing entities are accounted for as investment companies in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, whereby each investment is adjusted to fair value with any net realized or unrealized gain/loss recorded in the current period’s earnings. This process is a coordinated and documented effort by the Principal Investing Entities Deal Team (individuals from one of the independent investment managers who oversee these instruments), accounting staff, and the Investment Committee (individual employees and one of the independent investment managers). This process involves an in-depth review of the condition of each investment depending on the type of investment.Our direct investments include investments in debt and equity instruments of both private and public companies. When quoted prices are available in an active market for the identical direct investment, we use the quoted prices in the valuation process, and the related investments are classified as Level 1 assets. In most cases, quoted market prices are not available for our direct investments, and we must perform valuations using other methods. These direct investment valuations are an in-depth analysis of the condition of each investment and are based on the unique facts and circumstances related to each individual investment. There is a certain amount of subjectivity surrounding the valuation of these investments due to the combination of quantitative and qualitative factors that are used in the valuation models. Therefore, these direct investments are classified as Level 3 assets. The specific inputs used in the valuations of each type of direct investment are described below.Interest-bearing securities (i.e., loans) are valued on a quarterly basis. Valuation adjustments are determined by the Principal Investing Entities Deal Team and are subject to approval by the Investment Committee. Valuations of debt instruments are 85Table of Contentsbased on the Principal Investing Entities Deal Team’s knowledge of the current financial status of the subject company, which is regularly monitored throughout the term of the investment. Significant, unobservable inputs used in the valuations of these investments include the company’s payment history, adequacy of cash flows from operations, and current operatingresults, including market multiples and historical and forecast EBITDA. Inputs can also include the seniority of the debt, the nature of any pledged collateral, the extent to which the security interest is perfected, and the net liquidation value of collateral.Valuations of equity instruments of private companies, which are prepared on a quarterly basis, are based on current market conditions and the current financial status of each company. A valuation analysis is performed to value each investment. The valuation analysis is reviewed by the Principal Investing Entities Deal Team Member, and reviewed and approved by the Chief Administrative Officer of one of the independent investment managers. Significant unobservable inputs used in these valuations include adequacy of the company’s cash flows from operations, any significant change in the company’s performance since the prior valuation, and any significant equity issuances by the company. Equity instruments of public companies are valued using quoted prices in an active market for the identical security. If the instrument is restricted, the fair value is determined considering the number of shares traded daily, the number of the company’s total restricted shares, and price volatility.Our indirect investments include primary and secondary investments in private equity funds engaged mainly in venture- and growth-oriented investing. These investments do not have readily determinable fair values. Indirect investments are valued using a methodology that is consistent with accounting guidance allowing us to estimate fair value based upon net asset value per share (or its equivalent, such as member units or an ownership interest in partners’ capital to which a proportionate share of net assets is attributed). On January 13, 2017, Key filed for an additional extension for illiquid funds, to retain certain indirect investments until the earlier of the date on which the investment is conformed or is expected to mature, or July 21, 2022. The application for an extension was approved on February 14, 2017. As of June 30, 2017, we have not committed to a plan to sell these investments. Therefore, these investments continue to be valued using the net asset value per share methodology.For indirect investments, management may make adjustments it deems appropriate to the net asset value if it is determined that the net asset value does not properly reflect fair value. In determining the need for an adjustment to net asset value, management performs an analysis of the private equity funds based on the independent fund manager’s valuations as well as management’s own judgment. Management also considers whether the independent fund manager adequately marks down an impaired investment, maintains financial statements in accordance with GAAP, or follows a practice of holding all investments at cost.The following table presents the fair value of our direct and indirect principal investments and related unfunded commitments at June 30, 2017, as well as financial support provided for the six months ended June 30, 2017, and June 30, 2016.

Operations of the business enterprises are handled by management of the portfolio company. The purpose of funding these enterprises is to provide financial support for business development and acquisition strategies. We infuse equity capital based on an initial contractual cash contribution and later from additional requests on behalf of the companies’ management.(b)Our indirect investments consist of buyout funds, venture capital funds, and fund of funds. These investments are generally not redeemable. Instead, distributions are received through the liquidation of the underlying investments of the fund. An investment in any one of these funds typically can be sold only with the approval of the fund’s general partners. We estimate that the underlying investments of the funds will be liquidated over a period of one to eight years. The purpose of funding our capital commitments to these investments is to allow the funds to make additional follow-on investments and pay fund expenses until the fund dissolves. We, and all other investors in the fund, are obligated to fund the full amount of our respective capital commitments to the fund based on our and their respective ownership percentages, as noted in the applicable Limited Partnership Agreement.Loans Held for Sale. As of August 1, 2016, we account for our residential mortgage loans held for sale at fair value on a recurring basis. The election of the fair value option aligns the accounting for the residential mortgages held for sale with the related forward mortgage loan sale commitments. Residential mortgage loans are valued based on quoted market prices, where available, prices for other traded mortgage loans with similar characteristics, and purchase commitments and bid information received from market participants. The prices are adjusted as necessary to include the embedded servicing value in the loans and to take into consideration the specific 86Table of Contentscharacteristics of certain loans that are priced based on the pricing of similar loans. These adjustments represent unobservable inputs to the valuation but are not considered significant given the relative insensitivity of the value to changes in these inputs to the fair value of the loans. Accordingly, the majority of residential mortgage loans held for sale are classified as Level 2. Our residential mortgage activity also includes temporarily unsalable residential mortgage loans that are included in “Loans, net of unearned income” and loans with salability issues included in “Loans held for sale” on the balance sheet. These loans have an origination defect that makes them temporarily unable to be sold into the performing loan sales market. Because transaction details regarding sales of this type of loan are often unavailable, unobservable bid information from brokers and investors is heavily relied upon. Accordingly, based on the significance of unobservable inputs, these loans are classified as Level 3. Derivatives. Exchange-traded derivatives are valued using quoted prices and, therefore, are classified as Level 1 instruments. However, only a few types of derivatives are exchange-traded. The majority of our derivative positions are valued using internally developed models, based on market convention, that use observable market inputs, such as interest rate curves, LIBOR and Overnight Index Swap discount rates and curves, index pricing curves, foreign currency curves, and volatility surfaces (a three-dimensional graph of implied volatility against strike price and maturity), as well as current prices for mortgage securities and investor supplied prices. These derivative contracts, which are classified as Level 2 instruments, include interest rate swaps, certain options, cross-currency swaps, credit default swaps, and forward mortgage loan sale commitments. We have several customized derivative instruments and risk participations that are classified as Level 3 instruments. These derivative positions are valued using internally developed models, with inputs consisting of available market data, such as bond spreads and asset values, as well as unobservable, internally derived assumptions, such as loss probabilities and internal risk ratings of customers. These derivatives are priced monthly by our MRM group using a credit valuation adjustment methodology. Swap details with the customer and our related participation percentage, if applicable, are obtained from our derivatives accounting system, which is the system of record. Applicable customer rating information is obtained from the particular loan system and represents an unobservable input to this valuation process. Using these various inputs, a valuation of these Level 3 derivatives is performed using a model that was acquired from a third party. In summary, the fair value represents an estimate of the amount that the risk participation counterparty would need to pay/receive as of the measurement date based on the probability of customer default on the swap transaction and the fair value of the underlying customer swap. Therefore, a higher loss probability and a lower credit rating would negatively affect the fair value of the risk participations and a lower loss probability and higher credit rating would positively affect the fair value of the risk participations. As a result of the First Niagara acquisition, we acquired First Niagara’s residential mortgage business, which included interest rate lock commitments. These instruments are accounted for as a derivative and valued using models containing unobservable significant inputs. For valuation purposes, the loan amount associated with each interest rate lock commitment is adjusted by its modeled pull-through (an unobservable input) defined as the percentage of loans that will close prior to the expiration of the rate lock commitment, as adjusted for approved changes to the terms. Based on the significance of unobservable inputs, these instruments are classified as Level 3.Market convention implies a credit rating of “AA” equivalent in the pricing of derivative contracts, which assumes that all counterparties have the same creditworthiness. To reflect the actual exposure on our derivative contracts related to both counterparty and our own creditworthiness, we record a fair value adjustment in the form of a credit valuation adjustment. The credit component is determined by individual counterparty based on the probability of default and considers master netting and collateral agreements. The credit valuation adjustment is classified as Level 3. Our MRM group is responsible for the valuation policies and procedures related to this credit valuation adjustment. A weekly reconciliation process is performed to ensure that all applicable derivative positions are covered in the calculation, which includes transmitting customer exposures and reserve reports to trading management, derivative traders and marketers, derivatives middle office, and accounting personnel. On a quarterly basis, MRM prepares the credit valuation adjustment calculation, which includes a detailed reserve comparison with the previous quarter, an analysis for change in reserve, and a reserve forecast to ensure that the credit valuation adjustment recorded at period end is sufficient.Other assets and liabilities. The value of our short positions is driven by the valuation of the underlying securities. If quoted prices for identical securities are not available, fair value is determined by using pricing models or quoted prices of similar securities, resulting in a Level 2 classification. For interest rate-driven products, such as government bonds, U.S. Treasury bonds and other products backed by the U.S. government, inputs include spreads, credit ratings, and interest rates. For credit-driven products, such as corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities, inputs include actual trade data for comparable assets and bids and offers.  87Table of ContentsAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisCertain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis in accordance with GAAP.

The adjustments to fair value generally result from the application of accounting guidance that requires assets and liabilities to be recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, or assessed for impairment. There were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at June 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016. The following table presents our assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at June 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016: June 30, 2017 December 31, 2016in millionsLevel 1Level 2Level 3Total Level 1Level 2Level 3TotalASSETS MEASURED ON A NONRECURRING BASIS         Impaired loans—9$2$11 ——$11$11Loans held for sale (a)———— ————Accrued income and other assets——1010 ——1111Total assets on a nonrecurring basis at fair value—9$12$21 ——$22$22          (a)During the first six months of 2017, we transferred $17 million of commercial loans and leases at their current fair value from held-to-maturity portfolio to held-for-sale status, compared to $35 million during 2016.Impaired loans. We typically adjust the carrying amount of our impaired loans when there is evidence of probable loss and the expected fair value of the loan is less than its contractual amount. The amount of the impairment may be determined based on the estimated present value of future cash flows, the fair value of the underlying collateral, or the loan’s observable market price. Impaired loans with a specifically allocated allowance based on cash flow analysis or the value of the underlying collateral are classified as Level 3 assets. Impaired loans with a specifically allocated allowance based on an observable market price that reflects recent sale transactions for similar loans and collateral are classified as Level 2 assets.The evaluations for impairment are prepared by the responsible relationship managers in our Asset Recovery Group and are reviewed and approved by the Asset Recovery Group Executive. The Asset Recovery Group is part of the Risk Management Group and reports to our Chief Credit Officer. These evaluations are performed in conjunction with the quarterly ALLL process.Loans are evaluated for impairment on a quarterly basis. Loans included in the previous quarter’s review are re-evaluated, and if their values have changed materially, the underlying information (loan balance and in most cases, collateral value) is compared. Material differences are evaluated for reasonableness, and the relationship managers and their senior managers consider these differences and determine if any adjustment is necessary. The inputs are developed and substantiated on a quarterly basis based on current borrower developments, market conditions, and collateral values. The following two internal methods are used to value impaired loans: •Cash flow analysis considers internally developed inputs, such as discount rates, default rates, costs of foreclosure, and changes in collateral values.•The fair value of the collateral, which may take the form of real estate or personal property, is based on internal estimates, field observations, and assessments provided by third-party appraisers. We perform or reaffirm appraisals of collateral-dependent impaired loans at least annually. Appraisals may occur more frequently if the most recent appraisal does not accurately reflect the current market, if the debtor is seriously delinquent or chronically past due, or there has been a material deterioration in the performance of the project or condition of the property. Adjustments to outdated appraisals that result in an appraisal value less than the carrying amount of a collateral-dependent impaired loan are reflected in the ALLL.Impairment valuations are back-tested each quarter, based on a look-back of actual incurred losses on closed deals previously evaluated for impairment. The overall percent variance of actual net loan charge-offs on closed deals compared to the specific allocations on such deals is considered in determining each quarter’s specific allocations.Commercial loans held for sale. Through a quarterly analysis of our loan portfolios held for sale, which include both performing and nonperforming commercial loans, we determine any adjustments necessary to record the portfolios at the lower of cost or fair value in accordance with GAAP. Our analysis concluded that there were no commercial loans held for sale adjusted to fair value at June 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016.Market inputs, including updated collateral values, and reviews of each borrower’s financial condition influence the inputs used in our internal models and other valuation methodologies. The valuations are prepared by the responsible relationship managers or analysts in our Asset Recovery Group and are reviewed and approved by the Asset Recovery Group Executive. Actual gains 91Table of Contentsor losses realized on the sale of various commercial loans held for sale provide a back-testing mechanism for determining whether our valuations of these loans held for sale that are adjusted to fair value are appropriate.Valuations of performing commercial mortgage and construction loans held for sale are conducted using internal models that rely on market data from sales or nonbinding bids on similar assets, including credit spreads, treasury rates, interest rate curves, and risk profiles. These internal models also rely on our own assumptions about the exit market for the loans and details about individual loans within the respective portfolios. Therefore, we classify these loans as Level 3 assets. The inputs related to our assumptions and other internal loan data include changes in real estate values, costs of foreclosure, prepayment rates, default rates, and discount rates.Valuations of nonperforming commercial mortgage and construction loans held for sale are based on current agreements to sell the loans or approved, discounted payoffs. If a negotiated value is not available, we use third-party appraisals, adjusted for current market conditions. Since valuations are based on unobservable data, these loans are classified as Level 3 assets.Direct financing leases and operating lease assets held for sale. Our KEF Accounting and Capital Markets groups are responsible for the valuation policies and procedures related to these assets. The Managing Director of the KEF Capital Markets group reports to the President of the KEF line of business. A weekly report that lists all equipment finance deals booked in the warehouse portfolio is distributed to both groups. On a quarterly basis, the KEF Accounting group prepares a detailed held-for-sale roll-forward schedule that is reconciled to the general ledger and the above-mentioned weekly report. KEF management uses the held-for-sale roll-forward schedule to determine whether an impairment adjustment is necessary in accordance with lower of cost or fair value guidelines.Valuations of direct financing leases and operating lease assets held for sale are performed using an internal model that relies on market data, such as swap rates and bond ratings, as well as on our own assumptions about the exit market for the leases and details about the individual leases in the portfolio. The inputs based on our assumptions include changes in the value of leased items and internal credit ratings. These leases have been classified as Level 3 assets. KEF has master sale and assignment agreements with numerous institutional investors. Historically, multiple quotes are obtained, with the most reasonable formal quotes retained. These nonbinding quotes generally lead to a sale to one of the parties who provided the quote. Leases for which we receive a current nonbinding bid, and for which the sale is considered probable, may be classified as Level 2. The validity of these quotes is supported by historical and continued dealings with these institutions that have fulfilled the nonbinding quote in the past. In a distressed market where market data were not available, an estimate of the fair value of the leased asset may be used to value the lease, resulting in a Level 3 classification. In an inactive market, the market value of the assets held for sale is determined as the present value of the future cash flows discounted at the current buy rate. KEF Accounting calculates an estimated fair value buy rate based on the credit premium inherent in the relevant bond index and the appropriate swap rate on the measurement date. The amount of the adjustment is calculated as book value minus the present value of future cash flows discounted at the calculated buy rate.Goodwill and other intangible assets. On a quarterly basis, we review impairment indicators to determine whether we need to evaluate the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets assigned to Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. We also perform an annual impairment test for goodwill. Accounting guidance permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether additional goodwill impairment testing is required. We chose to utilize a qualitative assessment in our annual goodwill impairment testing performed during the fourth quarter of 2016. For additional information on the results of recent goodwill impairment testing, see Note 11 (“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”) beginning on page 166 of our 2016 Form 10-K.The fair value of other intangible assets is calculated using a cash flow approach. While the calculation to test for recoverability uses a number of assumptions that are based on current market conditions, the calculation is based primarily on unobservable assumptions. Accordingly, these assets are classified as Level 3. Our lines of business, with oversight from our Accounting group, are responsible for routinely, at least quarterly, assessing whether impairment indicators are present. All indicators that signal that impairment may exist are appropriately considered in this analysis. An impairment loss is only recognized for a held-and-used, long-lived asset if the sum of its estimated future undiscounted cash flows used to test for recoverability is less than its carrying value.Our primary assumptions include attrition rates, alternative costs of funds, and rates paid on deposits. For additional information on the results of other intangible assets impairment testing, see Note 11 (“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”) beginning on page 166 of our 2016 Form 10-K.Other assets. OREO and other repossessed properties are valued based on inputs such as appraisals and third-party price opinions, less estimated selling costs. Generally, we classify these assets as Level 3, but OREO and other repossessed 92Table of Contentsproperties for which we receive binding purchase agreements are classified as Level 2. Returned lease inventory is valued based on market data for similar assets and is classified as Level 2. Assets that are acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosures are recorded initially as held for sale at fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of foreclosure. After foreclosure, valuations are updated periodically, and current market conditions may require the assets to be marked down further to a new cost basis. •Commercial Real Estate Valuation Process: When a loan is reclassified from loan status to OREO because we took possession of the collateral, the Asset Recovery Group Loan Officer, in consultation with our OREO group, obtains a broker price opinion or a third-party appraisal, which is used to establish the fair value of the underlying collateral. The determined fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated selling costs becomes the carrying value of the OREO asset. In addition to valuations from independent third-party sources, our OREO group also writes down the carrying balance of OREO assets once a bona fide offer is contractually accepted, where the accepted price is lower than the current balance of the particular OREO asset. The fair value of OREO property is re-evaluated every 90 days, and the OREO asset is adjusted as necessary.•Residential Real Estate Valuation Process: The Asset Management team within our Risk Operations group is responsible for valuation policies and procedures of these loans. The current vendor partner provides monthly reporting of all broker price opinion evaluations, appraisals, and the monthly market plans. Market plans are reviewed monthly, and valuations are reviewed and tested monthly to ensure proper pricing has been established and guidelines are being met. Risk Operations Compliance validates and provides periodic testing of the valuation process. The Asset Management team reviews changes in fair value measurements. Third-party broker price opinions are reviewed every 180 days, and the fair value is written down based on changes to the valuation. External factors are documented and monitored as appropriate.Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value MeasurementsThe range and weighted average of the significant unobservable inputs used to fair value our material Level 3 recurring and nonrecurring assets at June 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, along with the valuation techniques used, are shown in the following table:June 30, 2017Fair Value ofLevel 3 AssetsValuation TechniqueSignificantUnobservable InputRange(Weighted Average)dollars in millionsRecurring    Other investments — principal investments — direct:$15Individual analysis of the condition of each investment  Debt instruments  EBITDA multiple5.70 - 6.30 (6.20)Nonrecurring    Impaired loans2Fair value of underlying collateralDiscount00.00 - 55.00% (16.00%)December 31, 2016Fair Value ofLevel 3 AssetsValuation TechniqueSignificantUnobservable InputRange(Weighted-Average)dollars in millionsRecurring    Other investments — principal investments — direct:$27Individual analysis of the condition of each investment  Debt instruments  EBITDA multiple6.30 - 7.00 (6.50)Equity instruments of private companies  EBITDA multiple (where applicable)N/A (6.3)Nonrecurring    Impaired loans11Fair value of underlying collateralDiscount00.00 - 70.00% (46.00%)93Table of ContentsFair Value Disclosures of Financial InstrumentsThe levels in the fair value hierarchy ascribed to our financial instruments and the related carrying amounts at June 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, are shown in the following tables: June 30, 2017  Fair Valuein millionsCarryingAmountLevel 1Level 2Level 3Measuredat NAVNettingAdjustment TotalASSETS        Cash and short-term investments (a)$3,123$3,123———— $3,123Trading account assets (b)1,0813$1,078——— 1,081Securities available for sale (b)18,024—18,004$20—— 18,024Held-to-maturity securities (c)10,638—10,463——— 10,463Other investments (b)732——580148— 728Loans, net of allowance (d)85,633——84,072—— 84,072Loans held for sale (b)1,743—631,680—— 1,743Derivative assets (b)6368695021—(421)(f)  636LIABILITIES        Deposits with no stated maturity (a)$91,930—$91,930——— $91,930Time deposits (e)10,891—10,979——— 10,979Short-term borrowings (a)2,704$1952,509——— 2,704Long-term debt (e)13,26113,023613——— 13,636Derivative liabilities (b)30885706——(483)(f)  308 December 31, 2016  Fair Valuein millionsCarryingAmountLevel 1Level 2Level 3Measuredat NAVNettingAdjustment TotalASSETS        Cash and short-term investments (a)$3,452$3,452———— $3,452Trading account assets (b)867—$867——— 867Securities available for sale (b)20,212320,192$17—— 20,212Held-to-maturity securities (c)10,232—10,007——— 10,007Other investments (b)738——569$164— 733Loans, net of allowance (d)85,180——83,285—— 83,285Loans held for sale (b)1,104—621,042—— 1,104Derivative assets (b)8031141,11010—$(431)(f)  803LIABILITIES        Deposits with no stated maturity (a)$93,906—$93,906——— $93,906Time deposits (e)10,181—10,267——— 10,267Short-term borrowings (a)2,310$1922,118——— 2,310Long-term debt (e)12,38412,386304——— 12,690Derivative liabilities (b)636102918——$(384)(f)  636Valuation Methods and Assumptions(a)Fair value equals or approximates carrying amount. The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity does not take into consideration the value ascribed to core deposit intangibles.(b)Information pertaining to our methodology for measuring the fair values of these assets and liabilities is included in the sections entitled “Qualitative Disclosures of Valuation Techniques” and “Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis” in this Note. Investments accounted for under the equity method are not included in this table. Investments accounted for under the cost method are classified as Level 3 assets. These investments are not actively traded in an open market as sales for these types of investments are rare. The carrying amount of the investments carried at cost are adjusted for declines in value if they are considered to be other-than-temporary. These adjustments are included in “other income” on the income statement. (c)Fair values of held-to-maturity securities are determined by using models that are based on security-specific details, as well as relevant industry and economic factors. The most significant of these inputs are quoted market prices, interest rate spreads on relevant benchmark securities, and certain prepayment assumptions. We review the valuations derived from the models to ensure that they are reasonable and consistent with the values placed on similar securities traded in the secondary markets.(d)The fair value of loans is based on the present value of the expected cash flows. The projected cash flows are based on the contractual terms of the loans, adjusted for prepayments and use of a discount rate based on the relative risk of the cash flows, taking into account the loan type, maturity of the loan, liquidity risk, servicing costs, and a required return on debt and capital. In addition, an incremental liquidity discount is applied to certain loans, using historical sales of loans during periods of similar economic conditions as a benchmark. The fair value of loans includes lease financing receivables at their aggregate carrying amount, which is equivalent to their fair value.(e)Fair values of time deposits and long-term debt are based on discounted cash flows utilizing relevant market inputs.(f)Netting adjustments represent the amounts recorded to convert our derivative assets and liabilities from a gross basis to a net basis in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. The net basis takes into account the impact of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements that allow us to settle all derivative contracts with a single counterparty on a net basis and to offset the net derivative position with the related cash collateral. Total derivative assets and liabilities include these netting adjustments.We use valuation methods based on exit market prices in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. We determine fair value based on assumptions pertaining to the factors that a market participant would consider in valuing the asset. A substantial portion of our fair value adjustments are related to liquidity. During 2016 and the first six months of 2017, the fair values of our 94Table of Contentsloan portfolios generally remained stable, primarily due to increasing liquidity in the loan markets. If we were to use different assumptions, the fair values shown in the preceding table could change. Also, because the applicable accounting guidance for financial instruments excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure requirements, the fair value amounts shown in the table above do not, by themselves, represent the underlying value of our company as a whole. Education lending business. The discontinued education lending business consists of loans in portfolio recorded at carrying value with appropriate valuation reserves, and loans in portfolio recorded at fair value. All of these loans were excluded from the table above as follows: •Loans at carrying value, net of allowance, of $1.4 billion ($1.2 billion at fair value) at June 30, 2017, and $1.5 billion ($1.3 billion at fair value) at December 31, 2016;•Portfolio loans at fair value of $2 million at June 30, 2017, and $3 million at December 31, 2016.These loans and securities are classified as Level 3 because we rely on unobservable inputs when determining fair value since observable market data is not available.Residential real estate mortgage loans. Residential real estate mortgage loans with carrying amounts of $5.5 billion at June 30, 2017, and $5.5 billion at December 31, 2016, are included in “Loans, net of allowance” in the previous table.Short-term financial instruments. For financial instruments with a remaining average life to maturity of less than six months, carrying amounts were used as an approximation of fair values.95Table of Contents7. Securities Securities available for sale. These are securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time but that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment risk, liquidity needs, or other factors. Securities available for sale are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses (net of income taxes) deemed temporary are recorded in equity as a component of AOCI on the balance sheet. Unrealized losses on equity securities deemed to be “other-than-temporary,” and realized gains and losses resulting from sales of securities using the specific identification method, are included in “other income” on the income statement. “Other securities” held in the available-for-sale portfolio consist primarily of convertible preferred stock issued by privately held companies.Unrealized losses on debt securities deemed to be “other-than-temporary” are included in “other income” on the income statement or in AOCI on the balance sheet in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance related to the recognition of OTTI of debt securities.Held-to-maturity securities. These are debt securities that we have the intent and ability to hold until maturity. Debt securities are carried at cost and adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts using the interest method. This method produces a constant rate of return on the adjusted carrying amount.“Other securities” held in the held-to-maturity portfolio consists primarily of foreign bonds.Unrealized losses on equity securities deemed to be “other-than-temporary,” and realized gains and losses resulting from sales of securities using the specific identification method, are included in “other income” on the income statement. Unrealized losses on debt securities deemed to be “other-than-temporary” are included in “other income” on the income statement or in AOCI on the balance sheet in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance related to the recognition of OTTI of debt securities.The amortized cost, unrealized gains and losses, and approximate fair value of our securities available for sale and held-to-maturity securities are presented in the following tables. Gross unrealized gains and losses represent the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of securities on the balance sheet as of the dates indicated. Accordingly, the amount of these gains and losses may change in the future as market conditions change.96Table of Contents June 30, 2017in millionsAmortizedCostGrossUnrealizedGainsGrossUnrealizedLossesFairValueSECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE    U.S. Treasury, agencies, and corporations$170—$2$168States and political subdivisions10$1—11Agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations14,4692820614,291Agency residential mortgage-backed securities1,6464121,638Agency commercial mortgage-backed securities 1,941—441,897Other securities172—19Total securities available for sale$18,253$35$264$18,024HELD TO MATURITY SECURITIES    Agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations$8,216$4$149$8,071Agency residential mortgage-backed securities63014627Agency commercial mortgage-backed securities1,7776331,750Other securities15——15Total held-to-maturity securities$10,638$11$186$10,463      December 31, 2016in millionsAmortizedCostGrossUnrealizedGainsGrossUnrealizedLossesFairValueSECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE    U.S. Treasury, agencies, and corporations$188—$4$184States and political subdivisions11——11Agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations16,652$3127516,408Agency residential mortgage-backed securities1,8576171,846Agency commercial mortgage-backed securities 1,778—351,743Other securities21—120Total securities available for sale$20,507$37$332$20,212HELD TO MATURITY SECURITIES    Agency residential collateralized mortgage obligations$8,404$1$173$8,232Agency residential mortgage-backed securities629—5624Agency commercial mortgage-backed securities1,1841491,136Other securities15——15Total held-to-maturity securities$10,232$2$227$10,007     97Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes our securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of June 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016.

These securities had a weighted-average maturity of 4.05 years at June 30, 2017. We also had $12 million of gross unrealized losses related to 236 agency residential mortgage-backed securities positions, which had a weighted-average maturity of 4.06 years at June 30, 2017. Because these securities have a fixed interest rate, their fair value is sensitive to movements in market interest rates. These unrealized losses are considered temporary since we expect to collect all contractually due amounts from these securities. Accordingly, these investments were reduced to their fair value through OCI, not through earnings.We regularly assess our securities portfolio for OTTI. The assessments are based on the nature of the securities, the underlying collateral, the financial condition of the issuer, the extent and duration of the loss, our intent related to the individual securities, and the likelihood that we will have to sell securities prior to expected recovery.The debt securities identified as OTTI are written down to their current fair value. For those debt securities that we intend to sell, or more likely than not will be required to sell prior to the expected recovery of the amortized cost, the entire impairment (i.e., the difference between amortized cost and the fair value) is recognized in earnings. For those debt securities that we do not intend to sell, or more likely than not will not be required to sell prior to expected recovery, the credit portion of OTTI is recognized in earnings, while the remaining OTTI is recognized in equity as a component of AOCI on the balance sheet. As shown in the following table, we did not have any impairment losses recognized in earnings for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, and June 30, 2016.Six months ended June 30, 2017 in millions Balance at December 31, 2016$4Impairment recognized in earnings—Balance at June 30, 2017$4  For the six months ended June 30, 2017, net realized securities gains totaled less than $1 million.98Table of ContentsAt June 30, 2017, securities available for sale and held-to-maturity securities totaling $7.7 billion were pledged to secure securities sold under repurchase agreements, to secure public and trust deposits, to facilitate access to secured funding, and for other purposes required or permitted by law.The following table shows our securities by remaining maturity. CMOs and other mortgage-backed securities (both of which are included in the securities available-for-sale portfolio) as well as the CMOs in the held-to-maturity portfolio are presented based on their expected average lives. The remaining securities, in both the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity portfolios, are presented based on their remaining contractual maturity. Actual maturities may differ from expected or contractual maturities since borrowers have the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties.

Derivatives and Hedging Activities We are a party to various derivative instruments, mainly through our subsidiary, KeyBank. Derivative instruments are contracts between two or more parties that have a notional amount and an underlying variable, require a small or no net investment, and allow for the net settlement of positions. A derivative’s notional amount serves as the basis for the payment provision of the contract and takes the form of units, such as shares or dollars. A derivative’s underlying variable is a specified interest rate, security price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index, or other variable. The interaction between the notional amount and the underlying variable determines the number of units to be exchanged between the parties and influences the fair value of the derivative contract.The primary derivatives that we use are interest rate swaps, caps, floors, and futures; foreign exchange contracts; commodity derivatives; and credit derivatives. Generally, these instruments help us manage exposure to interest rate risk, mitigate the credit risk inherent in our loan portfolio, hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and meet client financing and hedging needs. As further discussed in this note: •interest rate risk is the risk that the EVE or net interest income will be adversely affected by fluctuations in interest rates;•credit risk is the risk of loss arising from an obligor’s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms; and•foreign exchange risk is the risk that an exchange rate will adversely affect the fair value of a financial instrument.Derivative assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet, after taking into account the effects of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements. These agreements allow us to settle all derivative contracts held with a single counterparty on a net basis and to offset net derivative positions with related cash collateral, where applicable. As a result, we may have derivative contracts with negative fair values included in derivative assets on the balance sheet and contracts with positive fair values included in derivative liabilities.At June 30, 2017, after taking into account the effects of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements, we had $28 million of derivative assets and $8 million of derivative liabilities that relate to contracts entered into for hedging purposes. As of the same date, after taking into account the effects of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements and a reserve for potential future losses, we had derivative assets of $608 million and derivative liabilities of $300 million that were not designated as hedging instruments.Additional information regarding our accounting policies for derivatives is provided in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Derivatives” beginning on page 112 of our 2016 Form 10-K.Derivatives Designated in Hedge RelationshipsNet interest income and the EVE change in response to changes in the mix of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet instruments and the associated interest rates tied to each instrument. In addition, differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities cause net interest income and the EVE to fluctuate. We utilize derivatives that have been designated as part of a hedge relationship in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance to manage net interest income and EVE to within our stated risk tolerances. The primary derivative instruments used to manage interest rate risk are interest rate swaps, which convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index.We designate certain “receive fixed/pay variable” interest rate swaps as fair value hedges. These contracts convert certain fixed-rate long-term debt into variable-rate obligations, thereby modifying our exposure to changes in interest rates. As a result, we receive fixed-rate interest payments in exchange for making variable-rate payments over the lives of the contracts without exchanging the notional amounts.Similarly, we designate certain “receive fixed/pay variable” interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. These contracts effectively convert certain floating-rate loans into fixed-rate loans to reduce the potential adverse effect of interest rate decreases on future interest income. Again, we receive fixed-rate interest payments in exchange for making variable-rate payments over the lives of the contracts without exchanging the notional amounts.100Table of ContentsWe also designate certain “pay fixed/receive variable” interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. These swaps convert certain floating-rate debt into fixed-rate debt. We also use these swaps to manage the interest rate risk associated with anticipated sales of certain commercial real estate loans. The swaps protect against the possible short-term decline in the value of the loans that could result from changes in interest rates between the time they are originated and the time they are sold.We use foreign currency forward transactions to hedge the foreign currency exposure of our net investment in various foreign equipment finance entities. These entities are denominated in a non-U.S. currency. These swaps are designated as net investment hedges to mitigate the exposure of measuring the net investment at the spot foreign exchange rate.Derivatives Not Designated in Hedge RelationshipsOn occasion, we enter into interest rate swap contracts to manage economic risks but do not designate the instruments in hedge relationships. Excluding contracts addressing customer exposures, the amount of derivatives hedging risks on an economic basis at June 30, 2017, was not significant.Like other financial services institutions, we originate loans and extend credit, both of which expose us to credit risk. We actively manage our overall loan portfolio and the associated credit risk in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives and concentration risk tolerances to mitigate portfolio credit risk. Purchasing credit default swaps enables us to transfer to a third party a portion of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit, including situations where there is a forecast sale of loans. Beginning in the first quarter of 2014, we began purchasing credit default swaps to reduce the credit risk associated with the debt securities held in our trading portfolio. We may also sell credit derivatives to offset our purchased credit default swap position prior to maturity. Although we use credit default swaps for risk management purposes, they are not treated as hedging instruments.We also enter into derivative contracts for other purposes, including: •interest rate swap, cap, and floor contracts generally entered into to accommodate the needs of commercial loan clients;•energy and base metal swap and option contracts entered into to accommodate the needs of clients;•foreign exchange forward and option contracts entered into primarily to accommodate the needs of clients; and•futures contracts and positions with third parties that are intended to offset or mitigate the interest rate or market risk related to client positions discussed above.These contracts are not designated as part of hedge relationships.Fair Values, Volume of Activity, and Gain/Loss Information Related to Derivative InstrumentsThe following table summarizes the fair values of our derivative instruments on a gross and net basis as of June 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016. The change in the notional amounts of these derivatives by type from December 31, 2016, to June 30, 2017, indicates the volume of our derivative transaction activity during the first six months of 2017. The notional amounts are not affected by bilateral collateral and master netting agreements. The derivative asset and liability balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements. Total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted to take into account the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to settle all derivative contracts with a single counterparty on a net basis and to offset the net derivative position with the related cash collateral. Where master netting agreements are not in effect or are not enforceable under bankruptcy laws, we do not adjust those derivative assets and liabilities with counterparties. Securities collateral related to legally enforceable master netting agreements is not offset on the balance sheet. Our derivative instruments are included in “derivative assets” or “derivative liabilities” on the balance sheet, as indicated in the following table:101Table of Contents June 30, 2017 December 31, 2016  Fair Value  Fair Valuein millionsNotionalAmountDerivativeAssetsDerivativeLiabilities NotionalAmountDerivativeAssetsDerivativeLiabilitiesDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:       Interest rate$25,230$104$24 $24,237$189$94Foreign exchange286—7 28264Total25,51610431 24,51919598Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:       Interest rate60,393679492 55,315741643Foreign exchange6,7509989 6,230117109Commodity1,567167157 1,474176165Credit41534 36014Other (a)2,704518 39041Total71,829953760 63,7691,039922Netting adjustments (b)—(421)(483) —(431)(384)Net derivatives in the balance sheet97,345636308 88,288803636Other collateral (c)—(10)(163) —(21)(97)Net derivative amounts$97,345$626$145 $88,288$782$539        (a)Other derivatives include interest rate lock commitments and forward sale commitments related to our residential mortgage banking activities, forward purchase and sales contracts consisting of contractual commitments associated with “to be announced” securities and when issued securities, and when-issued security transactions in connection with an “at-the-market” equity offering program.(b)Netting adjustments represent the amounts recorded to convert our derivative assets and liabilities from a gross basis to a net basis in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance.(c)Other collateral represents the amount that cannot be used to offset our derivative assets and liabilities from a gross basis to a net basis in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. The other collateral consists of securities and is exchanged under bilateral collateral and master netting agreements that allow us to offset the net derivative position with the related collateral. The application of the other collateral cannot reduce the net derivative position below zero. Therefore, excess other collateral, if any, is not reflected above.Fair value hedges. Instruments designated as fair value hedges are recorded at fair value and included in “derivative assets” or “derivative liabilities” on the balance sheet. The effective portion of a change in the fair value of an instrument designated as a fair value hedge is recorded in earnings at the same time as a change in fair value of the hedged item, resulting in no effect on net income. The ineffective portion of a change in the fair value of such a hedging instrument is recorded in “other income” on the income statement with no corresponding offset. During the six-month period ended June 30, 2017, we did not exclude any portion of these hedging instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. While there is some immaterial ineffectiveness in our hedging relationships, all of our fair value hedges remained “highly effective” as of June 30, 2017.The following table summarizes the pre-tax net gains (losses) on our fair value hedges for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2017, and June 30, 2016, and where they are recorded on the income statement.in millionsIncome Statement Location ofNet Gains (Losses) on DerivativeNet Gains(Losses) onDerivativeHedged ItemIncome Statement Location ofNet Gains (Losses) on Hedged ItemNet Gains(Losses) onHedged ItemThree months ended June 30, 2017      Interest rateOther income$5Long-term debtOther income$(5)(a)  Interest rateInterest expense — Long-term debt14    Total $19  $(5) Six months ended June 30, 2017      Interest rateOther income$(30)Long-term debtOther income$30(a)  Interest rateInterest expense — Long-term debt32    Total $2  $30        in millionsIncome Statement Location ofNet Gains (Losses) on DerivativeNet Gains(Losses) onDerivativeHedged ItemIncome Statement Location ofNet Gains (Losses) on Hedged ItemNet Gains(Losses) onHedged ItemThree months ended June 30, 2016      Interest rateOther income$49Long-term debtOther income$(50)(a)  Interest rateInterest expense — Long-term debt23    Total $72  $(50) Six months ended June 30, 2016      Interest rateOther income$164Long-term debtOther income$(165)(a)  Interest rateInterest expense — Long-term debt50    Total $214  $(165)        (a)Net gains (losses) on hedged items represent the change in fair value caused by fluctuations in interest rates.Cash flow hedges. Instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value and included in “derivative assets” or “derivative liabilities” on the balance sheet. Initially, the effective portion of a gain or loss on a cash flow hedge is recorded as a 102Table of Contentscomponent of AOCI on the balance sheet. This amount is subsequently reclassified into income when the hedged transaction affects earnings (e.g., when we pay variable-rate interest on debt, receive variable-rate interest on commercial loans, or sell commercial real estate loans). The ineffective portion of cash flow hedging transactions is included in “other income” on the income statement. During the six-month period ended June 30, 2017, we did not exclude any portion of these hedging instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. While there is some immaterial ineffectiveness in our hedging relationships, all of our cash flow hedges remained “highly effective” as of June 30, 2017.Considering the interest rates, yield curves, and notional amounts as of June 30, 2017, we would expect to reclassify an estimated $14 million of after-tax net gains on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges from AOCI to income during the next 12 months. In addition, we expect to reclassify approximately $3 million of net losses related to terminated cash flow hedges from AOCI to income during the next 12 months. As of June 30, 2017, the maximum length of time over which we hedge forecast transactions is 11 years.Net investment hedges. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure to changes in the carrying value of our investments in foreign subsidiaries as a result of changes in the related foreign exchange rates. Instruments designated as net investment hedges are recorded at fair value and included in “derivative assets” or “derivative liabilities” on the balance sheet. Initially, the effective portion of a gain or loss on a net investment hedge is recorded as a component of AOCI on the balance sheet when the terms of the derivative match the notional and currency risk being hedged. The effective portion is subsequently reclassified into income when the hedged transaction affects earnings (e.g., when we dispose of or liquidate a foreign subsidiary). At June 30, 2017, AOCI reflected unrecognized, after-tax gains totaling $34 million related to cumulative changes in the fair value of our net investment hedges, which offset the unrecognized, after-tax foreign currency losses on net investment balances. The ineffective portion of net investment hedging transactions is included in “other income” on the income statement, but there was no net investment hedge ineffectiveness as of June 30, 2017. We did not exclude any portion of our hedging instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness during the six-month period ended June 30, 2017.The following table summarizes the pre-tax net gains (losses) on our cash flow and net investment hedges for the three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2017, and June 30, 2016, and where they are recorded on the income statement. The table includes the effective portion of net gains (losses) recognized in OCI during the period, the effective portion of net gains (losses) reclassified from OCI into income during the current period, and the portion of net gains (losses) recognized directly in income, representing the amount of hedge ineffectiveness.in millionsNet Gains (Losses)Recognized in OCI(Effective Portion)Income Statement Location of Net Gains (Losses)Reclassified From OCI Into Income (Effective Portion)Net Gains(Losses) ReclassifiedFrom OCI Into Income(Effective Portion)Income Statement Locationof Net Gains (Losses)Recognized in Income(Ineffective Portion)Net Gains (Losses)Recognized inIncome(Ineffective Portion)Three months ended June 30, 2017     Cash Flow Hedges     Interest rate$22Interest income — Loans$5Other income—Interest rate—Interest expense — Long-term debt(1)Other income—Interest rate—Investment banking and debt placement fees—Other income—Net Investment Hedges     Foreign exchange contracts(7)Other Income—Other income—Total$15 $4 —Six months ended June 30, 2017     Cash Flow Hedges     Interest rate$—Interest income — Loans$20Other income—Interest rate—Interest expense — Long-term debt(2)Other income—Interest rate—Investment banking and debt placement fees—Other income—Net Investment Hedges     Foreign exchange contracts(10)Other Income—Other income—Total$(10) $18 —      103Table of Contentsin millionsNet Gains (Losses)Recognized in OCI(Effective Portion)Income Statement Location of Net Gains (Losses)Reclassified From OCI Into Income (Effective Portion)Net Gains(Losses) ReclassifiedFrom OCI Into Income(Effective Portion)Income Statement Locationof Net Gains (Losses)Recognized in Income(Ineffective Portion)Net Gains (Losses)Recognized inIncome(Ineffective Portion)Three months ended June 30, 2016     Cash Flow Hedges     Interest rate$71Interest income — Loans$22Other income—Interest rate(2)Interest expense — Long-term debt(1)Other income—Interest rate—Investment banking and debt placement fees—Other income—Net Investment Hedges     Foreign exchange contracts9Other Income—Other income—Total$78 $21 —Six months ended June 30, 2016     Cash Flow Hedges     Interest rate$204Interest income — Loans$45Other income—Interest rate(6)Interest expense — Long-term debt(2)Other income—Interest rate(1)Investment banking and debt placement fees—Other income—Net Investment Hedges     Foreign exchange contracts(5)Other Income—Other income—Total$192 $43 —      The after-tax change in AOCI resulting from cash flow and net investment hedges is as follows:in millionsDecember 31, 20162017 Hedging ActivityReclassification of Gains to Net IncomeJune 30, 2017AOCI resulting from cash flow and net investment hedges$(14)$(6)$(11)$(31)Nonhedging instruments.

This risk is measured as the expected positive replacement value of the contracts. We use several means to mitigate and manage exposure to credit risk on derivative 104Table of Contentscontracts. We generally enter into bilateral collateral and master netting agreements that provide for the net settlement of all contracts with a single counterparty in the event of default. Additionally, we monitor counterparty credit risk exposure on each contract to determine appropriate limits on our total credit exposure across all product types. We review our collateral positions on a daily basis and exchange collateral with our counterparties in accordance with standard ISDA documentation, central clearing rules, and other related agreements. We generally hold collateral in the form of cash and highly rated securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, government-sponsored enterprises, or GNMA. Cash collateral of $37 million was included in derivative assets on the balance sheet at June 30, 2017, compared to $155 million of cash collateral netted against derivative assets at December 31, 2016. The cash collateral netted against derivative liabilities totaled $25 million at June 30, 2017, and $108 million at December 31, 2016. Beginning in the first quarter of 2017, the relevant agreements that allow us to access the central clearing organizations to clear derivative transactions became qualified master netting agreements resulting in a change in how cash collateral is reflected on our balance sheet and in related disclosures as of March 31, 2017. All cash collateral exchanged with central clearing organizations is now netted against the related derivative contracts on our balance sheet and related disclosures. Cash collateral exchanged with central clearing organizations was included in “short-term investments” and “NOW and money market deposit accounts” on the balance sheet in all periods prior to March 31, 2017. At December 31, 2016, we posted $448 million of cash collateral with clearing organizations and held $59 million of cash collateral from clearing organizations. Additionally, the CME amended its rulebook effective January 3, 2017, to legally characterize variation margin payments made to and received from the CME as settlement of derivatives, not collateral against derivative exposure. As a result, variation margin payments with the CME are presented on the balance sheet and in related disclosures as part of the gross fair value of CME-cleared derivative assets and liabilities. At June 30, 2017, we had paid $185 million and received $81 million in variation margin to settle CME-cleared derivatives. In addition, under the CME’s settlement rulebook, CME-cleared derivative assets and liabilities are offset against one another to determine the gross asset or liability exposure of CME-cleared derivatives. Netting cash collateral exchanged with all central clearing organizations and applying variation margin payments as settlement to CME-cleared derivative transactions resulted in a reduction of net derivative assets on our balance sheet of $23 million and a reduction of net derivative liabilities on our balance sheet of $211 million as of June 30, 2017, as compared to December 31, 2016.The following table summarizes the fair value of our derivative assets by type at the dates indicated. These assets represent our gross exposure to potential loss after taking into account the effects of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements and other means used to mitigate risk.in millionsJune 30, 2017December 31, 2016Interest rate$472$782Foreign exchange4362Commodity77110Credit2—Other54Derivative assets before collateral599958Less: Related collateral(37)155Total derivative assets$636$803   We enter into derivative transactions with two primary groups: broker-dealers and banks, and clients. Given that these groups have different economic characteristics, we have different methods for managing counterparty credit exposure and credit risk.We enter into transactions with broker-dealers and banks for various risk management purposes. These types of transactions are generally high dollar volume. We generally enter into bilateral collateral and master netting agreements with these counterparties. We began clearing certain types of derivative transactions with these counterparties in June 2013, whereby the central clearing organizations become our counterparties subsequent to novation of the original derivative contracts. In addition, we began entering into derivative contracts through swap execution facilities during the first quarter of 2014. The swap clearing and swap trade execution requirements were mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act for the purpose of reducing counterparty credit risk and increasing transparency in the derivative market. At June 30, 2017, we had gross exposure of $514 million to broker-dealers and banks. We had net exposure of $270 million after the application of master netting agreements and cash collateral, where such qualifying agreements exist. We had net exposure of $247 million after considering $23 million of additional collateral held in the form of securities.We enter into transactions with clients to accommodate their business needs. These types of transactions are generally low dollar volume. We generally enter into master netting agreements with these counterparties. In addition, we mitigate our overall 105Table of Contentsportfolio exposure and market risk by buying and selling U.S. Treasuries and Eurodollar futures and entering into offsetting positions and other derivative contracts, sometimes with entities other than broker-dealers and banks. Due to the smaller size and magnitude of the individual contracts with clients, we generally do not exchange collateral in connection with these derivative transactions. To address the risk of default associated with the uncollateralized contracts, we have established a credit valuation adjustment (included in “derivative assets”) in the amount of $6 million at June 30, 2017, which we estimate to be the potential future losses on amounts due from client counterparties in the event of default. At June 30, 2017, we had gross exposure of $399 million to client counterparties and other entities that are not broker-dealers or banks for derivatives that have associated master netting agreements. We had net exposure of $366 million on our derivatives with these counterparties after the application of master netting agreements, collateral, and the related reserve. Credit DerivativesWe are a buyer and, under limited circumstances, may be a seller of credit protection through the credit derivative market. We purchase credit derivatives to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending and swap obligations as well as exposures to debt securities. We may also sell credit derivatives, mainly single-name credit default swaps, to offset our purchased credit default swap positions prior to maturity.The following table summarizes the fair value of our credit derivatives purchased and sold by type as of June 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016. The fair value of credit derivatives presented below does not take into account the effects of bilateral collateral or master netting agreements.

The protected credit risk is related to adverse credit events, such as bankruptcy, failure to make payments, and acceleration or restructuring of obligations, identified in the credit derivative contract. As the seller of a single-name credit derivative, we may settle inone of two ways if the underlying reference entity experiences a predefined credit event. We may be required to pay the purchaser the difference between the par value and the market price of the debt obligation (cash settlement) or receive the specified referenced asset in exchange for payment of the par value (physical settlement). If we effect a physical settlement and receive our portion of the related debt obligation, we will join other creditors in the liquidation process, which may enable us to recover a portion of the amount paid under the credit default swap contract. We also may purchase offsetting credit derivatives for the same reference entity from third parties that will permit us to recover the amount we pay should a credit event occur.A traded credit default swap index represents a position on a basket or portfolio of reference entities. As a seller of protection on a credit default swap index, we would be required to pay the purchaser if one or more of the entities in the index had a credit event. Upon a credit event, the amount payable is based on the percentage of the notional amount allocated to the specific defaulting entity.The majority of transactions represented by the “other” category shown in the above table are risk participation agreements. In these transactions, the lead participant has a swap agreement with a customer. The lead participant (purchaser of protection) then enters into a risk participation agreement with a counterparty (seller of protection), under which the counterparty receives a fee to accept a portion of the lead participant’s credit risk. If the customer defaults on the swap contract, the counterparty to the risk participation agreement must reimburse the lead participant for the counterparty’s percentage of the positive fair value of the customer swap as of the default date. If the customer swap has a negative fair value, the counterparty has no reimbursement requirements. If the customer defaults on the swap contract and the seller fulfills its payment obligations under the risk participation agreement, the seller is entitled to a pro rata share of the lead participant’s claims against the customer under the terms of the swap agreement.The following table provides information on the types of credit derivatives sold by us and held on the balance sheet at June 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016. The notional amount represents the maximum amount that the seller could be required to pay. The payment/performance risk assessment is based on the default probabilities for the underlying reference entities’ debt obligations using a Moody’s credit ratings matrix known as Moody’s “Idealized” Cumulative Default Rates. The payment/performance risk shown in the table represents a weighted-average of the default probabilities for all reference entities in the 106Table of Contentsrespective portfolios. These default probabilities are directly correlated to the probability that we will have to make a payment under the credit derivative contracts.

The amount of collateral to be posted is based on the amount of the net liability and thresholds generally related to our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings with Moody’s and S&P. Collateral requirements also are based on minimum transfer amounts, which are specific to each Credit Support Annex (a component of the ISDA Master Agreement) that we have signed with the counterparties. In a limited number of instances, counterparties have the right to terminate their ISDA Master Agreements with us if our ratings fall below a certain level, usually investment-grade level (i.e., “Baa3” for Moody’s and “BBB-” for S&P). At June 30, 2017, KeyBank’s rating was “A3” with Moody’s and “A-” with S&P, and KeyCorp’s rating was “Baa1” with Moody’s and “BBB+” with S&P. As of June 30, 2017, the aggregate fair value of all derivative contracts with credit risk contingent features (i.e., those containing collateral posting or termination provisions based on our ratings) held by KeyBank that were in a net liability position totaled $113 million, which comprised of $112 million in derivative assets and $225 million in derivative liabilities. We had $118 million in cash and securities collateral posted to cover those positions as of June 30, 2017. There were no derivative contracts with credit risk contingent features held by KeyCorp at June 30, 2017.The following table summarizes the additional cash and securities collateral that KeyBank would have been required to deliver under the ISDA Master Agreements had the credit risk contingent features been triggered for the derivative contracts in a net liability position as of June 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016. The additional collateral amounts were calculated based on scenarios under which KeyBank’s ratings are downgraded one, two, or three ratings as of June 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, and take into account all collateral already posted. A similar calculation was performed for KeyCorp, and no additional collateral would have been required as of December 31, 2016. For more information about the credit ratings for KeyBank and KeyCorp, see the discussion under the heading “Factors affecting liquidity” in the section entitled “Liquidity risk management” in Item 2 of this report.

If KeyCorp’s ratings had been downgraded below investment grade as of December 31, 2016, payments of less than $1 million would have been required to either terminate the contracts or post additional collateral for those contracts in a net liability position, taking into account all collateral already posted.107Table of Contents9. Mortgage Servicing Assets We originate and periodically sell commercial and residential mortgage loans but continue to service those loans for the buyers. We also may purchase the right to service commercial mortgage loans for other lenders. We record a servicing asset if we purchase or retain the right to service loans in exchange for servicing fees that exceed the going market servicing rate and are considered more than adequate compensation for servicing. Commercial and residential mortgage servicing assets are recorded as a component of “accrued income and other assets” on the balance sheet. Additional information pertaining to the accounting for mortgage and other servicing assets is included in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Servicing Assets” in our 2016 Form 10-K.Commercial Mortgage ServicingChanges in the carrying amount of commercial mortgage servicing assets are summarized as follows: Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30,in millions20172016 20172016Balance at beginning of period$369$318 $356$321Servicing retained from loan sales1915 4722Purchases7— 1412Amortization(22)(10) (44)(32)Balance at end of period$373$323 $373$323Fair value at end of period$495$404 $495$404      The fair value of commercial mortgage servicing assets is determined by calculating the present value of future cash flows associated with servicing the loans. This calculation uses a number of assumptions that are based on current market conditions. The range and weighted average of the significant unobservable inputs used to determine the fair value of our commercial mortgage servicing assets at June 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, along with the valuation techniques, are shown in the following table: June 30, 2017Valuation TechniqueSignificantUnobservable InputRange(Weighted Average)dollars in millionsCommercial mortgage servicing assetsDiscounted cash flowExpected defaults1.00 - 3.00% (1.30%)  Residual cash flows discount rate7.00 - 15.00% (8.80%)  Escrow earn rate1.50 - 3.10% (2.50%)  Servicing cost$150 - $38,500 ($1,457)  Loan assumption rate0.00 - 3.00% (1.24%)  Percentage late0.00 - 2.00% (.29%)December 31, 2016Valuation TechniqueSignificantUnobservable InputRange(Weighted Average)dollars in millionsCommercial mortgage servicing assetsDiscounted cash flowExpected defaults1.00 - 3.00% (1.40%)  Residual cash flows discount rate7.00 - 12.00% (8.00%)  Escrow earn rate1.10 - 3.00% (2.40%)  Servicing cost$150 - $2,700 ($1,124)  Loan assumption rate0.00 - 3.00% (1.13%)  Percentage late0.00 - 2.00% (.34%)If these economic assumptions change or prove incorrect, the fair value of commercial mortgage servicing assets may also change. Expected credit losses, escrow earning rates, and discount rates are critical to the valuation of commercial mortgage servicing assets. Estimates of these assumptions are based on how a market participant would view the respective rates, and reflect historical data associated with the commercial mortgage loans, industry trends, and other considerations. Actual rates may differ from those estimated due to changes in a variety of economic factors. A decrease in the value assigned to the escrow earning rates would cause a decrease in the fair value of our commercial mortgage servicing assets. An increase in the assumed default rates of commercial mortgage loans or an increase in the assigned discount rates would cause a decrease in the fair value of our commercial mortgage servicing assets. Prepayment activity on commercial serviced loans does not significantly affect the valuation of our commercial mortgage servicing assets. Unlike residential mortgages, commercial mortgages experience significantly lower prepayments due to certain contractual restrictions affecting the borrower’s ability to prepay the mortgage. 108Table of ContentsWe have elected to account for commercial servicing assets using the amortization method. The amortization of commercial servicing assets is determined in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated net servicing income. The amortization of commercial servicing assets for each period, as shown in the table at the beginning of this note, is recorded as a reduction to contractual fee income. The contractual fee income from servicing commercial mortgage loans totaled $72 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2017, and $66 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016. This fee income was offset by $44 million of amortization for the six-month period ended June 30, 2017, and $44 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016. Both the contractual fee income and the amortization are recorded, net, in “mortgage servicing fees” on the income statement.Additional information pertaining to the accounting for commercial mortgage and other servicing assets is included in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Servicing Assets” on page 113 of our 2016 Form 10-K.Residential Mortgage ServicingWith the First Niagara acquisition, we acquired residential mortgage servicing assets with a fair value of $28 million as of the Acquisition Date.

This calculation uses a number of assumptions that are based on current market conditions. The range and weighted-average of the significant unobservable inputs used to fair value our mortgage servicing assets at June 30, 2017, along with the valuation techniques, are shown in the following table:June 30, 2017Valuation TechniqueSignificantUnobservable InputRange(Weighted Average)dollars in millionsResidential mortgage servicing assetsDiscounted cash flowPrepayment speed7.85 - 21.72% (9.42%)  Discount rate8.50 - 11.00% (8.55%)   Servicing cost$76 - $3,335 ($82.18) If these economic assumptions change or prove incorrect, the fair value of residential mortgage servicing assets may also change. Prepayment speed, discount rates, and servicing cost are critical to the valuation of servicing assets. Estimates of these assumptions are based on how a market participant would view the respective rates, and reflect historical data associated with the loans, industry trends, and other considerations. Actual rates may differ from those estimated due to changes in a variety of economic factors. An increase in the prepayment speed, assigned discount rates, and servicing cost assumptions would also cause a negative impact on the fair value of our residential mortgage servicing assets.We have elected to account for residential servicing assets using the amortization method. The amortization of residential servicing assets is determined in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated net residential servicing income. The amortization of servicing assets for June 30, 2017, as shown in the table above, is recorded as a reduction to contractual fee income. The contractual fee income from servicing residential mortgage loans totaled $7 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2017. This fee income was offset by $2 million of amortization for the six-month period ended June 30, 2017. Both the contractual fee income and the amortization are recorded, net, in “mortgage servicing fees” on the income statement.109Table of Contents10. Variable Interest Entities A VIE is a partnership, limited liability company, trust, or other legal entity that meets any one of the following criteria: •The entity does not have sufficient equity to conduct its activities without additional subordinated financial support from another party.•The entity’s investors lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the entity’s economic performance.•The entity’s equity at risk holders do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive residual returns.•The voting rights of some investors are not proportional to their economic interests in the entity, and substantially all of the entity’s activities involve, or are conducted on behalf of, investors with disproportionately few voting rights.Our significant VIEs are summarized below. We define a “significant interest” in an unconsolidated VIE as a subordinated interest that exposes us to a significant portion, but not the majority, of the VIE’s expected losses or residual returns, even though we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the entity’s economic performance. LIHTC investments. Through KCDC, we have made investments directly and indirectly in LIHTC operating partnerships formed by third parties. As a limited partner in these operating partnerships, we are allocated tax credits and deductions associated with the underlying properties. We have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these investments because the general partners have the power to direct the activities that most significantly influence the economic performance of their respective partnerships and have the obligation to absorb expected losses and the right to receive residual returns. As we are not the primary beneficiary of these investments, we do not consolidate their assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements.Our maximum exposure to loss in connection with these partnerships consists of our unamortized investment balance plus any unfunded equity commitments and tax credits claimed but subject to recapture. We had $1.2 billion of investments in LIHTC operating partnerships at both June 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016. These investments are recorded in “accrued income and other assets” on our balance sheet. We do not have any loss reserves recorded related to these investments because we believe the likelihood of any loss to be remote. For all legally binding, unfunded equity commitments, we increase our recognized investment and recognize a liability. As of June 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, we had liabilities of $446 million and $462 million, respectively, related to investments in qualified affordable housing projects, which are recorded in “accrued expenses and other liabilities” on our balance sheet. We continue to invest in these LIHTC operating partnerships.The assets and liabilities presented in the table below convey the size of KCDC’s direct and indirect investments at June 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016. As these investments represent unconsolidated VIEs, the assets and liabilities of the investments themselves are not recorded on our balance sheet.

During the first six months of 2017, we recognized $81 million of amortization and $78 million of tax credits associated with these investments within “income taxes” on our income statement. During the first six months of 2016, we recognized $64 million of amortization and $67 million of tax credits associated with these investments within “income taxes” on our income statement.Principal investments. Through our principal investing entity, KCC, we have made investments in private equity funds engaged in venture- and growth-oriented investing. As a limited partner to these funds, KCC records these investments at fair value and receives distributions from the funds in accordance with the funds’ partnership agreements. We are not the primary beneficiary of these investments as we do not hold the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the funds’ economic performance. Such power rests with the funds’ general partners. In addition, we have neither the obligation to absorb the funds’ expected losses nor the right to receive their residual returns. Our voting rights are also disproportionate to our economic interests, and substantially all of the funds’ activities are conducted on behalf of investors with disproportionately 110Table of Contentsfew voting rights. Because we are not the primary beneficiary of these investments, we do not consolidate their assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. Our maximum exposure to loss associated with indirect principal investments consists of the investments’ fair value plus any unfunded equity commitments. The fair value of our indirect principal investments totaled $148 million and $158 million at June 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016, respectively. These investments are recorded in “other investments” on our balance sheet. Additional information on indirect principal investments is provided in Note 6 (“Fair Value Measurements”). The table below reflects the size of the private equity funds in which KCC was invested as well as our maximum exposure to loss in connection with these investments at June 30, 2017.

We are involved with other various entities that we have determined to be VIEs in the normal course of business. We have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these partnerships because the general partners have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance. Our assets associated with these unconsolidated VIEs totaled $155 million at June 30, 2017, and $178 million at December 31, 2016, and primarily consisted of our investments in these entities. These assets are recorded in “accrued income and other assets,” “other investments,” and “securities available for sale” on our balance sheet. We had liabilities totaling $4 million associated with these unconsolidated VIEs at both June 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016. These liabilities are recorded in “accrued expenses and other liabilities” on our balance sheet.Consolidated VIEs. Through our principal investing entity, KPP, we have formed and funded operating entities that provide management and other related services to our investment company funds, which directly invest in portfolio companies. In return for providing services to our direct investment funds, these entities’ receive a minority equity interest in the funds. This minority equity ownership is recorded at fair value on the entities’ financial statements. Additional information on our direct principal investments is provided in Note 6 (“Fair Value Measurements”). While other equity investors manage the daily operations of these entities, we retain the power, through voting rights, to direct the activities of the entities that most significantly affect their economic performance. In addition, we have the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive residual returns that could potentially be significant to these entities. As a result, we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of these funds and have consolidated them since formation. The assets of these KPP entities that can only be used to settle the entities’ obligations totaled $3 million at June 30, 2017, and $1 million at December 31, 2016. These assets are recorded in “cash and due from banks” and “accrued income and other assets” on our balance sheet. The entities had no liabilities at June 30, 2017, nor at December 31, 2016, and other equity investors have no recourse to our general credit.111Table of Contents11. Income Taxes Income Tax ProvisionIn accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, the principal method established for computing the provision for income taxes in interim periods requires us to make our best estimate of the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full year. This estimated effective tax rate is then applied to interim consolidated pre-tax operating income to determine the interim provision for income taxes.The effective tax rate, which is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes, was 28.0% for the second quarter of 2017 and 25.6% for the second quarter of 2016. The effective tax rates are below our combined federal and state statutory tax rate of 37.2% primarily due to income from investments in tax-advantaged assets such as corporate-owned life insurance and credits associated with renewable energy and low-income housing investments. The effective tax rates for the three months ended June 30, 2017, and June 30, 2016, were affected by net discrete income tax benefits of .5% and detriments of 2.2%, respectively.The tax rate for the second quarter of 2017 was also impacted due to notable items of $1 million. Excluding those notable items, the tax rate for the second quarter of 2017 was 27.9%.Deferred Tax AssetAt June 30, 2017, from continuing operations we had a net deferred tax asset of $385 million, compared to a net deferred tax asset of $607 million at December 31, 2016, included in “accrued income and other assets” on the balance sheet. At June 30, 2017, deferred tax assets were affected by the First Niagara acquisition including certain purchase accounting adjustments and changes in market conditions that affect the mark-to-market deferred tax adjustment on securities. To determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized, and therefore recorded, we conduct a quarterly assessment of all available evidence. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, taxable income in prior periods, projected future taxable income, and projected future reversals of deferred tax items. These assessments involve a degree of subjectivity and may undergo change. Based on these criteria, we had a valuation allowance of $26 million at June 30, 2017, and $26 million at December 31, 2016. The valuation allowance is associated with certain state net operating loss carryforwards, state credit carryforwards, and federal and state capital loss carryforwards. Unrecognized Tax BenefitsAs permitted under the applicable accounting guidance for income taxes, it is our policy to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in “income tax expense.” At June 30, 2017, Key’s unrecognized tax benefits were $55 million. Pre-1988 Bank Reserves Acquired in a Business Combination As a result of the First Niagara acquisition, at June 30, 2017, the retained earnings of KeyBank included approximately $92 million of allocated bad debt deductions for which no income taxes have been recorded. Under current federal law, thesereserves are subject to recapture into taxable income if KeyBank, or any successor, fails to maintain its bank status under theInternal Revenue Code or makes non-dividend distributions or distributions greater than its accumulated earnings and profits.No deferred tax liability has been established as these events are not expected to occur in the foreseeable future.112Table of Contents12. Acquisition, Divestiture, and Discontinued Operations AcquisitionsHelloWallet Holdings, Inc. On May 31, 2017, KeyBank entered into a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of HelloWallet, a digital financial wellness company. Key’s retail banking franchise will leverage HelloWallet’s technology to provide data-driven insights to clients, allowing clients to better understand and improve their personal finances. The acquisition, which will be accounted for as a business combination, is effective July 1, 2017. Accordingly, we will begin consolidating HelloWallet’s financial results in our consolidated financial statements in the third quarter of 2017.Key Merchant Services, LLC. On June 30, 2017, KeyBank (consolidated) acquired an additional 51% interest in Key Merchant Services, LLC (“KMS”), increasing our ownership interest from 49% to 100%. This acquisition enables us to grow our merchant services business and enhance our merchant product offerings. This transaction is accounted for as a business combination achieved in stages. Prior to the acquisition, KMS was operated as a merchant services joint venture and accounted for as an equity method investment in our consolidated financial statements.Immediately before the acquisition, the provisional estimated fair value of our equity interest in KMS was $74 million. The fair value of our previously held equity interest was measured using discounted cash flow modeling that incorporates an appropriate risk premium and forecast earnings information. On June 30, 2017, we recognized a provisional non-cash holding gain of $64 million for the difference between the fair value and the book value of our previously held equity interest. The gain is included in “other income” on the income statement for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. Upon acquisition, we recorded estimated identifiable intangible assets of $95 million and goodwill of less than $1 million. The fair value estimates related to this acquisition represent our best estimate of fair value and are expected to be finalized over a period of up to one year from the acquisition date.First Niagara Financial Group, Inc. As previously disclosed, on October 30, 2015, KeyCorp entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger (“Agreement”) to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of First Niagara, headquartered in Buffalo, New York. On August 1, 2016, First Niagara merged with and into KeyCorp, with KeyCorp as the surviving entity. The total consideration for the transaction was approximately $4.0 billion. Under the terms of the Agreement, at the effective time of the merger, each share of First Niagara common stock was converted into the right to receive (i) 0.680 of a share of KeyCorp common stock and (ii) $2.30 in cash. The exchange ratio of KeyCorp stock for First Niagara stock was fixed per the Agreement and did not adjust based on changes in KeyCorp’s share trading price. First Niagara equity awards outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger were converted into equity awards for KeyCorp common stock as provided in the Agreement. Each share of First Niagara’s Fixed-to-Floating Rate Perpetual Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series B, was converted into a share of a newly created series of preferred stock of KeyCorp having substantially the same terms as First Niagara’s preferred stock. For more information on the acquisition, see Note 2 (“Business Combination”).On October 7, 2016, First Niagara Bank merged with and into KeyBank, with KeyBank as the surviving entity. Systems and client conversion also occurred during the fourth quarter of 2016 in connection with the bank merger. DivestitureOn September 9, 2016, KeyCorp sold to Northwest Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northwest Bancshares, Inc., 18 First Niagara Bank branches in the Buffalo, New York market. The branches were divested in connection with the merger between First Niagara and KeyCorp and pursuant to an agreement with the United States Department of Justice and commitments to the Federal Reserve following a customary antitrust review in connection with the merger. The divestiture included $439 million of loans and $1.6 billion of deposits associated with the 18 branches.Discontinued operationsEducation lending. In September 2009, we decided to exit the government-guaranteed education lending business. As a result, we have accounted for this business as a discontinued operation. As of January 1, 2010, we consolidated our ten outstanding education lending securitization trusts, as we held the residual interests and are the master servicer with the power to direct the activities that most significantly influence the economic performance of the trusts.On September 30, 2014, we sold the residual interests in all of our outstanding education lending securitization trusts to a third party for $57 million. In selling the residual interests, we no longer have the obligation to absorb losses nor the right to receive benefits related to the securitization trusts. Therefore, in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, we 113Table of Contentsdeconsolidated the securitization trusts and removed trust assets of $1.7 billion and trust liabilities of $1.6 billion from our balance sheet at September 30, 2014. We continue to service the securitized loans in eight of the securitization trusts and receive servicing fees, whereby we are adequately compensated, as well as remaining a counterparty to derivative contracts with three of the securitization trusts. We retained interests in the securitization trusts through our ownership of an insignificant percentage of certificates in two of the securitization trusts and two interest-only strips in one of the securitization trusts. These retained interests were remeasured at fair value on September 30, 2014, and their fair value of $1 million was recorded in “discontinued assets” on our balance sheet. These assets were valued using a similar approach and inputs that have been used to value the education loan securitization trust loans and securities, which are further discussed later in this note.“Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes” on the income statement includes (i) the changes in fair value of the portfolio loans at fair value (discussed later in this note), and (ii) the interest income and expense from the loans in portfolio at both amortized cost and fair value. These amounts are shown separately in the following table. Gains and losses attributable to changes in fair value are recorded as a component of “noninterest income” or “noninterest expense.” Interest income and interest expense related to the loans and securities are included as components of “net interest income.”The components of “income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes” for the education lending business are as follows: Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30,in millions20172016 20172016Net interest income$6$7 $11$14Provision for credit losses—— 32Net interest income after provision for credit losses67 812Noninterest income12 33Noninterest expense(1)4 39Income (loss) before income taxes85 86Income taxes32 32Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes (a)5$3 $5$4      (a)Includes after-tax charges of $7 million and $6 million for the three-month periods ended June 30, 2017, and June 30, 2016, respectively, and $13 million and $12 million for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2017, and June 30, 2016, respectively, determined by applying a matched funds transfer pricing methodology to the liabilities assumed necessary to support the discontinued operations.The discontinued assets of our education lending business included on the balance sheet are as follows.

As of June 30, 2015, we decided to sell the portfolio loans that are recorded at fair value, which were subsequently sold during the fourth quarter of 2015.At June 30, 2017, education loans included 2,490 TDRs with a recorded investment of approximately $24 million (pre-modification and post-modification). A specifically allocated allowance of $2 million was assigned to these loans as of June 30, 2017. At December 31, 2016, education loans included 2,163 TDRs with a recorded investment of approximately $22 million (pre-modification and post-modification). A specifically allocated allowance of $2 million was assigned to these loans as of December 31, 2016. There have been no significant payment defaults. There are no significant commitments to lend additional funds to these borrowers outstanding. Additional information regarding TDR classification and ALLL methodology is provided in Note 5 (“Asset Quality”).In June 2015, we transferred $179 million of loans that were previously purchased from three of the outstanding securitization trusts pursuant to the legal terms of those particular trusts to held for sale and accounted for them at fair value. These portfolio loans held for sale were valued based on indicative bids to sell the loans. These loans were considered Level 3 assets since we 114Table of Contentsrelied on unobservable inputs when determining their fair value. Portfolio loans accounted for at fair value were $2 million at June 30, 2017.The following table shows the significant unobservable inputs used to measure the fair value of the portfolio loans accounted for at fair value as of June 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016:June 30, 2017Fair Value of Level 3Assets and LiabilitiesValuationTechniqueSignificantUnobservable InputRange(Weighted-Average)dollars in millionsPortfolio loans accounted for at fair value$2Market approachIndicative bids84.50-104.00%December 31, 2016Fair Value of Level 3Assets and LiabilitiesValuationTechniqueSignificantUnobservable InputRange(Weighted-Average)dollars in millionsPortfolio loans accounted for at fair value$3Market approachIndicative bids84.50-104.00%The following table shows the principal and fair value amounts for our portfolio loans at carrying value at June 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016.

In April 2009, we decided to discontinue the operations of Austin, a subsidiary that specialized in managing hedge fund investments for institutional customers. As a result, we have accounted for this business as a discontinued operation. There was no income related to Austin for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2017, and June 30, 2016.

Securities Financing Activities We enter into repurchase agreements to finance overnight customer sweep deposits. We also enter into repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements to settle other securities obligations. We account for these securities financing agreements as collateralized financing transactions. Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements are recorded on the balance sheet at the amounts for which the securities will be subsequently sold or repurchased. Securities borrowed transactions are recorded on the balance sheet at the amounts of cash collateral advanced. While our securities financing agreements incorporate a right of set off, the assets and liabilities are reported on a gross basis. Reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions are included in “short-term investments” on the balance sheet; repurchase agreements are included in “federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements.”The following table summarizes our securities financing agreements at June 30, 2017, and December 31, 2016: June 30, 2017in millionsGross AmountPresented inBalance SheetNettingAdjustments (a)Collateral (b)NetAmountsOffsetting of financial assets:    Reverse repurchase agreements$11$(9)$(2)—Total$11$(9)$(2)—     Offsetting of financial liabilities:    Repurchase agreements (c)$346$(8)$(338)—Total$346$(8)$(338)—      December 31, 2016in millionsGross AmountPresented inBalance SheetNetting Adjustments (a)Collateral (b)NetAmountsOffsetting of financial assets:    Reverse repurchase agreements$3$(3)——Total$3$(3)——     Offsetting of financial liabilities:    Repurchase agreements (c)$497$(3)$(494)—Total$497$(3)$(494)—     (a)Netting adjustments take into account the impact of master netting agreements that allow us to settle with a single counterparty on a net basis.(b)These adjustments take into account the impact of bilateral collateral agreements that allow us to offset the net positions with the related collateral. The application of collateral cannot reduce the net position below zero. Therefore, excess collateral, if any, is not reflected above.(c)Repurchase agreements are collateralized by federal agency CMOs and U.S. Treasury securities and contracted on an overnight basis. These securities are reported in “securities available for sale” on our balance sheet.As of June 30, 2017, the carrying amount of assets pledged as collateral against repurchase agreements totaled $425 million. Assets pledged as collateral are reported in “securities available for sale” and “held-to-maturity securities” on our balance sheet. At June 30, 2017, the liabilities associated with collateral pledged were solely comprised of customer sweep financing activity and had a carrying value of $338 million. The collateral pledged under customer sweep repurchase agreements is posted to a third-party custodian and cannot be sold or repledged by the secured party. The risk related to a decline in the market value of collateral pledged is minimal given the collateral's high credit quality and the overnight duration of the repurchase agreements. Like other financing transactions, securities financing agreements contain an element of credit risk. To mitigate and manage credit risk exposure, we generally enter into master netting agreements and other collateral arrangements that give us the right, in the event of default, to liquidate collateral held and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty. Additionally, we establish and monitor limits on our counterparty credit risk exposure by product type. For the reverse repurchase agreements, we monitor the value of the underlying securities we received from counterparties and either request additional collateral or return a portion of the collateral based on the value of those securities. We generally hold collateral in the form of highly rated securities issued by the U.S. Treasury and fixed income securities. In addition, we may need to provide collateral to counterparties under our repurchase agreements. With the exception of collateral pledged against customer sweep repurchase agreements, the collateral we pledge and receive can generally be sold or repledged by the secured parties.117Table of Contents14. Employee Benefits Pension PlansEffective December 31, 2009, we amended our cash balance pension plan and other defined benefit plans to freeze all benefit accruals and close the plans to new employees. We will continue to credit participants’ existing account balances for interest until they receive their plan benefits. We changed certain pension plan assumptions after freezing the plans. As part of the acquisition of First Niagara, Key also obtained two frozen defined benefit plans sponsored by First Niagara, both of which provide benefits based upon length of service and compensation levels. Effective September 30, 2016, the two First Niagara plans merged into another defined benefit plan maintained by Key to form the KeyCorp Consolidated Cash Balance Plan. Effective December 31, 2016, our original cash balance pension plan merged into the KeyCorp Consolidated Cash Balance Plan.The components of net pension cost (benefit) for all funded and unfunded plans are as follows: Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30,in millions20172016 20172016Interest cost on PBO$12$11 $24$21Expected return on plan assets(17)(13) (34)(26)Amortization of losses44 88Net pension cost$(1)$2 $(2)$3      Other Postretirement Benefit PlansWe sponsor a retiree healthcare plan in which all employees age 55 with 5 years of service (or employees age 50 with 15 years of service who are terminated under conditions that entitle them to a severance benefit) are eligible to participate. Participant contributions are adjusted annually. Key may provide a subsidy toward the cost of coverage for certain employees hired before 2001 with a minimum of 15 years of service at the time of termination. We use a separate VEBA trust to fund the retiree healthcare plan. Effective November 29, 2016, an unfunded retiree welfare plan previously sponsored by First Niagara merged into our current retiree healthcare plan.The components of net postretirement benefit cost for all funded and unfunded plans are as follows: Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30,in millions20172016 20172016Interest cost on APBO—$1 —$2Expected return on plan assets—(1) —(2)Net postretirement benefit cost—— ——      118Table of Contents15. Trust Preferred Securities Issued by Unconsolidated Subsidiaries We own the outstanding common stock of business trusts formed by us that issued corporation-obligated, mandatorily redeemable, trust preferred securities. The trusts used the proceeds from the issuance of their trust preferred securities and common stock to buy debentures issued by KeyCorp. These debentures are the trusts’ only assets; the interest payments from the debentures finance the distributions paid on the mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities. The outstanding common stock of these business trusts is recorded in “other investments” on our balance sheet.We unconditionally guarantee the following payments or distributions on behalf of the trusts: •required distributions on the trust preferred securities;•the redemption price when a capital security is redeemed; and•the amounts due if a trust is liquidated or terminated.The Regulatory Capital Rules, discussed in “Supervision and regulation” in Item 2 of this report, implement a phase-out of trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital, consistent with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. For “standardized approach” banking organizations such as Key, the phase-out period began on January 1, 2015, and starting in 2016 requires us to treat our mandatorily redeemable, trust preferred securities as Tier 2 capital.The trust preferred securities, common stock, and related debentures are summarized as follows:dollars in millionsTrust Preferred Securities, Net of Discount (a)Common StockPrincipal Amount of Debentures, Net of Discount (b)Interest Rate of Trust Preferred Securities and Debentures (c)Maturity of Trust Preferred Securities and DebenturesJune 30, 2017     KeyCorp Capital I$155$6$1611.888%2028KeyCorp Capital II10641106.8752029KeyCorp Capital III13941437.7502029HNC Statutory Trust III181192.5862035Willow Grove Statutory Trust I181192.5562036HNC Statutory Trust IV161172.4502037Westbank Capital Trust II7—73.4642034Westbank Capital Trust III7—73.4642034Total$466$17$4834.890%—      December 31, 2016$475$17$4924.845%—      (a)The trust preferred securities must be redeemed when the related debentures mature, or earlier if provided in the governing indenture. Each issue of trust preferred securities carries an interest rate identical to that of the related debenture. Certain trust preferred securities include basis adjustments related to fair value hedges totaling $60 million at June 30, 2017, and $59 million at December 31, 2016. See Note 8 (“Derivatives and Hedging Activities”) for an explanation of fair value hedges.(b)We have the right to redeem these debentures. If the debentures purchased by KeyCorp Capital I, HNC Statutory Trust III, Willow Grove Statutory Trust I, HNC Statutory Trust IV, Westbank Capital Trust II, or Westbank Capital Trust III are redeemed before they mature, the redemption price will be the principal amount, plus any accrued but unpaid interest. If the debentures purchased by KeyCorp Capital II or KeyCorp Capital III are redeemed before they mature, the redemption price will be the greater of: (i) the principal amount, plus any accrued but unpaid interest, or (ii) the sum of the present values of principal and interest payments discounted at the Treasury Rate (as defined in the applicable indenture), plus 20 basis points for KeyCorp Capital II or 25 basis points for KeyCorp Capital III, or 50 basis points in the case of redemption upon either a tax or a capital treatment event for either KeyCorp Capital II or KeyCorp Capital III, plus any accrued but unpaid interest. The principal amount of certain debentures includes basis adjustments related to fair value hedges totaling $60 million at June 30, 2017, and $59 million at December 31, 2016. See Note 8 for an explanation of fair value hedges. The principal amount of debentures, net of discounts, is included in “long-term debt” on the balance sheet.(c)The interest rates for the trust preferred securities issued by KeyCorp Capital II and KeyCorp Capital III are fixed. The trust preferred securities issued by KeyCorp Capital I have a floating interest rate, equal to three-month LIBOR plus 74 basis points, that reprices quarterly. The trust preferred securities issued by HNC Statutory Trust III have a floating interest rate, equal to three-month LIBOR plus 140 basis points, that reprices quarterly. The trust preferred securities issued by Willow Grove Statutory Trust I have a floating interest rate, equal to three-month LIBOR plus 131 basis points, that reprices quarterly. The trust preferred securities issued by HNC Statutory Trust IV have a floating interest rate, equal to three-month LIBOR plus 128 basis points, that reprices quarterly. The trust preferred securities issued by Westbank Capital Trust II and Westbank Capital Trust III each have a floating interest rate, equal to three-month LIBOR plus 219 basis points, that reprices quarterly. The total interest rates are weighted-average rates.119Table of Contents16. Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees Legal ProceedingsSee Note 21 (“Commitments, Contingent Liabilities, and Guarantees”) under the heading “Legal Proceedings” on page 194 of our 2016 Form 10-K for a description of a proceeding styled In re: Checking Account Overdraft Litigation.Other litigation. From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are subject to various other litigation, investigations, and administrative proceedings. Private, civil litigations may range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to putative class action lawsuits with potentially thousands of class members. Investigations may involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both government agencies and self-regulatory bodies. These other matters may involve claims for substantial monetary relief. At times, these matters may present novel claims or legal theories. Due to the complex nature of these various other matters, it may be years before some matters are resolved. While it is impossible to ascertain the ultimate resolution or range of financial liability, based on information presently known to us, we do not believe there is any other matter to which we are a party, or involving any of our properties that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We continually monitor and reassess the potential materiality of these other litigation matters. We note, however, that in light of the inherent uncertainty in legal proceedings there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution will not exceed established reserves. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter, or a combination of matters, may be material to our results of operations for a particular period, depending upon the size of the loss or our income for that particular period.GuaranteesWe are a guarantor in various agreements with third parties. The following table shows the types of guarantees that we had outstanding at June 30, 2017. Information pertaining to the basis for determining the liabilities recorded in connection with these guarantees is included in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Guarantees” beginning on page 115 of our 2016 Form 10-K. June 30, 2017Maximum Potential Undiscounted Future PaymentsLiability Recordedin millionsFinancial guarantees:  Standby letters of credit$11,839$66Recourse agreement with FNMA2,8485Residential mortgage reserve1,2915Return guarantee agreement with LIHTC investors33Written put options (a)2,24350Total$18,224$129    (a)The maximum potential undiscounted future payments represent notional amounts of derivatives qualifying as guarantees.We determine the payment/performance risk associated with each type of guarantee described below based on the probability that we could be required to make the maximum potential undiscounted future payments shown in the preceding table. We use a scale of low (0% to 30% probability of payment), moderate (greater than 30% to 70% probability of payment), or high (greater than 70% probability of payment) to assess the payment/performance risk, and have determined that the payment/performance risk associated with each type of guarantee outstanding at June 30, 2017, is low.Standby letters of credit. KeyBank issues standby letters of credit to address clients’ financing needs. These instruments obligate us to pay a specified third party when a client fails to repay an outstanding loan or debt instrument or fails to perform some contractual nonfinancial obligation. Any amounts drawn under standby letters of credit are treated as loans to the client; they bear interest (generally at variable rates) and pose the same credit risk to us as a loan. At June 30, 2017, our standby letters of credit had a remaining weighted-average life of three years, with remaining actual lives ranging from less than one year to as many as 17 years.Recourse agreement with FNMA. We participate as a lender in the FNMA Delegated Underwriting and Servicing program. FNMA delegates responsibility for originating, underwriting, and servicing mortgages, and we assume a limited portion of the risk of loss during the remaining term on each commercial mortgage loan that we sell to FNMA. We maintain a reserve for such potential losses in an amount that we believe approximates the fair value of our liability. At June 30, 2017, the outstanding commercial mortgage loans in this program had a weighted-average remaining term of 7.7 years, and the unpaid principal balance outstanding of loans sold by us as a participant was $10.1 billion. The maximum potential amount of undiscounted future payments that we could be required to make under this program, as shown in the preceding table, is equal 120Table of Contentsto approximately 28% of the principal balance of loans outstanding at June 30, 2017. If we are required to make a payment, we would have an interest in the collateral underlying the related commercial mortgage loan; any loss we incur could be offset by the amount of any recovery from the collateral.Residential Mortgage Banking. We often originate and sell residential mortgage loans with servicing retained. Our loan sales activity is generally conducted through loan sales in a secondary market sponsored by FNMA and FHLMC. Subsequent to the sale of mortgage loans, we do not typically retain any interest in the underlying loans except through our relationship as the servicer of the loans.As is customary in the mortgage banking industry, we, or banks we have acquired, have made certain representations and warranties related to the sale of residential mortgage loans (including loans sold with servicing released) and to the performance of our obligations as servicer. The breach of any such representations or warranties could result in losses for us. Our maximum exposure to loss is equal to the outstanding principal balance of the sold loans; however, any loss would be reduced by any payments received on the loans or through the sale of collateral.At June 30, 2017, the outstanding residential mortgage loans in this program had a weighted-average LTV ratio of 71%, and the unpaid principal balance outstanding of loans sold by us was $4.3 billion. The risk assessment is low for the residential mortgage product. The maximum potential amount of undiscounted future payments that we could be required to make under this program, as shown in the preceding table, is equal to approximately 30% of the principal balance of loans outstanding at June 30, 2017. Our liability for estimated repurchase obligations on loans sold, which is included in other liabilities on our balance sheet, was $5 million at June 30, 2017.Return guarantee agreement with LIHTC investors. KAHC, a subsidiary of KeyBank, offered limited partnership interests to qualified investors. Partnerships formed by KAHC invested in low-income residential rental properties that qualify for federal low-income housing tax credits under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code. In certain partnerships, investors paid a fee to KAHC for a guaranteed return that is based on the financial performance of the property and the property’s confirmed LIHTC status throughout a 15-year compliance period. Typically, KAHC fulfills these guaranteed returns by distributing tax credits and deductions associated with the specific properties. If KAHC defaults on its obligation to provide the guaranteed return, KeyBank is obligated to make any necessary payments to investors. No recourse or collateral is available to offset our guarantee obligation other than the underlying income streams from the properties and the residual value of the operating partnership interests.As shown in the previous table, KAHC maintained a reserve in the amount of $3 million at June 30, 2017, which is sufficient to cover estimated future obligations under the guarantees. The maximum exposure to loss reflected in the table represents undiscounted future payments due to investors for the return on and of their investments.These guarantees have expiration dates that extend through 2018, but KAHC has not formed any new partnerships under this program since October 2003. Additional information regarding these partnerships is included in Note 10 (“Variable Interest Entities”).Written put options. In the ordinary course of business, we “write” put options for clients that wish to mitigate their exposure to changes in interest rates and commodity prices. At June 30, 2017, our written put options had an average life of three years. These instruments are considered to be guarantees, as we are required to make payments to the counterparty (the client) based on changes in an underlying variable that is related to an asset, a liability, or an equity security that the client holds. We are obligated to pay the client if the applicable benchmark interest rate or commodity price is above or below a specified level (known as the “strike rate”). These written put options are accounted for as derivatives at fair value, as further discussed in Note 8 (“Derivatives and Hedging Activities”). We mitigate our potential future payment obligations by entering into offsetting positions with third parties.Written put options where the counterparty is a broker-dealer or bank are accounted for as derivatives at fair value but are not considered guarantees since these counterparties typically do not hold the underlying instruments. In addition, we are a purchaser and seller of credit derivatives, which are further discussed in Note 8 (“Derivatives and Hedging Activities”).Default guarantees. Some lines of business participate in guarantees that obligate us to perform if the debtor (typically a client) fails to satisfy all of its payment obligations to third parties. We generally undertake these guarantees for one of two possible reasons: (i) either the risk profile of the debtor should provide an investment return, or (ii) we are supporting our underlying investment in the debtor. We do not hold collateral for the default guarantees. If we were required to make a payment under a guarantee, we would receive a pro rata share should the third party collect some or all of the amounts due from the debtor. At June 30, 2017, we had less than $1 million of default guarantees.121Table of ContentsOther Off-Balance Sheet RiskOther off-balance sheet risk stems from financial instruments that do not meet the definition of a guarantee as specified in the applicable accounting guidance, and from other relationships.Indemnifications provided in the ordinary course of business. We provide certain indemnifications, primarily through representations and warranties in contracts that we execute in the ordinary course of business in connection with loan and lease sales and other ongoing activities, as well as in connection with purchases and sales of businesses. We maintain reserves, when appropriate, with respect to liability that reasonably could arise as a result of these indemnities.Intercompany guarantees. KeyCorp, KeyBank, and certain of our affiliates are parties to various guarantees that facilitate the ongoing business activities of other affiliates. These business activities include issuing debt, assuming certain lease and insurance obligations, purchasing or issuing investments and securities, and engaging in certain leasing transactions involving clients.122Table of Contents17.

Shareholders' Equity Comprehensive Capital PlanAs previously reported and as authorized by the Board and pursuant to our 2016 capital plan (which was effective through the second quarter of 2017) submitted and not objected to by the Federal Reserve, we had authority to repurchase up to $350 million of our common shares. We completed $94 million of Common Share repurchases, including $88 million of Common Share repurchases in the open market and $6 million of Common Share repurchases related to employee equity compensation programs in the second quarter of 2017 under this authorization.As previously reported, our 2016 capital plan proposed an increase in our quarterly common share dividend from $.085 to $.095 per Common Share for the second quarter of 2017 which was approved by our Board in May 2017. On June 28, 2017, the Federal Reserve announced that it did not object to our 2017 capital plan submitted as part of the annual CCAR process. Share repurchases of up to $800 million were included in the 2017 capital plan, which is effective from the third quarter of 2017 through the second quarter of 2018. Potential dividend increases were also included in our 2017 capital plan. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Board plans to consider a potential increase in our quarterly common share dividend, up to $.105 per share, consistent with the 2017 capital plan. An additional potential increase in the quarterly common share dividend, up to $.12 per share, is expected to be considered by the Board for the second quarter of 2018. Preferred StockOn March 9, 2017, we announced that all of our 7.75% Noncumulative Perpetual Convertible Series A Preferred Stock would convert into KeyCorp Common Shares.

Line of Business Results The specific lines of business that constitute each of the major business segments (operating segments) are described below.Key Community BankKey Community Bank serves individuals and small to mid-sized businesses primarily through its 15-state branch network.Individuals are provided with branch-based deposit and investment products, personal finance services, and loans, including residential mortgages, home equity, credit card, and various types of installment loans. Key Community Bank offers personal property and casualty insurance, such as home, auto, renters, watercraft, and umbrella policies. Key Community Bank also purchases retail auto sales contracts via a network of auto dealerships. The auto dealerships finance the sale of automobiles as the initial lender and then assign the contracts to us pursuant to dealer agreements. In addition, financial, estate and retirement planning, asset management services, and Delaware Trust capabilities are offered to assist high net worth clients with their banking, trust, portfolio management, life insurance, charitable giving, and related needs. Small businesses are provided with deposit, investment and credit products, and business advisory services. Mid-sized businesses are provided with products and services, some of which are delivered by Key Corporate Bank, that include commercial lending, cash management, equipment leasing, investment, insurance including commercial property and casualty as well as captive insurance and employee benefit programs, succession planning, access to capital markets, derivatives, and foreign exchange.Key Corporate BankKey Corporate Bank is a full-service corporate and investment bank focused principally on serving the needs of middle market clients in seven industry sectors: consumer, energy, healthcare, industrial, public sector, real estate, and technology. Key Corporate Bank delivers a broad suite of banking and capital markets products to its clients, including syndicated finance, debt and equity capital markets, commercial payments, equipment finance, commercial mortgage banking, derivatives, foreign exchange, financial advisory, and public finance. Key Corporate Bank is also a significant servicer of commercial mortgage loans and a significant special servicer of CMBS. Key Corporate Bank delivers many of its product capabilities to clients of Key Community Bank.Other SegmentsOther Segments consists of corporate treasury, our principal investing unit, and various exit portfolios.Reconciling ItemsTotal assets included under “Reconciling Items” primarily represent the unallocated portion of nonearning assets of corporate support functions. Charges related to the funding of these assets are part of net interest income and are allocated to the business segments through noninterest expense. Reconciling Items also includes intercompany eliminations and certain items that are not allocated to the business segments because they do not reflect their normal operations, including merger-related charges.The information was derived from the internal financial reporting system that we use to monitor and manage our financial performance. GAAP guides financial accounting, but there is no authoritative guidance for “management accounting,” i.e., the way we apply judgment and experience to make reporting decisions. Consequently, the line of business results we report may not be comparable to line of business results presented by other companies.The selected financial data are based on internal accounting policies designed to compile results on a consistent basis and in a manner that reflects the underlying economics of the businesses. In accordance with our policies: •Net interest income is determined by assigning a standard cost for funds used or a standard credit for funds provided based on their assumed maturity, prepayment, and/or repricing characteristics;•Indirect expenses, such as computer servicing costs and corporate overhead, are allocated based on assumptions regarding the extent that each line of business actually uses the services;•The consolidated provision for credit losses is allocated among the lines of business primarily based on their actual net loan charge-offs, adjusted periodically for loan growth and changes in risk profile. The amount of the consolidated 126Table of Contentsprovision is based on the methodology that we use to estimate our consolidated ALLL. This methodology is described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses” beginning on page 109 of our 2016 Form 10-K;•Income taxes are allocated based on the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% and a blended state income tax rate (net of the federal income tax benefit) of 2.2%; and•Capital is assigned to each line of business based on economic equity.The development and application of the methodologies that we use to allocate items among our lines of business is a dynamic process. Accordingly, financial results may be revised periodically to reflect enhanced alignment of expense base allocation drivers, changes in the risk profile of a particular business, or changes in our organizational structure.The table on the following pages shows selected financial data for our major business segments for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2017, and June 30, 2016.127Table of ContentsThree months ended June 30,Key Community Bank Key Corporate Bankdollars in millions20172016 20172016SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS     Net interest income (TE)$676$392 $312$221Noninterest income336206 284230Total revenue (TE) (a)1,012598 596451Provision for credit losses4725 1930Depreciation and amortization expense2812 2213Other noninterest expense624433 277246Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes (TE)313128 278162Allocated income taxes and TE adjustments11648 5629Income (loss) from continuing operations19780 222133Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes—— ——Net income (loss)19780 222133Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests—— —(2)Net income (loss) attributable to Key$197$80 $222$135      AVERAGE BALANCES (b)     Loans and leases$47,431$30,936 $37,750$28,607Total assets (a)51,41932,963 44,17733,908Deposits79,71653,794 21,14619,129OTHER FINANCIAL DATA     Net loan charge-offs (b)$47$17 $19$27Return on average allocated equity (b)16.62%11.76% 31.29%26.23%Return on average allocated equity16.6211.76 31.2926.23Average full-time equivalent employees (c)10,8997,331 2,3642,138      Six months ended June 30,Key Community Bank Key Corporate Bankdollars in millions20172016 20172016SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS     Net interest income (TE)$1,306$791 $616$439Noninterest income613403 558437Total revenue (TE) (a)1,9191,194 1,174876Provision for credit losses9466 3673Depreciation and amortization expense5625 4226Other noninterest expense1,223858 559470Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes (TE)546245 537307Allocated income taxes and TE adjustments20391 13456Income (loss) from continuing operations343154 403251Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes—— ——Net income (loss)343154 403251Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests—— (1)(2)Net income (loss) attributable to Key$343$154 $404$253      AVERAGE BALANCES (b)     Loans and leases$47,235$30,863 $37,744$28,164Total assets (a)51,19232,910 44,17533,658Deposits79,55653,299 21,07518,602OTHER FINANCIAL DATA     Net loan charge-offs (b)$90$40 $33$45Return on average allocated equity (b)14.64%11.44% 28.14%24.58%Return on average allocated equity14.6411.44 28.1424.58Average full-time equivalent employees (c)10,8517,353 2,3742,132(a)Substantially all revenue generated by our major business segments is derived from clients that reside in the United States.

These financial statements are the responsibility of KeyCorp’s management.We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated financial statements referred to above for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of KeyCorp as of December 31, 2016, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein) and we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements in our report dated February 28, 2017. In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of KeyCorp as of December 31, 2016 is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.

Controls and ProceduresAs of the end of the period covered by this report, KeyCorp carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of KeyCorp’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of KeyCorp’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), to ensure that information required to be disclosed by KeyCorp in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to KeyCorp’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, KeyCorp’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, as of the end of the period covered by this report.PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal ProceedingsThe information presented in the Legal Proceedings section of Note 16 (“Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) is incorporated herein by reference.On at least a quarterly basis, we assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings utilizing the latest information available. Where it is probable that we will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements. These legal reserves may be increased or decreased to reflect any relevant developments on a quarterly basis. Where a loss is not probable or the amount of the loss is not estimable, we have not accrued legal reserves, consistent with applicable accounting guidance. Based on information currently available to us, advice of counsel, and available insurance coverage, we believe that our established reserves are adequate and the liabilities arising from the legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the inherent uncertainty in legal proceedings there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution will not exceed established reserves. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter or a combination of matters may be material to our results of operations for a particular period, depending upon the size of the loss or our income for that particular period.Item 1A.
