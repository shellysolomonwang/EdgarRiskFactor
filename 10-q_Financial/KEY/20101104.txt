Any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of subsequent events or circumstances. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider all risks and uncertainties disclosed in our SEC filings, including our reports on Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q and our registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, all of which are accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and at www.Key.com/IR.     Long-term goals  Our long-term financial goals are as follows:                 ¨    Continue to achieve a loan to core deposit ratio range of 90% to 100%.           ¨    Return to a moderate risk profile by targeting a net charge-off ratio range of 40 to 50 basis points.           ¨    Grow high quality and diverse revenue streams by targeting a net interest margin in excess of 3.50% and maintain noninterest income to total revenue of greater than 40%.           ¨    Create positive operating leverage and complete Keyvolution run-rate savings goal of $300 million to $375 million by the end of 2012.           ¨    Achieve a return on average assets in the range of 1.00% to 1.25%.

This was due to higher pre-provision net revenue and a lower provision for loan losses. The growth in pre-provision net revenue was the result of a higher net interest margin, well-controlled expenses and improvements in several fee-based businesses.           ¨    Our improved asset quality metrics, across the majority of our loan portfolios, are the result of lowering our risk profiles and proactively addressing credit quality issues.           ¨    Our balance sheet continues to reflect strong capital, liquidity and reserve levels. In August, 2010, we issued $750 million of senior 5-year senior unsecured debt at the holding company.           ¨    We established several long-term benchmark metrics for measuring our progress; they are identified in Figure 1.           ¨    During the first nine months of 2010, we opened 34 new branches, and we expect to open an additional five branches during the remainder of 2010. During 2009, we opened 38 new branches in eight markets, and we have completed renovations on 192 branches over the past two and a half years. We expect to open 35-40 new branches in 2011 as part of our long-term plan to modernize and strengthen our market presence in select markets.           ¨    During 2009, we settled all outstanding federal income tax issues with the IRS for the tax years 1997-2006, including all outstanding leveraged lease tax issues for all open tax years.           ¨    During the third quarter of 2009, we decided to exit the government-guaranteed education lending business, following earlier actions taken in the third quarter of 2008 to cease private student lending. As a result of this decision, we have accounted for the education lending business as a discontinued operation. Additionally, we ceased conducting business in both the commercial vehicle and office equipment leasing markets.           ¨    During the second quarter of 2009, we decided to wind down the operations of Austin, a subsidiary that specialized in managing hedge fund investments for institutional customers. As a result of this decision, we have accounted for this business as a discontinued operation.        Economic overview  During the third quarter of 2010, a renewed slowing of the U.S. economy ignited fears of a prolonged recovery or double-dip recession. With the strength of the economy in question, employers continued to be reluctant to add workers. U.S. payrolls decreased by 218,000 during the third quarter of 2010 compared to a 570,000 increase in the second quarter of 2010; however, the third quarter of 2010 decline was due to the termination of temporary government census workers hired during the second quarter. Private payrolls did increase, but at a slower pace than the second quarter, increasing by 274,000 compared to 353,000 the prior quarter. During 2010, the U.S. has gained 613,000 net jobs, and, therefore, is just beginning to offset the significant declines experienced over the prior two years, when over 8 million Americans lost their jobs. The average unemployment rate for the third quarter of 2010 declined to 9.6% from the second quarter average of 9.7%. This compares to a 9.3% average rate for all of 2009 and a 10 year average rate of 5.9%.  Even with mortgage rates at historically low levels and home affordability high, activity slowed in the housing market during the third quarter after the second quarter’s expiration of the homebuyer tax credit, which was offered as part of “The Worker, Homeownership and Business Assistance Act of 2009.” In September 2010, existing home sales decreased by 14% from June 2010. Weak demand and a rising pace of foreclosures served to weigh on home values as prices for existing homes over the same period declined by 6%. Foreclosures rose 11% over the third quarter. New home sales declined 1% in September 2010 from June 2010, while prices increased 2% over the same period. . Homebuilding activity saw moderate improvement as housing starts increased 13% in September 2010 from the year’s lows reached in June 2010, but still remain at very depressed levels.  Even as U.S. consumers continued to be constrained with high unemployment, consumer spending moderately increased in the third quarter of 2010. The average monthly rate of consumer spending increased 0.4% for the third quarter of 2010 compared to an average monthly increase of 0.3% in the first two quarters of 2010. Measures of inflation continued to remain low as prices for consumer goods and services increased a modest 1.1% in September 2010 from September 2009, compared to an annual increase of 1.1% in June 2010 and a 2.7% increase for all of 2009.  60    Table of Contents  The Federal Reserve expressed concerns that the current low levels of inflation were running below long-term targets for price stability and suggested further monetary policy action may be needed to address the issue. They held the federal funds target rate near zero during the quarter while maintaining its stance that rates would remain at exceptionally low levels for an extended period. The Federal Reserve also announced the planned reinvestment of principal payments from its agency debt and mortgage-backed securities portfolio into longer-term Treasuries. The possibility of additional quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve sent the benchmark two-year Treasury yield down to all time record low levels, falling 0.18% from 0.61% at June 30, 2010, to 0.43% at September 30, 2010. The ten-year Treasury yield, which began the quarter at 2.93%, declined 0.42% to close the quarter at 2.51%. As distress from the second quarter’s European sovereign debt crisis subsided during the third quarter of 2010, the related concerns over the creditworthiness of financial institutions diminished. This resulted in a decrease in short-term interbank lending rates by as much as 0.25% and a narrowing of credit spreads for financial institutions debt obligations.     Regulatory Reform Developments  On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Act into law. The Dodd-Frank Act is intended to address perceived deficiencies and gaps in the regulatory framework for financial services in the United States, reduce the risks of bank failures and better equip the nation’s regulators to guard against or mitigate any future financial crises, and manage systemic risk through increased supervision of systemically important financial companies (including nonbank financial companies). The Dodd-Frank Act implements numerous and far-reaching changes across the financial landscape affecting financial companies, including banks and bank holding companies such as Key. For a review of the various changes that the Dodd-Frank Act implements, see page 64 of our quarterly report for the period ended June 30, 2010. The rulemakings required by the various regulatory agencies are still in the process of being implemented.     Interchange Fees  Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will require additional studies and new regulations to be completed before they take effect. One area that has received considerable discussion is the potential impact on interchange revenues. In total, on an annualized basis, Key derives approximately $75 million in revenue from debit interchange. Until the regulations are proposed and ultimately finalized, we will not know the impact on this revenue stream.     Regulation E pursuant to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978  During the third quarter of 2010, the Federal Reserve’s final rules regarding Regulation E became effective. Regulation E is designed to protect consumers by prohibiting unfair practices and improving disclosures to consumers. Regulation E became effective July 1, 2010, for new clients and on August 15, 2010, for existing clients. Regulation E, among other items, prohibits financial institutions from charging overdraft fees to a client without receiving consent from the client to “opt-in” to the financial institutions overdraft services for ATM and everyday debit card transactions.  Based on the number of clients whom have opted-in, we anticipate these rules to reduce our deposit service charge income by approximately $40 million annually. The decline experienced in our deposit service charge income during the third quarter of 2010 is consistent with our expectations. However, this amount is subject to change as additional clients make their overdraft decisions.     Demographics  We have two major business groups: Community Banking and National Banking. The effect on our business of continued volatility and weakness in the housing market varies with the state of the economy in the regions in which these business groups operate.  The Community Banking group serves consumers and small to mid-sized businesses by offering a variety of deposit, investment, lending and wealth management products and services. These products and services are provided through a 14-state branch network organized into three internally defined geographic regions: Rocky Mountains and Northwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast.  We are somewhat encouraged by the stabilization we are seeing in our middle market commercial and industrial portfolio, specifically in our Great Lakes and Northeast Regions. Businesses are beginning to make investments to upgrade their production capabilities and are thinking about acquiring other companies. In addition, we have experienced growth of our core leasing portfolio as clients have upgraded their technology and equipment investments. However, we do not anticipate the activity in our commercial and industrial, and core leasing portfolios will be sufficient enough to offset continued pay-downs in our remaining books of business over the next several quarters.  Figure 2 shows the geographic diversity of our Community Banking group’s average core deposits, commercial loans and home equity loans.  61    Table of Contents  Figure 2.

The National Banking group includes those corporate business units that operate nationally, within and beyond our 14-state branch network, as well as internationally. The specific products and services offered by the Community and National Banking groups are described in Note 3.  We saw market liquidity strengthen in the latter half of the third quarter of 2010. We used this as an opportunity to continue to move our nonperforming assets. We were also encouraged by the fact we were able to move these assets close to their carrying value recorded on our books.  Figure 17, which appears later in this report in the “Loans and loans held for sale” section, shows the diversity of our commercial real estate lending business based on industry type and location. As previously reported, we have ceased all new lending to homebuilders and, since December 31, 2007, we have reduced outstanding balances in the residential properties segment of the commercial real estate construction loan portfolio by $2.9 billion, or 82%, to $643 million. Additional information about loan sales is included in the “Credit risk management” section.  Since the beginning of the financial crisis, results for the National Banking group have also been affected adversely by increasing credit costs and volatility in the capital markets, which have led to declines in the market values of assets under management and the market values at which we record certain assets (primarily commercial real estate loans and securities held for sale or trading).  During the third quarter of 2009, we recorded an after-tax write-off of other intangible assets in the amount of $28 million related to our leasing operation. During the first quarter of 2009, we determined that the estimated fair value of the National Banking reporting unit was less than the carrying amount. As a result, we recorded an after-tax noncash accounting charge of $164 million, which excludes an after-tax charge of $23 million related to the discontinued operations of Austin. As a result of this charge and a similar after-tax charge of $420 million recorded during the fourth quarter of 2008, we have written off all of the goodwill that had been assigned to our National Banking reporting unit.     Critical accounting policies and estimates  Our business is dynamic and complex. Consequently, we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies. These choices are critical: not only are they necessary to comply with GAAP, they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance. All accounting policies are important, and all policies described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) on page 79 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance.  In our opinion, some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility. These policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance, or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. Because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances, they may prove to be inaccurate, or we may find it necessary to change them.  We rely heavily on the use of judgment, assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions, including accounting for the allowance for loan losses; contingent liabilities, guarantees and income taxes; derivatives and related hedging activities; and assets and liabilities that involve valuation methodologies. In addition, we may employ outside valuation experts to assist us in determining fair values of certain assets and liabilities. A brief discussion of each of these areas appears on pages 19 through 21 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders.  At September 30, 2010, $25.2 billion, or 27%, of our total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Approximately 96% of these assets, before netting adjustments, were classified as Level 1 or Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. At September  62    Table of Contents  30, 2010, $2.7 billion, or 3%, of our total liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Substantially all of these liabilities were classified as Level 1 or Level 2.  At September 30, 2010, $393 million, or .4%, of our total assets were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Approximately 9% of these assets were classified as Level 1 or Level 2. At September 30, 2010, there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  In addition, with the consolidation of the education lending securitization trusts on January 1, 2010, assets and liabilities at fair value of $3.3 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively, were included on the balance sheet at September 30, 2010, in the discontinued assets and liabilities line items.  During the first nine months of 2010, we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates.     Highlights of Our Performance  Financial performance  For the third quarter of 2010, we announced net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $163 million, or $.19 per common share. These results compare to a net loss from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $422 million, or $.50 per common share, for the third quarter of 2009. Third quarter net income attributable to Key common shareholders was $178 million compared to a net loss attributable to Key common shareholders of $438 million for the third quarter of 2009. Net income attributable to Key common shareholders for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 was $111 million compared to a net loss attributable to Key common shareholders of $1.364 billion for the same period one year ago.  The third quarter earnings improvement resulted from improved pre-provision net revenue and a lower provision for loan losses when compared to the second quarter of 2010. Credit quality also continued to improve across the majority of the loan portfolios in both Community Banking and National Banking.  For the first nine months of 2010, the net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shares was $121 million, or $.14 per common share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $1.323 billion, or $2.07 per common share, for the same period last year.  The net interest margin was 3.35% for the third quarter of 2010. This was an increase of 18 basis points from the second quarter of 2010 and an increase of 55 basis points from the year-ago quarter. The increase from the second quarter of 2010 was due to the re-pricing of maturing certificates of deposit in the third quarter. Given the current mix of assets and liabilities and the existing shape of the yield curve, we expect the fourth quarter of 2010 net interest margin in the 3.30% range as we continue to experience inflows of transaction and money market deposits that we are re-deploying into a higher volume of lower yielding investments.  Net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2010 were $357 million, a decline of $230 million from the third quarter of 2009. During the same period, commercial loan net charge-offs decreased by $218 million, primarily driven by lower charge-offs from the commercial real estate construction portfolio. We also experienced improvement across all of our consumer portfolios in the third quarter. During the third quarter, nonperforming loans decreased by $331 million, from $1.7 billion at June 30, 2010 to $1.4 billion at September 30, 2010 and were down $918 million from their peak at September 30, 2009. This decrease was primarily attributable to continued stabilization in the commercial loan portfolio.  Our Tier 1 common equity and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios at September 30, 2010, remain strong at 8.61% and 14.30%, respectively, compared to 7.64% and 12.61%, respectively, at September 30, 2009.  Our allowance for loan losses decreased to $2 billion from $2.5 billion one year-ago. At September 30, 2010, our allowance represented 3.81% of total loans and 142.6% of nonperforming loans compared to 4.00% and 108.5%, respectively at September 30, 2009. One of our primary areas of focus has been to reduce our exposure to the higher risk segments of our commercial real estate portfolio. Further information pertaining to our progress in reducing our commercial real estate exposure and our exit loan portfolio is presented in the section entitled “Credit risk management.”  We made significant progress strengthening our liquidity and funding positions in the midst of weak loan demand and a soft economy. Our consolidated loan to deposit ratio was 92% at September 30, 2010, compared to 101% at September 30, 2009. This improvement was accomplished by reducing our reliance on wholesale funding, exiting nonrelationship businesses and increasing the portion of our earning assets invested in highly liquid securities. During the first nine months of 2010, we originated approximately $21 billion in new or renewed lending commitments.  63    Table of Contents  During the first nine months of 2010, we continued our investment in our Community Banking 14-state branch network by opening 34 new branches, with an additional five branches slated to be opened during the remainder of 2010. In addition, we also continue with our plans to further modernize our existing branches. Our online account application features were ranked second among the 16 largest U.S. banks in Corporate Insight’s September 2010 edition of Bank Monitor, a leading rating service for the online space. We had previously been recognized by Bank Monitor for our capabilities in the areas of online application, account information, and alerts. The investment in new and modernized branches, coupled with the enhancements to online banking, reflect our relationship strategy and efforts to provide clients with a breadth of options that meet their specific banking needs. We are positioning our branch and online capabilities to enhance growth as the economy turns. These investments enable our customers to utilize the full breadth of solutions, expertise, products and services we have to offer.  We continue to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our organization. Over the past two years, we have reduced our staff by more than 2,400 average full-time equivalent employees and implemented ongoing initiatives that will better align our cost structure with our relationship-focused business strategies. We want to ensure that we have effective business models that are sustainable and flexible.  Finally, we remain steadfast in our actions of reducing risk exposure, concentrating on core relationship businesses, and maintaining strong capital, liquidity and reserve levels as we emerge from this extraordinary credit cycle as a strong, competitive company.

In April 2009, we decided to wind down the operations of Austin, a subsidiary that specialized in managing hedge fund investments for institutional customers. As a result of these decisions, we have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations. The loss from discontinued operations for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010, was primarily attributable to fair value adjustments related to the education lending securitization trusts. Included in the loss from discontinued operations for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2009, is a charge for intangible assets impairment related to Austin.

conducted through Key Education Resources, the education payment and financing unit of KeyBank. In April 2009, we decided to wind down the operations of Austin, a subsidiary that specialized in managing hedge fund investments for institutional customers.    65    Table of Contents  Figure 5 presents certain financial measures related to “tangible common equity” and “Tier 1 common equity.” The tangible common equity ratio has been a focus of some investors. We believe this ratio may assist investors in analyzing our capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. Since the SCAP in early 2009, the Federal Reserve has focused its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 capital known as Tier 1 common equity. Because the Federal Reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders’ equity (essentially Tier 1 capital less preferred stock, qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in Tier 1 capital, this focus on Tier 1 common equity is consistent with existing capital adequacy guidelines. The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to bank holding companies by requiring regulators to create rules phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities (excluding TARP CPP preferred stock issued to the United States or its agencies or instrumentalities before October 4, 2010) being treated as Tier 1 eligible capital. This three year phase-out period, which commences January 1, 2013, will ultimately result in our capital securities being treated only as Tier 2 capital.  Tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by GAAP nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations; this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity and Tier 1 common equity, we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases. Figure 5 also reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures.  The table also shows the computation for pre-provision net revenue, which is not formally defined by GAAP. Management believes that eliminating the effects of provision for loan losses facilitates the analysis of results by presenting them on a more comparable basis.  Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.  66    Table of Contents  Figure 5.

During the first quarter of 2010, we re-aligned our reporting structure for our business groups. Prior to 2010, Consumer Finance consisted mainly of portfolios which were identified as exit or run-off portfolios and were included in our National Banking segment. Effective for all periods presented, we are reflecting the results of these exit portfolios in Other Segments. The automobile dealer floor-plan business, previously included in Consumer Finance, has been re-aligned with the Commercial Banking line of business within the Community Banking segment. In addition, other previously identified exit portfolios included in the National Banking segment have been moved to Other Segments. Note 3 (“Line of Business Results”) describes the products and services offered by each of these business groups, provides more detailed financial information pertaining to the groups and their respective lines of business, and explains “Other Segments” and “Reconciling Items.”  Figure 6 summarizes the contribution made by each major business group to our “taxable-equivalent revenue from continuing operations” and “income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Key” for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010 and 2009.

(b)   Other Segments’ results for the third quarter of 2009 include a $17 million ($11 million after-tax) loss related to the exchange of Key common shares for capital securities.       Community Banking summary of operations  As shown in Figure 7, Community Banking recorded net income attributable to Key of $57 million for the third quarter of 2010, compared to net income attributable to Key of less than $1 million for the year-ago quarter. Decreases in the provision for loan losses and noninterest expense contributed to the improvement in the third quarter of 2010.  Taxable-equivalent net interest income declined by $31 million, or 7%, from the third quarter of 2009, due to declines in average earning assets and average deposits. Average earning assets decreased $2 billion, or 8%, from the year-ago quarter, reflecting reductions in the commercial loan and home equity loan portfolios. Average deposits declined by $4 billion, or 8%. The mix of deposits continues to change from the year-ago quarter as higher-costing certificates of deposit originated in prior years mature, partially offset by growth in noninterest-bearing deposits and NOW accounts.  Noninterest income increased by $2 million, or 1%, from the year-ago quarter, due to higher income from trust and investment services, electronic banking fees, and a reduction in the provision for credit losses from client derivatives. The increase in trust and investment services income reflects increased performance in the Key Private Bank, as well as growth in Key’s branch-based investment services. These factors were partially offset by the anticipated lower service charges on deposits from the implementation of Regulation E.  68    Table of Contents  The provision for loan losses declined by $85 million, or 53%, compared to the third quarter of 2009 due to improving economic conditions from one year ago.  Noninterest expense declined by $30 million, or 6%, from the year-ago quarter. The decrease was driven by reductions in FDIC deposit insurance premiums of $9 million from the third quarter of 2009, a credit of $5 million recorded to the provision for losses on lending-related commitments compared to a charge of $7 million recorded in the third quarter of 2009, and a reduction in corporate allocated costs. These improvements were partially offset by increases in personnel expense and professional fees.  Figure 7.

             National Banking summary of operations  As shown in Figure 8, National Banking recorded net income attributable to Key of $130 million for the third quarter of 2010, compared to a net loss attributable to Key of $236 million for the same period one year ago. This improvement in the third quarter of 2010 was a result of a substantial decrease in the provision for loan losses.  Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $16 million, or 7%, compared to the third quarter of 2009, primarily due to lower earning assets, partially offset by improved earning asset yields. Average earning assets decreased by $7 billion, or 27%, from the year-ago quarter.  Noninterest income increased $65 million, or 40%, from the third quarter of 2009. Investment banking and capital markets income increased $56 million, letter of credit and loan fees increased $18 million, and net gains from loan sales were $8 million, compared to net losses from loan sales of $9 million for the same period one year ago. These gains were offset by decreases in trust and investment  69    Table of Contents  services income of $8 million, operating lease revenue of $7 million, and various other miscellaneous income items from the third quarter of 2009.  The provision for loan losses in the third quarter of 2010 was a $25 million credit compared to a $439 million charge for the same period one year ago. National Banking continued to experience improved asset quality for the fourth quarter in a row.  Noninterest expense decreased by $76 million, or 23%, from the third quarter of 2009 as a result of a decrease in the write-off of intangible assets of $45 million and a credit of $4 million to the provision for losses on lending-related commitments compared to a charge of $20 million in the year-ago quarter. OREO expense, operating lease expense, and the provision for losses on LIHTC guaranteed funds also declined from the third quarter of 2009. These improvements were partially offset by an increase in personnel costs.  Figure 8.

Other Segments  Other Segments consist of Corporate Treasury, Key’s Principal Investing unit and various exit portfolios which were previously included within the National Banking segment. These exit portfolios were moved to Other Segments during the first quarter of 2010. Prior periods have been adjusted to conform with the current reporting of the financial information for each segment. Other Segments generated net income attributable to Key of $19 million for the third quarter of 2010, compared to a net loss attributable to Key of $150 million for the same period last year. These results reflect an increase in net interest income of $86 million from the third quarter of 2009 and a decrease in the provision for loan losses of $92 million.  70    Table of Contents     Results of Operations     Net interest income  One of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets (such as loans and securities) and loan-related fee income, and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. There are several factors that affect net interest income, including:     ♦    the volume, pricing, mix and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities;      ♦    the volume and value of net free funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and equity capital;      ♦    the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk;      ♦    interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace; and      ♦    asset quality.    To make it easier to compare results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets (some taxable, some not), we present net interest income in this discussion on a “taxable-equivalent basis” (i.e., as if it were all taxable and at the same rate). For example, $100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as $154, an amount that — if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% — would yield $100.  Figure 9 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense, and their respective yields or rates over the past five quarters. This figure also presents a reconciliation of taxable-equivalent net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with GAAP for each of those quarters. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized taxable-equivalent net interest income by average earning assets.  Taxable-equivalent net interest income for the third quarter of 2010 was $647 million, and the net interest margin was 3.35%. These results compare to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $599 million and a net interest margin of 2.80% for the third quarter of 2009. The increase in the net interest margin is primarily attributable to lower funding costs. We continue to experience an improvement in the mix of deposits by reducing the level of higher costing certificates of deposit and increasing lower costing transaction accounts. We expect this change in funding mix to continue through the fourth quarter of 2010, although at a slower pace going forward. This reduced pace will result from a lower volume of higher costing maturing certificates of deposit in the fourth quarter of 2010. Over the past year, funding costs were also reduced by maturities of long-term debt and the 2009 exchanges of capital securities for Key common shares. We also experienced improved yields on loans due to lower levels of nonperforming loans.  Compared to the second quarter of 2010, taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $24 million, and the net interest margin expanded by 18 basis points. Most of this improvement is attributable to the repricing of certificates of deposit and an overall improved mix of deposits. Our third quarter net interest margin also benefitted from reducing amounts invested in overnight short-term investments and investing these funds in collateralized mortgage-backed securities which were issued by government-sponsored entities and GNMA, and had an average duration of 2.5-3.5 years.  Average earning assets for the third quarter of 2010 totaled $77.5 billion, which was $8.0 billion, or 9%, lower than the third quarter of 2009. This reduction reflects a $12.2 billion decrease in loans caused by soft demand for both consumer and commercial credit due to the uncertain economic environment and the run-off in our exit portfolios and net charge-offs. A $3.6 billion decrease in short-term investments is due to reducing amounts invested in overnight short-term investments. The decline in earning assets was partially offset by increases of $8.1 billion in securities available for sale due to our emphasis on building liquidity and investing excess cash flows from loan repayments.  Since January 1, 2009, the size and composition of our loan portfolios have been affected by the following actions:     ♦    During the first nine months of 2010, we sold $2.0 billion in total loans, excluding $487 million of education loans that relate to our discontinued operations of the education lending business. The largest portion of loans sold, $1.0 billion, were residential real estate loans.      ♦    In the fourth quarter of 2009, we transferred loans with a fair value of $82 million from held-for-sale status to the held-to-maturity portfolio as a result of current market conditions and our related plans to restructure the terms of these loans.    71    Table of Contents    ♦    In late September 2009, we transferred $193 million of loans ($248 million, net of $55 million in net charge-offs) from the held-to-maturity loan portfolio to held-for-sale status in conjunction with additional actions taken to reduce our exposure in the commercial real estate and institutional portfolios through the sale of selected assets. Most of these loans were sold during October 2009.      ♦    We sold $1.3 billion of commercial real estate loans during 2009. Since some of these loans have been sold with limited recourse (i.e., there is a risk that we will be held accountable for certain events or representations made in the sales agreements), we established and have maintained a loss reserve in an amount that we believe is appropriate. More information about the related recourse agreement is provided in Note 13 (“Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) under the heading “Recourse agreement with FNMA.”      ♦    In late September 2009, we decided to exit the government-guaranteed education lending business and have applied discontinued operations accounting to the education lending business for all periods presented in this report. We sold $474 million of education loans (included in “discontinued assets” on the balance sheet) during 2009.      ♦    In addition to the sales of commercial real estate loans discussed above, we sold other loans totaling $1.8 billion (including $1.5 billion of residential real estate loans) during 2009.    72    Table of Contents     Figure 9.

Noninterest income  Our noninterest income was $486 million for the third quarter of 2010, compared to $382 million for the year-ago quarter. For the first nine months of the year, noninterest income was $1.4 billion, representing a decrease of $138 million, or 9%, from the first nine months of 2009.  As shown in Figure 11, the third quarter of 2010 noninterest income improved by $104 million from the third quarter of 2009, primarily due to increases of $68 million in investment banking and capital markets income, $24 million in gains from principal investing and $15 million in letter of credit and loan fees. Also included in the third quarter of 2010 was a $12 million dividend from corporate-owned life insurance. Offsetting these increases was a $14 million decrease in operating lease income. Lastly, as anticipated, as a result of the implementation of Regulation E deposit service charge income decreased.  For the year-to-date period, the $138 million decrease in noninterest income was largely attributable to our nonfee-based income items. A reduction in net securities gains of $110 million, a decrease of $105 million for a nonrecurring gain from the sale of Visa Inc. shares recorded during the first quarter of 2009, a decrease of $78 million related to our exchange of common shares for capital securities in the second and third quarters of 2009, and $70 million in reduced gains from the sale of leased equipment all contributed to the decrease in noninterest income. These decreases are offset by a $156 million increase in net gains from principal investing and a $77 million increase in income from investment banking and capital markets activities in 2010.  75    Table of Contents  Figure 11.

Trust and investment services income. Trust and investment services are our largest source of noninterest income. The primary components of revenue generated by these services are shown in Figure 12. The third quarter of 2010 decrease of $3 million, or 3%, is attributable to lower income from brokerage commissions and fees.  Figure 12. Trust and Investment Services Income                                                                                Three months ended                     Nine months ended                     September 30,     Change     September 30,     Change            dollars in millions   2010     2009     Amount     Percent     2010     2009     Amount     Percent                   Brokerage commissions and fee income    $ 33      $ 37      $ (4 )     (10.8 )%    $ 102      $ 120      $ (18 )     (15.0 )  %       Personal asset management and custody fees     37       35       2       5.7       111       104       7       6.7           Institutional asset management and custody fees     40       41       (1 )     (2.4 )     123       118       5       4.2                 Total trust and investment services income    $ 110      $ 113      $ (3 )     (2.7 )%    $ 336      $ 342      $ (6 )     (1.8 )  %                                                                                                                               A significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management. At September 30, 2010, our bank, trust and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of $59.7 billion, compared to $66.1 billion at September 30, 2009. As shown in Figure 13, most of the decrease was attributable to decreases in the securities lending and money market portfolios, offset in part by an increase in the fixed income portfolio. The decline in the securities lending portfolio was due to relatively flat equity market activities, a decline on spreads, and client departures. When clients’ securities are lent out, the borrower must provide us with cash collateral, which is invested during the term of the loan. The difference between the revenue generated from the investment and the cost of the collateral is shared with the lending client. This business, although profitable, generates a significantly lower rate of return (commensurate with the lower level of risk) than other types of assets under management. The decline in the money market portfolio was due in part to the low rate environment as clients look for higher yields in other investment strategies. The decrease in the value of our portfolio of hedge funds is attributable in part to our second quarter of 2009 decision to wind down the operations of Austin.  76    Table of Contents  Figure 13.

Service charges on deposit accounts. The decrease in service charges on deposit accounts during the first nine months of 2010 is due primarily to changing client behaviors resulting in lower transaction volume, which generated fewer overdraft fees. A recent component of the decrease was due to the implementation of Regulation E, which went into effect on July 1, 2010 for new clients and August 15, 2010 for our existing clients. The decrease in service charges on deposit accounts associated with Regulation E was in line with our expectations.     Operating lease income. Reduced originations of operating leases due to the related economics resulted in decreases of $14 million and $44 million in our third quarter of 2010 and the first nine months of 2010, respectively, in the Equipment Finance line of business. These decreases are primarily attributable to impaired leases and product run-off. Accordingly, as shown in Figure 15, operating lease expense also declined.     Net gains (losses) from loan sales. We sell loans to achieve desired interest rate and credit risk profiles of the overall loan portfolio. During the first nine months of 2010, we recorded $47 million of net gains from loan sales, compared to net gains of $4 million during the first nine months of 2009. We saw market liquidity strengthen in the latter half of the third quarter of 2010 and used this as an opportunity to continue to move our nonperforming assets. We were also encouraged by the fact we were able to move these assets at values close to their carrying values recorded on our books.     Net gains (losses) from principal investing. Principal investments consist of direct and indirect investments in predominantly privately-held companies. Our principal investing income is susceptible to volatility since most of it is derived from mezzanine debt and equity investments in small to medium-sized businesses. These investments are carried on the balance sheet at fair value ($945 million at September 30, 2010, compared to $1 billion at December 31, 2009, and $935 million at September 30, 2009). The net gains (losses) presented in Figure 11 derive from changes in fair values as well as sales of principal investments.     Investment banking and capital markets income (loss). As shown in Figure 14, income from investment banking and capital markets activities increased from the year-ago quarter and year-to-date periods. Dealer trading and derivatives losses decreased by $26 million from the year-ago quarter due largely to a $12 million decrease in the provision for losses related to customer derivatives and $17 million increase in corporate bonds trading income. Other investment income increased $25 million resulting from lower losses from changes in the fair value of certain investments made by our Funds Management Group within our Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services line of business in National Banking. Investment banking income increased $16 million due to advisory services, and merger and acquisition fees.  77    Table of Contents  Figure 14.

For the first nine months of the year, noninterest expense was $2.3 billion, representing a decrease of $393 million, or 15%, from the first nine months of 2009.  As shown in Figure 15, the decrease for the third quarter of 2010 compared to the year-ago quarter was attributable to a $47 million decrease in net OREO expense; a $45 million decrease in intangible assets impairment; a $39 million decrease in provision for losses on lending-related commitments; a $21 million decrease in personnel expenses; and a $13 million decrease in FDIC assessment as a result of opting out of the TAG program effective July 1, 2010 and a decrease in insured deposits.  The decrease in net OREO is attributable to sales of OREO at prices approximating their net carrying values.  The decrease in provision for losses on lending-related commitments is due to a $10 million credit for the quarter resulting from improved credit quality and fewer unfunded commitments.  For the year-to-date period, the decline is attributable to a $241 million decrease in intangible assets impairment; a $62 million decrease in provision for losses on lending-related commitments; a $43 million decrease in FDIC assessment expense; a $31 million decrease in operating lease expense and a decrease in OREO expense of $14 million.  The decrease in provision for losses on lending-related commitments is due to a $22 million credit during the year-to-date period resulting from improved credit quality and a lower level of unfunded commitments.  FDIC assessment expense decreased due to a one time special assessment recorded in the second quarter of 2009, the result of opting out of the TAG program effective July 1, 2010 and a decrease in insured deposits.  OREO expense decreased as a result of improved liquidity for income producing properties in the current year resulting in fewer write-downs compared to one year-ago.  78    Table of Contents  Figure 15.

The following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest expense and the factors that caused those elements to change.     Personnel. As shown in Figure 16, personnel expense, the largest category of our noninterest expense, decreased by $8 million, or 1%, from the first nine months of 2009. The decrease was due primarily to a $38 million decrease in our employee benefits expense. The employee benefits decrease was caused by a decline in pension expense due to amending our pension plans to freeze all benefit accruals, as previously reported, and the resulting change in pension plan assumptions. For more information related to our pension plans, see Note 11 (“Employee Benefits”). Severance also decreased by $15 million. The personnel decrease was partially offset by $35 million in increased incentive compensation accruals on improved profitability and increases of $5 million in both salaries and stock-based compensation.

During the third quarter of 2009, we recorded a $45 million charge to write-off intangible assets, other than goodwill, associated with actions taken to cease conducting business in certain equipment leasing markets. During the first quarter of 2009, we determined that the estimated fair value of our National Banking reporting unit was less than the carrying amount, reflecting continued weakness in the financial markets. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax noncash accounting charge of $223 million, of which $27 million relates to the discontinued operations of Austin. As a result of this charge, we have now written off all of the goodwill that had been assigned to our National Banking reporting unit.     Operating lease expense. The decrease in operating lease expense compared to both the quarterly and year-to-date periods is attributable to impaired leases and product run-off. Income related to the rental of leased equipment is presented in Figure 11 as “operating lease income.”     Professional fees. Professional fees for both the 2010 quarter-to-date and year-to-date periods are consistent with their corresponding periods from the prior year.  79    Table of Contents     Corporate-wide efficiency initiative (Keyvolution). In late 2008, we began a corporate-wide initiative designed to build a consistently superior experience for our clients, simplify processes, improve speed to market, and enhance our ability to seize growth and profit opportunities. As of September 30, 2010, we have implemented $224 million of the targeted run-rate savings toward our goal of achieving $300 million to $375 million by the end of 2012. Over the past two years, we have been exiting certain noncore businesses, such as retail marine and education lending, and have been modernizing our 14-state branch networks coupled with enhancing our online banking to provide clients with a breadth of options that meet their specific banking needs. As a result of these and other efforts, over the last two years, we have reduced our workforce by 2,400 average full-time equivalent employees.     Income taxes  We recorded tax expense from continuing operations of $85 million for the third quarter of 2010 and $11 million for the second quarter of 2010, compared to a tax benefit of $274 million for the third quarter of 2009. For the first nine months of 2010, we recorded a tax benefit from continuing operations of $14 million, compared to a benefit of $688 million for the same period last year.  The tax benefit recorded in prior periods is largely attributable to the before tax net loss resulting from continuation of an uncertain economic environment and recognition of tax credits arising from investments in low income housing projects. During the first quarter of 2009, our results from continuing operations included a $196 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets, of which $110 million is not deductible for tax purposes.  Our federal tax (benefit) expense differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate, primarily because we generate income from investments in tax-advantaged assets, such as corporate-owned life insurance, earn credits associated with investments in low-income housing projects, and make periodic adjustments to our tax reserves.  Additional information pertaining to how our tax (benefit) expense and the resulting effective tax rates were derived are included in Note 18 (“Income Taxes”) on page 117 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders.     Financial Condition     Loans and loans held for sale  At September 30, 2010, total loans outstanding from continuing operations were $51.4 billion, compared to $58.8 billion at December 31, 2009 and $62.2 billion at September 30, 2009. Loans related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business, which are excluded from total loans at September 30, 2010, December 31, 2009, and September 30, 2009, totaled $6.6 billion, $3.5 billion, and $3.6 billion, respectively. The decrease in our loans from continuing operations over the past twelve months reflects reductions in most of our portfolios, with the largest decline experienced in the commercial portfolio. For more information on balance sheet carrying value, see Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the headings “Loans” and “Loans Held for Sale” on page 81 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders.  80    Table of Contents     Commercial loan portfolio  Commercial loans outstanding decreased by $9.6 billion, or 21%, since September 30, 2009, as a result of continued soft demand for credit due to continued sluggish economic conditions, accelerated paydowns on our portfolios as commercial clients continue to de-leverage, the run-off in our exit loan portfolio and still elevated net charge-offs.     Commercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans represent approximately 24% of our total loan portfolio. These loans include both owner and nonowner-occupied properties and constitute approximately 35% of our commercial loan portfolio. As shown in Figure 17, at September 30, 2010, our commercial real estate portfolio included mortgage loans of $9.7 billion and construction loans of $2.7 billion representing 19% and 5% respectively, of our total loans. Nonowner-occupied loans represent 17% of our total loans and owner-occupied loans represent 7% of our total loans. The average mortgage loan originated during the third quarter of 2010 was $2.8 million, and our largest mortgage loan at September 30, 2010, had a balance of $123 million. At September 30, 2010, our average construction loan commitment was $3.6 million. Our largest construction loan commitment was $49 million, $48 million of which was outstanding.  Our commercial real estate lending business is conducted through two primary sources: our 14-state banking franchise, and Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services, a national line of business that cultivates relationships both within and beyond the branch system. This line of business deals primarily with nonowner-occupied properties (generally properties for which at least 50% of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties) and accounted for approximately 61% of our average year-to-date commercial real estate loans during the third quarter of 2010, compared to 58% one year ago. Our commercial real estate business generally focuses on larger real estate developers and owners. As shown in Figure 17, this loan portfolio is diversified by both property type and geographic location of the underlying collateral. Figure 17 includes commercial mortgage and construction loans in both the Community Banking and National Banking groups.  Figure 17.

have decreased by $518 million compared to an increase of $600 million for the same period in 2009.  The secondary market for income property loans has been severely constrained for the past three years and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. In prior years, we have not provided permanent financing for our clients upon the completion of their construction projects; permanent financing had been provided by the commercial mortgage-backed securities market or other lenders. With other sources of permanent commercial mortgage financing constrained, we are currently providing interim financing for certain  81    Table of Contents  of our relationship clients upon completion of their commercial real estate construction projects. During 2009 and the first nine months of 2010, we extended the maturities, for up to five years, of certain existing loans to commercial real estate relationship clients with projects at or near completion. We applied normal customary underwriting standards to these longer-term extensions and generally received market rates of interest and additional fees, offering permanent market proxy fixed rates where appropriate, to mitigate the potential impact of rising interest rates. In cases where the terms were at less than normal market rates for similar lending arrangements, we have transferred these loans to the Asset Recovery Group for resolution. In the third quarter of 2010, there were $65 million of new restructured loans included in nonperforming loans, of which $10 million related to commercial real estate.  As shown in Figure 17, at September 30, 2010, 69% of our commercial real estate loans were for nonowner-occupied properties compared to 70% at September 30, 2009. Approximately 28% and 43% of these loans were construction loans at September 30, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Typically, these properties are not fully leased at the origination of the loan. The borrower relies upon additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide the cash flow necessary to support debt service payments. Uncertain economic conditions generally slow the execution of new leases and may also lead to the turnover of existing leases, driving rental rates and occupancy rates down. As we have experienced during the first nine months of 2010, we expect vacancy rates for retail, office and industrial space to remain elevated and possibly further increase well into 2011.  Commercial real estate fundamentals continue to deteriorate, although at a moderating pace. Through the third quarter of 2010, vacancies rose further and rents declined in office and retail properties. Vacancies are expected to peak this year, with rent levels bottoming in 2011. Net operating income should trough around the same time as rents, with the exception of the lagging office sector. The apartment sector appears to be stabilizing, with vacancies actually falling in the third quarter (after a flat reading in the second quarter of 2010) and rents growing modestly. With the labor market stalling, however, the apartment market may take a step back again before moving toward recovery. This data appears to suggest further softening in commercial real estate, with vacancies rising and rents falling over the next few months, although the pace of decline is moderating. If the upward trend in vacancies continues, any resulting effect would likely be most noticeable in the nonowner-occupied properties segment of our commercial real estate loan portfolio, particularly in the retail properties and office buildings components, which comprise 27% of our commercial real estate loans.  Commercial property values peaked in the fall of 2007, having experienced increases of approximately 30% since 2005 and 90% since 2001. The most recent Moody’s Real Estate Analytics, LLC Commercial Property Price Index (October 2010) shows a 45.1% decrease in values from its peak, down 7.6% in the past year, and representing a new recession low. While prices may be reaching a bottom, a significant volume of distressed properties entering the market remains a risk and would result in further price declines. In addition, prices are likely to stall before gaining any real upward momentum, reflecting the high level of uncertainty in the market and slow growth outlook. If the factors described above result in further weakening in the fundamentals underlying the commercial real estate market (i.e., vacancy rates, the stability of rental income and asset values), and lead to reduced cash flow to support debt service payments, our ability to collect such payments and the strength of our commercial real estate loan portfolio could be adversely affected.     Commercial lease financing. We conduct financing arrangements through our Equipment Finance line of business and have both the scale and array of products to compete in the equipment lease financing business. Commercial lease financing receivables represented 19% of commercial loans at September 30, 2010, and 17% at September 30, 2009. As previously reported, we ceased conducting business in both the commercial vehicle and office equipment leasing markets during the second half of 2009.     Commercial loan modification and restructuring  Certain commercial loans are modified and extended in the normal course of business for our clients. Loan modifications vary and are handled on a case by case basis with strategies responsive to the specific circumstances of each loan and borrower. In many cases, borrowers have other resources and can reinforce the credit with additional capital, collateral, guarantees or income sources.  Modifications are negotiated to achieve fair and mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan credit quality while at the same time meeting our client’s financing needs. Modifications made to loans of creditworthy borrowers not experiencing financial difficulties and under circumstances where ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt are not classified as TDRs. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, TDR classification occurs when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a creditor concession has been granted.  Our concession types are primarily categorized as interest rate reductions, principal deferral, or forgiveness of principal. Loan extensions are sometimes coupled with these primary concession types. The table below provides the amount of TDRs by the primary type of concession made at each period end. Since our TDR activity has recently increased (four quarters of activity), it is too early to gauge the success of the different types of concessions. Our success will be significantly influenced by economic conditions going forward. Although we have restructured these loans to provide the best opportunity for successful repayment by the borrowers, given the uncertainty of the current economic situation, we are not able to predict how these restructured notes will ultimately perform.  82    Table of Contents  Figure 18 shows our concession types for our commercial accruing and nonaccruing TDRs.

The benefits derived from multiple note TDRs are recognized when the underlying assets (predominantly commercial real estate) have been stabilized with a level of leverage supportable by ongoing cash flows. Right sizing the A note to sustainable cash flow should ultimately allow for its return to accrual status and thereupon a resumption of interest income recognition. Similarly, appropriately sized A notes will allow for upgraded credit classification based on rehabilitated credit metrics including demonstrated payment performance. Other benefits include the borrower’s retention of ownership and control of the asset, deleveraged and sustainable capital structure (often sufficient to attract fresh capital into the transaction) and rehabilitation of local markets by minimizing distressed/fire sales.  As the objective of the multiple notes TDR is to achieve a fully performing and well-rated A note, we focus on sizing the A note to a level that is supported by cash flow available to service debt at current market terms and consistent with our customary underwriting standards. This typically will include a debt coverage ratio of 1.2 or better of cash flow to monthly payments of market interest and principal amortization of generally not more than 25 years.  The B note is typically an interest only note with no required amortization until the property stabilizes and generates excess cash flow which is customarily applied directly to principal. The B note is subsequently evaluated at such time when accrual restoration of the A note is under consideration. In many cases, the B note has then been charged-off contemporaneously with the A note being returned to accrual status. Alternatively, both A and B notes may be simultaneously returned to accrual if credit metrics are supportive as set forth above. In many cases where a three (A, B, C) note structure has been utilized, the C notes are fully charged-off at the time of the  83    Table of Contents  TDR. In the very few instances where the C note is not charged-off, there is a pending equity event, additional leasing or pending sale of developed units that support the C note balance shortly after the TDR.  All loans processed as a TDR, including A notes and any non-charged-off B or C notes, are reported as TDRs during the year in which they are consummated. Removing such loans from TDR classification may occur in the subsequent year after a sustained period (generally six months) of timely principal and interest payments in accordance with the terms of the restructure agreement. Returning an A note to accrual status also requires a reasonable level of certainty that the balance of principal and interest is fully collectable over time.  Our policy requires a sustained period of timely principal and interest payments to restore a loan to accrual status. Primary repayment derived from property cash flow is evaluated for risk of continued sustainability while secondary repayment (collateral) is appraised to ensure that market value exceeds the carrying value of the A note with a sufficient excess (generally 20%). Although our policy is a guideline, considerable judgment is required to review each borrower’s circumstances.      Extensions  Certain commercial loans are modified and extended in the normal course of business for our clients. Project loans are typically refinanced into the permanent commercial loan market at maturity; however, due to the limited sources of permanent commercial mortgage financing available in the market today and the market-wide decline in leasing activity and rental rates, an increased number of loans have been extended. Extension terms take into account the specific circumstances of the client relationship, the status of the project and near-term prospects for both the client and the collateral. In all cases, pricing and loan structure are reviewed and (where necessary) modified to ensure the loan has been priced to achieve a market rate of return and loan terms (i.e., amortization, covenants and term) that are appropriate for the risk. Typical enhancements include one or more of the following: principal paydown, increased amortization, additional collateral, increased guarantees, and/or a cash flow sweep. As previously mentioned, some maturing construction loans have automatic extension options built in and in those cases where the borrower qualifies for the extension option, pricing and loan terms cannot be altered. Most project loans by their nature are “collateral-dependent” as cash flow from the project loans or the sale of the real estate provides for repayment of the loan.  Pricing of a loan is determined based on the strength of the borrowing entity and the strength of the guarantor. Therefore, pricing may remain the same, e.g., the loan is already priced at or above current market. We do not consider loan extensions in the normal course of business (under existing loan terms or at market rates) as TDRs, particularly when ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt and no concession has been made. In the case of loan extensions outside of the normal course of business—where either collection of all principal and interest is uncertain or a concession has been made, we would analyze such credit under the accounting guidance to determine whether it qualifies as a TDR. Extensions that qualify as TDRs are measured for impairment under the applicable accounting guidance.     Guarantors  A detailed guarantor analysis is conducted (1) for all new extensions of credit, (2) at the time of any material modification/extension, and (3) typically annually, as part of our on-going portfolio and loan monitoring procedures. This analysis includes submission by the guarantor entity of all appropriate financial statements including balance sheets, income statements, tax returns, and real estate schedules.  While the specific steps of each guarantor analysis may have some minor differences, the high level objectives include reaching a conclusion regarding the overall financial conditions of the guarantor entities, including: size, quality, and nature of asset base; net worth (adjusted to reflect our opinion of market value); leverage; standing liquidity; recurring cash flow; contingent and direct debt obligations; and near term debt maturities.  Borrower/Guarantor financial statements are required at least annually within 90-120 days of the calendar/fiscal year end. Income statements and rent rolls for project collateral are required quarterly. In some cases, disclosure of certain information including liquidity, certifications, status of asset sales or debt resolutions, and real estate schedules may be required more frequently.  We routinely seek performance from guarantors of impaired debt, provided the guarantor is solvent. In limited circumstances, we would not seek to enforce the guaranty, including situations in which we are precluded by bankruptcy and/or it is determined the cost to pursue a guarantor exceeds the value to be returned given the guarantor’s verified financial condition. We are often successful in obtaining either monetary payment and/or the cooperation of our solvent guarantors to help mitigate loss, cost and the expense of collections.  84    Table of Contents  As of September 30, 2010, we had $578 million of mortgage and construction loans that had a loan to value ratio greater than 1.0 and were accounted for as performing loans. These loans were not considered impaired due to one or more of the following factors: underlying cash flow adequate to service the debt at a market rate of return with adequate amortization; a satisfactory borrower payment history; and acceptable guarantor support.     Consumer loan portfolio  Consumer loans outstanding decreased by $1.2 billion, or 7%, from one year ago. As shown in Figure 36 in the “Credit risk management” section, the majority of the reduction came from our exit loan portfolio. Most of the decrease is attributable to the marine segment.  The home equity portfolio is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio. Virtually all of this portfolio (93% at September 30, 2010) is derived primarily from the Regional Banking line of business within our Community Banking group. The remainder of the portfolio, which has been in an exit mode since the fourth quarter of 2007, was originated from the Consumer Finance line of business and is now included in Other Segments. Home equity loans within the Community Banking group decreased by $499 million, or less than 5%, over the past twelve months.  Figure 20 summarizes our home equity loan portfolio by source at the end of the last five quarters, as well as certain asset quality statistics and yields on the portfolio as a whole.  Figure 20.

As previously reported, we have experienced a decrease in our consumer loan portfolio and continue to expect the portfolio to decrease in future periods as a result of our actions to exit dealer-originated home equity loans and indirect retail lending for marine and recreational vehicle products, and discontinue the education lending business. We ceased originating new education loans effective December 5, 2009 and account for this business in discontinued operations.  In recent weeks, there has been public controversy surrounding the foreclosure practices of large home lenders. Our number of home loan foreclosures is small (the average number of new mortgage foreclosures serviced by Key and third parties, initiated per month, through September 30, 2010 is 145; mortgage loans serviced by Key and third parties outstanding at September 30, 2010 are approximately 244,000 loans) and primarily have occurred in our home equity loan portfolio. A review of our foreclosure processes (which is still ongoing) has not uncovered any material defects in the process of signing and notarizing affidavits.     Loans held for sale  As shown in Note 5 (“Loans and Loans Held for Sale”), our loans held for sale increased to $637 million at September 30, 2010 from $443 million at December 31, 2009 and totaled $703 million at September 30, 2009. Loans held for sale related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business, which are excluded from total loans held for sale at September 30, 2010, December 31, 2009 and September 30, 2009, totaled $15 million, $434 million, and $341 million, respectively.  At September 30, 2010, loans held for sale included $327 million of commercial mortgages which increased by $25 million from September 30, 2009, and $92 million of residential mortgage loans which decreased $18 million from September 30, 2009.     Loan sales  As shown in Figure 21, during the first nine months of 2010, we sold $694 million of commercial real estate loans, $1.0 billion of residential real estate loans, $199 million of commercial loans and $35 million of commercial lease financing. Most of these sales came from the held-for-sale portfolio. Additionally, we sold $487 million of education loans (included in “discontinued assets” on the  85    Table of Contents  balance sheet), which are excluded from Figure 21. See Note 16 (“Discontinued Operations”) for additional information related to education lending.  Figure 21 summarizes our loan sales for the first nine months of 2010 and all of 2009.  Figure 21.

(b)   We adopted new accounting guidance on January 1, 2010, which required us to consolidate our education loan securitization trusts and resulted in the addition of $2.6 billion of education loans at fair value which are included in “discontinued assets” on the balance sheet.    In the event of default by a borrower, we are subject to recourse with respect to approximately $728 million of the $120.2 billion of loans administered or serviced at September 30, 2010. Additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in Note 13 (“Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) under the heading “Recourse agreement with FNMA.”  We derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold. We earn noninterest income (recorded as “other income”) from fees for servicing or administering loans. This fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets. In addition, we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing of commercial real estate loans.     Securities  Our securities portfolio totaled $21.3 billion at September 30, 2010, compared to $16.7 billion at December 31, 2009, and $15.4 billion at September 30, 2009. At each of these dates, most of our securities consisted of securities available for sale, with the remainder consisting of held-to-maturity securities of less than $25 million.     Securities available for sale. The majority of our securities available-for-sale portfolio consists of CMOs, which are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities. CMOs generate interest income and serve as collateral to support  86    Table of Contents  certain pledging agreements. At September 30, 2010, we had $21.1 billion invested in CMOs and other mortgage-backed securities in the available-for-sale portfolio, compared to $16.4 billion at December 31, 2009, and $15.2 billion at September 30, 2009.  As shown in Figure 23, all of our mortgage-backed securities are issued by government-sponsored enterprises or GNMA, and are traded in highly liquid secondary markets and recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. See Note 21 (“Fair Value Measurements”) under the heading “Qualitative Disclosures of Valuation Techniques” on page 128 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders.  Figure 23.

The net unrealized gains resulted from a decrease in market interest rates and were recorded in the AOCI component of shareholders’ equity. We continue to maintain a moderate asset-sensitive exposure to near-term changes in interest rates.  We periodically evaluate our securities available-for-sale portfolio in light of established A/LM objectives, changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio, and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. These evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning.  In addition, the size and composition of our securities available-for-sale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required (or elect) to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits. Although we generally use debt securities for this purpose, other assets, such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit, are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles.  During the third quarter of 2010, our investing activities continue to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs. We purchased $2.5 billion in CMOs, and had maturities and cash flows of $1.2 billion. The purchases were in CMOs issued by government-sponsored entities or GNMA. We are able to either pledge these securities to the Federal Reserve or Federal Home Loan Bank for secured borrowing arrangements, sell them or use them in connection with repurchase agreements should alternate sources of liquidity be required in the future.

They include direct investments (investments made in a particular company) as well as indirect investments (investments made through funds that include other investors). Principal investments are predominantly made in privately held companies and are carried at fair value ($945 million at September 30, 2010, $1.0 billion at December 31, 2009, and $935 million at September 30, 2009).  In addition to principal investments, “other investments” include other equity and mezzanine instruments, such as certain real estate-related investments that are carried at fair value, as well as other types of investments that generally are carried at cost.  Most of our other investments are not traded on an active market. We determine the fair value at which these investments should be recorded based on the nature of the specific investment and all available relevant information. Among other things, our review may encompass such factors as the issuer’s past financial performance and future potential, the values of public companies in comparable businesses, the risks associated with the particular business or investment type, current market conditions, the nature and duration of resale restrictions, the issuer’s payment history, our knowledge of the industry and third party data. During the first nine months of 2010, net gains from our principal investing activities (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) totaled $72 million, which includes $53 million of net unrealized gains. These net gains are recorded as “net gains (losses) from principal investing” on the income statement.     Deposits and other sources of funds  Domestic deposits are our primary source of funding. During the third quarter of 2010, these deposits averaged $60.9 billion and represented 79% of the funds we used to support loans and other earning assets, compared to $67.4 billion and 79% during the same quarter in 2009. The composition of our average deposits is shown in Figure 9 in the section entitled “Net interest income.”  The decrease in average domestic deposits compared to the third quarter of 2009 was due to a decline in certificates of deposit ($100,000 or more) and other time deposits. This decline was offset by an increase in NOW and money market deposit accounts, and noninterest-bearing deposits. The mix of deposits continues to change as higher-costing certificates of deposit mature and reprice to current market rates and clients move their balances to transaction deposit accounts, such as NOW and money market savings accounts, or look for other alternatives for investing in the current low-rate environment.  Wholesale funds, consisting of deposits in our foreign office and short-term borrowings, averaged $3.9 billion during the third quarter of 2010, compared to $3.3 billion during the year-ago quarter. The change from the third quarter of 2009 resulted from a $293 million increase in foreign office deposits and a $658 million increase in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, which was offset partially by a $365 million decline in bank notes and other short-term borrowings.  Substantially all of our domestic deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. Accordingly, we are subject to deposit insurance premium assessments by the FDIC. On November 17, 2009, the FDIC published a final rule to announce an amended DIF restoration plan requiring depository institutions, such as KeyBank, to prepay, on December 30, 2009, their estimated quarterly risk-based assessments for the third and fourth quarters of 2009 and for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012. On that date, KeyBank paid the FDIC $539 million to cover the insurance assessments for those time periods. For the three-months ended September 30, 2010, our FDIC insurance assessment was $27 million. At the end of the third quarter of 2010, we had $414 million of prepaid FDIC insurance assessments recorded on our balance sheet.  The FDIC announced on April 13, 2010 its Board of Directors’ approval of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Assessments. The proposed revisions to the assessment system would be applicable to large institutions with more than $10 billion in assets, such as KeyBank. According to the FDIC, the proposed revisions would better capture risk at the time an institution assumes the risk, better differentiate institutions during periods of good economic and banking conditions based on how they would fare during periods of stress or economic downturns, and would also take into account the losses that the FDIC may incur if an institution fails. The proposal was published in the Federal Register on May 3, 2010, and the comment period for the proposal expired on July 2, 2010.     Capital  At September 30, 2010, our shareholders’ equity was $11.1 billion, up $471 million from December 31, 2009. The following discusses certain factors that contributed to the change in our shareholders’ equity. For other factors that contributed to the change, see the Statement of Changes in Equity.  89    Table of Contents     Adoption of new accounting guidance  Effective January 1, 2010, we adopted new consolidation accounting guidance which required us to consolidate our education loan securitization trusts (classified as discontinued assets and liabilities), thereby adding $2.8 billion in assets and liabilities to our balance sheet. As a result of adopting this new guidance, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment (after-tax) of $45 million to beginning retained earnings on January 1, 2010.     Dividends  During the first nine months of 2010, we made dividend payments of $94 million to the U.S. Treasury on our Series B Preferred Stock as a participant in the U.S. Treasury’s TARP CPP.  During the first nine months of 2010, we have made three quarterly dividend payments of $1.9375 per share or $6 million per quarter, on our Series A Preferred Stock.  Additionally, during the first nine months of 2010, we have made three quarterly dividend payments of $.01 per share, or $9 million per quarter, on our Common Shares.     Common shares outstanding  Our Common Shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol KEY. At September 30, 2010 our book value per Common Share was $9.54 based on 880.3 million shares outstanding at September 30, 2010, compared to $9.04 based on 878.5 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2009, and $9.39 based on 878.6 million shares outstanding at September 30, 2009. At September 30, 2010 our tangible book value per Common Share was $8.46 compared to $7.94 at December 31, 2009, and $8.29 at September 30, 2009.  Figure 26 shows activities that caused the change in outstanding Common Shares over the past five quarters.  Figure 26. Changes in Common Shares Outstanding                                                      2010     2009     in thousands   Third     Second     First     Fourth     Third           Shares outstanding at beginning of period     880,515       879,052       878,535       878,559       797,246     Common shares exchanged for capital securities     —       —       —       —       81,278     Shares reissued (returned) under employee benefit plans     (187 )     1,463       517       (24 )     35         Shares outstanding at end of period     880,328       880,515       879,052       878,535       878,559                                     As shown above, Common Shares outstanding decreased by 187 thousand shares during the third quarter of 2010 from net activity in our employee benefit plans.  At September 30, 2010, we had 66.0 million treasury shares, compared to 67.8 million treasury shares at December 31, 2009 and 67.8 million at September 30, 2009. During the third quarter of 2010, shares previously issued in conjunction with our employee benefit plans were returned to us. Going forward we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stock-based compensation awards and for other corporate purposes.  We repurchase Common Shares periodically in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions under a repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors. The program does not have an expiration date, and we have outstanding Board authority to repurchase 13.9 million shares. We did not repurchase any Common Shares during the first nine months of 2010 or 2009. Further, in accordance with the terms of our participation in the TARP CPP, until the earlier of three years after the issuance of, or such time as the U.S. Treasury no longer holds, any Series B Preferred Stock issued by us under that program, we will not be able to repurchase any of our Common Shares without the approval of the U.S. Treasury, subject to certain limited exceptions (e.g., for purchases in connection with benefit plans).     Capital availability and management  As a result of market disruptions in previous periods, the availability of capital (principally to financial services companies) remains restricted. While we have been successful in raising additional capital, lower market prices per share have increased the dilution of our per Common Share results. We cannot predict when or if the markets will return to more favorable conditions.  90    Table of Contents  We determine how capital is to be strategically allocated among our businesses to maximize returns within acceptable risk parameters and strengthen core relationship businesses. In that regard, we will continue to emphasize our client relationship strategy.     Capital adequacy  Capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance. All of our capital ratios remain strong at September 30, 2010. Our strong capital and improved liquidity position us well to weather the current credit cycle while continuing to serve our clients’ needs, as well as to adjust to the application of any new regulatory capital standards due to or promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act. Our shareholders’ equity to assets ratio was 11.84% at September 30, 2010, compared to 11.43% at December 31, 2009 and 11.31% at September 30, 2009. Our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.00% at September 30, 2010, compared to 7.56% at December 31, 2009 and 7.58% at September 30, 2009.  Banking industry regulators prescribe minimum capital ratios for bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries. Risk-based capital guidelines require a minimum level of capital as a percent of “risk-weighted assets.” Risk-weighted assets consist of total assets plus certain off-balance sheet and market items, subject to adjustment for predefined credit risk factors. Currently, banks and bank holding companies must maintain, at a minimum, Tier 1 capital as a percent of risk-weighted assets of 4.00% and total capital as a percent of risk-weighted assets of 8.00%. As of September 30, 2010, our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio increased 155 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2009 to 14.30%, and our total risk-based capital ratio increased 127 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2009 to 18.22%.  Another indicator of capital adequacy, the leverage ratio, is defined as Tier 1 capital as a percentage of average quarterly tangible assets. Leverage ratio requirements vary with the condition of the financial institution. Bank holding companies that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the Federal Reserve’s risk-adjusted measure for market risk — as we have — must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 3.00%. All other bank holding companies must maintain a minimum ratio of 4.00%. As of September 30, 2010, our leverage ratio increased by 81 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2009 to 12.53%.  The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to bank holding companies by requiring regulators to create rules phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities (excluding TARP, CPP preferred stock issued to the United States or its agencies or instrumentalities before October 4, 2010) being Tier 1 eligible capital. This three year phase-out period which commences January 1, 2013 will ultimately result in our capital securities being treated only as Tier 2 capital. These changes in effect apply the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to depository institutions to bank holding companies, savings and loan holding companies, and nonbank financial companies identified as systemically important.  As of September 30, 2010, our Tier 1 capital ratio, leverage ratio, and total capital ratios represented 14.30%, 12.53%, and 18.22%, respectively. The trust preferred securities issued by the KeyCorp and Union State Bank capital trusts contribute $1.8 billion or 225, 197, and 225 basis points to our Tier 1 capital ratio, leverage ratio, and total capital ratio, respectively, as of September 30, 2010.  Under current regulatory capital guidelines, Federal bank regulators group FDIC-insured depository institutions into five categories, ranging from “well capitalized” to “critically undercapitalized.” A “well capitalized” institution must exceed the prescribed thresholds of 6.00% for Tier 1 capital ratio, 5.00% for the leverage ratio and 10.00% for total capital ratio. If these provisions applied to bank holding companies, we would qualify as “well capitalized” at September 30, 2010. Analysis on a pro forma basis, accounting for the phase-out of our trust preferred securities as Tier 1 eligible (and therefore as Tier 2 instead) as of September 30, 2010, also determines that we would qualify as “well capitalized” under current regulatory guidelines, with the pro forma Tier 1 capital, pro forma leverage ratio, and pro forma total capital ratio being 12.05%, 10.56%, and 18.22%, respectively. The current regulatory defined categories serve a limited supervisory function. Investors should not use our pro forma ratios as a representation of our overall financial condition or prospects of KeyCorp or KeyBank.  Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. As a result of the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has intensified its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 capital, known as Tier 1 common equity, and its review of the consolidated capitalization of systemically important financial companies, including KeyCorp. Because the Federal Reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders’ equity (essentially Tier 1 capital less preferred stock, qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in Tier 1 capital, such a focus is consistent with existing capital adequacy guidelines and does not imply a new or ongoing capital standard. The modifications mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act are consistent with the renewed focus on Tier 1 common equity and the consolidated capitalization of banks, bank holding companies, and covered nonbank financial companies, which resulted from the financial crisis. Because Tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by GAAP nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations, this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. Figure 5 in the “Highlights of Our Performance” section reconciles Key  91    Table of Contents  shareholders’ equity, the GAAP performance measure, to Tier 1 common equity, the corresponding non-GAAP measure. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio was 8.61% at September 30, 2010, compared to 7.50% at December 31, 2009 and 7.64% at September 30, 2009.  At September 30, 2010, we had a consolidated net deferred tax asset of $389 million compared to $569 million at December 31, 2009 and $476 million at September 30, 2009. In recent years, we had been in a net deferred tax liability position. Generally, for risk-based capital purposes, deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income are limited to the lesser of: (i) the amount of deferred tax assets that a financial institution expects to realize within one year of the calendar quarter-end date, based on its projected future taxable income for the year, or (ii) 10% of the amount of an institution’s Tier 1 capital. Based on these restrictions, at September 30, 2010, $277 million of our net deferred tax assets were deducted from Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets compared to $514 million at December 31, 2009 and $285 million at September 30, 2009. We anticipate that the amount of our net deferred tax asset disallowed for risk-based capital purposes will gradually decline in coming quarters.     Revisions to the International Regulatory Framework for Banks (Basel III)  In December 2009, the BCBS published a consultative document, titled “Strengthening the Resilience of the Banking Sector,” which contained a comprehensive set of reform measures designed to strengthen the regulation, supervision and risk management of the banking sector. Following a comment period during which industry members registered opinions on the proposal, a revised consultative document was published in July 2010, followed in mid-September by publication of the proposed new minimum capital ratios and a five-year phase-in plan. These documents along with proposed new liquidity standards for banks have come to be known as Basel III. The BCBS has announced an intention to finalize the capital component of the proposals by year-end. Should the BCBS meet these timeframes, we expect to see a U.S. regulatory response in the form of proposed revisions to the domestic regulatory framework. The liquidity proposals before the BCBS will be undergoing additional review before finalization.  The Basel III proposed capital regulations are designed to increase the level and quality of capital and to increase the sensitivity of capital to changes in the bank’s risk profile. The proposed regulations provide for the first time an official definition and specific guideline minimums for Tier 1 Common Equity. Minimum levels for Tier 1 capital and Total Risk-based capital will be higher than the U.S.’s current “Well-capitalized” minimums. Key has prepared pro forma estimates of its capital ratios using the Basel III capital guidelines proposed by the Committee. These estimates indicate that Key’s capital levels are currently above the Basel III minimums, including the capital conservation buffer and the phasing-out of trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act.

The Dodd-Frank Act’s Reform of Deposit Insurance  The FDIC’s interim rule published in the Federal Register on April 19, 2010, extended the TLGP TAG program from July 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010. KeyBank elected not to participate in this TAG program extension. KeyBank and many of its peers have elected not to continue in the TAG program at various times. As previously reported, we anticipate a certain amount of deposit run-off for this interim period of expiration of unlimited deposit insurance on noninterest-bearing transaction accounts. We have established a liquidity buffer in anticipation and, as a result, do not expect it to have a significant effect on liquidity.  93    Table of Contents  The Dodd-Frank Act makes permanent the current FDIC deposit insurance limit of $250,000, and provides for temporary unlimited FDIC deposit insurance until January 1, 2013, for non interest-bearing demand transaction accounts at all insured depository institutions effective December 31, 2010 (concurrent with the expiration date of the current TAG program extension). Accordingly, effective December 31, 2010, KeyBank will again offer noninterest-bearing demand transaction accounts, with unlimited FDIC deposit insurance.     Deposit Insurance Assessment  On October 19, 2010, the FDIC adopted an Amended Restoration Plan for the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) and the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPR”) on Assessment Rates, Dividends and the Designated Reserve Ratio to implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act as well as the agency’s comprehensive plan for a stable DIF.  The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to set a designated reserve ratio of not less than 1.35% for any year, and to take “such steps as may be necessary” to increase the DIF to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits by September 30, 2020, rather than 1.15% by the end of 2016 required by the Amended Restoration Plan, adopted September 29, 2009. Considerations discussed in the FDIC’s adoption of the Amended Restoration Plan were the additional time afforded the FDIC to reach the reserve ratio required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the continued stresses on the earnings of insured financial institutions, and the fact that the DIF’s estimates of losses for the period of 2010 through 2014 have declined to $52 billion from its projection of $60 billion in June 2010.  The Amended Restoration Plan adopted by the FDIC on September 29, 2010 and effective immediately, provides for:       •   extension of the period of the Restoration Plan to September 30, 2020;        •   the FDIC will forego the uniform 3 basis point increase initial assessment rates scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2011;        •   maintain the current schedule of assessment rates for all insured depository institutions;        •   the FDIC to pursue further rulemaking during 2011 concerning the method that will be used to reach 1.35% by September 30, 2020 and to offset the effect on insured depository institutions with consolidated assets of less than $10 billion that the reserve reach 1.35% by September 30, 2020, rather than 1.15% by the end of 2016;        •   the semi-annual update of loss and income projections for the DIF, and, if needed increases (or decreases) in assessment rates following notice-and-comment rulemaking if required; and        •   that institutions may continue to use assessment credits without additional restriction during the term of the Restoration Plan.    On October 27, 2010, the FDIC published in the Federal Register its NPR on Assessment Dividends, Assessment Rates and Designated Reserve Ratio. The NPR is part of the FDIC’s implementation of its comprehensive, long-range plan for DIF management, with the goal of maintaining a positive fund balance, even during a period of large fund losses, and steady, predictable assessment rates throughout the economic and credit cycles. The FDIC provides that its historical analysis of fund losses indicates that to maintain a positive fund balance and steady predictable assessment rates, the reserve ratio must be at least 2% before a period of large fund losses and average assessment rates must be approximately 8.5 basis points. The FDIC proposes to: set the Designated Reserve Ratio at 2%; adopt a lower rate schedule when the reserve ratio reaches 1.15% so that the average rate over time should be about 8.5 basis points; and in lieu of dividends to adopt lower rate schedules when the reserve ratio reaches 2% and 2.5%, with average rates expected to decline 25% and 50%, respectively. Proposed assessment rates once the reserve ratio reaches 1.15% would be lowered significantly, with Risk Category I, II, III, and IV institutions paying initial assessment rates between 8 and 12 basis points, 18 basis points, 28 basis points, and 40 basis points, respectively.  94    Table of Contents     Risk Management     Overview  Like all financial services companies, we engage in business activities and assume the related risks. The most significant risks we face are credit, liquidity, market, compliance, operational, strategic and reputation risks. We must properly and effectively identify, assess, measure, monitor, control and report such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability. Certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section.  During 2009, our management team reevaluated our ERM capabilities, and enhanced our ERM Program. Our ERM Committee, which consists of the Chief Executive Officer and his direct reports, is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite. The Program encompasses our risk philosophy, policy, framework and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company. The ERM Committee reports to the Risk Management Committee of our Board of Directors. The Board of Directors approves the ERM Program, as well as the risk appetite and corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories. We continue to enhance our ERM Program and related practices and to use a risk-adjusted capital framework to manage risks. This framework is approved and managed by the ERM Committee.  Our Board of Directors serves in an oversight capacity with the objective of managing our enterprise-wide risks in a manner that is effective, balanced and adds value for the shareholders. The Board inquires about risk practices, reviews the portfolio of risks, compares actual risks to the risk appetite and tolerances, and receives regular reports about significant risks — both actual and emerging. To assist in these efforts, the Board has delegated primary oversight responsibility for risk to the Audit Committee and Risk Management Committee.  The Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for internal audit; financial reporting; compliance risk and legal matters; the implementation, management and evaluation of operational risk and controls; information security and fraud risk; and evaluating the qualifications and independence of the independent auditors. The Audit Committee discusses policies related to risk assessment and risk management and the processes related to risk review and compliance.  The Risk Management Committee has responsibility for overseeing the management of credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk (including the actions taken to mitigate these risks), as well as reputational and strategic risks relating to the foregoing. The Risk Management Committee also oversees the maintenance of appropriate regulatory and economic capital. The Risk Management Committee reviews the ERM reports and, in conjunction with the Audit Committee, annually reviews reports of material changes to the Operational Risk Committee and Compliance Risk Committee charters, and annually approves any material changes to the charter of the ERM Committee and other subordinate risk committees.  The Audit and Risk Management Committees meet jointly, as appropriate, to discuss matters that relate to each committee’s responsibilities. In addition to regularly scheduled bi-monthly meetings, the Audit Committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases. Committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting. All members of the Board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months.  Federal banking regulators are reemphasizing with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution. We believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks, and comport with regulatory expectations.     Market risk management  The values of some financial instruments vary not only with changes in market interest rates but also with changes in foreign exchange rates. Financial instruments also are susceptible to factors influencing valuations in the equity securities markets and other market-driven rates or prices. For example, the value of a fixed-rate bond will decline if market interest rates increase. Similarly, the value of the U.S. dollar regularly fluctuates in relation to other currencies. The holder of a financial instrument faces “market risk” when the value of the instrument is tied to such external factors. Most of our market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations.     Interest rate risk management  Interest rate risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the economic value of equity. Such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates, and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. To minimize the volatility of net interest income and the  95    Table of Contents  economic value of equity, we manage exposure to interest rate risk in accordance with policy limits established by the ERM Committee.  Interest rate risk positions can be influenced by a number of factors other than changes in market interest rates, including economic conditions, the competitive environment within our markets, and balance sheet positioning that arises out of consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products. The primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of basis risk, gap risk, yield curve risk and option risk.     ¨   We face “basis risk” when floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities reprice at the same time, but in response to different market factors or indices. Under those circumstances, even if equal amounts of assets and liabilities are repricing, interest expense and interest income may not change by the same amount.      ¨   “Gap risk” occurs if interest-bearing liabilities and the interest-earning assets they fund (for example, deposits used to fund loans) do not mature or reprice at the same time.      ¨   “Yield curve risk” exists when short-term and long-term interest rates change by different amounts. For example, when U.S. Treasury and other term rates decline, the rates on automobile loans also will decline, but the cost of money market deposits and short-term borrowings may remain elevated.      ¨   A financial instrument presents “option risk” when one party to the instrument can take advantage of changes in interest rates without penalty. For example, when interest rates decline, borrowers may choose to prepay fixed-rate loans by refinancing at a lower rate. Such a prepayment gives us a return on our investment (the principal plus some interest), but unless there is a prepayment penalty, that return may not be as high as the return that would have been generated had payments been received over the original term of the loan. Deposits that can be withdrawn on demand also present option risk.       Net interest income simulation analysis. The primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis. For purposes of this analysis, we estimate our net interest income based on the current composition of our on- and off-balance sheet positions, the current interest rate environment and projected on- and off-balance sheet positions and interest rates. The simulation assumes that projections of our on- and off-balance sheet positions will reflect recent product trends, targets and plans established by the ALCO Committee and the lines of business, and consensus economic forecasts.  Typically, the amount of net interest income at risk is measured by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if the federal funds target rate were to gradually increase or decrease by 200 basis points over the next twelve months, and term rates were to move in a similar fashion. In light of the low interest rate environment, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, we modified the standard rate scenario of a gradual decrease of 200 basis points over twelve months to a gradual decrease of 25 basis points over two months with no change over the following ten months. After calculating the amount of net interest income at risk, we compare that amount with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment. The analysis also considers sensitivity to changes in a number of other variables, including other market interest rates and deposit mix. We also perform regular stress tests and sensitivities on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments. One set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of interest rate inputs on simulated exposures. Assessments are performed using different shapes in the yield curve (the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity), including a sustained flat yield curve, an inverted slope yield curve, changes in credit spreads, an immediate parallel change in market interest rates and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates. Another set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of pricing and volume projections and discretionary strategies on simulated exposures. Assessments are performed on changes to the following assumptions: the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities, changes in lending spreads, prepayments on loans and securities, other loan and deposit balance changes, investment, funding and hedging activities and liquidity and capital management strategies.  Simulation analysis produces only a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on assumptions and judgments related to balance sheet growth, customer behavior, new products, new business volume, product pricing, market interest rate behavior and anticipated investment, funding, hedging and capital management activities. We tailor the assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled, and validate those assumptions on a regular basis. Our simulations are performed with the assumption that interest rate risk positions will be actively managed through the use of on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments to achieve the desired risk profile. Actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, actual hedging strategies employed, changes in balance sheet composition, and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events.  Figure 28 presents the results of the simulation analysis at September 30, 2010 and 2009. At September 30, 2010, our simulated exposure to a change in short-term interest rates was moderately asset sensitive. ALCO policy limits for risk management call for corrective measures if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual increase or decrease in short-term interest rates over the next twelve months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 4%. As shown in Figure 28, we are operating within these limits.  96    Table of Contents  Figure 28. Simulated Change in Net Interest Income                          September 30, 2010                                             Basis point change assumption (short-term rates)     -25       +200                          ALCO policy limits     -4.00 %     -4.00  %       Interest rate risk assessment     -.88 %     3.53  %            September 30, 2009                         Basis point change assumption (short-term rates)     -25       +200                          ALCO policy limits     -4.00 %     -4.00  %       Interest rate risk assessment     -.92 %     +2.68  %         As interest rates declined throughout 2008 and have remained at low levels since that time, we gradually shifted from a liability-sensitive position to an asset-sensitive position as a result of balance growth in transaction deposits, declines in loan balances and a number of capital-raising transactions. Although outstanding derivative hedge positions have declined over the past year due to contractual maturities, improved liquidity flows have resulted in increases of a similar magnitude in the outstanding balance of fixed rate investment securities, and this has served to moderate further increases in the asset-sensitive positioning. Our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume, mix, maturity and pricing of loan and deposit flows. As changes occur to the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy, management evaluates hedging opportunities that would change the reported interest rate risk profile.  The results of additional simulation analyses that make use of alternative rising interest rate scenarios and yield curve shapes indicate that the improvement in net interest income when interest rates increase could be less than the policy simulation results in Figure 28. Net interest income improvements are highly dependent on the timing, magnitude and path of interest rate increases. Also, the sensitivity analysis of assumption inputs for deposit re-pricing relationships, lending spreads and the balance behavior of transaction accounts indicates that net interest income improvements in a rising rate environment could be diminished if actual behavior is different than modeled.  We also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second year of a two-year horizon. These simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a twelve-month horizon. To capture longer-term exposures, we simulate changes to the EVE as discussed in the following section.     Economic value of equity modeling. EVE complements net interest income simulation analysis since it estimates risk exposure beyond twelve- and twenty-four month horizons. EVE measures the extent to which the economic values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates, and measuring the resulting change in the values of assets and liabilities under multiple interest rate paths. Under the current level of market interest rates, the calculation of EVE under an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest rates results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than 200 basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points. This analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities. Those assumptions are based on historical behaviors, as well as our expectations. We take corrective measures if this analysis indicates that our EVE will decrease by more than 15% in response to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates. We are operating within these guidelines.  97    Table of Contents     Management of interest rate exposure. We use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate A/LM strategies to achieve the desired risk profile within the parameters of our capital and liquidity guidelines. Specifically, we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities, issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates, and using derivatives — predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps, which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities.  Figure 29 shows all swap positions which we hold for A/LM purposes. These positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. For example, fixed-rate debt is converted to a floating rate through a “receive fixed/pay variable” interest rate swap. The volume, maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader A/LM objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our balance sheet, see Note 14 (“Derivatives and Hedging Activities”).  Figure 29. Portfolio Swaps by Interest Rate Risk Management Strategy                                                                      September 30, 2010                                                                                           Weighted-Average     September 30, 2009         Notional     Fair     Maturity     Receive     Pay     Notional     Fair       dollars in millions   Amount     Value     (Years)     Rate     Rate     Amount     Value           Receive fixed/pay variable--conventional A/LM(a)    $  8,005      $  22       1.1       1.0 %     .3 %    $  14,518      $  69     Receive fixed/pay variable--conventional debt     5,513       573       14.0       4.6       .8       5,220       436     Pay fixed/receive variable--conventional debt     609       (13 )     6.3       .9       2.4       —       —     Pay fixed/receive variable--forward starting     —       —       —       —       —       706       3     Foreign currency--conventional debt     1,523       (164 )     1.0       1.1       .5       2,664       (148 )                                                                   Total portfolio swaps    $  15,650      $  418       5.8       2.3 %     .5 %    $  23,108      $  360                                                                                                                           (a)   Portfolio swaps designated as A/LM are used to manage interest rate risk tied to both assets and liabilities.       Derivatives not designated in hedge relationships  Our derivatives that are not designated in hedge relationships are described in Note 14. We use a VAR simulation model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of this portfolio. Using two years of historical information, the model estimates the maximum potential one-day loss with a 95% confidence level. Statistically, this means that losses will exceed VAR, on average, five out of 100 trading days, or three to four times each quarter.  We manage exposure to market risk in accordance with VAR limits for trading activity that have been approved by the Risk Capital Committee whose market risk management responsibilities are now performed by the Market Risk Committee established as part of Key’s ERM Program. At September 30, 2010, the aggregate one-day trading limit set by the committee was $6.1 million. We are operating within these constraints. During the first nine months of 2010, our aggregate daily average, minimum and maximum VAR amounts were $1.9 million, $1.4 million and $2.5 million, respectively. During the same period one year ago, our aggregate daily average, minimum and maximum VAR amounts were $2.9 million, $2.4 million and $3.7 million, respectively.  In addition to comparing VAR exposure against limits on a daily basis, we monitor loss limits, use sensitivity measures and conduct stress tests. We report our market risk exposure to the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors.     Liquidity risk management  We define “liquidity” as the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences. Liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions.     Long-term liquidity strategy  Our long-term liquidity strategy is to reduce our reliance on wholesale funding. Our Community Banking group supports our client-driven relationship strategy, with the objective of achieving greater reliance on deposit-based funding to reduce our liquidity risk. We use the loan to deposit ratio as a metric to monitor this strategy. Our target loan to deposit ratio is between 90-100%.     Governance structure  We manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis. This approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity, as well as each entity’s capacity to manage through adverse conditions. It also recognizes that adverse market conditions  98    Table of Contents  or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding.  Oversight of the liquidity risk management process is governed by the Risk Management Committee of the KeyCorp Board of Directors, the KeyBank Board of Directors, the ERM Committee and the ALCO. These groups regularly review various liquidity reports, including liquidity and funding summaries, liquidity trends, peer comparisons, variance analyses, liquidity projections, hypothetical funding erosion stress tests and goal tracking reports. The reviews generate a discussion of positions, trends and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of the decisions that we make. When liquidity pressure is elevated, monitoring of positions is heightened and reporting is more intensive. We meet with individuals within and outside of the company on a daily basis to discuss emerging issues. In addition, we use a variety of daily liquidity reports to monitor the flow of funds.     Sources of liquidity  Our primary sources of funding include customer deposits, wholesale funding, liquid assets, and capital. If the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances, we rely on wholesale funding or liquid assets. Conversely, excess cash generated by operating, investing and deposit-gathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets. We actively manage liquidity using a variety of nondeposit sources, including short- and long-term debt, and secured borrowings.     Factors affecting liquidity  Our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events. An example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency. Examples of indirect events (events unrelated to us) that could impact our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war, natural disasters, political events, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund or hedge fund. Similarly, market speculation, or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources.  On November 1, 2010, Moody’s announced the downgrade of ratings of ten large U.S. regional banks, including KeyBank, previously identified as benefiting from systemic support. KeyBank’s short-term borrowings, senior long-term debt and subordinated debt ratings received a one notch downgrade from P-1 to P-2, A2 to A3, and A3 to Baa1, respectively.  The ratings downgrade could impact the ability of KeyBank to hold certain escrow deposit balances related to commercial mortgage securitizations serviced by Key and rated by Moody’s. The new ratings have breached minimum ratings thresholds established by Moody’s in connection with the securitizations that Key services. In the event Key is unable to obtain a waiver of the ratings requirements from Moody’s, it could be required, among other remedies, to evaluate alternative investments for these escrow deposit balances which are in the range of $1.50 to $1.85 billion. This may also trigger an impairment of our mortgage servicing assets. We have an excess liquidity buffer that we expect to be sufficient to withstand this ratings downgrade. We anticipate that our liquid asset portfolio of $11.1 billion, including $9.8 billion of unpledged securities, will provide sufficient coverage to manage the impact of the credit ratings changes and maintain our strong liquidity position.     Managing liquidity risk  We regularly monitor our funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding. In the normal course of business, we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both KeyCorp and KeyBank. In a “heightened monitoring mode,” we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently, and use assumptions so the stress tests are more strenuous and reflect the changed market environment. Erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods. Ultimately, they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations. To compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures, we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed.  We continue to reposition our balance sheet to reduce future reliance on wholesale funding and increase our liquid asset portfolio. We also retain the capacity to utilize secured borrowings as a contingent funding source. During the third quarter of 2009, our secured borrowings matured and were not replaced, though we retain the capacity to utilize secured borrowings as a contingent funding source. We continue to reposition our balance sheet to reduce future reliance on wholesale funding and increase our liquid asset portfolio.  We maintain a Contingency Funding Plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis. The Plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions. It also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for effectively managing liquidity through a problem period. As part of that plan, we maintain a liquidity reserve through balances in our liquid asset portfolio which during a problem period could reduce our potential reliance on wholesale funding. The portfolio at September 30,  99    Table of Contents  2010 totaled $11.1 billion. The portfolio balance consisted of $9.8 billion of unpledged securities, $883 million of securities available for pledging at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and $435 million of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our Federal Reserve account. Additionally, as of September 30, 2010, our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was $11.4 billion at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and $2.8 billion at the Federal Home Loan Bank.     Our liquidity position and recent activity  Over the past twelve months, we have increased our liquid asset portfolio, which includes overnight and short-term investments, as well as unencumbered, high quality liquid assets held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios. Liquidity stress scenarios include the loss of access to either unsecured or secured funding sources, as well as draws on unfunded commitments and significant deposit withdrawals.  From time to time, KeyCorp or its principal subsidiary, KeyBank, may seek to retire, repurchase or exchange outstanding debt, capital securities or preferred stock through cash purchase, privately negotiated transactions or other means. Such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity and capital requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.  We generate cash flows from operations, and from investing and financing activities. During the third quarter 2010 we used the proceeds from loan paydowns and maturities of short-term investments to increase the balance of our securities available-for-sale portfolio. During the first nine months of 2009 the issuance of common shares was used to fund the reduction of short-term borrowings and long-term debt and to increase the balance of our securities available-for-sale portfolio.  The consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for each of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2010 and 2009.     Liquidity for KeyCorp  The parent company has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt; support customary corporate operations and activities (including acquisitions) and occasional guarantees of subsidiary’s obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences; and pay dividends to shareholders.  Our primary tool for assessing parent company liquidity is the net short-term cash position, which measures the ability to fund debt maturing in twenty-four months or less with existing liquid assets. Another key measure of parent company liquidity is the “liquidity gap,” which represents the difference between projected liquid assets and anticipated financial obligations over specified time horizons. We generally rely upon the issuance of term debt to manage the liquidity gap within targeted ranges assigned to various time periods.  Typically, the parent company meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from KeyBank. Federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval. A national bank’s dividend-paying capacity is affected by several factors, including net profits (as defined by statute) for the two previous calendar years and for the current year, up to the date of dividend declaration. During the third quarter 2010, KeyBank did not pay any dividends to the parent, and nonbank subsidiaries did not pay the parent any dividends. As of the close of business on September 30, 2010, KeyBank would not have been permitted to pay dividends to the parent without prior regulatory approval. To compensate for the absence of dividends, the parent company has relied upon the issuance of long-term debt and stock. During the first nine months of 2010, the parent made capital infusions of $100 million to KeyBank, compared to $850 million during the first nine months of 2009.  The parent company generally maintains cash and short-term investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over the next twenty-four months. At September 30, 2010, the parent company held $3.9 billion in short-term investments, which we projected to be sufficient to repay our maturing debt obligations.  During the third quarter, 2010, the parent company issued $750 million of a five-year fixed-rate senior note. We believe that this successful issuance demonstrates our ability to access the wholesale funding markets without an FDIC guarantee.     Liquidity programs  We have several liquidity programs, which are described in Note 12 (“Short-Term Borrowings”) on page 104 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which enable the parent company and KeyBank to raise funds in the public and private markets when the capital markets are functioning normally. The proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. Each of the programs is replaced or renewed as needed. There are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs.  100    Table of Contents     Liquidity and credit ratings  Our credit ratings at September 30, 2010, are shown in Figure 30. We believe that these credit ratings, under normal conditions in the capital markets, will enable the parent company or KeyBank to effect future offerings of securities that would be marketable to investors. Conditions in the credit markets are improving relative to the disruption experienced between the third quarter of 2007 and the third quarter of 2009; however, the availability of credit and the cost of funds remain tight and more costly than is typical of an economy with a growing gross domestic product.  Figure 30 reflects the credit ratings of KeyCorp securities at September 30, 2010. If our credit ratings fall below investment-grade, that event could have a material adverse effect on us. Such downgrades could adversely affect access to liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us. Ultimately, credit ratings downgrades could adversely affect our business operations and reduce our ability to generate income.  On April 27, 2010, Moody’s, a credit rating agency that rates KeyCorp and KeyBank debt securities, indicated that, if enacted into law, the financial reform bill then proposed by Senator Christopher Dodd could result in lower debt and deposit ratings for seventeen U.S. banks, including KeyBank, because the legislation could weaken Moody’s current assumptions regarding the systemic support provided to the largest financial institutions. Moody’s has publicly reported that KeyCorp holding company ratings do not currently benefit from any uplift as a result of a systemic support assumption by Moody’s. KeyBank long-term deposit and senior debt ratings were identified as receiving a one notch “uplift” due to systemic support.  Subsequently, on July 27, 2010, Moody’s announced its review for possible downgrade of the ratings of the ten large U.S. regional banks, including KeyBank. According to Moody’s, the ratings reviewed benefited from an expectation of increased government support since 2009. Moody’s review considered its government support assumptions in light of the recent passage of the Dodd-Frank Act. KeyBank long-term deposit, short-term borrowings, senior long-term debt, and subordinated long-term debt ratings were previously identified among the ratings under review for possible downgrade.  On November 1, 2010, Moody’s announced the downgrade of KeyBank’s short-term borrowings, senior long-term debt and subordinated debt one notch from P-1 to P-2, A2 to A3, and A3 to Baa1, respectively. For information on the impact on our liquidity that Moody’s action may have, see the “Liquidity Risk Management” section under the heading “Factors affecting liquidity.”  Figure 30.

Credit risk management  Credit risk is the risk of loss to us arising from an obligor’s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms. Like other financial services institutions, we make loans, extend credit, purchase securities and enter into financial derivative contracts, all of which have related credit risk.     Credit policy, approval and evaluation. We manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program. Risk committees approve both retail and commercial credit policies. These policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit. For more information about our credit policies, as well as related approval and evaluation processes, see the section entitled “Credit policy, approval and evaluation” on page 61 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders.  We actively manage the overall loan portfolio in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives, including the use of credit derivatives — primarily credit default swaps — to mitigate credit risk. Credit default swaps enable us to transfer a portion of the  101    Table of Contents   credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit to a third party. At September 30, 2010, we used credit default swaps with a notional amount of $943 million to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending obligations. We also sell credit derivatives — primarily index credit default swaps — to diversify and manage portfolio concentration and correlation risks. At September 30, 2010, the notional amount of credit default swaps sold by us for the purpose of diversifying our credit exposure was $436 million. Occasionally, we have provided credit protection to other lenders through the sale of credit default swaps. These transactions with other lenders generated fee income.  Credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Related gains or losses, as well as the premium paid or received for credit protection, are included in the trading income component of noninterest income. These swaps decreased our operating results by $21 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2010 compared to a decrease of $33 million for the same period last year.  We also manage the loan portfolio using portfolio swaps and bulk purchases and sales. Our overarching goal is to manage the loan portfolio within a specified range of asset quality.  Selected asset quality statistics for each of the past five quarters are presented in Figure 31. The factors that drive these statistics are discussed in the remainder of this section.  102    Table of Contents  Figure 31.

Watch and criticized assets. Watch assets are troubled commercial loans with the potential to deteriorate in quality due to the client’s current financial condition and possible inability to perform in accordance with the terms of the underlying contract. Criticized assets are troubled loans and other assets that show additional signs of weakness that may lead, or have led, to an interruption in scheduled repayments from primary sources, potentially requiring us to rely on repayment from secondary sources, such as collateral liquidation. Criticized assets showed significant improvement during the third quarter of 2010 from both the prior quarter and the same period one year ago.     Allowance for loan losses. At September 30, 2010, the allowance for loan losses was $2.0 billion, or 3.81% of loans, compared to $2.5 billion, or 4.00%, at September 30, 2009. The allowance includes $135 million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of $840 million at September 30, 2010, compared to $390 million that was allocated for impaired loans of $1.8 billion one year ago. For more information about impaired loans, see Note 8 (“Nonperforming Assets and Past Due Loans from Continuing Operations”). At September 30, 2010, the allowance for loan losses was 142.64% of nonperforming loans, compared to 108.52% at September 30, 2009.  We estimate the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses on at least a quarterly basis. The methodology used is described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Allowance for Loan Losses” on page 82 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders. Briefly, we apply historical loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions, changes in credit policies or underwriting standards, and changes in the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets. If an impaired loan has an outstanding balance greater than $2.5 million, we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss content and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate. A specific allowance also may be assigned — even when sources of repayment appear sufficient — if we remain uncertain about whether the loan will be repaid in full. The allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2010, represents our best estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date.  As shown in Figure 32, our allowance for loan losses decreased by $528 million, or 21%, during the past twelve months. This contraction was associated with the improvement in credit quality of the loan portfolio, which has trended more favorably the past three quarters. Asset quality is improving and has resulted in favorable risk rating migration and a reduction in our general allowance. Our delinquency trends continue to decline while our roll rates keep improving. We attribute this to a moderate economic outlook, more favorable conditions in the capital markets, improvement in client income statements and continued run off in our exit loan portfolio. Our liability for credit losses on lending-related commitments increased slightly by $5 million to $99 million at September 30, 2010, compared to the same period one year ago. When combined with our allowance for loan losses, our total allowance for credit losses represented 4.00% of loans at the end of the third quarter of 2010 compared to 4.15% at the end of the third quarter of 2009. We anticipate further reductions in the level of our allowance for loan losses for the balance of 2010 as a result of our expectation of lower levels of net charge-offs and nonperforming loans as the economy continues to show signs of improvement.  103    Table of Contents  Figure 32.

Our provision for loan losses was $94 million for the third quarter of 2010, compared to $733 million for the year-ago quarter. Our net loan charge-offs for the third quarter of 2010 exceeded the provision for loan losses by $263 million. The decrease in our provision is due to the improving credit quality we have experienced in most of our loan portfolios and the reduction of our outstanding loan balances. Additionally, we continue to work our exit loans through the credit cycle, and reduce exposure in our higher-risk businesses including residential properties portion of our construction loan portfolio, Marine/RV financing, and other selected leasing portfolios through the sale of certain loans, payments from borrowers or net charge-offs. As these outstanding loan balances decreases, so does their required allowance for loan losses and corresponding provision.     Net loan charge-offs. Net loan charge-offs for the third quarter of 2010 totaled $357 million, or 2.69% of average loans from continuing operations. These results compare to net charge-offs of $587 million, or 3.59%, for the same period last year. Figure 33 shows the trend in our net loan charge-offs by loan type, while the composition of loan charge-offs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in Figure 34.  Over the past twelve months, net charge-offs in the commercial loan portfolio dropped by $218 million, due primarily to commercial real estate related credits within the Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services line of business. Net charge-offs for this line of business declined by $183 million from the third quarter of 2009 and decreased $309 million from the fourth quarter of 2009. Net charge-offs for this line of business included $131 million of net charge-offs recorded on two specific customer relationships during the fourth quarter of 2009. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, net loan charge-offs in the commercial loan portfolio decreased by $329 million which was attributable to declines in both the real estate commercial mortgage and construction categories. As shown in Figure 36, our exit loan portfolio accounted for $105 million, or 29%, of total net loan charge-offs for the third quarter of 2010. We expect net charge-offs to remain elevated for the remainder of 2010.  104    Table of Contents  Figure 33.

These assets totaled $1.8 billion at September 30, 2010, and represented 3.48% of portfolio loans, OREO and other nonperforming assets, compared to $2.5 billion, or 4.25%, at December 31, 2009, and $2.8 billion, or 4.46%, at September 30, 2009. Nonperforming assets were down over $998 million from their peak at September 30, 2009. We experienced another decrease in the inflow of nonperforming loans during the third quarter of 2010, representing our fifth consecutive decrease and the lowest level of new inflows since the third quarter of 2008.

These concessions are made to improve the collectability of the loan and generally take the form of a reduction of the interest rate, extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance.   As shown in Figure 35, nonperforming assets decreased during the third quarter of 2010 which represents the fourth consecutive quarterly decline. Most of the reduction came from nonperforming loans and OREO in the commercial real estate lines of business. These reductions were offset in part by an increase in nonperforming loans held for sale which reflects the actions we are taking to reduce our exposure in the commercial real estate and institutional portfolios through the sale of selected assets. As shown in Figure 36, our exit loan portfolio accounted for $290 million, or 16%, of total nonperforming assets at September 30, 2010, compared to $385 million, or 18%, at June 30, 2010.  At September 30, 2010, the carrying amount of our commercial nonperforming loans outstanding represented 62% of their original face value, and total nonperforming loans outstanding represented 67% of their face value. At the same date, OREO represented 51% of its original face value, while loans held for sale and other nonperforming assets in the aggregate represented 58% of their face value.  At September 30, 2010, our 20 largest nonperforming loans totaled $364 million, representing 27% of total loans on nonperforming status.  Figure 36 shows the composition of our exit loan portfolio at September 30, 2010 and June 30, 2010, the net charge-offs recorded on this portfolio for the third and second quarters of 2010, and the nonperforming status of these loans at September 30, 2010 and June 30, 2010. The exit loan portfolio represented 11% of total loans and loans held for sale at September 30, 2010.  107    Table of Contents  Figure 36.

(b)   Includes loans in Key’s education loan securitization trusts consolidated upon the adoption of new consolidation accounting guidance on January 1, 2010.   Figure 37 shows credit exposure by industry classification in the largest sector of our loan portfolio, “commercial, financial and agricultural loans.” Since December 31, 2009, total commitments and loans outstanding in this sector have declined by $5.5 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, and have declined by $9 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively from September 30, 2009.  The types of activity that caused the change in our nonperforming loans during each of the last five quarters are summarized in Figure 38. As shown in this figure, nonperforming loans experienced another quarterly decrease as loans placed on nonaccrual decreased for the fourth consecutive quarter and loans sold and payments received on nonperforming loans increased in the third quarter of 2010 as compared to the second quarter of 2010 and the third quarter of 2010, as market liquidity improved.

Operational risk also encompasses compliance (legal) risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules and regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards. Due to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, large financial companies like Key will be subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation due to their systemic importance. This heightened level of regulation will increase our operational risk. We have created and continue to create work teams to respond to and analyze the new regulatory requirements imposed upon us and that will be promulgated as a result of the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. Resulting losses could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation or forgone opportunities. We seek to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls.  We continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with laws, rules and regulations, and to improve the oversight of our operational risk. For example, a loss-event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational losses. This tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action. We also rely upon  109    Table of Contents  software programs designed to assist in monitoring our control processes. This technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the Board of Directors.  Primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business. Our Risk Review function periodically assesses the overall effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Risk Review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the Audit Committee, and independently supports the Audit Committee’s oversight of these controls. The Operational Risk Committee, a senior management committee, oversees our level of operational risk, and directs and supports our operational infrastructure and related activities.     Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk  The information presented in the “Market risk management” section of the Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition & Results of Operations, is incorporated herein by reference.     Item 4. Controls and Procedures  As of the end of the period covered by this report, KeyCorp carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of KeyCorp’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of KeyCorp’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, KeyCorp’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, as of the end of the period covered by this report, in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. No changes were made to KeyCorp’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, KeyCorp’s internal control over financial reporting.     PART II. OTHER INFORMATION     Item 1. Legal Proceedings  The information presented in the Legal Proceedings section of Note 13 (“Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is incorporated herein by reference.     Item 1A. Risk Factors  An investment in our Common Shares, debt, or other securities is subject to risks inherent to our business and our industry. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below relating to recent developments and the risk factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2010, and June 30, 2010, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. Although we have significant risk management policies, procedures and practices aimed at mitigating uncertainties, these risks may nevertheless impair our business operations. These risks are not the only ones that we face. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.  IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS (OR THOSE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE AS INDICATED ABOVE) ACTUALLY OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND/OR ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY AND/OR CREDIT COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED (“MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US”). IF THIS WERE TO HAPPEN, THE VALUE OF OUR SECURITIES — COMMON SHARES, SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES B PREFERRED STOCK, TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES, AND OUR DEBT SECURITIES — COULD DECLINE, PERHAPS SIGNIFICANTLY, AND YOU COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT.  RISKS RELATED TO RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  Our credit ratings affect our liquidity position.  KeyBank’s long-term debt deposit and senior debt ratings were identified in April 2009 by Moody’s as receiving a one notch “uplift” due to Moody’s assumption about systemic support. Subsequently, on July 27, 2010, Moody’s announced that it was reviewing for possible downgrade the ratings of ten large U.S. regional banks, including KeyBank, that benefit from systemic support. KeyCorp was identified as not receiving a systemic support “uplift.” On November 1, 2010, Moody’s announced the downgrade of ratings for ten large U.S. regional banks, including KeyBank, previously identified as benefiting from systemic support. KeyBank’s short term borrowings, senior long-term debt, and subordinated debt ratings received a one notch downgrade from P-1 to P-2, A2 to A3, and A3  110    Table of Contents  to Baa1, respectively. The ratings downgrade could impact the ability of KeyBank to hold certain escrow deposit balances related to commercial mortgage securitizations serviced by Key and rated by Moody’s. The new ratings have breached minimum ratings thresholds established by Moody’s in connection with the securitizations that Key services. In the event Key is unable to obtain a waiver of the ratings requirements from Moody’s, it could be required, among other remedies, to evaluate alternative investments for these escrow deposit balances which are in the range of $1.50 to $1.85 billion. This may also trigger an impairment of our mortgage servicing assets. Additionally, the ratings downgrade could decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to Key.  The Federal Reserve has acknowledged the rising risk of a double dip recession and deflation. Should this occur, the financial services industry and our business could be adversely affected.  Despite the conclusion of the recession, the recovery continues to progress slowly; consumer confidence remains low, unemployment remains high at 9.6% for September 2010, and the housing market remains an important downside risk, with prices expected to fall through much of next year. Given the concerns about the U.S. economy, U.S. employers will approach hiring with caution, and as a result unemployment is expected to rise until mid-2011. Furthermore, the Federal Open Market Committee communicated in its September 2010 statement that it is now concerned about the risks associated with low inflation. Monetary and fiscal policy measures may be insufficient to strengthen the recovery and restore stability to the financial markets. Should economic indicators not improve, the U.S. could face a double dip recession and corresponding deflation. A double dip recession and deflation could affect us in a variety of substantial and unpredictable ways as well as affect our borrowers’ ability to meet their repayment obligations. These factors could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.     Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
