Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2012 Form 10-K.  Any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of subsequent events or circumstances. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider all risks and uncertainties disclosed in our SEC filings, including our reports on Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q and our registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, all of which are or will upon filing be accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and on our website at www.key.com/ir.   Economic overview  Certain key economic indicators that we typically rely upon for this economic overview (such as monthly retail sales and GDP) were not available due to the recently experienced Federal government shutdown. The economic overview provided below is based on our analysis of the most recently available data.  Economic growth slowed in the third quarter, due in part to a rapid rise in interest rates that weighed on both business and residential fixed investment. Consumer spending growth was modest, with durable goods registering solid gains, but nondurables and services spending coming in relatively weak. Manufacturing was somewhat sluggish early in the quarter, but recovered to some extent as auto production accelerated. Markets remained focused on prospective Fed actions, with budget and debt ceiling negotiations reemerging as an important distraction toward the end of the quarter.  In the third quarter, weak income growth remained an important constraint on consumption, although pent-up demand and rising household wealth helped to offset this weak income growth. Spending was concentrated in durable goods, with vehicles sales averaging 15.2 million units in the third quarter of 2013, compared to 15.8 million in the second quarter of 2013. Based on July and August 2013 data, retail sales excluding autos improved a bit over disappointing second quarter results, but gains were modest. Consumer confidence soured, ending the third quarter at 79.7, down about 2.4 points from June 2013 and falling below 80 for the first time since May 2013. Energy prices were somewhat volatile through the third quarter of 2013, with oil prices rising due to the risk of a Western strike on Syria. This risk faded toward the end of the third quarter, however, and overall inflation remained low. Core personal consumption expenditures were up just 1.2% year-over-year as of August 2013.  Weak economic growth was finally reflected in labor market data, with average monthly job gains falling to an average of 143,000 during the third quarter of 2013, compared to average gains of 182,000 in the second quarter of 2013. Unemployment fell further, to 7.2% as of September 30, 2013, driven by declines in the labor force. Participation dropped to 63.2%, the lowest since 1978.  The pace of improvement in the housing market slowed notably in the third quarter. While higher mortgage rates are partially to blame, other factors are also impacting the market, including waning investment demand, labor and lot shortages, tight credit, and an overall limited number of first-time buyers. Affordability is another factor impacting demand. Housing prices have remained historically high, but have slipped recently in the face of higher mortgage rates and rapid home price    91    Table of Contents  appreciation. Housing starts totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 891,000 in August 2013, up 19% year-over-year but falling short of consensus expectations. Permits declined, providing downside risk to starts in coming months. Sales of existing homes continue to make steady progress, up 13% year-over-year as of August, while the trends in new home sales have weakened a bit, up 13% year-over-year, compared to 26% in the second quarter of 2013. Signs of a slowing market are not yet reflected in price indices, with the CoreLogic Home Price Index up 12.4% year-over-year in August 2013.  Speculation around the potential Federal Reserve tapering of asset purchases moved yields higher still in the third quarter of 2013. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury started the quarter at 2.50%, peaked on September 5, 2013 at 2.98% and settled in at 2.86% on the eve of the FOMC meeting. On September 18, 2013, the day of the FOMC meeting, the markets were clearly surprised by the Federal Reserve’s decision to postpone tapering which was reflected in a 17 basis point decline in the 10-year yield to 2.69%. Concern over budget negotiations and the looming debt ceiling provided additional downward pressure on yields, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury ending the third quarter of 2013 at 2.64%.  Long-term financial goals  Our long-term financial goals are as follows:      •    Target a loan-to-core deposit ratio range of 90% to 100%;      •    Maintain a moderate risk profile by targeting a net charge-off ratio range of .40% to .60%;      •    Grow high quality and diverse revenue streams by targeting a net interest margin in excess of 3.50%, and ratio of noninterest income to total revenue of greater than 40%;      •    Create positive operating leverage and target a cash efficiency ratio in the range of 60% to 65%; and      •    Achieve a return on average assets in the range of 1.00% to 1.25%.  Figure 2 shows the evaluation of our long-term financial goals for the third quarter of 2013.  Figure 2.

This acquisition brought in over $1 billion in low-cost escrow deposits and further leverages our existing servicing platform. We are now the third largest servicer of commercial and multi-family loans and the fifth largest special servicer of CMBS in the U.S.      •    Our revenue benefited from solid loan growth, driven by an 11.1% increase from the prior year in commercial, financial, and agricultural loans, as well as improved trends in several of our fee-based businesses. These results reflect the success of our distinctive business model and our progress implementing our growth initiatives.      •    We achieved annualized run rate savings of $207 million, thus meeting our announced expense target that we set in June of 2012 to achieve annualized savings of $200 million. We consolidated eight branches during the third quarter of 2013, reaching 65 total consolidated branches since the launch of the efficiency initiative.      •    On July 31, 2013, Key closed the sale of Victory and completed the divestiture of this business. This sale resulted in an after-tax gain of $92 million; the cash portion of this gain was $72 million. Additional gain may be realized resulting from consents that may be received through January 2014.      •    During the third quarter of 2013, we completed $198 million of Common Share repurchases on the open market under our 2013 capital plan. This amount included repurchases related to the cash portion of the net after-tax gain from the sale of Victory. Common Share repurchases under the 2013 capital plan authorization are expected to be executed through the first quarter of 2014.      •    Consistent with the 2013 capital plan, the Board declared a quarterly dividend of $.055 per Common Share for the third quarter of 2013.  Demographics  We have two major business segments: Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank.  Key Community Bank serves individuals and small to mid-sized businesses by offering a variety of deposit, investment, lending, and personalized wealth management products and business advisory services. These products and services are provided through our relationship managers and specialists working in our 13-state branch network, which is organized into nine internally defined geographic regions: Oregon and Alaska, Washington, Rocky Mountains, Indiana, Western Ohio and Michigan, Eastern Ohio, Eastern New York, New England, and Western New York.  Figure 3 shows the geographic diversity of Key Community Bank’s average deposits, commercial loans, and home equity loans.  Figure 3.

Key Corporate Bank is a full-service corporate and investment bank focused principally on serving the needs of middle market clients in six industry sectors: consumer, energy, healthcare, industrial, public sector and real estate. Key Corporate Bank delivers a broad product suite of banking and capital markets products to its clients, including syndicated finance, debt- and equity capital markets, commercial payments, equipment finance, commercial mortgage banking, derivatives, foreign exchange, financial advisory and public finance. Key Corporate Bank also delivers many of its product capabilities to clients of Key Community Bank.    93    Table of Contents Further information regarding the products and services offered by our Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank segments is included in this report in Note 18 (“Line of Business Results”).    94    Table of Contents Supervision and regulation  Regulatory reform developments  On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act became law. It was intended to address perceived deficiencies and gaps in the regulatory framework for financial services in the U.S., reduce the risks of bank failures, better equip the nation’s regulators to guard against or mitigate any future financial crises, and manage systemic risk through increased supervision of bank and nonbank SIFIs, such as KeyCorp and KeyBank. Further discussion concerning the Dodd-Frank Act, related regulatory developments, and the risks that they present to Key is available under the heading “Supervision and Regulation” in Item 1. Business and under the heading “II. Compliance Risks” in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2012 Form 10-K. Many of the proposed rules referenced in our prior reports continue to remain pending. The following discussion provides a summary of relevant regulatory developments relating to the Dodd-Frank Act or that relate to our results this quarter.  Enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements  On January 5, 2012, the Federal Reserve published proposed Regulation YY — Enhanced Prudential Standards — as part of its efforts to implement enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements to be imposed upon SIFIs pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. It generally applies to SIFIs like KeyCorp and includes a wide range of measures addressing issues such as risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits, liquidity requirements, single-counterparty credit limits, risk management, supervisory and company-run stress testing requirements, and early remediation. The comment period on the proposed rule closed on April 30, 2013. We continue to monitor the implementation of this rule.  Debit card and interchange fees and routing  On July 31, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a ruling in NACS v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, vacating the Federal Reserve’s Final Rule on Debit Card and Interchange Fees and Routing. Retail merchants and merchant groups challenged the Federal Reserve’s final rule, which had allowed debit card issuers to recover from merchants an interchange fee of $.21 per transaction, a fee of five basis points of the value of the transaction and an additional $.01 fraud prevention adjustment. The district court held that this fee structure, and the final rule’s requirements regarding the number of networks over which each debit card transaction can be processed, did not comply with the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act. On September 19, 2013, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit granted a joint motion by the parties for expedited appeal of the district court’s opinion. The parties are scheduled to file briefs with the court through December 2013. In the meantime, the final rule will remain in effect until resolution of the appeal by the circuit court. We continue to monitor these developments.  New regulatory capital rules  In July 2013, the Federal banking regulators approved the final Basel III capital framework for U.S. banking organizations (the “Regulatory Capital Rules”). Besides Basel III implementation in the U.S., the Regulatory Capital Rules also address two capital-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act: first, the provision requiring that the general risk-based and leverage capital requirements applicable to FDIC-insured deposit institutions that are not “advanced approaches” depository institutions (such as KeyBank) act as a floor for the requirements applicable to all BHCs (such as KeyCorp) as well as to all “advanced approaches” banking organizations; and, second, the provision requiring that references to external credit ratings be removed from the regulators’ rules and replaced with alternative standards of creditworthiness.  The Regulatory Capital Rules are lengthy and complex, and we are evaluating their impact on Key. In general, however, the Regulatory Capital Rules largely adhere to the NPRs as initially proposed in 2012 and replace the regulators’ Basel I-based general rules with a standardized approach based in substantial part upon the standardized approach in Basel II that was never adopted for U.S. banking organizations. The Regulatory Capital Rules also consolidate into a single regulation, with a single set of definitions used with common meanings, the regulators’ existing general risk-based capital rules, advanced approaches risk-based capital rules, leverage capital rules, and market risk rules.  Based on our preliminary analysis, there are at least three noteworthy changes from the NPRs that are in the Regulatory Capital Rules. The first change relates to the treatment of AOCI. This change permits banking organizations not subject to the advanced approaches provisions, such as Key, to make a one-time permanent election to opt-out of the requirement to include all components of AOCI (excluding accumulated net gains and losses on cash flow hedges related to items that are not fair-valued on the balance sheet) in common equity Tier 1 capital. The second change relates to the risk weightings for residential mortgage loans. Unlike the treatment of such loans under the NPRs that would have applied risk weightings to residential mortgages ranging from 35% to 200% based on the loan’s loan-to-value and product features associated with    95    Table of Contents  higher risk, the Regulatory Capital Rules retain the current treatment for such exposures (i.e., 50% risk weight for most first-lien exposures that are prudently underwritten and performing according to their original terms and 100% risk weight for other residential mortgage exposures). The third change relates to the treatment of mortgage servicing assets (“MSAs”). Under the NPRs, the amount of a banking organization’s MSAs that could be included in regulatory capital could not exceed 90% of the fair value of its MSAs. If the amount of MSAs included in regulatory capital (after applying the individual 10% and 15% aggregate common equity Tier 1 deduction thresholds) was greater than 90% of the fair value of a banking organization’s MSAs, then the banking organization would have been required to deduct an additional amount of MSAs from regulatory capital until no more than 90% of the fair value of its MSAs was included. This 90% MSA fair value limitation was eliminated in the Regulatory Capital Rules. However, all amounts of MSAs not deducted under the 10% and 15% common equity Tier 1 deduction thresholds and included in regulatory capital must be assigned a 250% risk weight.  While the Regulatory Capital Rules are effective January 1, 2014, the mandatory compliance date for Key as a “standardized approach” banking organization begins on January 1, 2015 and is subject to transitional provisions extending to January 1, 2019.  New Minimum Capital Requirements  Under the Regulatory Capital Rules, banking organizations subject to the standardized approach provisions, like Key, will be required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in Figure 4, below. At September 30, 2013, Key had a Tier 1 common equity ratio of 11.17% under current Basel I. Also at September 30, 2013, based on the fully phased-in Regulatory Capital Rules, Key estimates that its capital and leverage ratios, after adjustment for market risk, would be as set forth in Figure 4.  Figure 4.

Key is not subject to the countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% imposed under the advanced approaches portion of the Regulatory Capital Rules.    (b) Key is not subject to the 3% supplemental leverage ratio requirement imposed under the advanced approaches portion of the Regulatory Capital Rules. A discussion of the Basel III liquidity framework is included in the section “Supervision and regulation” under Item 1. Business of our 2012 Form 10-K under the heading “Basel III Capital and Liquidity Framework”.  Revised Prompt Corrective Action Standards  Under the Regulatory Capital Rules, the prompt corrective action capital category threshold ratios applicable to FDIC-insured depository institutions such as KeyBank will be revised effective January 1, 2015. Figure 5 identifies the proposed capital category threshold ratios for a well capitalized and an adequately capitalized institution under current law and the Regulatory Capital Rules.  Figure 5. Revised Prompt Corrective Action Well Capitalized and Adequately Capitalized Capital Category Ratios under the Regulatory Capital Rules                         Prompt Corrective Action   Capital Category        Well Capitalized     Adequately Capitalized     Ratio   Final Rule     Current     Final Rule     Current     Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based     6.5 %      N/A       4.5 %      N/A     Tier 1 Risk-Based     8.0       6.0 %      6.0       4.0 %    Total Risk-Based     10.0       10.0       8.0       8.0     Tier 1 Leverage (a)     5.0       5.0       4.0       3.0 or 4.0        (a) KeyBank is not subject to the federal banking agencies’ proposed rule that would establish a prompt corrective action well capitalized threshold of 6% for the supplementary leverage ratio for subsidiary insured depository institution subsidiaries of certain large, interconnected BHCs, which proposed rule was published on August 20, 2013.    96    Table of Contents We believe that, as of September 30, 2013, KeyCorp and KeyBank would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the Regulatory Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis if such requirements were currently effective. As previously indicated, the prompt corrective action requirements only apply to FDIC-insured depository institutions and not to BHCs. Nevertheless, if such prompt corrective action capital categories applied to BHCs, we believe that KeyCorp would meet all prompt corrective action capital and leverage ratio requirements for a well-capitalized capital category at September 30, 2013, under the Regulatory Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis if such requirements were currently effective.   Liquidity coverage ratios  On October 24, 2013, the Federal Reserve approved an NPR that would create a minimum liquidity coverage ratio (“LCR”) for certain internationally active bank and nonbank financial companies (not including Key) and a modified version of the LCR (“Modified LCR”) for certain depository institution holding companies that are not internationally active (including KeyCorp). The NPR was developed by the Federal Reserve with the OCC and FDIC, which have not yet approved it. Under the current terms of the NPR, KeyBank will not be subject to the LCR or the Modified LCR unless the OCC determines that its application to KeyBank is appropriate in light of its asset size, level of complexity, risk profile, scope of operations, affiliation with foreign or domestic covered entities, or risk to the financial system.  The LCR and Modified LCR created by the NPR are based on the Basel III liquidity framework and would be an enhanced prudential liquidity standard consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the NPR, KeyCorp would be required to maintain its high-quality liquid asset amount at not less than 100% of its total net cash flow outflow amount over a 21-calendar day period and the LCR and Modified LCR of 100% would be phased-in during a transition period beginning January 1, 2015 that continues until January 1, 2017.  New assessments, fees and other charges  As previously reported, Section 318 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve to charge SIFIs and institutions regulated by it new assessments, fees and other charges in connection with their examination, supervision, and regulation of such companies. On April 18, 2013, the Federal Reserve published a proposed rule to establish an annual assessment of SIFIs. The comment period on the proposed rule expired on June 16, 2013. On August 23, 2013, the Federal Reserve published its final rule establishing an annual assessment of SIFIs. The final rule outlines how the Federal Reserve determines which companies are assessed, estimates the total expenses that are necessary or appropriate to carry out its supervisory and regulatory responsibilities for such companies ($440 million for each of 2012, 2013, and 2014), determines the amount of each company’s assessment, and bills for and collects the assessments. Under the final rule, each calendar year starting with 2012 is an assessment period. For each assessment period after 2012, the Federal Reserve will notify each company of the amount of its assessment no later than July 15 of the year following the assessment period, with payments being due by September 30 of the year following the assessment period. For the 2012 assessment period, however, payment will not be collected until sometime in December 2013 but no later than December 15, 2013, with notice of the amount of the assessment being provided in late October 2013. Using the methodologies in the final rule, the Federal Reserve estimates that it would collect a total of approximately $440 million assessed with respect to approximately $20 trillion of aggregate total assessable assets. Based on this, Key estimates that its initial assessment under the final rule will be approximately $2.0 million.  Highlights of Our Performance  Financial performance  For the third quarter of 2013, we announced net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $229 million, or $.25 per Common Share. Our third quarter of 2013 results compare to net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $211 million, or $.22 per Common Share, for the third quarter of 2012.  Our taxable-equivalent net interest income was $584 million for the third quarter of 2013, and the net interest margin was 3.11%. These results compare to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $578 million and a net interest margin of 3.23% for the third quarter of 2012. Net interest income increased $6 million or 1.0% when compared to third quarter of 2012. The net interest margin this quarter was negatively impacted by lower earning asset yields and relatively high levels of liquidity, offset by lower funding costs. Over the next couple of quarters, we expect the net interest margin to be relatively stable to the reported third quarter level, with potential downward pressure dependent on levels of liquidity.    97    Table of Contents Our noninterest income was $459 million for the third quarter of 2013, compared to $518 million for the year-ago quarter. Other income declined $53 million due to a $54 million gain associated with the redemption of trust preferred securities one year ago. Operating lease income and other leasing gains also decreased $23 million, partially due to a $39 million gain on the early termination of leveraged leases one year ago compared to a $23 million gain on the early termination of leveraged leases in the current quarter. These decreases were partially offset by increases in trust and investment services income, cards and payments income, and net gains (losses) from principal investing of $6 million each.  Our noninterest expense was $716 million for the third quarter of 2013, compared to $712 million for the year-ago quarter, representing an increase of $4 million or 0.6%. Excluding the $41 million in expenses related to our efficiency initiative and the pension settlement charge compared to the $9 million in efficiency initiative expenses one year ago, noninterest expense was down $28 million from the prior year. Personnel expense increased $15 million. Employee benefits, a component of personnel expense, increased $24 million due to a $25 million pension settlement charge as a result of an increase in lump sum payments made from the pension plans. This increase in employee benefits was partially offset by a $5 million decrease in salaries and a $2 million decline in both incentive compensation and stock-based compensation. Nonpersonnel expense decreased $11 million from one year ago primarily due to a decline in business services and professional fees.  We achieved our efficiency initiative target by achieving $207 million in annualized expense savings. We plan to provide further information regarding the cost savings associated with our efficiency initiative when we announce our full year 2013 results in January 2014.  Average loans were $53.3 billion for the third quarter of 2013, an increase of $2.6 billion compared to the third quarter of 2012. Commercial, financial and agricultural loans grew by $2.4 billion over the year-ago quarter, with strong growth across our lending to business clients. In addition, home equity loans grew $409 million primarily as a result of lending campaigns launched in the Fall of 2012 and Spring of 2013. Credit cards also increased $268 million as a result of Key’s third quarter 2012 credit card portfolio acquisition. Loan growth was partially offset by declines in the equipment lease portfolio, which included the early termination of certain leveraged leases, and run-off of consumer loans in the designated exit portfolio. Our outlook for loan growth remains consistent with our prior guidance of mid-single digit, year-over-year growth, driven by commercial, financial and agricultural loans.  Average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, totaled $65.4 billion for the third quarter of 2013, an increase of $3.4 billion compared to the year-ago quarter. The growth was driven by corporate clients and the addition of escrow demand deposits from our servicing business acquisition. The overall growth resulted from an increase in demand deposits of $2.5 billion and interest-bearing non-time deposits of $2.7 billion. This deposit growth was partially offset by $1.8 billion of run-off of certificates of deposit and other time deposits.  Our provision for loan and lease losses was $28 million for the third quarter of 2013, compared to $109 million for the year-ago quarter. Our allowance for loan and lease losses was $868 million, or 1.62%, of total period-end loans at September 30, 2013, compared to 1.73% at September 30, 2012.  At September 30, 2013, our nonperforming loans totaled $541 million and represented 1.01% of period-end portfolio loans, compared to 1.27% at September 30, 2012. Nonperforming loans at September 30, 2012 included $38 million, the net carrying amount of secured loans reclassified as TDRs under updated regulatory guidance. The updated regulatory guidance requires loans discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower to be charged off to the collateral’s fair value, less selling costs, and classified as nonaccrual regardless of delinquency status. Nonperforming assets at September 30, 2013 totaled $579 million and represented 1.08% of period-end portfolio loans and OREO and other nonperforming assets, compared to 1.39% at September 30, 2012.  Our capital ratios remain strong. Our tangible common equity, Tier 1 common equity and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios at September 30, 2013, are 9.93%, 11.17%, and 11.92%, respectively, compared to 10.39%, 11.30%, and 12.10%, respectively, at September 30, 2012. We continue to return capital to our shareholders by repurchasing Common Shares and through our quarterly Common Share dividend. In the third quarter of 2013, we repurchased $198 million of Common Shares under our 2013 capital plan, including repurchases related to the cash portion of the net after-tax gain from the sale of Victory. Our Board of Directors at its September meeting approved the use of the cash portion of the after-tax gain from the sale of Victory for additional Common Share repurchases, and we received no objection from the Federal Reserve to use the cash portion of the after-tax gain for this purpose.  Related to our discontinued operations, on July 31, 2013, we closed the sale of Victory and completed the divestiture of this business. This sale resulted in an after-tax gain of $92 million; the cash portion of this gain was $72 million. Additional gain may be realized resulting from consents received through January 2014. The gain on the Victory divestiture was partially    98    Table of Contents  offset by a net after-tax loss of $48 million related to the fair value of the loans and securities in our ten education loan securitization trusts. During the third quarter of 2013, additional market participant information about projected trends for default and recovery rates became available. Based on this information and our related internal analysis, certain assumptions related to valuing the loans in these securitization trusts were adjusted.  Figure 6 shows our continuing and discontinued operating results for the current, past and year-ago quarters. Our financial performance for each of the past five quarters is summarized in Figure 1.

In September 2009, we decided to discontinue the education lending business conducted through Key Education Resources, the education payment and financing unit of KeyBank. In February 2013, we decided to sell Victory to a private equity fund. As a result of these decisions, we have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations. For further discussion regarding the income (loss) from discontinued operations see Note 11 (“Acquisitions and Discontinued Operations”).    (a) EPS may not foot due to rounding.  Figure 7 presents certain non-GAAP financial measures related to “tangible common equity,” “return on tangible common equity” and “Tier 1 common equity.” Tier 1 common equity, a non-GAAP financial measure, is a component of Tier 1 risk-based capital. Tier 1 common equity is not formally defined by GAAP or prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations applicable to us before January 1, 2015. However, since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity and Tier 1 common equity, we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases. Figure 7 also reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures.  Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and BHC capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. Since early 2009, the Federal Reserve has focused its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 common equity. Because the Federal Reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders’ equity (essentially Tier 1 risk-based capital less preferred stock, qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in Tier 1 risk-based capital, this focus on Tier 1 common equity is consistent with existing capital adequacy categories. The Regulatory Capital Rules, described in more detail under the section “Supervision and regulation” of this report, also make Tier 1 common equity a priority. The Regulatory Capital Rules change the regulatory capital standards that apply to BHCs by phasing out the treatment of trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred securities as Tier 1 eligible capital. By 2016, our trust preferred securities will only be included in Tier 2 capital.  The table also shows the computation for pre-provision net revenue, which is not formally defined by GAAP. We believe that eliminating the effects of the provision for loan and lease losses makes it easier to analyze our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis.  The cash efficiency ratio and adjusted cash efficiency ratio are ratios of two non-GAAP performance measures. As such, there are no directly comparable GAAP performance measures. The cash efficiency ratio performance measure removes the impact of our intangible asset amortization from the calculation. The adjusted cash efficiency ratio further removes the impact of the efficiency initiative and pension settlement charges. We believe these ratios provide greater consistency and comparability between our results and those of our peer banks. Additionally, these ratios are used by analysts and investors as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis.    99    Table of Contents Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.    100    Table of Contents Figure 7.

Results of Operations  Net interest income  One of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets (such as loans and securities) and loan-related fee income, and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. There are several factors that affect net interest income, including:      •    the volume, pricing, mix and maturity of earning assets, and interest-bearing liabilities;      •    the volume and value of net free funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and equity capital;      •    the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk;      •    interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace; and      •    asset quality.  To make it easier to compare results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets (some taxable, some not), we present net interest income in this discussion on a “taxable-equivalent basis” (i.e., as if it were all taxable and at the same rate). For example, $100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as $154, an amount that — if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% — would yield $100.  Figure 8 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense, and their respective yields or rates over the past five quarters. This figure also presents a reconciliation of taxable-equivalent net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with GAAP for each of those quarters. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized taxable-equivalent net interest income by average earning assets.  Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $584 million for the third quarter of 2013, and the net interest margin was 3.11%. These results compare to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $578 million and a net interest margin of 3.23% for the third quarter of 2012. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to a decline of $5 million of recognized unamortized lease origination costs related to the early termination of leveraged leases in the third quarter of 2013 compared to the third quarter of 2012. The decrease in the net interest margin was primarily a result of earning asset yields falling faster than the cost of funds over the past year.  Average earning assets for the third quarter of 2013 totaled $74.8 billion, compared to $71.8 billion for the third quarter of 2012. Commercial, financial and agricultural loans grew by $2.4 billion over the year-ago quarter, with strong growth across Key’s lending to business clients. In addition, home equity loans grew $409 million primarily as a result of lending campaigns launched in the Fall of 2012 and Spring of 2013. Credit cards also increased $268 million as a result of Key’s third quarter 2012 credit card portfolio acquisition. Loan growth was partially offset by declines in the equipment lease portfolio, which included the early termination of certain leveraged leases, and run-off of consumer loans in the designated exit portfolio.  As shown in Figure 8, the yield was impacted by lower spreads on commercial loans and lower security yields.    103    Table of Contents Figure 8.

Noninterest income  As shown in Figure 10, noninterest income was $459 million for the third quarter of 2013, compared to $518 million for the year-ago quarter, a decrease of $59 million, or 11.4%. Other income declined $53 million due to a $54 million gain associated with the redemption of trust preferred securities one year ago. Operating lease income and other leasing gains also decreased $23 million, partially due to a $39 million gain on the early termination of leveraged leases one year ago compared to a $23 million gain on the early termination of leveraged leases in the current quarter. These decreases were partially offset by increases in trust and investment services income, cards and payments income, and net gains (losses) from principal investing of $6 million each.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2013, noninterest income decreased $104 million, or 7.3%, from the same period one year ago. Operating lease income and other leasing gains decreased $91 million primarily due to a $90 million gain on the early termination of leveraged leases in the prior year compared to a $23 million gain on the early termination of leveraged leases in the current year. Other income also declined $41 million due to a $54 million gain associated with the redemption of trust preferred securities in the prior year. Net gains (losses) from principal investing also decreased $38 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in investment banking and debt placement fees of $32 million, cards and payments income of $25 million, and trust and investment services income of $15 million.    106    Table of Contents Figure 10.

For the quarter ended September 30, 2012, fixed income and equity securities trading activities constitute the majority of this amount. Income related to foreign exchange and interest rate derivative trading was less than $1 million and was offset by losses from our credit portfolio management activities.    (b) The allocation between proprietary and nonproprietary is made based upon whether the trade is conducted for the benefit of Key or Key’s clients rather than based upon the proposed rulemaking under the Volcker Rule. The prohibitions and restrictions on proprietary trading activities contemplated by the Volcker Rule and the rules proposed thereunder are not yet final. Therefore, the ultimate impact of the rules proposed under the Volcker Rule is not yet known.    107    Table of Contents The following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest income and the factors that caused those elements to change.  Trust and investment services income  Trust and investment services income is our largest source of noninterest income and consists of brokerage commissions, trust and asset management commissions, and insurance income. The assets under management that primarily generate these revenues are shown in Figure 12. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, trust and investment services income increased $6 million, or 6.4%, and $15 million, or 5.4%, respectively, as compared to the same periods one year ago.  A significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management. At September 30, 2013, our bank, trust and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of $36.1 billion, compared to $35.6 billion at September 30, 2012. As shown in Figure 12, an increase in the equity portfolio was partially offset by decreases in the securities lending, fixed income, and money market portfolios. Our securities lending business has been declining due to our de-emphasis of this business resulting in lower transaction volumes, client departures, and fewer assets under management.  Figure 12. Assets Under Management                                2013     2012     in millions   Third     Second     First     Fourth     Third     Assets under management by investment type:                            Equity   $ 19,761     $ 19,658     $ 19,659     $ 18,013     $ 18,266     Securities lending     3,740       3,202       2,879       3,147       3,900     Fixed income     9,997       10,066       10,697       10,872       10,621     Money market     2,612       2,618       2,479       2,712       2,800                                                         Total   $ 36,110     $ 35,544     $ 35,714     $ 34,744     $ 35,587                                                                Proprietary mutual funds included in assets under management:                            Equity     —        —      $ 40     $ 38     $ 40     Fixed income     —      $ 188       230       244       261                                                         Total     —      $ 188     $ 270     $ 282     $ 301                                                        Investment banking and debt placement fees  Investment banking and debt placement fees, consist of syndication fees, debt and equity financing fees, financial advisor fees, gains on sales of commercial mortgages, and agency origination fees. Investment banking and debt placement fees increased $3 million, or 3.6%, from the year-ago quarter and $32 million, or 14.7%, from the nine-month period ended one year ago primarily due to increased levels of debt and equity financings and advisor fees.  Operating lease income and other leasing gains  Operating lease income and other leasing gains decreased $23 million, or 34.8%, for the third quarter of 2013 and $91 million, or 51.7%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to the same periods one year ago. The decrease in the current quarter was partially due to a $39 million gain on the early termination of leveraged leases one year ago compared to a $23 million gain on the early termination of leveraged leases in the current quarter. The year-to-date decline was partially due to a $90 million gain on the early termination of leveraged leases in the prior year compared to a $23 million gain on the early termination of leveraged leases in the current year. Product run-off also contributed to the decreases in operating lease income and other leasing gains. Accordingly, as shown in Figure 13, operating lease expense also declined for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2013.  Cards and payments income  Cards and payments income, which consists of debit card, consumer and commercial credit card, and merchant services income, increased $6 million, or 16.2%, from the year-ago quarter and $25 million, or 25.8%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, primarily due to the third quarter 2012 credit card portfolio acquisition.  Other income  Other income, which consists primarily of gain on sale of certain loans; mortgage servicing revenue, net of amortization; other service charges; and certain dealer trading income, decreased $53 million, or 68.8%, from the year-ago quarter and $41 million, or 33.3%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 as compared to the same period one year ago. This decline was due to a $54 million gain on the redemption of certain trust preferred securities in the third quarter of 2012.    108    Table of Contents Noninterest expense  As shown in Figure 13, noninterest expense was $716 million for the third quarter of 2013, compared to $712 million for the year-ago quarter, representing an increase of $4 million or 0.6%. Excluding the $41 million in expenses related to our efficiency initiative and the pension settlement charge compared to the $9 million in efficiency initiative expenses one year ago, noninterest expense was down $28 million from prior year. Personnel expense increased $15 million compared to the year-ago quarter. Employee benefits, a component of personnel expense, increased $24 million from the third quarter of 2012 due to a $25 million pension settlement charge as a result of an increase in lump sum payments made from the pension plans. This increase in employee benefits was partially offset by a $5 million decrease in salaries and a $2 million decline in both incentive compensation and stock-based compensation. Nonpersonnel expense decreased $11 million from one year ago primarily due to a decline in business services and professional fees.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2013, noninterest expense increased $24 million, or 1.2%, compared to the same period one year ago. Personnel expense increased $63 million due to an increase in severance expense primarily associated with our efficiency initiative, as well as increases in employee benefits due to a pension settlement charge and incentive compensation. Nonpersonnel expense decreased $39 million from one year ago. Business services and professional fees declined $27 million, and marketing expense and other expense each decreased $15 million. These declines were partially offset by an increase in intangible asset amortization of $23 million primarily as a result of the 2012 acquisitions of the credit card portfolio and Western New York branches. The provision (credit) for losses on lending-related commitments increased $13 million. Net occupancy also increased $11 million primarily due to charges related to the consolidation of 46 branches during the first nine months of 2013.  The amount of noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, attributable to our 2012 acquisitions was $79 million spread across several expense categories, compared to $47 million for the prior year. For the nine months ended September 30, 2013, costs associated with our efficiency initiative, including the pension settlement charge, totaling $93 million were also incurred compared to $9 million in the prior year.

The following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest expense and the factors that caused those elements to change.  Personnel  As shown in Figure 14, personnel expense, the largest category of our noninterest expense, increased by $15 million, or 3.8%, when compared to the year-ago quarter. Employee benefits increased $24 million, or 44.4%, primarily due to a pension settlement charge of $25 million. This increase in employee benefits was partially offset by decreases in salaries, incentive compensation, and stock-based compensation. For the nine months ended September 30, 2013, personnel expense increased $63 million, or 5.5%, compared to the same period one year ago. Incentive compensation accruals increased $22 million, or 10.5%. Severance expense and employee benefits each increased $21 million, or 175% and 12.2%, respectively, as a result of staff reductions related to our efficiency initiative. Employee benefits included a $25 million pension settlement    109    Table of Contents  charge. In addition, higher levels of contract labor on technology initiatives resulted in an $11 million, or 24.4%, increase. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation of $9 million, or 25%, when compared to the same period one year ago.  Figure 14.

This year-to-date decline was attributable to product run-off. Income related to the rental of leased equipment is presented in Figure 10 as “operating lease income and other leasing gains.”  Intangible asset amortization  Intangible asset amortization increased $3 million compared to the year-ago quarter and $23 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2013, as compared to the same period one year ago as a result of the third quarter 2012 acquisitions of the credit card portfolio and 37 branches in Western New York.  Other expense  Other expense is comprised of various miscellaneous expense items. The $8 million, or 8.8% decrease in the current quarter compared to the year-ago quarter and the $15 million, or 5.7%, decrease in the first nine months of 2013 as compared to the same period one year ago reflects fluctuations in several of those line items.   Income taxes  We recorded tax expense from continuing operations of $59 million for the third quarter of 2013, $72 million for the second quarter of 2013 and $50 million for the third quarter of 2012. For the first nine months of 2013, we recorded tax expense from continuing operations of $201 million compared to tax expense of $177 million for the same period last year.  Our federal tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate, primarily because we generate income from investments in tax-advantaged assets, such as corporate-owned life insurance, earn credits associated with investments in low-income housing projects, and make periodic adjustments to our tax reserves. In addition, during the third quarter, our effective tax rate was lower due to the early termination of certain leveraged leases that resulted in nontaxable gains pursuant to a prior settlement with the IRS.  Additional information pertaining to how our tax expense (benefit) and the resulting effective tax rates were derived are included in Note 12 (“Income Taxes”) on page 175 of our 2012 Form 10-K.    110    Table of Contents Line of Business Results  This section summarizes the financial performance and related strategic developments of our two major business segments (operating segments), Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. Note 18 (“Line of Business Results”) describes the products and services offered by each of these business segments, provides more detailed financial information pertaining to the segments and explains “Other Segments” and “Reconciling Items.”  Figure 15 summarizes the contribution made by each major business segment to our “taxable-equivalent revenue from continuing operations” and “income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Key” for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013 and 2012.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $19 million, or 5.1%, from the third quarter of 2012 due to declines in the deposit spread in the current period as a result of the continued low-rate environment. Average loans and leases grew 6.2% while average deposits increased .8% from one year ago.  Noninterest income declined by $5 million, or 2.5%, from the year-ago quarter. Consumer mortgage income decreased $8 million, and other income declined $3 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in cards and payments income and trust and investment services income of $3 million each.  The provision for loan and lease losses decreased by $99 million, or 80.5%, from the third quarter of 2012. During the third quarter of 2012, the application of updated regulatory guidance related to debts discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy increased the provision $45 million, and the acquisition of the credit card portfolio and Western New York branches increased the provision $32 million. Net loan charge-offs decreased $64 million from the same period one year ago, partially due to the application of the updated regulatory guidance in the third quarter of 2012 as discussed above.  Noninterest expense declined by $37 million, or 7.7 %, from the year-ago quarter as a result of Key’s efficiency initiative. Personnel expense decreased $17 million primarily due to declines in salaries, incentive compensation, and employee benefits. Nonpersonnel expense declined $20 million primarily due to declines in business services and professional fees, computer processing, and internally-allocated costs.    111    Table of Contents Figure 16.

  Average loan balances up 9% from the prior year      •    Average deposits up 25.2% from the prior year  As shown in Figure 17, Key Corporate Bank recorded net income attributable to Key of $96 million for the third quarter of 2013, compared to $109 million for the same period one year ago.  Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $1 million, or .5%, compared to the third quarter of 2012. Average earning assets increased $1.7 billion, or 8.3%, from the year-ago quarter, driving a $7 million increase in earning asset spread. Average deposit balances increased $3.2 billion, or 25.2%, from the year-ago quarter, driven by third-party servicing acquisitions and increased public sector deposits. However, these increases in balances were offset by declines in the deposit spread as a result of the continued low-rate environment.    112    Table of Contents Noninterest income increased by $8 million, or 4.4%, from the third quarter of 2012. Increases in investment banking and debt placement fees, corporate services, and other income were partially offset by a decrease in operating lease income and other leasing gains compared to the year-ago quarter.  The provision for loan and lease losses was a charge of $13 million compared to a credit of $3 million for the third quarter of 2012 due to loan growth and lower levels of recovery.  Noninterest expense increased by $16 million, or 8%, from the third quarter of 2012. This increase was driven by a $2 million charge in the provision (credit) for losses on lending-related commitments compared to a credit of $6 million for the third quarter of 2012. Internally-allocated costs were also higher in the current quarter than one year ago.  Figure 17.

Other Segments generated net income attributable to Key of $92 million for the third quarter of 2013, compared to net income attributable to Key of $104 million for the same period last year. These results were primarily attributable to a decrease in other income due to a $54 million gain on the redemption of certain trust preferred securities. The net gain resulting from the early termination of leveraged leases was $15 million (a $23 million gain in operating lease income and other leasing gains less an $8 million charge for the write-off of capitalized loan origination costs) in the third quarter of 2013 compared to a net gain of $26 million in the third quarter of 2012, which also contributed to the decline in other segments. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in net interest income of $24 million, adjusted for the impact of the leveraged lease terminations discussed above, and a decline in noninterest expense of $19 million.    113    Table of Contents Financial Condition  Loans and loans held for sale  At September 30, 2013, total loans outstanding from continuing operations were $53.6 billion, compared to $52.8 billion at December 31, 2012 and $51.4 billion at September 30, 2012. Loans related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business, which are excluded from total loans at September 30, 2013, December 31, 2012, and September 30, 2012, totaled $4.7 billion, $5.2 billion, and $5.3 billion, respectively. The increase in our outstanding loans from continuing operations over the past twelve months results primarily from increased lending activity in our commercial, financial and agricultural portfolio along with the previously discussed credit card portfolio and branch acquisition. For more information on balance sheet carrying value, see Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the headings “Loans” and “Loans Held for Sale” on pages 119-120 of our 2012 Form 10-K.  Commercial loan portfolio  Commercial loans outstanding were $37.5 billion at September 30, 2013, an increase of $1.9 billion, or 5%, compared to September 30, 2012.  Commercial, financial and agricultural. Our commercial, financial and agricultural loans, also referred to as “Commercial and Industrial,” represented 45% of our total loan portfolio at September 30, 2013, 44% at December 31, 2012, and 43% at September 30, 2012, and are the largest component of our total loans. These loans are originated by both Key Corporate Bank and Key Community Bank and are comprised of fixed and variable rate loans to our large, middle market and small business clients.

We have experienced growth in new high credit quality loan commitments, and utilization with clients in our middle market segment, and as well as in our Institutional and Capital Markets business. While there was loan growth in several industry classifications compared to the year ago quarter, the most significant growth occurred in the public utilities industry classification, which increased by 46.3%. Our two largest industry classifications — services and manufacturing — increased by 8.8% and 4.5%, respectively, when compared to the year ago quarter. The services and manufacturing industries represented 23.7% and 17.0%, respectively, of the total commercial, financial and agricultural loan portfolio at September 30, 2013, compared to 24.1% and 18.0%, respectively, at September 30, 2012. At the end of each of the quarterly periods provided in Figure 18 above, loans in the services and manufacturing industry classifications accounted for over 40% of our total commercial, financial and agricultural loan portfolio.    114    Table of Contents Services and manufacturing are focus areas where we maintain dedicated industry verticals that are staffed by relationship managers who possess deep industry experience and knowledge. Our loans in the services classification grew by $467 million, or 8.8%, compared to last year. The growth in the services loan portfolio was largely related to increases in lending to large corporate, middle market, and business banking clients and was partially offset by decreases in loans to clients in private bank and real estate. Loans in the manufacturing classification grew by $179 million, or 4.5%, compared to the same period one year ago. Increases in lending to large corporate, middle market, and business banking clients accounted for the majority of the growth in this classification.  Commercial real estate loans. Our commercial real estate (“CRE”) lending business is conducted through two primary sources: our 13-state banking franchise, and KeyBank Real Estate Capital, a national line of business that cultivates relationships with owners of CRE located both within and beyond the branch system. This line of business deals primarily with nonowner-occupied properties (generally properties for which at least 50% of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties) and accounted for approximately 55% of our average year-to-date commercial real estate loans, compared to 54% one year ago. KeyBank Real Estate Capital generally focuses on larger owners and operators of commercial real estate.   CRE loans represent 16% of our total loan portfolio at September 30, 2013 compared to 17% one year ago. These loans include both owner and nonowner occupied properties which at September 30, 2013 represented 23% of our commercial loan portfolio compared to 24% one year ago. These loans were $8.6 billion at September 30, 2013 and September 30, 2012. We have been de-risking the portfolio by changing our focus from developers to owners of completed and stabilized CRE.  Figure 19 includes commercial mortgage and construction loans in both Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. As shown in Figure 19, this loan portfolio is diversified by both property type and geographic location of the underlying collateral.  As shown in Figure 19, at September 30, 2013, our CRE portfolio included mortgage loans of $7.5 billion and construction loans of $1.1 billion, representing 14% and 2%, respectively, of our total loans. At September 30, 2013, nonowner-occupied loans represented 66% of our total CRE loans and owner-occupied loans represented 34% of our total CRE loans. The average size of mortgage loans originated during the third quarter of 2013 was $3.5 million, and our largest mortgage loan at September 30, 2013, had a balance of $66.3 million. At September 30, 2013, our average construction loan commitment was $5.2 million. Our largest construction loan commitment was $56.7 million, and our largest construction loan amount outstanding was $55.7 million.  Also shown in Figure 19, 66% of our CRE loans at September 30, 2013 were for nonowner-occupied properties compared to 64% at September 30, 2012. Approximately 16% of these loans were construction loans at both September 30, 2013 and 2012. Typically, these properties are not fully leased at the origination of the loan. The borrower relies upon additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide the cash flow necessary to support debt service payments. A significant decline in economic growth, and in turn, rental rates and occupancy would adversely affect our portfolio of construction loans.    115    Table of Contents Figure 19.

Our nonowner occupied commercial real estate portfolio has increased by 2.9%, or approximately $159 million, since September 30, 2012.  If the economic recovery stalls, it may weaken the commercial real estate market fundamentals (i.e., vacancy rates, the stability of rental income and asset values), leading to reduced cash flow to support debt service payments. Reduced client cash flow would adversely affect our ability to collect such payments. Accordingly, the value of our commercial real estate loan portfolio could be adversely affected.  Commercial lease financing. We conduct commercial lease financing arrangements through our Key Equipment Finance line of business and have both the scale and array of products to compete in the equipment lease financing business. Commercial lease financing receivables represented 12% of commercial loans at September 30, 2013, and 14% at September 30, 2012.   Commercial loan modification and restructuring  We modify and extend certain commercial loans in the normal course of business for our clients. Loan modifications vary and are handled on a case by case basis with strategies responsive to the specific circumstances of each loan and borrower. In many cases, borrowers have other resources and can reinforce the credit with additional capital, collateral, guarantees or income sources.  Modifications are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan credit quality while at the same time meeting our clients’ financing needs. Modifications made to loans of creditworthy borrowers not experiencing financial difficulties and under circumstances where ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt are not classified as TDRs. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, a loan is classified as a TDR only when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a creditor concession has been granted.  Our concession types are primarily interest rate reductions, forgiveness of principal, and other modifications. Loan extensions are sometimes coupled with these primary concession types. Because economic conditions have improved modestly and we have restructured loans to provide the optimal opportunity for successful repayment by the borrower, certain of our restructured loans have returned to accrual status and consistently performed under the restructured loan terms over the past year.    116    Table of Contents If the loan terms are extended at less than normal market rates for similar lending arrangements, our Asset Recovery Group is consulted to help determine if any concession granted would result in designation as a TDR. Transfer to our Asset Recovery Group is considered for any commercial loan determined to be a TDR. During the third quarter of 2013, there were $53 million of new restructured commercial loans.  For more information on concession types for our commercial accruing and nonaccruing TDRs, see Note 4 (“Asset Quality”).  Figure 20.

First, we create an A note. As the objective of this TDR note structure is to achieve a fully performing and well-rated A note, we focus on sizing that note to a level that is supported by cash flow available to service debt at current market terms and consistent with our customary underwriting standards. This note structure typically will include a debt coverage ratio of 1.2 or better of cash flow to monthly payments of market interest, and principal amortization of generally not more than 25 years. (These metrics are adjusted from time to time based upon changes in long-term markets and “take out underwriting standards” of our various lines of business.) Appropriately sized A notes are more likely to return to accrual status, allowing us to resume recognizing interest income. As the borrower’s payment performance improves, these restructured notes typically also allow for an upgraded internal quality risk rating classification. Moreover, the borrower retains ownership and control of the underlying collateral (typically, commercial real estate), the borrower’s capital structure is strengthened (often to the point that fresh capital is attracted to the transaction), and local markets are spared distressed/fire sales.  The B note typically is an interest-only note with no required amortization until the property stabilizes and generates excess cash flow. This excess cash flow customarily is applied directly to the principal of the A note. We evaluate the B note when we consider returning the A note to accrual status. In many cases, the B note is charged off at the same time the A note is returned to accrual status. Alternatively, both A and B notes may be simultaneously returned to accrual if credit metrics are supportive.  Restructured nonaccrual loans may be returned to accrual status based on a current, well documented evaluation of the credit, which would include analysis of the borrower’s financial condition, prospects for repayment under the modified terms, and alternate sources of repayment such as the value of loan collateral. We wait a reasonable period (generally a minimum of six months) to establish the borrower’s ability to sustain historical repayment performance before returning the loan to accrual status. Sustained historical repayment performance prior to the restructuring also may be taken into account. The primary consideration for returning a restructured loan to accrual status is the reasonable assurance that the full contractual principal balance of the loan and the ongoing contractually required interest payments will be fully repaid. Although our policy is a guideline, considerable judgment is required to review each borrower’s circumstances.  All loans processed as TDRs, including A notes and any non-charged-off B notes, are reported as TDRs during the calendar year in which the restructure took place.  Additional information regarding TDRs is provided in Note 4 (“Asset Quality”).  Extensions. Project loans typically are refinanced into the permanent commercial loan market at maturity, but sometimes they are modified and extended. Extension terms take into account the specific circumstances of the client relationship, the status of the project, and near-term prospects for both the client and the collateral. In all cases, pricing and loan structure are    117    Table of Contents  reviewed and, where necessary, modified to ensure the loan has been priced to achieve a market rate of return and loan terms that are appropriate for the risk. Typical enhancements include one or more of the following: principal paydown, increased amortization, additional collateral, increased guarantees, and a cash flow sweep. Some maturing construction loans have automatic extension options built in; in those cases, pricing and loan terms cannot be altered.  Loan pricing is determined based on the strength of the borrowing entity and the strength of the guarantor, if any. Therefore, pricing for an extended loan may remain the same because the loan is already priced at or above current market.  We do not consider loan extensions in the normal course of business (under existing loan terms or at market rates) as TDRs, particularly when ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt and no concession has been made. In the case of loan extensions where either collection of all principal and interest is uncertain or a concession has been made, we would analyze such credit under the accounting guidance to determine whether it qualifies as a TDR. Extensions that qualify as TDRs are measured for impairment under the applicable accounting guidance.  Guarantors. We conduct a detailed guarantor analysis (1) for all new extensions of credit, (2) at the time of any material modification/extension, and (3) typically annually, as part of our on-going portfolio and loan monitoring procedures. This analysis requires the guarantor entity to submit all appropriate financial statements, including balance sheets, income statements, tax returns, and real estate schedules.  While the specific steps of each guarantor analysis may vary, the high level objectives include determining the overall financial conditions of the guarantor entities, including: size, quality, and nature of asset base; net worth (adjusted to reflect our opinion of market value); leverage; standing liquidity; recurring cash flow; contingent and direct debt obligations; and near term debt maturities.  Borrower and guarantor financial statements are required at least annually within 90-120 days of the calendar/fiscal year end. Income statements and rent rolls for project collateral are required quarterly. We may require certain information, such as liquidity, certifications, status of asset sales or debt resolutions, and real estate schedules to be provided more frequently.  We routinely seek performance from guarantors of impaired debt if the guarantor is solvent. We may not seek to enforce the guaranty if we are precluded by bankruptcy or we determine the cost to pursue a guarantor exceeds the value to be returned given the guarantor’s verified financial condition. We often are successful in obtaining either monetary payment or the cooperation of our solvent guarantors to help mitigate loss, cost and the expense of collections.  As of September 30, 2013, we had $5.5 million of mortgage and construction loans that had a loan-to-value ratio greater than 1.0, and were accounted for as performing loans. These loans were not considered impaired due to one or more of the following factors: (i) underlying cash flow adequate to service the debt at a market rate of return with adequate amortization; (ii) a satisfactory borrower payment history; and (iii) acceptable guarantor support.  Consumer loan portfolio  Consumer loans outstanding increased by $244 million, or 2%, from one year ago. The home equity portfolio is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio. Approximately 97% of this portfolio at September 30, 2013, is derived from our Key Community Bank within our 13 state footprint. The remainder of the portfolio, which has been in an exit mode since the fourth quarter of 2007, was originated from the Consumer Finance line of business and is now included in Other Segments. Home equity loans in Key Community Bank increased by $517 million, or 5%, over the past twelve months as a result of stabilized home values, improved employment, and favorable borrowing conditions.  As shown in Figure 16, we hold the first lien position for approximately 58% of the Key Community Bank home equity portfolio at September 30, 2013, and 54% at September 30, 2012. For consumer loans with real estate collateral, we track borrower performance monthly. Regardless of the lien position, credit metrics are refreshed quarterly, including recent Fair Isaac Corporation scores as well as original and updated loan-to-value ratio. This information is used in establishing the ALLL. Our methodology is described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses” that begins on page 120 of our 2012 Form 10-K.  Regulatory guidance issued in January 2012 addressed specific risks and required actions within home equity portfolios associated with second lien loans. At September 30, 2013, 42% of our home equity portfolio is secured by second lien mortgages. On at least a quarterly basis, we continue to monitor the risk characteristics of these loans when determining whether our loss estimation methods are appropriate.    118    Table of Contents Figure 21 summarizes our home equity loan portfolio by source at the end of each of the last five quarters, as well as certain asset quality statistics and yields on the portfolio as a whole.

(b) Includes $72 million of performing secured loans that were discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not formally re-affirmed as addressed in regulatory guidance that was updated in the third quarter of 2012. Such loans have been designated as nonperforming and TDRs.    (c) From continuing operations.   Loans held for sale  As shown in Note 3 (“Loans and Loans Held for Sale”), our loans held for sale increased to $699 million at September 30, 2013 from $599 million at December 31, 2012 and totaled $628 million at September 30, 2012.  At September 30, 2013, loans held for sale included $608 million of commercial mortgages, which increased by $124 million from September 30, 2012, $23 million of residential mortgage loans, which decreased $94 million from September 30, 2012, and $68 million of commercial, financial, and agricultural loans, which increased $55 million from September 30, 2012.  Loan sales  As shown in Figure 22, during the first nine months of 2013, we sold $2.6 billion of commercial real estate loans, $738 million of residential real estate loans, $288 million of commercial lease financing loans, and $236 million of commercial loans. Most of these sales came from the held-for-sale portfolio; however, $150 million of these loan sales related to the held-to-maturity portfolio.  Loan sales classified as held for sale generated net gains of $91 million in the first nine months of 2013 and are included in “investment banking and debt placement fees” and “other income” on the income statement.  Among the factors that we consider in determining which loans to sell are:      •    our business strategy for particular lending areas;      •    whether particular lending businesses meet established performance standards or fit with our relationship banking strategy;      •    our A/LM needs;      •    the cost of alternative funding sources;      •    the level of credit risk;      •    capital requirements; and      •    market conditions and pricing.    119    Table of Contents Figure 22 summarizes our loan sales for the first nine months of 2013 and all of 2012.

In the event of default by a borrower, we are subject to recourse with respect to approximately $1.3 billion of the $200 billion of loans administered or serviced at September 30, 2013. Additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in Note 15 (“Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) under the heading “Recourse agreement with FNMA.”  We derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold. We earn noninterest income (recorded as “other income”) from fees for servicing or administering loans. This fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets. In addition, we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing of commercial real estate loans.  Securities  Our securities portfolio totaled $17.4 billion at September 30, 2013, compared to $16 billion at December 31, 2012, and $16.1 billion at September 30, 2012. Available-for-sale securities were $12.6 billion at September 30, 2013, compared to $12.1 billion at December 31, 2012, and $12 billion at September 30, 2012. Held-to-maturity securities were $4.8 billion at September 30, 2013, compared to $3.9 billion at December 31, 2012, and $4.1 billion at September 30, 2012. Essentially all of our held-to-maturity securities portfolio was invested in CMOs at September 30, 2013.  As shown in Figure 24, all of our mortgage-backed securities, which include both securities available for sale and held-to-maturity securities, are issued by government-sponsored enterprises or GNMA, and are traded in highly liquid secondary markets. These securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value for the available-for-sale portfolio and at cost for the held-to-maturity portfolio. For more information about these securities, see Note 5 (“Fair Value Measurements”) under the heading “Qualitative Disclosures of Valuation Techniques” and Note 6 (“Securities”).    120    Table of Contents Figure 24.

Securities available for sale  The majority of our securities available-for-sale portfolio consists of CMOs, which are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities. CMOs generate interest income and serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements. At September 30, 2013, we had $12.5 billion invested in CMOs and other mortgage-backed securities in the available-for-sale portfolio, compared to $12 billion at December 31, 2012, and $11.9 billion at September 30, 2012.  We periodically evaluate our securities available-for-sale portfolio in light of established A/LM objectives, changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio, and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. These evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning.  In addition, the size and composition of our securities available-for-sale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required (or elect) to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits. Although we generally use debt securities for this purpose, other assets, such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit, are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles.  Throughout 2012 and in the first nine months of 2013, our investing activities continued to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs. Our actions to not reinvest the monthly security cash flows at various times during this time period served to provide the liquidity necessary to address our funding requirements. These funding requirements included ongoing loan growth and occasional debt maturities, as well as the Western New York branch acquisition in July 2012 (including credit card assets obtained in September 2012) and the acquisition of Key-branded credit card assets in August 2012.  Figure 25 shows the composition, yields and remaining maturities of our securities available for sale.

(b) Excludes $5 million of securities at September 30, 2013, that have no stated yield.    122    Table of Contents Other investments  Principal investments — investments in equity and mezzanine instruments made by our Principal Investing unit — represented 58% of other investments at September 30, 2013. They include direct investments (investments made in a particular company) as well as indirect investments (investments made through funds that include other investors). Principal investments are predominantly made in privately held companies and are carried at fair value ($585 million at September 30, 2013, $627 million at December 31, 2012, and $669 million at September 30, 2012).  In addition to principal investments, “other investments” include other equity and mezzanine instruments, such as certain real estate-related investments that are carried at fair value, as well as other types of investments that generally are carried at cost.  Most of our other investments are not traded on an active market. We determine the fair value at which these investments should be recorded based on the nature of the specific investment and all available relevant information. This review may encompass such factors as the issuer’s past financial performance and future potential, the values of public companies in comparable businesses, the risks associated with the particular business or investment type, current market conditions, the nature and duration of resale restrictions, the issuer’s payment history, our knowledge of the industry, third-party data and other relevant factors. During the first nine months of 2013, net gains from our principal investing activities (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) totaled $32 million, which includes $5 million of net unrealized gains. These net gains are recorded as “net gains (losses) from principal investing” on the income statement. Additional information regarding these investments is provided in Note 5 (“Fair Value Measurements”).  Deposits and other sources of funds  Domestic deposits are our primary source of funding. During the third quarter of 2013, average domestic deposits were $65.4 billion and represented 87% of the funds we used to support loans and other earning assets, compared to $62 billion and 86% during the same quarter of 2012. The composition of our average deposits is shown in Figure 8 in the section entitled “Net interest income.”  The increase in average domestic deposits in the third quarter of 2013, compared to the third quarter of 2012, was driven by corporate clients and the addition of escrow deposits from our servicing business acquisition. The overall growth resulted from an increase in demand deposits of $2.5 billion and interest-bearing non-time deposits of $2.7 billion. This deposit growth was partially offset by $1.8 billion of run-off from one year ago in certificates of deposit and other time deposits. Improved funding mix and previous maturities of our certificates of deposit have reduced the cost of total domestic deposits from .38% for the third quarter of 2012 to .22% for the third quarter of 2013.  Wholesale funds, consisting of deposits in our foreign office and short-term borrowings, averaged $2.8 billion during third quarter of 2013, compared to $2.9 billion during third quarter of 2012. The change from 2012 resulted from a $45 million decrease in foreign office deposits, a $7 million decrease in bank notes and other short-term borrowings, and a $15 million increase in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase.    123    Table of Contents Capital  At September 30, 2013, our shareholders’ equity was $10.2 billion, down $65 million from December 31, 2012. The following sections discuss certain factors that contributed to this change. For other factors that contributed to the change, see the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity.  CCAR and capital actions  As part of its ongoing supervisory process, the Federal Reserve requires BHCs like KeyCorp to submit an annual comprehensive capital plan and to update that plan to reflect material changes in a firm’s risk profile, business strategies, or corporate structure, including but not limited to changes in planned capital actions. As previously reported, on January 7, 2013, we submitted to the Federal Reserve and provided to the OCC under the annual CCAR process our 2013 capital plan. On March 14, the Federal Reserve announced that it did not object to our 2013 capital plan. At its March 2013 meeting, our Board authorized up to $426 million of Common Share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The authorization was expressly in addition to any amounts remaining under preexisting authority. Common Share repurchases under the current authorization are expected to be executed through the first quarter of 2014.  Our Board of Directors at its September meeting approved the use of the cash portion of the after-tax gain from the sale of Victory for additional Common Share repurchases, and we received no objection from the Federal Reserve to use the cash portion of the after-tax gain for this purpose. During the third quarter of 2013, we completed $198 million of Common Share repurchases on the open market under our 2013 capital plan. This amount included repurchases related to the cash portion of the net after-tax gain from the sale of Victory.  Dividends  Consistent with the 2013 capital plan, during the third quarter of 2013, we made a dividend payment of $.055 per Common Share, or $49 million, on our Common Shares. We made dividend payments of $.055 per Common Share, or $49 million, and $.05 per Common Share, or $47 million, during the second and first quarters of 2013, respectively. Changes to future dividends may be evaluated by the Board of Directors based upon our earnings, financial condition, and other factors, including regulatory review. Further information regarding the capital plan process and CCAR is included in the “Supervision and Regulation” section of our 2012 Form 10-K in Item 1. Business under the heading “Capital Assessment and Review of Capital Actions.”  During the third quarter of 2013, we also made a dividend payment of $1.9375 per share, or $6 million, on our Series A Preferred Stock.  Common shares outstanding  Our Common Shares are traded on the NYSE under the symbol KEY with 30,803 holders of record at September 30, 2013. Our book value per Common Share was $11.05 based on 897.8 million shares outstanding at September 30, 2013, compared to $10.78 based on 925.8 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2012, and $10.64 based on 936.2 million shares outstanding at September 30, 2012. At September 30, 2013, our tangible book value per Common Share was $9.92 compared to $9.67 at December 31, 2012, and $9.54 at September 30, 2012.  Figure 27 shows activities that caused the change in outstanding Common Shares over the past five quarters.  Figure 27.

Going forward we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stock-based compensation awards and for other corporate purposes.  Information on repurchases of Common Shares by KeyCorp is included in Part II, Item 2. “Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds” of this report.  Capital adequacy  Capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance. All of our capital ratios remain in excess of regulatory requirements at September 30, 2013. Our capital and liquidity are intended to position us to weather an adverse credit cycle while continuing to serve our clients’ needs, as well as to adjust to the Regulatory Capital Rules described in this report under the heading “Supervision and regulation”. Our shareholders’ equity to assets ratio was 11.25% at September 30, 2013, compared to 11.51% at December 31, 2012, and 11.79% at September 30, 2012. Our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 9.93% at September 30, 2013, compared to 10.15% at December 31, 2012, and 10.39% at September 30, 2012.  Banking industry regulators prescribe minimum capital ratios for BHCs like KeyCorp and their banking subsidiaries. Risk-based capital guidelines require a minimum level of capital as a percent of “risk-weighted assets.” Risk-weighted assets consist of total assets plus certain off-balance sheet and market risk items, subject to adjustment for predefined credit risk factors. Currently, banks and BHCs must maintain, at a minimum, Tier 1 capital as a percent of risk-weighted assets of 4.00% and total capital as a percent of risk-weighted assets of 8.00%. As of September 30, 2013, our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and our total risk-based capital ratios were 11.92% and 14.37%, respectively, compared to 12.15% and 15.13%, respectively, at December 31, 2012 and 12.10% and 15.17%, respectively, at September 30, 2012.  Another indicator of capital adequacy, the leverage ratio, is defined as Tier 1 capital as a percentage of average quarterly tangible assets. BHCs that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the Federal Reserve’s risk-adjusted measure for market risk — as we have — must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 3.00%. All other BHCs must maintain a minimum ratio of 4.00%. As of September 30, 2013, our leverage ratio was 11.33%, compared to 11.41% at December 31, 2012 and 11.37% at September 30, 2012.  The adoption of the Regulatory Capital Rules changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to BHCs by phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities as eligible Tier 1 capital. The phase-out period, beginning January 1, 2015, will result in our trust preferred securities issued by the KeyCorp capital trusts being treated only as Tier 2 capital by 2016. These changes apply the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to depository institutions to BHCs, savings and loan holding companies, and nonbank financial companies identified as systemically important. The section titled “Supervision and regulation” of this report contains more detailed information regarding the Regulatory Capital Rules, and the section titled “Supervision and Regulation” under Item 1. Business of our 2012 Form 10-K contains additional information regarding capital.  As of September 30, 2013, our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, leverage ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio were 11.92%, 11.33%, and 14.37%, respectively. The trust preferred securities issued by the KeyCorp capital trusts contribute $340 million or 41, 39, and 41 basis points to our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio, respectively, as of September 30, 2013. The new minimum capital ratios together with the estimated capital ratios of Key at September 30, 2013, calculated on a fully phased-in basis under the Regulatory Capital Rules are set forth in Figure 4 of this report.  Federal bank regulators group FDIC-insured depository institutions into five categories, ranging from “well-capitalized” to “critically undercapitalized.” A “well-capitalized” institution must meet or exceed the prescribed threshold ratios of 6.00% for Tier 1 risk-based capital, 5.00% for Tier 1 leverage capital, and 10.00% for total risk-based capital and must not be subject to any written agreement, order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. If these provisions applied to BHCs, we believe we would qualify as “well-capitalized” at September 30, 2013, and we believe there has not been any change in condition or event since that date that would cause a change in capital category. Analysis on an estimated basis, accounting for the phase-out of our trust preferred securities as Tier 1 eligible (and therefore as Tier 2 instead) as of September 30, 2013, also determines that we would qualify as “well-capitalized” under current regulatory guidelines (Basel I), with the estimated Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, estimated leverage ratio, and estimated total risk-based capital ratio being 11.51%, 10.95%, and 14.37%, respectively. Figure 5 in the “Supervision and regulation” section above, describes the new threshold capital ratios for a “well capitalized” and an “adequately capitalized” institution under the    125    Table of Contents  Regulatory Capital Rules. The regulatory defined capital categories serve a limited supervisory function. Investors should not use our estimated ratios as a representation of our overall financial condition or prospects of KeyCorp. A discussion of the regulatory capital standards and other related capital adequacy regulatory standards is included in the section “Supervision and Regulation” under Item 1. Business of our 2012 Form 10-K under the heading “Capital.”  Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and BHC capital adequacy based on both the amount and composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. As a result of the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has intensified its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 risk-based capital, known as Tier 1 common equity, and its review of the consolidated capitalization of systemically important financial companies, including KeyCorp. The capital modifications mandated by the Regulatory Capital Rules are consistent with the renewed focus on Tier 1 common equity and the consolidated capitalization of banks, BHCs, and covered nonbank financial companies, which resulted from the financial crisis. Tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by GAAP nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations; this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. Figure 7 in the “Highlights of Our Performance” section reconciles Key shareholders’ equity, the GAAP performance measure, to Tier 1 common equity, the corresponding non-GAAP measure. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio was 11.17% at September 30, 2013, compared to 11.36% at December 31, 2012, and 11.30% at September 30, 2012.  Generally, for risk-based capital purposes, deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income are limited to the lesser of: (i) the amount of deferred tax assets that a financial institution expects to realize within one year of the calendar quarter-end date, based on its projected future taxable income for the year, or (ii) 10% of the amount of an institution’s Tier 1 capital. At September 30, 2013, December 31, 2012, and September 30, 2012, we had no net deferred tax assets deducted from Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets. At September 30, 2013, for Key’s consolidated operations, we had a federal net deferred tax asset of $197 million and a state deferred tax asset of $7 million compared to a federal deferred tax asset of $83 million and a state deferred tax liability of $13 million at December 31, 2012, and a federal deferred tax asset of $41 million and a state deferred tax liability of $29 million at September 30, 2012. We have recorded a valuation allowance of $2 million against the gross deferred tax assets associated with certain state net operating loss carryforwards and state credit carryforwards.  Regulatory Capital Rules  The Regulatory Capital Rules provide for the phase-out of Tier 1 capital treatment for capital securities beginning in January 2015. As a result, our outstanding trust preferred securities will, by 2016, become Tier 2 capital. The “Supervision and regulation” section of this report contains a more detailed discussion of the Regulatory Capital Rules. Figure 5 in the “Supervision and regulation” section above discloses the new minimum capital ratios together with the estimated capital ratios of Key at September 30, 2013, calculated on a fully phased-in basis under the Regulatory Capital Rules. Given our strong capital position, we expect to be able to satisfy the capital framework established under the Regulatory Capital Rules on our compliance date of January 1, 2015.  Figure 28 represents the details of our regulatory capital position at September 30, 2013, December 31, 2012, and September 30, 2012, under the existing Basel I standards.    126    Table of Contents Figure 28.

The most significant risks we face are credit, liquidity, market, compliance, operational, strategic, and reputation risks. Our risk management activities are focused on ensuring we properly identify, measure and manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability. Certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section.  The KeyCorp Board of Directors (the “Board”) serves in an oversight capacity ensuring that Key’s risks are managed in a manner that is effective and balanced and adds value for the shareholders. The Board understands Key’s risk philosophy, approves the risk appetite, inquires about risk practices, reviews the portfolio of risks, compares the actual risks to the risk appetite and is apprised of significant risks, both actual and emerging, and determines whether management is responding appropriately. The Board challenges management and ensures accountability.  The Board’s Audit Committee assists the Board in oversight of financial statement integrity, regulatory and legal compliance, independent auditors’ qualifications and independence and all risk review functions including internal audit. The Audit Committee discusses policies related to risk assessment and risk management and the processes related to risk review and compliance. The Audit Committee has responsibility over financial reporting, compliance risk and legal matters, the implementation, management and evaluation of operational risk controls and information, security and fraud risk, and associated reputation and strategic risks.  The Board’s Risk Committee assists the Board in oversight of strategies, policies, procedures and practices relating to the management of credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk, including the actions taken to mitigate these risks, as well as reputational and strategic risks. The Risk Committee also oversees the maintenance of appropriate regulatory and economic capital, reviews the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) reports, and approves any material changes to the charter of the ERM Committee.  The Audit and Risk Committees meet jointly, as appropriate, to discuss matters that relate to each committee’s responsibilities. In addition to regularly scheduled bi-monthly meetings, the Audit Committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases. Committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting. All members of the Board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months.  Our ERM Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer and comprised of other senior level executives, is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite. The ERM Program encompasses our risk philosophy, policy, framework and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company. The ERM Committee reports to the Board’s Risk Committee. Annually, the Board reviews and approves the ERM Program, as well as the risk appetite and corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories. We use a risk-adjusted capital framework to manage risks. This framework is approved and managed by the ERM Committee.  Tier 2 Risk Governance Committees support the ERM Committee by identifying early warning events and trends, escalating emerging risks and discussing forward-looking assessments. Membership of the Risk Governance Committees includes representatives from each of the Three Lines of Defense. The First Line of Defense is the Line of Business primarily responsible to accept, own, proactively identify, monitor and manage risk. The Second Line of Defense comprises Risk Management representatives who provide independent, centralized oversight over all risk categories by aggregating, analyzing and reporting risk information. Risk Review provides the Third Line of Defense in their role to provide independent assessment and testing of the effectiveness, appropriateness and adherence to KeyCorp’s risk management policies, practices and controls.  The Chief Risk Officer ensures that relevant risk information is properly integrated into strategic and business decisions, ensures appropriate ownership of risks, provides input into performance and compensation decisions, assesses aggregate enterprise risk, monitors capabilities to manage critical risks, and executes appropriate Board and stakeholder reporting.    128    Table of Contents Federal banking regulators continue to emphasize with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution. We believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks, and conform to regulatory expectations.    129    Table of Contents Market risk management  The cash flows and values of financial instruments change as a function of changes in market rates or prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, credit spreads, or volatilities. These factors influence prospective yields, values, or prices associated with the instrument. For example, the value of a fixed-rate bond will decline when market interest rates increase, while the cash flows associated with a variable rate loan will increase when interest rates increase. The holder of a financial instrument is exposed to market risk when either the cash flows or the value of the instrument is tied to such external factors.  We manage our market risk differently based on whether the financial instrument is associated with trading or nontrading operations and activities. Our trading positions are carried at fair value with changes recorded in the income statement. These positions are subject to various market-based risk factors that impact the fair value of the financial instruments in the trading category. Our traditional banking loan and deposit products as well as long-term debt and certain short-term borrowings are nontrading positions. These positions are generally carried at the principal amount outstanding for assets and the amount owed for liabilities. The nontrading positions are subject to changes in economic value due to varying market conditions, primarily changes in interest rates.  Trading market risk  Key incurs market risk as a result of trading, investing, and client facilitation activities, principally within our investment banking and capital markets business. Key has exposures to a wide range of interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and commodity prices, as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads. Our primary market risk exposures are a result of trading activities in the derivative and fixed income markets and maintaining positions in these instruments. We maintain modest trading inventories to facilitate customer flow, make markets in securities, and hedge certain risks. The majority of our positions are traded in active markets.  Management of trading market risks. Market risk management is an integral part of Key’s risk culture. The Market Risk Committee, headed by our Chief Market Risk Officer, along with the Risk Committee of our Board and the ERM Committee (collectively, the “Committees”) provide oversight of the management of trading market risks. Market risk policies and procedures have been defined and approved by the Market Risk Committee and take into account our tolerance for risk and consideration for the business environment. The Committees regularly review and discuss market risk reports prepared by our Market Risk Management group (“MRM”) that contain our market risk exposures and results of monitoring activities.  MRM is an independent risk management function that partners with the lines of business to identify, measure, and monitor market risks throughout our company. MRM is responsible for ensuring transparency of significant market risks, monitoring compliance with established limits, and escalating limit exceptions to appropriate senior management. Market risk is monitored through various measures, such as VaR, and through routine stress testing, sensitivity, and scenario analyses. MRM conducts stress tests for each covered position using historical worst case and standard shock scenarios. VaR, stressed VaR, and other analyses are prepared daily and distributed to appropriate management.  Covered positions. We monitor the market risk of our covered positions, which includes all of our trading positions as well as all foreign exchange and commodity positions, regardless of whether the position is in a trading account. The trading account includes on-and off-balance sheet positions in financial instruments acquired with the intent to profit from price variations. All positions in the trading account are recorded at fair value, and changes in fair value are reflected in our consolidated statements of income. Information regarding our fair value policies, procedures and methodologies is provided in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Fair Value Measurements” on page 122 of our 2012 Form 10-K and Note 5 (“Fair Value Measurements”) in this report. Instruments that are used to hedge nontrading activities, such as bank issued debt and loan portfolios, equity positions that are not actively traded, and securities financing activities do not meet the definition of a covered position. MRM is responsible for identifying our portfolios as either covered or non-covered. The Covered Position Working Group develops the final list of covered positions, and a summary is provided to the Market Risk Committee.  Our significant portfolios of covered positions are detailed below. We analyze market risk by portfolios of covered positions, and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type. The descriptions below incorporate the respective risk types associated with each of these portfolios.        •    Fixed income includes those instruments associated with our capital markets business and the trading of securities as a dealer. These instruments include positions in municipal bonds, bonds backed by the U.S. government, agency    130    Table of Contents       and corporate bonds, certain mortgage-backed securities, securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, money markets, and certain collateralized CMOs. The activities and instruments within the fixed income portfolio create exposures to interest rate and credit spread risks.        •    Foreign exchange includes foreign currency spots, forwards and options. We enter into contracts for these types of instruments primarily to accommodate the needs of clients. These activities result in exposures to foreign currency risk.        •    Interest rate derivatives include interest rate swaps, caps and floors, which are transacted primarily to accommodate the needs of commercial loan clients. In addition, we enter into interest rate derivatives to offset or mitigate the interest rate risk related to the client positions. The activities within this portfolio create exposures to interest rate risk.        •    Credit derivatives include credit default swaps, which are used to mitigate loan portfolio credit risk, and credit default swap indexes, which are used to manage the credit risk exposure associated with anticipated sales of certain commercial real estate loans. The transactions within the credit derivatives portfolio result in exposure to credit risk.  VaR and stressed VaR. VaR is the estimate of the maximum amount of loss on an instrument or portfolio due to adverse market conditions during a given time interval within a stated confidence level. Stressed VaR is used to assess the extreme conditions on market risk within our trading portfolios. MRM calculates VaR and stressed VaR on a daily basis, and the results are distributed to appropriate management. VaR and stressed VaR results are also provided to our regulators and utilized in regulatory capital calculations.  We use a VaR simulation model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions. Historical scenarios are customized for specific covered positions, and numerous risk factors are incorporated in the calculation. VaR is calculated using daily observations over a one-year time horizon, and approximates a 95% confidence level. Statistically, this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than VaR, on average, five out of 100 trading days, or three to four times each quarter. We also calculate VaR and stressed VaR at a 99% confidence level. Two years of historical data were used in the simulation during 2012. Beginning in February 2013, the simulation uses historical data from the previous year, as we believe it more appropriately reflects the current market conditions and the risks associated with our portfolios. This change resulted in a decrease in VaR results of approximately 2% at the 95% confidence level and 15% at the 99% confidence level. We also utilize factors to estimate the exposures that contain optionality features, such as options and cancellable provisions.  The VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of possible gains and losses on our covered positions. However, there are limitations inherent in the VaR model since it uses historical results over a given time interval to estimate future performance. Historical results may not be indicative of future results, and changes in the market or composition of our portfolios could have a significant impact on the accuracy of the VaR model. We regularly review and enhance the modeling techniques, inputs and assumptions used. Our market risk policy includes the independent validation of our VaR model by Key’s Risk Management Group on an annual basis. The Model Risk Management Committee oversees the Model Validation Program, and results of validations are discussed with the ERM Committee.  MRM backtests our VaR model on a daily basis to evaluate its predictive power. The test compares VaR model results at the 99% confidence level to observed daily profit and loss. Results of backtesting are provided to the Market Risk Committee. Backtesting exceptions occur when trading losses exceed VaR. Actual losses did not exceed daily trading VaR on any day during the quarters ended September 30, 2013 and 2012.  We do not engage in correlation trading, or utilize the internal model approach for measuring default and credit migration risk. Our net VaR approach incorporates diversification, but our VaR calculation does not include the impact of counterparty risk and our own credit spreads on derivatives.  The aggregate VaR at the 99% confidence level for all covered positions was $1.7 million at September 30, 2013, and $1.9 million at September 30, 2012. The decrease in aggregate VaR was primarily due to reduced exposures in credit derivatives as well as the change from using two years of historical data to one year for the VaR simulation, which was partially offset by an increase in the interest rate derivatives and fixed income VaR. Figure 29 summarizes our VaR at the 99% confidence level for significant portfolios of covered positions for the third quarter of 2013 and 2012.    131    Table of Contents Figure 29.

The aggregate stressed VaR for all covered positions was $5.0 million at September 30, 2013. Figure 30 summarizes our stressed VaR for significant portfolios of covered positions for the third quarter of 2013 as used for market risk capital charge calculation purposes. Stressed VaR was not calculated for market risk regulatory capital purposes during 2012.  Figure 30.

Market risk is a component of our internal capital adequacy assessment. Our risk-weighted assets include a market risk equivalent asset position, which consists of a VaR component, stressed VaR component, and a specific risk add-on. Specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments, which is not accounted for by changes in broad market risk factors. Specific risk is measured through a standardized approach for positions where the VaR model does not capture specific risk. Specific risk calculations are run quarterly by MRM, and approved by the Chief Market Risk Officer. The VaR, stressed VaR, and specific risk components are added together to arrive at a total market risk equivalent assets calculation.  Nontrading market risk  Most of our market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations. Interest rate risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the EVE. Such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. We manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the EVE in accordance with our risk appetite, and within Board approved policy limits.  Interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of consumer preferences for loan and deposit products, economic conditions, the competitive environment within our markets and changes in market interest rates that affect client activity and our hedging, investing, funding and capital positions. The primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of gap risk, basis risk, yield curve risk and option risk.      •    “Gap risk” is the exposure to changes in interest rates and occurs when the volume of interest-bearing liabilities and the volume of interest-earning assets they fund (for example, deposits used to fund loans) do not mature or reprice at the same time.      •    “Basis risk” is the exposure to asymmetrical changes in interest rate indexes and occurs when floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities reprice at the same time, but in response to different market factors or indexes.    132    Table of Contents   •    “Yield curve risk” is the exposure to non-parallel changes in the slope of the yield curve (where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity) and occurs when interest-bearing liabilities and the interest-earning assets they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve.      •    “Option risk” is the exposure to a customer or counterparty’s ability to take advantage of the interest rate environment and terminate or reprice one of our assets, liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments prior to contractual maturity without a penalty. Option risk occurs when exposures to customer and counterparty early withdrawals or early prepayments are not mitigated with an offsetting position or appropriate compensation.  Oversight of nontrading market risk is governed by the Risk Committee of our Board, the ERM Committee and the ALCO. These committees regularly review various reports, including interest rate risk summaries, trends, peer comparisons, variance analyses, projections, and sensitivity analyses. The reviews generate a discussion of positions, trends and directives on interest rate risk and inform a number of our decisions. Guidance for the oversight and management of interest rate risk is provided through the asset/liability management policy, which is governed by the ALCO. We communicate with individuals within and outside of the company on a daily basis to discuss emerging issues.   Net interest income simulation analysis. The primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis. For purposes of this analysis, we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on- and off-balance sheet positions, accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity. The analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments, including a most likely macro-economic scenario. Simulation modeling assumes that residual risk exposures will be managed to within the risk appetite.   We measure the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if the federal funds target rate were to gradually increase or decrease over the next twelve months, and term rates were to move in a similar fashion. Our standard rate scenarios encompass a gradual increase or decrease of 200 basis points, but due to the low interest rate environment, we have modified the standard to a gradual decrease of 25 basis points over two months with no change over the following ten months. After calculating the amount of net interest income at risk to interest rate changes, we compare that amount with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment. We also perform regular stress tests and sensitivities on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments. One set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of interest rate inputs on simulated exposures. Assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve, including a sustained flat yield curve, an inverted slope yield curve, changes in credit spreads, an immediate parallel change in market interest rates, and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates. Another set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of loan and deposit assumptions and assumed discretionary strategies on simulated exposures. Assessments are performed on changes to the following assumptions: the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities; changes in lending spreads; prepayments on loans and securities; other loan and deposit balance shifts; investment, funding and hedging activities; and liquidity and capital management strategies.  Simulation analysis produces only a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on judgments related to assumption inputs into the simulation model. We tailor assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled, and validate those assumptions on a regular basis. Our simulations are performed with the assumption that interest rate risk positions will be actively managed through the use of on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments to achieve the desired residual risk profile. However, actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition, customer behavior, product pricing, market interest rates, investment, funding and hedging activities, and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events. Figure 31 presents the results of the simulation analysis at September 30, 2013, and 2012. At September 30, 2013, our simulated exposure to changes in interest rates was moderately asset sensitive. Policy limits for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual increase or decrease in short-term interest rates over the next twelve months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 4%. As shown in Figure 31, we are operating within these limits.    133    Table of Contents Figure 31.

Net interest income is highly dependent on the timing, magnitude, frequency, and path of interest rate increases and assumption inputs for deposit repricing relationships, lending spreads, and the balance behavior of transaction accounts. The unprecedented low level of interest rates increases the uncertainty when modeling future deposit balances and repricing behavior. As shown in Figure 31, our sensitivity testing of both assumptions and variables suggests an increase or decrease of 50 basis points in our simulated exposure to a gradual 200 basis point increase in rates is reasonable at this time. Increases in both short term and intermediate term rates would benefit net interest income over time. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the FOMC expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens, and in particular expects to keep the federal funds rate at exceptionally low levels. Key will continue to monitor balance sheet flows and expects the benefit from rising rates to increase prior to any increase in the federal funds rate. Our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume, mix, maturity, and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows. As changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy, management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile. We also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a three-year horizon. These simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a twelve-month horizon. To capture longer-term exposures, we calculate exposures to changes to the EVE as discussed in the following section.  Economic value of equity modeling. EVE complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond twelve-, twenty-four and thirty-six month horizons. EVE modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates, measuring the resulting change in the values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, and comparing those amounts with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment. Because the calculation of EVE under an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest rates in the current low rate environment results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than 200 basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points, we have modified the standard declining rate scenario to an immediate 100 basis point decrease. This analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with non-contractual maturities. Those assumptions are based on historical behaviors, as well as our expectations. We develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our EVE will decrease by more than 15% in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates. We are operating within these guidelines.  Management of interest rate exposure. We use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate A/LM strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures. Specifically, we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities, issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates, and using derivatives — predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps, which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities.   Figure 32 shows all swap positions that we hold for A/LM purposes. These positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. For example, fixed-rate debt is converted to a floating rate through a “receive fixed/pay variable” interest rate swap. The volume, maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader A/LM objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile, see Note 7 (“Derivatives and Hedging Activities”).    134    Table of Contents Figure 32.

(b) Excludes accrued interest of $32 million and $38 million for September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  Liquidity risk management  We define “liquidity” as the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences. Liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions.  Governance structure  We manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis. This approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity, as well as each entity’s capacity to manage through adverse conditions. The approach also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding.  Oversight of the liquidity risk management process is governed by the Board’s Risk Committee, the KeyBank Board of Directors, the ERM Committee and the ALCO. These groups regularly review various liquidity reports, including liquidity and funding summaries, liquidity trends, peer comparisons, variance analyses, liquidity projections, hypothetical funding erosion stress tests and goal tracking reports. The reviews generate a discussion of positions, trends and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of our decisions. When liquidity pressure is elevated, positions are monitored more closely and reporting is more intensive. We communicate with individuals within and outside of the company on a daily basis to discuss emerging issues.  Factors affecting liquidity  Our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events. An example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency. Examples of indirect events (events unrelated to us) that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war, natural disasters, political events, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund or hedge fund. Similarly, market speculation, or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources.  Our credit ratings at September 30, 2013, are shown in Figure 33. We believe that these credit ratings, under normal conditions in the capital markets, will enable the parent company or KeyBank to issue fixed income securities to investors.    135    Table of Contents Figure 33.

In the normal course of business, we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both KeyCorp and KeyBank. In a “heightened monitoring mode,” we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently, and use assumptions to reflect the changed market environment. Our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies. Erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods. Ultimately, they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations. To compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures, we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed.  We maintain a Contingency Funding Plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis. The plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions. It also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for managing liquidity through a problem period. As part of the plan, we maintain a liquidity reserve through balances in our liquid asset portfolio. During a problem period, that reserve could be used as a source of funding to provide time to develop and execute a longer-term strategy. The liquid asset portfolio at September 30, 2013, totaled $9.8 billion, consisting of $6.3 billion of unpledged securities, $1.1 billion of securities available for secured funding at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, and $2.4 billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our Federal Reserve account. The liquid asset portfolio can fluctuate due to excess liquidity, heightened risk, or prefunding of expected outflows, such as debt maturities. Additionally, as of September 30, 2013, our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was $15.6 billion at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and $2.7 billion at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati.  Long-term liquidity strategy  Our long-term liquidity strategy is to be predominantly funded by core deposits. However, we may use wholesale funds to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio, meet daily cash demands, and allow management flexibility to execute business initiatives. Key’s client-based relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base which, in conjunction with intermediate and long-term wholesale funds managed to a diversified maturity structure and investor base, supports our liquidity risk management strategy. We use the loan to deposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies. Our target loan to deposit ratio is 90-100% (at September 30, 2013, our loan to deposit ratio was 84%), which we calculate as total loans, loans held for sale, and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by domestic deposits.  Sources of liquidity  Our primary sources of liquidity include customer deposits, wholesale funding and liquid assets. If the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances, we rely on wholesale funding or liquid assets. Conversely, excess cash generated by operating, investing and deposit-gathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets.   Liquidity programs  We have several liquidity programs, which are described in Note 15 (“Long-Term Debt”) on page 184 of our 2012 Form 10-K, that enable the parent company and KeyBank to raise funds in the public and private markets when the capital markets are functioning normally. The proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. Each of the programs is replaced or renewed as needed. There are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs.    136    Table of Contents KeyBank maintains a $20 billion Global Bank Note Program that allows KeyBank to issue notes, domestically and abroad, with original maturities of seven days or more for senior notes or five years or more for subordinated notes. These notes may be denominated in U.S. dollars or in foreign currencies. Each note will be the sole obligation of KeyBank.  In the first nine months of 2013, Key’s outstanding note balance decreased by $693 million. On January 29, 2013, Key issued $1 billion of Senior Bank Notes due February 1, 2018 under the Global Bank Note Program. These Notes have a coupon of 1.65% per annum and are not redeemable prior to maturity. Key also had maturities of $26 million in Euro medium-term notes and repayments of $750 million in Federal Home Loan Bank advances. KeyCorp had maturities of $750 million in medium-term notes.   Liquidity for KeyCorp  The primary source of liquidity for the parent is from subsidiary dividends, primarily from KeyBank NA. The parent company has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt; support customary corporate operations and activities (including acquisitions); support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries’ obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, and without adverse consequences; and pay dividends to shareholders.  We use a cash coverage metric as the primary measure to assess parent company liquidity. The cash coverage metric measures the months into the future where projected obligations can be met with the current amount of liquidity to meet all projected obligations. We generally issue term debt to supplement dividends from KeyBank to manage our liquidity position at or above our targeted levels. The parent company generally maintains cash and short-term investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over at least the next 24 months. At September 30, 2013, KeyCorp held $1.4 billion in short-term investments, which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations, including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our risk tolerance.  Typically, the parent company meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from KeyBank, supplemented with term debt. Federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval. A national bank’s dividend-paying capacity is affected by several factors, including net profits (as defined by statute) for the two previous calendar years and for the current year, up to the date of dividend declaration. During the first nine months of 2013, KeyBank paid the parent $300 million in dividends, while the nonbank subsidiaries did not make any dividend payments to the parent. The parent did not make any capital infusions to KeyBank during the first nine months of 2013. As of September 30, 2013, KeyBank has capacity to pay $209 million in dividends to KeyCorp without prior regulatory approval.  Our liquidity position and recent activity  Over the past twelve months our liquid asset portfolio, which includes overnight and short-term investments, as well as unencumbered, high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios, has increased as a result of an increase in unpledged securities, growth in deposits related to the acquisition of the commercial mortgage servicing portfolio and special servicing business, and net customer loan and deposit flows. The liquid asset portfolio continues to exceed the amount we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a longer-term solution. The issuance of $1 billion of Senior Bank Notes in January 2013 provided additional liquidity to support normal business flows and maintain our liquid asset portfolio within target levels.  From time to time, KeyCorp or KeyBank may seek to retire, repurchase or exchange outstanding debt, capital securities, preferred shares or Common Shares through cash purchase, privately negotiated transactions or other means. We periodically repurchase Common Shares in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions under our 2013 capital plan authorized by our Board and not objected to by the Federal Reserve. Additional information on repurchases of Common Shares by KeyCorp is included in Part II, Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities or Use of Proceeds of this report. Such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity and capital requirements, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and other factors. The amounts involved may be material, individually or collectively.  We generate cash flows from operations and from investing and financing activities. We have approximately $165 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in international tax jurisdictions as of September 30, 2013. As we consider alternative long-term strategic and liquidity plans, opportunities to repatriate these amounts would result in    137    Table of Contents  approximately $12 million in taxes to be paid. If we were to cease operations in all international tax jurisdictions, the total amount of taxes to be paid would increase to approximately $32 million. Accordingly, we have included the total amount as a deferred tax liability at September 30, 2013.  The consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2013, and 2012.  Credit risk management  Credit risk is the risk of loss to us arising from an obligor’s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms. Like other financial services institutions, we make loans, extend credit, purchase securities and enter into financial derivative contracts, all of which have related credit risk.   Credit policy, approval and evaluation  We manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program. The Credit Risk Committee approves both retail and commercial credit policies. These policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit.  Our credit risk management team is responsible for credit approval, is independent of our lines of business, and consists of senior officers who have extensive experience in structuring and approving loans. Only credit risk management members are authorized to grant significant exceptions to credit policies. It is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate, but most major lending units have been assigned specific thresholds to keep exceptions at a manageable level.  Loan grades are assigned at the time of origination, verified by the credit risk management team and periodically reevaluated thereafter. Most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or scoring. This risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling. Commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings. The first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation; the second rating reflects expected recovery rates on the credit facility. Default probability is determined based on, among other factors, the financial strength of the borrower, an assessment of the borrower’s management, the borrower’s competitive position within its industry sector, and our view of industry risk within the context of the general economic outlook. Types of exposure, transaction structure and collateral, including credit risk mitigants, affect the expected recovery assessment.  Our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans. These models, known as scorecards, forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant. The scorecards are embedded in the application processing system, which allows for real-time scoring and automated decisions for many of our products. We periodically validate the loan grading and scoring processes.  We maintain an active concentration management program to encourage diversification in our credit portfolios. For individual obligors, we employ a sliding scale of exposure, known as hold limits, which is dictated by the strength of the borrower. Our legal lending limit is approximately $1.6 billion for any individual borrower. However, internal hold limits generally restrict the largest exposures to less than 20% of that amount. As of September 30, 2013, we had five client relationships with loan commitments net of credit default swaps of more than $200 million. The average amount outstanding on these five individual net obligor commitments was $38 million at September 30, 2013. In general, our philosophy is to maintain a diverse portfolio with regard to credit exposures.  We actively manage the overall loan portfolio in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives and concentration risk tolerances to mitigate credit risk. We utilize credit default swaps to transfer a portion of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit to a third party. At September 30, 2013, we used credit default swaps with a notional amount of $652 million to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending obligations. We may also sell credit derivatives — primarily single name credit default swaps — to offset our purchased credit default swap position prior to maturity. At September 30, 2013, we had sold credit default swaps outstanding with a total notional amount of $67 million.  Credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Related gains or losses, as well as the premium paid or received for credit protection, are included in the “corporate services income” and “other income” components of noninterest income.    138    Table of Contents We may also manage the loan portfolio using portfolio swaps and bulk purchases and sales. Our overarching goal is to manage the loan portfolio within a specified range of asset quality.  Allowance for loan and lease losses  At September 30, 2013, the ALLL was $868 million, or 1.62% of loans, compared to $888 million, or 1.73%, at September 30, 2012. The allowance includes $47 million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of $411 million at September 30, 2013, compared to $39 million that was allocated for impaired loans of $428 million one year ago. For more information about impaired loans, see Note 4 (“Asset Quality”). At September 30, 2013, the allowance for loan and lease losses was 160.4% of nonperforming loans, compared to 136.0% at September 30, 2012.  Selected asset quality statistics for each of the past five quarters are presented in Figure 34. The factors that drive these statistics are discussed in the remainder of this section.  Figure 34.

(b) September 30, 2013, June 30, 2013, March 31, 2013, December 31, 2012, and September 30, 2012 amounts exclude $18 million, $19 million, $22 million, $23 million, and $25 million, respectively, of PCI loans acquired in July 2012.  We estimate the appropriate level of the ALLL on at least a quarterly basis. The methodology used is described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses” on page 102 of our 2012 10-K. Briefly, we apply expected loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions, changes in credit policies or underwriting standards, and changes in the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets.  For all commercial and consumer TDRs, regardless of size, as well as impaired commercial loans with an outstanding balance greater than $2.5 million, we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss content and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate. We estimate the extent of impairment by comparing the recorded investment of the loan with the estimated present value of its expected cash flows, the fair value of its underlying collateral or the loan’s observable market price. A specific allowance also may be assigned — even when sources of repayment appear sufficient — if we remain uncertain about whether the loan will be repaid in full. On at least a quarterly basis, we evaluate the appropriateness of our loss estimation methods to reduce differences between estimated incurred losses and actual losses. The ALLL at September 30, 2013, represents our best estimate of the probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date.  As shown in Figure 35, our ALLL decreased by $20 million, or 2%, during the past twelve months. This contraction was associated with the improvement in credit quality of the loan portfolio, which has trended more favorably over the past twenty-four months. The quality of new loan originations and decreasing NPLs and net charge-offs has resulted in a reduction in our general allowance. Our delinquency trends have declined during 2012 and thus far in 2013 due to a modest level of loan growth, relatively stable conditions in the economic environment, and continued run off in our exit loan portfolio, and reflects our effort to maintain a moderate enterprise risk tolerance. Our liability for credit losses on lending-related commitments decreased by $3 million to $40 million at September 30, 2013, compared to the same period one year ago. When combined with our allowance for loan and lease losses, our total allowance for credit losses represented 1.69% of loans at the end of the third quarter of 2013, compared to 1.81% at the end of the third quarter of 2012.    139    Table of Contents Figure 35.

Our provision (credit) for loan and lease losses was $28 million for third quarter of 2013, compared to $109 million for the year-ago quarter. Our net loan charge-offs were $37 million for the third quarter 2013 compared to $109 million for the third quarter of 2012. Our net charge-offs for the third quarter of 2012 included $45 million of charge-offs reported in accordance with updated regulatory guidance requiring loans and leases discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower to be charged-off to the collateral’s fair market value less selling costs and classified as nonaccrual regardless of their delinquency. Additionally, we continue to reduce our exit loans and leases, as well as our exposure in our higher-risk businesses, including the residential properties portion of our construction loan portfolio, Marine/RV financing, and other selected leasing portfolios through the sale of certain loans, payments from borrowers or net charge-offs. We anticipate that net loan charge-offs will remain at, or below, the lower end of our targeted range of 40 to 60 basis points of average loans for the balance of the current year and for our provision (credit) for loan and lease losses to be near this same level.    140    Table of Contents Net loan charge-offs  Net loan charge-offs for the third quarter of 2013 totaled $37 million, or .28% of average loans, compared to net loan charge-offs of $109 million, or .86%, for the same period last year. Third quarter of 2012 included $45 million (.35% of average loans) of incremental net loan charge-offs reported in accordance with updated regulatory guidance requiring loans discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower to be charged off to the collateral’s fair market value less selling costs and classified as nonaccrual regardless of their delinquency status. Figure 36 shows the trend in our net loan charge-offs by loan type, while the composition of loan charge-offs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in Figure 37.  Over the past twelve months, net loan charge-offs decreased $72 million. This decrease is attributable to improvement in asset quality statistics as shown in Figure 38 and updated regulatory guidance that went into effect for us in the third quarter of 2012. As shown in Figure 39, our exit loan portfolio contributed a total of $1 million in net loan charge-offs for the third quarter of 2013. Net loan charge-offs for the second quarter of 2013 in our exit loan portfolio were $10 million. The decrease in net loan charge-offs in our exit loan portfolio were primarily driven by lower levels of net loan charge-offs in the consumer exit loan portfolios.  Figure 36.

(b) September 30, 2013, June 30, 2013, March 31, 2013, December 31, 2012, and September 30, 2012 amounts exclude $18 million, $19 million, $22 million, $23 million, and $25 million, respectively, of PCI loans acquired in July 2012.    (c) Restructured loans (i.e., troubled debt restructurings) are those for which Key, for reasons related to a borrower’s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. These concessions are made to improve the collectability of the loan and generally take the form of a reduction of the interest rate, extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance. The majority of the increase in restructured loans included in nonperforming loans during the second half of 2012 was a result of updated regulatory guidance in the third quarter of 2012.  As shown in Figure 38, nonperforming assets decreased during the third quarter of 2013. Most of the reduction came from nonperforming loans in our commercial real estate loan portfolios, commercial, financial, and agricultural portfolio, and Home equity — Key Community Bank portfolio, partially offset by an increase in nonperforming loans in the commercial lease financing portfolio. As shown in Figure 39, our exit loan portfolio accounted for $56 million, or 10%, of our total nonperforming assets at September 30, 2013, compared to $63 million, or 9%, at June 30, 2013.  At September 30, 2013, the carrying amount of our commercial nonperforming loans outstanding represented 61% of their contractual amount owed, total nonperforming loans outstanding represented 74% of their contractual amount owed, and nonperforming assets in total were carried at 72% of their original contractual amount.  At September 30, 2013, our twenty largest nonperforming loans totaled $119 million, representing 22% of total nonperforming loans.    143    Table of Contents Figure 39 shows the composition of our exit loan portfolio at September 30, 2013 and June 30, 2013, the net charge-offs recorded on this portfolio for the third quarter of 2013 and the second quarter of 2013, and the nonperforming status of these loans at September 30, 2013 and June 30, 2013. The exit loan portfolio represented 4% of total loans and loans held for sale at September 30, 2013.

The types of activity that caused the change in our nonperforming loans during each of the last five quarters are summarized in Figure 40. Loans placed on nonaccrual status decreased $115 million during third quarter of 2013 compared to the third quarter 2012, due to the third quarter of 2012 classification of loans discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy previously discussed, as well as continued improvement in market liquidity.

These events include, among other things, threats to our cybersecurity, as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct our business activities.  Operational risk also encompasses compliance risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules and regulations, prescribed practices, and ethical standards. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, large financial companies like Key will be subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation due to their systemic importance. This heightened level of regulation will increase our operational risk. We have created work teams to respond to and analyze the regulatory requirements that have been or will be promulgated as a result of the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. Resulting operational risk losses and/or additional regulatory compliance costs could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation or foregone opportunities.  We seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk, alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance, and a system of internal controls and reporting. We continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws, rules and regulations. For example, an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses. This tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action. We also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes. This technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the Board.  The Operational Risk Management Program provides the framework for the structure, governance, roles and responsibilities as well as the content to manage operational risk for Key. Primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business. The Operational Risk Committee, a senior management committee, oversees our level of operational risk and directs and supports our operational infrastructure and related activities. This committee and the Operational Risk Management function are an integral part of our ERM Program. Our Risk Review function periodically assesses the overall effectiveness of our Operational Risk Management Program and our system of internal controls. Risk Review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the Audit Committee, and independently supports the Audit Committee’s oversight of these controls.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Our business is dynamic and complex. Consequently, we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies. These choices are critical: not only are they necessary to comply with GAAP, they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance. All accounting policies are important, and all policies described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) beginning on page 117 of our 2012 Form 10-K should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance.  In our opinion, some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility. These policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance, or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. Because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances, they may prove to be inaccurate, or we may find it necessary to change them.  We rely heavily on the use of judgment, assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions, including accounting for the allowance for loan and lease losses; contingent liabilities, guarantees and income taxes; derivatives and related hedging activities; and assets and liabilities that involve valuation methodologies. In addition, we may employ outside valuation experts to assist us in determining fair values of certain assets and liabilities. A brief discussion of each of these areas appears on pages 120 through 128 of our 2012 Form 10-K.  At September 30, 2013, $15.1 billion, or 16.6%, of our total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Approximately 96.0% of these assets, before netting adjustments, were classified as Level 1 or Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. At September 30, 2013, $1.5 billion, or 1.9%, of our total liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Substantially all of these liabilities were classified as Level 1 or Level 2.  During the third quarter of 2013, $37 million, or .1%, of our total assets were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Substantially all of these assets were classified as Level 3. At September 30, 2013, there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.    146    Table of Contents In addition, the education lending securitization trusts assets and liabilities were included on the balance sheet at September 30, 2013 at fair value, in the amount of $2.2 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively.  During the first nine months of 2013, we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates.    147    Table of Contents European Sovereign Debt Exposures  Our total European sovereign and non-sovereign debt exposure is presented in Figure 43.

At-risk exposures in the rest of the world, which are actively monitored by management, total less than $1 million.    148    Table of Contents Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk  The information presented in the “Market risk management” section of the Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition & Results of Operations is incorporated herein by reference.  Item 4. Controls and Procedures  As of the end of the period covered by this report, KeyCorp carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of KeyCorp’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of KeyCorp’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, KeyCorp’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, as of the end of the period covered by this report, in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. No changes were made to KeyCorp’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, KeyCorp’s internal control over financial reporting.  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION      Item 1. Legal Proceedings  As of September 30, 2013, KeyCorp and its subsidiaries are defendants or putative defendants in a variety of legal proceedings, in the form of regulatory/government investigations as well as private, civil litigation and arbitration proceedings. The private, civil litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both government agencies and self-regulatory bodies. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation and involve a variety of claims (including common law tort, contract claims, securities, ERISA, and consumer protection claims). At times, these legal proceedings may present novel claims or legal theories.  On at least a quarterly basis, we assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings utilizing the latest information available. For those matters where it is probable that we will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements. These legal reserves may be increased or decreased to reflect any relevant developments on a quarterly basis. Where a loss is not probable or the amount of the loss is not estimable, we have not accrued legal reserves, consistent with applicable accounting guidance. Because the outcome of legal proceedings is inherently uncertain, based on information currently available to us, advice of counsel, and the availability of insurance coverage and indemnification from third parties, we believe that our established reserves are adequate and the liabilities arising from the legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the inherent uncertainty in legal proceedings there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution will not exceed established reserves. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter, or a combination of matters, may be material to our results of operation for a particular period, depending upon the size of the loss or our income for that particular period.
