Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2015 Form 10-K. Many proposed rules referenced in our prior reports remain pending. The following discussion provides a summary of recent regulatory developments relating to the Dodd-Frank Act or regulatory developments that relate to our results this quarter.Regulatory capital rulesIn October 2013, federal banking regulators published the final Basel III capital framework for U.S. banking organizations (the “Regulatory Capital Rules”). The Regulatory Capital Rules generally implement in the U.S. the Basel III capital framework published by the Basel Committee in December 2010 and revised in June 2011 and January 2014 (the “Basel III capital framework”). The Basel III capital framework and the U.S. implementation of the Basel III capital framework are discussed in more detail in Item 1. Business of our 2015 Form 10-K under the heading “Supervision and Regulation — Basel III capital and liquidity frameworks.”While the Regulatory Capital Rules became effective on January 1, 2014, the mandatory compliance date for Key as a “standardized approach” banking organization was January 1, 2015, subject to transitional provisions extending to January 1, 2019.New minimum capital and leverage ratio requirementsUnder the Regulatory Capital Rules, “standardized approach” banking organizations, like KeyCorp, are required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in Figure 4 below. At September 30, 2016, Key had an estimated Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 9.42% under the fully phased-in Regulatory Capital Rules. Also at September 30, 2016, based on the fully phased-in Regulatory Capital Rules, Key estimates that its capital and leverage ratios, after adjustment for market risk, would be as set forth in Figure 4.102Table of ContentsFigure 4.

The table reconciles the GAAP performance measure to the corresponding non-GAAP measure, which provides a basis for period-to-period comparisons.(b)Capital conservation buffer must consist of Common Equity Tier 1 capital. As a standardized approach banking organization, KeyCorp is not subject to the countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% imposed upon an advanced approaches banking organization under the Regulatory Capital Rules.(c)As a standardized approach banking organization, KeyCorp is not subject to the 3% supplemental leverage ratio requirement, which becomes effective January 1, 2018.Revised prompt corrective action capital category ratiosUnder the Regulatory Capital Rules, the prompt corrective action capital category threshold ratios applicable to FDIC-insured depository institutions such as KeyBank and First Niagara Bank were revised. Figure 5 identifies the capital category threshold ratios for a “well capitalized” and an “adequately capitalized” institution under the Regulatory Capital Rules.Figure 5.

Under the proposal, a large noncomplex BHC is one with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more but less than $250 billion, on-balance sheet foreign exposure of less than $10 billion, and nonbank assets of less than $75 billion. This would include KeyCorp.If the proposal is adopted as a final rule, it would considerably reduce the compliance burden associated with the Federal Reserve’s capital plan and stress test rules. Specifically, the proposal would relieve large noncomplex banking organizations (including KeyCorp) from the qualitative assessment portion of the Federal Reserve’s CCAR program and modify the reporting requirements for these organizations to collect less detailed information regarding stress test results and raise the materiality thresholds for specific portfolio reporting requirements. In addition, the proposed rule would further limit the amount of capital a banking organization may distribute in excess of the amount set forth in its capital plan without Federal Reserve approval (the de minimis exception), and establish a one-quarter blackout period during which a BHC would not be able to submit a notice to use the de minimis exception or seek prior approval to make a capital distribution in an amount that exceeds the de minimis exception level. The proposal also would establish reporting requirements for nonbank assets. 103Table of ContentsThe relief proposed for the qualitative assessment portion of the CCAR program would be effective for the 2017 CCAR cycle. The modified reporting requirements would take effect immediately upon adoption of a final rule or after a six-month delay. The proposed revisions to the de minimis exception and new one-quarter blackout period are expected to be effective during the second quarter of 2017. The comment period for the proposed rule expires on November 25, 2016. Liquidity coverage ratioThe federal banking agencies published the final Basel III liquidity framework for U.S. banking organizations (the “Liquidity Coverage Rules”) that create a minimum LCR for certain internationally active bank and nonbank financial companies (excluding KeyCorp) and a modified version of the LCR (“Modified LCR”) for BHCs and other depository institution holding companies with over $50 billion in consolidated assets that are not internationally active (including KeyCorp).Because KeyCorp is a Modified LCR BHC under the Liquidity Coverage Rules, it is required to maintain its ratio of high-quality liquid assets to its total net cash outflow amount, determined by prescribed assumptions in a standardized hypothetical stress scenario over a 30-calendar day period. Implementation for Modified LCR banking organizations, like KeyCorp, began on January 1, 2016, with a minimum requirement of 90% coverage, reaching 100% coverage by January 1, 2017. For the third quarter of 2016, our Modified LCR was above 100%. In the future, we may change the composition of our investment portfolio, increase the size of the overall investment portfolio, and/or modify product offerings to enhance or optimize our liquidity position.KeyBank and First Niagara Bank will not be subject to the LCR or the Modified LCR under the Liquidity Coverage Rules unless the OCC affirmatively determines that application to KeyBank and or First Niagara Bank is appropriate in light of their respective asset sizes, levels of complexity, risk profiles, scope of operations, affiliation with foreign or domestic covered entities, or risk to the financial system.Net stable funding ratioAs previously disclosed in the “Supervision and Regulation” section of Item 1. Business of our 2015 Form 10-K under the heading “Basel III capital and liquidity frameworks,” the Basel Committee finalized the Basel III net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) in October 2014. The Basel Committee published final Basel III NSFR disclosure standards in June 2015. In April and May 2016, the federal banking regulators issued an NPR proposing to implement the final Basel III NSFR and the final Basel III NSFR disclosure standards. The proposal would create a minimum NSFR for certain internationally active banking organizations (excluding KeyCorp) and a modified version of the NSFR for BHCs and other depository institution holding companies with over $50 billion in consolidated assets that are not internationally active (including KeyCorp). The proposal would also require quarterly quantitative and qualitative public disclosures regarding the NSFR. The proposed NSFR requirement would apply beginning on January 1, 2018. The comment period for the NPR expired on August 5, 2016.Recovery planningOn September 28, 2016, the OCC released final guidelines that establish standards for recovery planning by certain large OCC-regulated institutions, including KeyBank. The guidelines require such institutions to establish a comprehensive framework for evaluating the financial effects of severe stress events, and recovery actions an institution may pursue to remain a viable, going concern during a period of severe financial stress. Under the final guidelines, an institution’s recovery plan must include triggers to alert the institution of severe stress events, escalation procedures, recovery options, and a process for periodic review and approval by senior management and the board of directors. The recovery plan should be tailored to the complexity, scope of operations, and risk profile of the institution. Assuming that KeyBank has average total consolidated assets of greater than $100 billion but less than $750 billion as of January 1, 2017, it must be in compliance with the guidelines not later than January 1, 2018.Deposit insurance and assessmentsIn March 2015, the FDIC approved a final rule to impose a surcharge, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, on the quarterly deposit insurance assessments of insured depository institutions having total consolidated assets of at least $10 billion (like KeyBank and First Niagara Bank). The surcharge is 4.5 cents per $100 of the institution’s assessment base (after making certain adjustments). The final rule became effective on July 1, 2016. If the DIF reserve ratio reached 1.15% before that date, surcharges would begin July 1, 2016. If the reserve ratio had not reached 1.15% by that date, surcharges would begin the first quarter after the reserve ratio reaches 1.15%. On August 30, 2016, the FDIC announced that the reserve ratio reached 1.17% at the end of June 2016 - the highest level in more than eight years. As a result, FDIC-insured institutions with $10 billion or 104Table of Contentsmore in assets, like KeyBank and First Niagara Bank, will pay a surcharge effective July 1, 2016, to bring the reserve ratio to the statutory minimum of 1.35%. Surcharges will continue through the quarter that the DIF reserve ratio reaches or exceeds 1.35%, but not later than December 31, 2018. If the reserve ratio does not reach 1.35% by December 31, 2018 (provided it is at least 1.15%), the FDIC will impose a shortfall assessment on March 31, 2019, on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more (like KeyBank).In February 2016, the FDIC issued an NPR proposing to impose recordkeeping requirements on insured depository institutions with two million or more deposit accounts (including KeyBank) in order to facilitate rapid payment of insured deposits to customers if the institutions were to fail. The proposal would require such insured depository institutions (i) to maintain complete and accurate data on each depositor’s ownership interest by right and capacity for all of the institution’s deposit accounts and (ii) to develop the capability to calculate the insured and uninsured amounts for each deposit owner within 24 hours of failure. The FDIC would conduct periodic testing of covered institutions’ compliance with these requirements and such institutions would be required to file a deposit insurance coverage summary report with the FDIC annually. Compliance would be required two years after the effective date of a final rule. After being extended, the comment period for the NPR expired on June 25, 2016.Single counterparty credit limitsIn March 2016, the Federal Reserve issued an NPR proposing to establish single counterparty credit limits for BHCs with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. This proposal would implement a provision in the Dodd-Frank Act and replaces proposals on this subject issued by the Federal Reserve in 2011 and 2012. Under the proposal, a covered BHC (including KeyCorp) would not be allowed to have an aggregate net credit exposure to any unaffiliated counterparty that exceeds 25% of the consolidated capital stock and surplus of the covered BHC. G-SIBs and certain other large BHCs (excluding KeyCorp) would be subject to stricter limits under the proposal. A covered BHC such as KeyCorp would be required to comply with the proposed limits and quarterly reporting to show such compliance starting two years after the effective date of a final rule. The comment period for the NPR expired on June 3, 2016.ERISA fiduciary standardIn April 2016, the Department of Labor published final rules and amendments to certain prohibited transaction exemptions regarding which service providers would be regarded as fiduciaries under ERISA for making investment advice recommendations to: 1) certain retirement plan fiduciaries, participants or beneficiaries and 2) owners or beneficiaries of individual retirement accounts and health savings accounts, among other retirement plans. In sum, the rules intend to place fiduciary obligations, rather than the lesser legal obligations that currently apply, on these service providers. The rules subject any financial institution making recommendations for either the purchase or sale of investments in or rollover of the respective retirement plan to certain fiduciary obligations under ERISA such as an impartial conduct standard and not selling certain investment products whose compensation may raise a conflict of interest for the advisor without entering into a contract providing certain disclosures and legal remedies to the customer. The requirement of impartial conduct is effective April 10, 2017, and the contract provisions must be in place by January 1, 2018. Highlights of Our PerformanceFinancial performanceFor the third quarter of 2016, we announced net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $165 million, or $.16 per common share. Our third quarter of 2016 results compare to net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $216 million, or $.26 per common share, for the third quarter of 2015. During the third quarter of 2016, we incurred merger-related charges totaling $207 million, or $.14 per common share. No merger-related charges were incurred in the third quarter of 2015.The acquisition of First Niagara contributed approximately $175 million of net interest income in the third quarter of 2016, which included $19 million of related purchase accounting accretion. Third quarter 2016 net interest income was reduced by $6 million of one-time merger-related charges related to conforming accounting policies for leases.Our taxable-equivalent net interest income was $788 million for the third quarter of 2016, and the net interest margin was 2.85%, compared to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $598 million and a net interest margin of 2.87% for the third quarter of 2015. The net interest margin declined two basis points, reflecting higher levels of liquidity, partially offset by the benefit from the First Niagara acquisition. Excluding the impact of First Niagara and merger-related charges, net interest income increased 4% compared to the year-ago quarter, driven by higher earning asset balances. 105Table of ContentsThe acquisition of First Niagara contributed approximately $53 million of noninterest income in the third quarter of 2016, which was primarily attributable to service charges on deposit accounts, trust and investment services income, and cards and payments income. Additionally, third quarter 2016 reported noninterest income includes $12 million of merger-related charges, including losses from investment portfolio repositioning. For the full year of 2016, we will experience five months of First Niagara activity and expect further refinement of our purchase accounting marks and resulting accretion.Key’s noninterest income was $549 million for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $470 million for the year-ago quarter. Excluding the impact of First Niagara and merger-related charges discussed above, noninterest income increased $38 million, or 8%, primarily driven by a record quarter in investment banking and debt placement fees. Also benefiting the quarter was continued growth in cards and payments income, as well as service charges on deposit accounts. These increases were partially offset by lower corporate services income, net gains on principal investing and operating lease income and other leasing gains. For the full year of 2016, we will experience five months of First Niagara activity and expect investment banking and debt placement fees to be stable-to-slightly higher than the full year of 2015.Our noninterest expense was $1.1 billion for the third quarter of 2016, including $140 million related to the operations of First Niagara, which primarily impacted personnel expense, net occupancy, business services and professional fees and other expense. Additionally, noninterest expense included $189 million of merger-related charges, primarily made up of $97 million in personnel expense related to severance and technology development for systems conversions, as well as fully-dedicated personnel for merger and integration efforts. The remaining $92 million of merger-related charges were nonpersonnel expense, largely recognized in business services and professional fees, computer processing and other expense. No merger-related charges were incurred in the third quarter of 2015.Excluding the $140 million impact of First Niagara and $189 million of merger-related charges, noninterest expense was $29 million higher than the third quarter of last year. The increase was primarily driven by higher performance-based compensation, along with slight increases across various nonpersonnel line items, including FDIC assessment expense. These increases were partially offset by lower employee benefits expense. For the full year of 2016, we will experience five months of First Niagara activity and expect elevated levels of merger-related charges to continue.In the third quarter of 2016, the acquisition of First Niagara contributed approximately $15.4 billion of average loans, or $23 billion at period-end, impacting both the commercial and consumer loan portfolios. These results include the estimated fair value adjustment on the acquired portfolio of $686 million and the divestiture of $439 million of loans.Average loans were $77.7 billion for the third quarter of 2016, an increase of $18.4 billion compared to the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the impact of the First Niagara acquisition, average loans were $62.3 billion for the third quarter of 2016, an increase of $3 billion compared to the third quarter of 2015. The loan growth occurred primarily in the commercial, financial and agricultural portfolio, which increased $3.3 billion. Consumer loans declined $537 million, largely due to paydowns in Key’s home equity loan portfolio. In the third quarter of 2016, the acquisition of First Niagara contributed approximately $18.9 billion of average deposits, or $27.3 billion at period-end, which are spread across deposit products and consist primarily of consumer deposits. During the quarter, $1.6 billion of deposits were divested.Average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, totaled $94.9 billion for the third quarter of 2016, an increase of $24.9 billion compared to the year-ago quarter. Excluding the impact of First Niagara, average deposits increased $5.7 billion over the year-ago quarter. Interest-bearing deposits increased $5.9 billion driven by a $4.7 billion increase in NOW and money market deposit accounts and a $1.2 billion increase in certificates of deposits and other time deposits. The increase from the year-ago quarter reflects core deposit growth in our retail banking franchise and growth in escrow deposits from our commercial mortgage servicing business. Our provision for credit losses was $59 million for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $45 million for the third quarter of 2015 and $52 million for the second quarter of 2016. Our provision for credit losses in the third quarter of 2016 included $12 million related to the acquired credit card portfolio from First Niagara. Our allowance for loan and lease losses was $865 million, or 1.01% of total period-end loans, at September 30, 2016, compared to 1.31% at September 30, 2015. For the remainder of 2016, we expect the provision for credit losses to slightly exceed net loan charge-offs.106Table of ContentsNet loan charge-offs for the third quarter of 2016 totaled $44 million, or .23% of average total loans, including $2 million of net charge-offs related to First Niagara. These results compare to $41 million, or .27%, for the third quarter of 2015. For the remainder of 2016, we expect net loan charge-offs to remain relatively stable with the third quarter of 2016.At September 30, 2016, our nonperforming loans totaled $723 million, which represented .85% of period-end portfolio loans, and include $150 million of nonperforming loans related to First Niagara. These results compare to .67% at September 30, 2015. Nonperforming assets at September 30, 2016, totaled $760 million and represented .89% of period-end portfolio loans and OREO and other nonperforming assets, compared to $417 million, or .69% of period-end portfolio loans, at September 30, 2015.Our capital ratios remain strong. Our tangible common equity and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios at September 30, 2016, are 8.27% and 10.53%, respectively, compared to 9.90% and 10.87%, respectively, at September 30, 2015. In addition, our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio is 9.56% at September 30, 2016, compared to 10.47% at September 30, 2015. The declines from the year-ago quarter are primarily related to the acquisition of First Niagara. We continue to return capital to our shareholders by repurchasing common shares and through our quarterly common share dividend. In the third quarter of 2016, we completed $65 million of common share repurchases and paid a cash dividend of $.085 per common share, under our 2016 capital plan authorization.Figure 6 shows our continuing and discontinued operating results for the current, past, and year-ago quarters. Our financial performance for each of the past five quarters is summarized in Figure 1.Figure 6.

As a result of this decision, we have accounted for this business as a discontinued operation. For further discussion regarding the income (loss) from discontinued operations, see Note 12 (“Acquisition, Divestiture, and Discontinued Operations”).(b)EPS may not foot due to rounding.Figure 7 presents certain non-GAAP financial measures related to “tangible common equity,” “return on tangible common equity,” “Common Equity Tier 1,” “pre-provision net revenue,” certain financial measures excluding merger-related charges, and “cash efficiency ratio.”The tangible common equity ratio and the return on tangible common equity ratio have been a focus for some investors, and management believes these ratios may assist investors in analyzing Key’s capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and BHC capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. The Federal Reserve focuses its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 capital known as Common Equity Tier 1. Because the Federal Reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders’ equity (essentially Tier 1 risk-based capital less preferred stock and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in Tier 1 risk-based capital, this focus on Common Equity Tier 1 is consistent with existing capital adequacy categories. The Regulatory Capital Rules, described in more detail under the section “Supervision and regulation” in Item 2 of this report, also make Common Equity Tier 1 a priority. The Regulatory Capital Rules change the regulatory capital standards that apply to BHCs by, among other changes, phasing out the treatment of trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred securities as Tier 1 eligible capital. Starting in 2016, our trust preferred securities are only included in Tier 2 capital. Since analysts and banking regulators 107Table of Contentsmay assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity and Common Equity Tier 1, we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases. Figure 7 reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures.Figure 7 also shows the computation for and reconciliation of pre-provision net revenue, which is not formally defined by GAAP. We believe that eliminating the effects of the provision for credit losses makes it easier to analyze our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis.As disclosed in Note 2 ("Business Combination") and Note 12 (“Acquisition, Divestiture, and Discontinued Operations”), KeyCorp completed its purchase of First Niagara on August 1, 2016. The definitive agreement and plan of merger to acquire First Niagara was originally announced on October 30, 2015. As a result of this transaction, we’ve recognized merger-related charges. Figure 7 shows the computation of noninterest expense excluding merger-related charges and return on average assets from continuing operations excluding merger-related charges. We believe that eliminating the effects of the merger-related charges makes it easier to analyze our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis.The cash efficiency ratio is a ratio of two non-GAAP performance measures. Accordingly, there is no directly comparable GAAP performance measure. The cash efficiency ratio excludes the impact of our intangible asset amortization from the calculation. We also disclose the cash efficiency ratio excluding merger-related charges. We believe these ratios provide greater consistency and comparability between our results and those of our peer banks. Additionally, these ratios are used by analysts and investors as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis.Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.108Table of ContentsFigure 7.

OperationsNet interest incomeOne of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets (such as loans and securities) and loan-related fee income, and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. There are several factors that affect net interest income, including: •the volume, pricing, mix, and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities;•the volume and value of net free funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and equity capital;•the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk;•interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace; and•asset quality.To make it easier to compare results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets (some taxable, some not), we present net interest income in this discussion on a “taxable-equivalent basis” (i.e., as if it were all taxable and at the same rate). For example, $100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as $154, an amount that — if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% — would yield $100.Figure 8 shows our taxable-equivalent net interest income excluding the impact of merger-related charges and the impact of First Niagara during the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2016. Figure 9 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense, and their respective yields or rates over the past five quarters. This figure also presents a reconciliation of taxable-equivalent net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with GAAP for each of those quarters. The net interest margin, which is an indicator of the profitability of the earning assets portfolio less cost of funding, is calculated by dividing annualized taxable-equivalent net interest income by average earning assets.The acquisition of First Niagara contributed approximately $175 million of net interest income in the third quarter of 2016, which included $19 million of related purchase accounting accretion. Third quarter 2016 net interest income included an additional $6 million of one-time merger-related charges.Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $788 million for the third quarter of 2016, and the net interest margin was 2.85% compared to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $598 million and a net interest margin of 2.87% for the third quarter of 2015. The net interest margin declined two basis points, reflecting higher levels of liquidity, partly offset by the benefit from the First Niagara acquisition. Excluding the impact of First Niagara and merger-related charges, net interest income increased 4% compared to the year-ago quarter, driven by higher earning asset balances. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $239 million, and the net interest margin decreased by four basis points. The increase in net interest income reflects the First Niagara acquisition and growth in our core earning asset balances, while higher levels of liquidity contributed to the overall decline in the net interest margin.In the third quarter of 2016, the acquisition of First Niagara contributed approximately $15.4 billion of average loans, or $23 billion at period-end, impacting both the commercial and consumer loan portfolios. These results include the estimated fair value adjustment on the acquired portfolio of $686 million and the divestiture of $439 million of loans.Average loans were $77.7 billion for the third quarter of 2016, an increase of $18.4 billion compared to the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the impact of the First Niagara acquisition, average loans were $62.3 billion for the third quarter of 2016, an increase of $3 billion compared to the third quarter of 2015. The loan growth occurred primarily in the commercial, financial and agricultural portfolio, which increased $3.3 billion. Consumer loans declined $537 million, largely due to paydowns in Key’s home equity loan portfolio.Our securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities portfolios together averaged $24.2 billion in the third quarter of 2016, compared to $19.2 billion in the third quarter of 2015. The increase compared to both the year-ago quarter and prior 111Table of Contentsquarter primarily reflects the impact of the First Niagara acquisition, which added $4.7 billion of average investment securities, or $9 billion of securities at period-end. During the quarter, Key completed the planned sales and repositioning of First Niagara's portfolio to more closely align with Key's portfolio and investment philosophy. In the third quarter of 2016, the acquisition of First Niagara contributed approximately $18.9 billion of average deposits, or $27.3 billion at period-end, which are spread across deposit products and consist primarily of consumer deposits. During the quarter, $1.6 billion of deposits were divested.Average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, totaled $94.9 billion for the third quarter of 2016, an increase of $24.9 billion compared to the year-ago quarter. Excluding the impact of First Niagara, average deposits increased $5.7 billion over the year-ago quarter. Interest-bearing deposits increased $5.9 billion driven by a $4.7 billion increase in NOW and money market deposit accounts and a $1.2 billion increase in certificates of deposits and other time deposits. The increase from the year-ago quarter reflects core deposit growth in our retail banking franchise and growth in escrow deposits from our commercial mortgage servicing business. Figure 8.

Additionally, third quarter 2016 reported noninterest income includes $12 million of merger-related charges, including losses from investment portfolio repositioning.As shown in Figure 11, noninterest income was $549 million for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $470 million for the year-ago quarter. Excluding the impact of First Niagara and merger-related charges discussed above, noninterest income increased $38 million, or 8.1%, primarily driven by a record quarter in investment banking and debt placement fees. Also benefiting the quarter was continued growth in cards and payments income, as well as service charges on deposit accounts. These increases were partially offset by lower corporate services income, net gains on principal investing and operating lease income and other leasing gains. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, noninterest income increased $58 million, or 4.2%, from the same period one year ago. Excluding the $53 million impact of First Niagara and $12 million of merger-related charges, noninterest income increased $17 million, or 1.2%, from the same period one year ago. This increase was primarily driven by an increase of $7 million of investment banking and debt placement fees driven by a record quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees in the third quarter of 2016. Also benefiting the period was continued growth in cards and payments income, as well as service charges on deposit accounts. These increases were partially offset by lower net gains on principal investing and operating lease income and other leasing gains.115Table of ContentsFigure 11.

For the quarter ended September 30, 2015, income of $1 million related to fixed income, foreign exchange, interest rate, and commodity derivative trading was offset by losses related to equity securities trading and credit portfolio management activities.(b)The allocation between proprietary and nonproprietary is made based upon whether the trade is conducted for the benefit of Key or Key’s clients rather than based upon rulemaking under the Volcker Rule. For more information on prohibitions and restrictions imposed by the Volcker Rule, see the discussion under the heading “Other Regulatory Developments under the Dodd-Frank Act – ‘Volcker Rule’” in the section entitled “Supervision and Regulation” in Item 1 of our 2015 Form 10-K.The following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest income and the factors that caused those elements to change.Trust and investment services income Trust and investment services income is one of our largest sources of noninterest income and consists of brokerage commissions, trust and asset management commissions, and insurance income. The assets under management that primarily generate these revenues are shown in Figure 13. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, trust and investment services income increased $14 million, or 13.0%, and $13 million, or 4.0%, respectively, primarily due to the acquisition of First Niagara. A significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management. At September 30, 2016, our bank, trust, and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of $36.8 billion, compared to $35.2 billion at September 30, 2015. The increase in assets under management, as shown in Figure 13, was primarily attributable to the First Niagara acquisition.116Table of ContentsFigure 13.

Investment banking and debt placement fees increased $47 million, or 43.1%, for the third quarter of 2016, and $7 million, or 2.2%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods one year ago. These increases were related to strength in commercial mortgage banking, equity capital markets, and merger and acquisition advisory fees.Service charges on deposit accountsService charges on deposit accounts increased $17 million, or 25%, and $26 million, or 13.5%, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to the same periods one year ago. The increase from the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, was primarily due to the acquisition of First Niagara and higher overdraft and account analysis fees.Operating lease income and other leasing gainsOperating lease income and other leasing gains decreased $9 million, or 60%, for the third quarter of 2016, and $17 million, or 29.3%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same periods one year ago. These declines reflect $12 million of lease residual losses recognized in the third quarter of 2016. The expense related to the rental of leased equipment is presented in Figure 13 as “operating lease expense.”Corporate services incomeCorporate services income decreased $6 million, or 10.5%, from the year-ago quarter, and increased $11 million, or 7.7%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period one year ago. These increases were primarily due to the acquisition of First Niagara.Cards and payments incomeCards and payments income, which consists of debit card, consumer and commercial credit card, and merchant services income, increased $19 million, or 40.4%, from the year-ago quarter, and $28 million, or 20.6%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period one year ago. These increases were primarily due to the acquisition of First Niagara and higher purchase card, credit card, and ATM debit card fees driven by increased volume.Consumer mortgage incomeConsumer mortgage income increased $3 million, or 100%, from the year-ago quarter, and $1 million, or 10%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period one year ago. These increases were primarily due to the acquisition of First Niagara.Mortgage servicing feesMortgage servicing fees increased $4 million, or 36.4%, from the year-ago quarter, and $4 million, or 12.1%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period one year ago. These increases were primarily driven by the acquisition of First Niagara and increased service fee income on mortgage loans sold.117Table of ContentsOther income Other income, which consists primarily of gains on sales of loans held for sale, other service charges, and certain dealer trading income, decreased $3 million, or 27.3%, from the year-ago quarter, and increased $26 million, or 74.3%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period one year ago. These changes in other income were primarily attributable to changes in various miscellaneous income categories.Noninterest expenseAs shown in Figure 14, noninterest expense was $1.1 billion for the third quarter of 2016, including $140 million related to the operations of First Niagara, which was primarily attributable to personnel expense, net occupancy, business services and professional fees and other expense. Additionally, noninterest expense included $189 million of merger-related charges, primarily made up of $97 million in personnel expense related to severance and technology development for systems conversions, as well as fully-dedicated personnel for merger and integration efforts. The remaining $92 million of merger-related charges were nonpersonnel expense, largely recognized in business services and professional fees, computer processing and other expense. No merger-related charges were incurred in the third quarter of 2015.Excluding the $140 million impact of First Niagara and $189 million of merger-related charges, noninterest expense was $29 million higher than the third quarter of last year. The increase is primarily driven by higher performance-based compensation, along with slight increases across various nonpersonnel line items, including FDIC assessment expense. These increases were partially offset by lower employee benefits expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, noninterest expense increased $432 million, or 20.5%, compared to the same period one year ago. Noninterest expense included $140 million related to the operations of First Niagara which primarily impacted personnel expense, net occupancy, business services and professional fees and other expense.Additionally, noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, included $258 million of merger-related charges, primarily made up of $148 million in personnel expense related to severance and technology development for systems conversions, as well as fully-dedicated personnel for merger and integration efforts. The remaining $110 million of merger-related charges were nonpersonnel expense, largely recognized in business services and professional fees, computer processing and other expense.Excluding merger-related charges, noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $34 million higher than the same period one year ago. Personnel expense increased $54 million driven by higher performance-based compensation along with increases across various nonpersonnel line items including computer processing and FDIC assessment. These increases were partially offset by lower employee benefits expense and business services and professional fees.118Table of ContentsFigure 14.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, personnel expense increased $202 million, or 16.5%, from the same period one year ago. These increases were primarily attributable to the acquisition of First Niagara and higher-performance based compensation, partially offset by lower employee benefits expense119Table of ContentsFigure 16.

These increases were primarily due to the acquisition of First Niagara.Operating lease expenseOperating lease expense increased $4 million, or 36.4%, from the year-ago quarter, and $8 million, or 23.5%, from the nine-month period ended one year ago. These increases were due to increased depreciation expense on operating lease equipment. Income related to the rental of leased equipment is presented in Figure 11 as “operating lease income and other leasing gains.”Other expenseOther expense comprises various miscellaneous expense items. The $71 million, or 80.7%, increase in the current quarter and the $97 million, or 37.6%, increase in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods one year ago reflect the impact of the First Niagara acquisition, certain real estate investments, and other miscellaneous expenses.Income taxesWe recorded tax expense from continuing operations of $16 million for the third quarter of 2016 and $72 million for the third quarter of 2015. For the first nine months of 2016, we recorded tax expense from continuing operations of $141 million, compared to $230 million for the same period one year ago.Our federal tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate, primarily because we generate income from investments in tax-advantaged assets, such as corporate-owned life insurance, and credits associated with renewable energy and low-income housing investments. The tax expense for the third quarter of 2016 was also significantly reduced due to merger-related charges of $207 million. Excluding those expenses, the tax expense for the third quarter of 2016 was $93 million.Additional information pertaining to how our tax expense (benefit) and the resulting effective tax rates were derived is included in Note 12 (“Income Taxes”) beginning on page 184 of our 2015 Form 10-K.Line of Business ResultsThis section summarizes the financial performance and related strategic developments of our two major business segments (operating segments): Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. Note 19 (“Line of Business Results”) describes the products and services offered by each of these business segments, provides more detailed financial information pertaining to the segments, and explains “Other Segments” and “Reconciling Items.”120Table of ContentsFigure 17 summarizes the contribution made by each major business segment to our “taxable-equivalent revenue from continuing operations” and “income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Key” for the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015.Figure 17.

Key Community Bank summary of operations •Net income increased $29 million, or 39.2% from the year-ago quarter (up $11 million, or 14.9% excluding the impact of First Niagara)•Average deposits increased $18.2 billion, or 35.5% from the year-ago quarter (up $3.8 billion, or 7.4% excluding the impact of First Niagara)•Average loans increased $10.5 billion, or 33.9% from the year-ago quarter (up $206 million, or .7% excluding the impact of First Niagara)As shown in Figure 18, Key Community Bank recorded net income attributable to Key of $103 million for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $74 million for the year-ago quarter. First Niagara contributed $18 million of the growth year-over-year. Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $151 million, or 39.8%, from the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the impact of First Niagara, taxable-equivalent net interest income increased $27 million, primarily driven by deposit growth and higher interest rates. Noninterest income increased $49 million, or 24.5%, from the year-ago quarter. Excluding the impact of First Niagara, noninterest income increased $8 million, or 4%, related to positive trends in cards and payments income and service charges on deposit accounts. Investment banking and debt placement fees also increased from the year-ago period. These increases were partially offset by declines in trust and investment services and consumer mortgage income.The provision for credit losses increased by $19 million, or 105.6%, from the third quarter of 2015, primarily related to the acquired credit card portfolio from First Niagara. Excluding the impact of First Niagara, the provision for credit losses increased $3 million, or 16.6%, related to an increase in net loan charge-offs of $9 million from the same period one year ago. Noninterest expense increased by $134 million, or 30.2%, from the year-ago quarter. Excluding the impact of First Niagara, noninterest expense increased $14 million, or 3.1%, mostly driven by the implementation of an FDIC surcharge and increased marketing expense.121Table of ContentsFigure 18.

First Niagara contributed $14 million of the growth year-over year. Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $55 million, or 24.9%, compared to the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the impact of First Niagara, taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $18 million, or 8%, compared to the third quarter of 2015. Average loan and lease balances increased $8.1 billion, or 30.8%, from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by the First Niagara acquisition as well as growth in commercial, financial and agricultural loans. This loan growth was offset by spread compression due to higher funding costs. Average deposit balances increased $3.9 billion, or 20.7%, from the year-ago quarter, mostly driven by the First Niagara acquisition as well as growth in commercial escrow deposits. Noninterest income increased $44 million, or 18.9%, from the prior year. Excluding the impact of First Niagara, noninterest income increased $40 million, or 17%. This growth was mostly due to a record quarter for investment banking and debt placement fees, which were up $46 million, or 43%, related to strength in commercial mortgage banking, equity capital markets, and merger and acquisition advisory fees. The provision for credit losses decreased $5 million, or 16.7%, compared to the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the impact of First Niagara, the provision for credit losses decreased $7 million, or 22.2%. The decrease was mostly due to lower net loan charge-offs. Noninterest expense increased by $57 million, or 22.8%, from the third quarter of 2015. Excluding the impact of First Niagara, noninterest expense increased $39 million, or 15.4%. Personnel expense increased $32 million, or 26%, mostly due to increases in incentive compensation and salaries. Several other line items increased over the prior year, including operating lease, cards and payments, FDIC, and overhead expenses. Figure 19.

The balance at September 30, 2016, included $23 billion of loans that were acquired from First Niagara. The September 30, 2016, balance reflects the estimated fair value adjustment on the acquired portfolio of $686 million and the divestiture of $439 million of loans.Excluding the impact of the acquisition, total loans outstanding from continuing operations were $62.5 billion. The increase in our outstanding loans from continuing operations over the past twelve months results primarily from increased lending activity in our commercial, financial and agricultural and commercial mortgage portfolios. Loans related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business, which are excluded from total loans at September 30, 2016, December 31, 2015, and September 30, 2015, totaled $1.6 billion, $1.8 billion, and $1.9 billion, respectively.

Our commercial, financial and agricultural loans, also referred to as “commercial and industrial,” represented 46% of our total loan portfolio at September 30, 2016, 52% at December 31, 2015, and 52% at September 30, 2015, and is the largest component of our total loans. These loans are originated by both Key Corporate Bank and Key Community Bank and consist of fixed and variable rate loans to our large, middle market, and small business clients.Commercial, financial and agricultural loans increased $8.3 billion, or 26.8%, from the same period last year, with Key Corporate Bank increasing $4 billion, Key Community Bank up $4.5 billion, and Other Segments decreasing $185 million. We have experienced growth in new high credit quality loan commitments and utilization with clients in our middle market segment and Institutional and Capital Markets business. Our two largest industry classifications — commercial real estate and healthcare — increased by 12.4% and 25.5%, respectively, when compared to one year ago. The commercial real estate and healthcare industries represented approximately 11% and 9%, respectively, of the total commercial, financial and agricultural loan portfolio at September 30, 2016, and approximately 13% and 9%, respectively, at September 30, 2015. In addition, utilities and financial, which represented approximately 8% and 10%, respectively, of the commercial, financial and agricultural loan portfolio at September 30, 2016, increased 48.7% and 19.9%, respectively, from one year ago. The increases in our utilities and financial portfolios were due to the acquisition of First Niagara.Our oil and gas loan portfolio focuses on lending to middle market companies and represents approximately 1% of total loans outstanding at September 30, 2016. Our oil and gas portfolio represented $1.1 billion of outstanding commercial, financial and agricultural loans at September 30, 2016. In addition, the commercial real estate and commercial lease financing loan portfolios also included $41 million and $57 million, respectively, of outstanding oil and gas loans at September 30, 2016. We have nearly 15 years of experience in energy lending with over 20 specialists dedicated to this sector, focusing on middle market companies, which is aligned with our relationship strategy.The upstream segment, comprising oil and gas exploration and production, represents approximately 56% of our exposure, is primarily secured by oil and gas reserves, subject to a borrowing base, and is regularly stress-tested. The midstream segment, comprising mostly distribution companies, has lower exposure to commodity risk. Oil field services exposure is minimal and concentrated in very few borrowers. This mix was essentially unchanged from the prior year. Our total commitments in the oil and gas sector were approximately $3.1 billion at September 30, 2016.Commercial real estate loans. Our commercial real estate lending business is conducted through two primary sources: our 15-state banking franchise, and KeyBank Real Estate Capital, a national line of business that cultivates relationships with owners of commercial real estate located both within and beyond the branch system. This line of business deals primarily with nonowner-occupied properties (generally properties for which at least 50% of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties) and accounted for approximately 52% of our average year-to-date commercial real estate loans, compared to 67% one year ago. KeyBank Real Estate Capital generally focuses on larger owners and operators of commercial real estate.Commercial real estate loans totaled $17.2 billion at September 30, 2016, and $9.3 billion at September 30, 2015, and represented 20% and 15% of our total loan portfolio at September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015, respectively. The increase from September 30, 2016, was due to the acquisition of First Niagara. These loans, which include both owner- and nonowner-occupied properties, represented 28% and 21% of our commercial loan portfolio at September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015, respectively. We continue to de-risk the portfolio by changing our focus from developers to owners of completed and stabilized commercial real estate.Figure 21 includes commercial mortgage and construction loans in both Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. As shown in Figure 21, this loan portfolio is diversified by both property type and geographic location of the underlying collateral.As presented in Figure 21, at September 30, 2016, our commercial real estate portfolio included mortgage loans of $15 billion and construction loans of $2.2 billion, representing 18% and 3%, respectively, of our total loans. At September 30, 2016, nonowner-occupied loans represented 15% of our total loans and owner-occupied loans represented 5% of our total loans. The average size of mortgage loans originated during the third quarter of 2016 was $6.8 million, and our largest mortgage loan at September 30, 2016, had a balance of $68.6 million. At September 30, 2016, our average construction loan commitment was $8.5 million, our largest construction loan commitment was $48.2 million, and our largest construction loan amount outstanding was $30.6 million.Also shown in Figure 21, 76% of our commercial real estate loans at September 30, 2016, were for nonowner-occupied properties compared to 73% at September 30, 2015. Approximately 15% of these loans were construction loans at both September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015. Typically, these properties are not fully leased at the origination of the loan. The 126Table of Contentsborrower relies upon additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide the cash flow necessary to support debt service payments. A significant decline in economic growth, and in turn rental rates and occupancy, would adversely affect our portfolio of construction loans.Figure 21.

Our nonowner-occupied commercial real estate portfolio has increased by 94.1%, or approximately $6.3 billion, since September 30, 2015, due to the First Niagara acquisition. The increase also reflects many of our clients who have taking advantage of opportunities to permanently refinance their loans at historically low interest rates.Commercial lease financing. We conduct commercial lease financing arrangements through our KEF line of business and have both the scale and array of products to compete in the equipment lease financing business. Commercial lease financing receivables represented 8% of commercial loans at September 30, 2016, and 9% of commercial loans at September 30, 2015.Commercial loan modification and restructuringWe modify and extend certain commercial loans in the normal course of business for our clients. Loan modifications vary and are handled on a case-by-case basis with strategies responsive to the specific circumstances of each loan and borrower. In many cases, borrowers have other resources and can reinforce the credit with additional capital, collateral, guarantees, or other income sources.Modifications are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan credit quality while at the same time meeting our clients’ financing needs. Modifications made to loans of creditworthy borrowers not experiencing financial 127Table of Contentsdifficulties and under circumstances where ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt are not classified as TDRs. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, a loan is classified as a TDR only when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a creditor concession has been granted.Our concession types are primarily interest rate reductions, forgiveness of principal, and other modifications. Loan extensions are sometimes coupled with these primary concession types. Because economic conditions have improved modestly and we have restructured loans to provide the optimal opportunity for successful repayment by the borrower, certain of our restructured loans have returned to accrual status and consistently performed under the restructured loan terms over the past year.If loan terms are extended at less than normal market rates for similar lending arrangements, our Asset Recovery Group is consulted to help determine if any concession granted would result in designation as a TDR. Transfer to our Asset Recovery Group is considered for any commercial loan determined to be a TDR. During the first nine months of 2016, we had $50 million of new restructured commercial loans compared to $51 million of new restructured commercial loans during the first nine months of 2015.For more information on concession types for our commercial accruing and nonaccruing TDRs, see Note 5 (“Asset Quality”).Figure 22. Commercial TDRs by Accrual Status  in millionsSeptember 30, 2016June 30, 2016March 31, 2016December 31, 2015September 30, 2015Commercial TDRs by Accrual Status     Nonaccruing$67$33$50$52$57Accruing1820224Total Commercial TDRs$85$53$52$54$61      We often use an A-B note structure for our TDRs, breaking the existing loan into two tranches. First, we create an A note. Since the objective of this TDR note structure is to achieve a fully performing and well-rated A note, we focus on sizing that note to a level that is supported by cash flow available to service debt at current market terms and consistent with our customary underwriting standards. This note structure typically will include a debt coverage ratio of 1.2 or better of cash flow to monthly payments of market interest, and principal amortization of generally not more than 25 years. These metrics are adjusted from time to time based upon changes in long-term markets and “take-out underwriting standards” of our various lines of business. Appropriately sized A notes are more likely to return to accrual status, allowing us to resume recognizing interest income. As the borrower’s payment performance improves, these restructured notes typically also allow for an upgraded internal quality risk rating classification.The B note typically is a structurally subordinate note that may or may not require any debt service until the primary payment source stabilizes and generates excess cash flow. This excess cash flow customarily is captured for application to either the A note or B note dependent upon the terms of the restructure. We evaluate the B note when we consider returning the A note to accrual status. In many cases, the B note is charged off at the same time the A note is returned to accrual status in accordance with our interpretation of accounting and regulatory guidance applicable to TDRs. Alternatively, both A and B notes may be simultaneously returned to accrual if credit metrics are supportive.Restructured nonaccrual loans may be returned to accrual status based on a current, well-documented evaluation of the credit, which would include analysis of the borrower’s financial condition, prospects for repayment under the modified terms, and alternate sources of repayment such as the value of loan collateral. We consider the borrower’s ability to perform under the modified terms for a reasonable period (generally a minimum of six months) before returning the loan to accrual status. Sustained historical repayment performance prior to the restructuring also may be taken into account. The primary consideration for returning a restructured loan to accrual status is the reasonable assurance that the full contractual principal balance of the loan and the ongoing contractually required interest payments will be fully repaid. Although our policy is a guideline, considerable judgment is required to review each borrower’s circumstances.All loans processed as TDRs, including A notes and any non-charged-off B notes, are reported as TDRs during the calendar year in which the restructure took place. At September 30, 2016, we had $85 million of A note commercial TDRs. We did not have any B note commercial TDRs at September 30, 2016.Additional information regarding TDRs is provided in Note 5 (“Asset Quality”).128Table of ContentsExtensions. Project loans typically are refinanced into the permanent commercial loan market at maturity, but they are often modified and extended. Extension terms take into account the specific circumstances of the client relationship, the status of the project, and near-term prospects for the client, the repayment source, and the collateral. In all cases, pricing and loan structure are reviewed and, where necessary, modified to ensure the loan has been priced to achieve a market rate of return and loan terms that are appropriate for the risk. Typical enhancements include one or more of the following: principal pay down, increased amortization, additional collateral, increased guarantees, and a cash flow sweep. Some maturing loans have automatic extension options built in; in those cases, pricing and loan terms cannot be altered.Loan pricing is determined based on the strength of the borrowing entity, the strength of the guarantor, if any, and the structure and residual risk of the transaction. Therefore, pricing for an extended loan may remain the same because the loan is already priced at or above current market.We do not consider loan extensions in the normal course of business (under existing loan terms or at market rates) as TDRs, particularly when ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt and no concession has been made. In the case of loan extensions where either collection of all principal and interest is uncertain or a concession has been made, we would analyze such credit under the applicable accounting guidance to determine whether it qualifies as a TDR. Extensions that qualify as TDRs are measured for impairment under the applicable accounting guidance. Guarantors. We conduct a detailed guarantor analysis (1) for all new extensions of credit, (2) at the time of any material modification/extension, and (3) typically annually, as part of our on-going portfolio and loan monitoring procedures. This analysis requires the guarantor entity to submit all appropriate financial statements, including balance sheets, income statements, tax returns, and real estate schedules.While the specific steps of each guarantor analysis may vary, the high-level objectives include determining the overall financial conditions of the guarantor entities, including size, quality, and nature of asset base; net worth (adjusted to reflect our opinion of market value); leverage; standing liquidity; recurring cash flow; contingent and direct debt obligations; and near-term debt maturities.Borrower and guarantor financial statements are required at least annually within 90-120 days of the calendar/fiscal year end. Income statements and rent rolls for project collateral are required quarterly. We may require certain information, such as liquidity, certifications, status of asset sales or debt resolutions, and real estate schedules, to be provided more frequently.We routinely seek performance from guarantors of impaired debt if the guarantor is solvent. We may not seek to enforce the guaranty if we are precluded by bankruptcy or we determine the cost to pursue a guarantor exceeds the value to be returned given the guarantor’s verified financial condition. We often are successful in obtaining either monetary payment or the cooperation of our solvent guarantors to help mitigate loss, cost, and the expense of collections.Mortgage and construction loans with a loan-to-value ratio greater than 1.0 are accounted for as performing loans. These loans were not considered impaired due to one or more of the following factors: (i) underlying cash flow adequate to service the debt at a market rate of return with adequate amortization; (ii) a satisfactory borrower payment history; and (iii) acceptable guarantor support. As of September 30, 2016, we did not have any mortgage and construction loans that had a loan-to-value ratio greater than 1.0.Consumer loan portfolioConsumer loans outstanding increased by $8.3 billion, or 52.7%, from one year ago, largely due to the acquisition of First Niagara, partially offset by paydowns in our home equity loan portfolio.The home equity portfolio is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio. Approximately 99% of this portfolio at September 30, 2016, was originated from our Key Community Bank within our 15-state footprint. The remainder of the portfolio, which has been in an exit mode since the fourth quarter of 2007, was originated from the Consumer Finance line of business and is now included in Other Segments. Home equity loans in Key Community Bank increased by $2.3 billion, or 22%, over the past twelve months, primarily due to the acquisition of First Niagara.As shown in Figure 17, we held the first lien position for approximately 55% of the Key Community Bank home equity portfolio at September 30, 2016, and 60% at September 30, 2015. For consumer loans with real estate collateral, we track borrower performance monthly. Regardless of the lien position, credit metrics are refreshed quarterly, including recent Fair Isaac Corporation scores as well as original and updated loan-to-value ratios. This information is used in establishing the 129Table of ContentsALLL. Our methodology is described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses” beginning on page 122 of our 2015 Form 10-K.At September 30, 2016, 45% of our home equity portfolio was secured by second lien mortgages. On at least a quarterly basis, we continue to monitor the risk characteristics of these loans when determining whether our loss estimation methods are appropriate.Figure 23 summarizes our home equity loan portfolio at the end of each of the last five quarters, as well as certain asset quality statistics and yields on the portfolio as a whole.Figure 23.

Most of these sales came from the held-for-sale portfolio; however, $100 million of these loan sales related to the held-to-maturity portfolio.Loan sales classified as held for sale generated net gains of $92 million in the first nine months of 2016 and are included in “investment banking and debt placement fees” and “other income” on the income statement.Among the factors that we consider in determining which loans to sell are: •our business strategy for particular lending areas;•whether particular lending businesses meet established performance standards or fit with our relationship banking strategy;•our A/LM needs;•the cost of alternative funding sources;•the level of credit risk;•capital requirements; and•market conditions and pricing.Figure 24 summarizes our loan sales for the first nine months of 2016 and all of 2015.130Table of ContentsFigure 24.

Additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in Note 16 (“Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) under the heading “Recourse agreement with FNMA.”We derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold. We earn noninterest income (recorded as “mortgage servicing fees”) from fees for servicing or administering loans. This fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets. In addition, we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing of commercial real estate loans.SecuritiesOur securities portfolio totaled $29.5 billion at September 30, 2016, compared to $19.1 billion at December 31, 2015, and $19.3 billion at September 30, 2015. Available-for-sale securities were $20.5 billion at September 30, 2016, compared to $14.2 billion at December 31, 2015, and $14.4 billion at September 30, 2015. Held-to-maturity securities were $9 billion at September 30, 2016, compared to $4.9 billion at December 31, 2015, and $4.9 billion at September 30, 2015. The acquisition of First Niagara contributed $9 billion of securities at September 30, 2016.As shown in Figure 26, all of our mortgage-backed securities, which include both securities available for sale and held-to-maturity securities, are issued by government-sponsored enterprises or GNMA and traded in liquid secondary markets. These securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value for the available-for-sale portfolio and at cost for the held-to-maturity portfolio. For more information about these securities, see Note 6 (“Fair Value Measurements”) under the heading “Qualitative Disclosures of Valuation Techniques,” and Note 7 (“Securities”).131Table of ContentsFigure 26.

CMOs are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities. These mortgage securities generate interest income, serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements, and provide liquidity value under regulatory requirements. At September 30, 2016, we had $20.3 billion invested in CMOs and other mortgage-backed securities in the available-for-sale portfolio, compared to $14.2 billion at December 31, 2015, and $14.3 billion at September 30, 2015.We periodically evaluate our securities available-for-sale portfolio in light of established A/LM objectives, changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio, the regulatory environment, and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. These evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning.In addition, the size and composition of our securities available-for-sale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required (or elect) to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits. Although we generally use debt securities for this purpose, other assets, such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit, are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles.Our investing activities continue to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs. Our actions to not reinvest the monthly security cash flows at various times provide the liquidity necessary to address our funding requirements. These funding requirements include ongoing loan growth and occasional debt maturities. At other times, we may make additional investments that go beyond the replacement of maturities or mortgage security cash flows as our liquidity position and/or interest rate risk management strategies may require. Lastly, our focus on investing in high quality liquid assets, including GNMA-related securities, is related to liquidity management strategies to satisfy regulatory requirements.Figure 27 shows the composition, yields, and remaining maturities of our securities available for sale.

They include direct investments (investments made in a particular company) as well as indirect investments (investments made through funds that include other investors). Principal investments are predominantly made in privately held companies and are carried at fair value. The fair value of the direct investments was $27 million at September 30, 2016, $69 million at December 31, 2015, and $66 million at September 30, 2015, while the fair value of the indirect investments was $173 million at September 30, 2016, $235 million at December 31, 2015, and $271 million at September 30, 2015. Under the requirements of the Volcker Rule, we will be required to dispose of some or all of our indirect principal investments. The Federal Reserve extended the conformance period to July 21, 2017, for all banking entities with respect to covered funds. Key is permitted to file for an additional extension of up to five years for illiquid funds, to retain the indirect investments for a longer period of time. We plan to continue to evaluate our options, including applying for the extension and holding the investments. Additional information about this investment is provided in the “Principal investments” section of Note 6 (“Fair Value Measurements”). For more information about the Volcker Rule, see the discussion in Item 1 under the heading “Other Regulatory Developments under the Dodd-Frank Act — ‘Volcker Rule’” in the section entitled “Supervision and Regulation” beginning on page 17 of our 2015 Form 10-K.In addition to principal investments, “other investments” include other equity and mezzanine instruments, such as certain real-estate-related investments and an indirect ownership interest in a partnership, that are carried at fair value, as well as other types of investments that generally are carried at cost. The real-estate-related investments were valued at $8 million at both September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, and $9 million at September 30, 2015. The indirect investment in a partnership was valued at $4 million at September 30, 2015. Under the requirements of the Volcker Rule, we were required to dispose of this investment, which was redeemed prior to December 31, 2015. Additional information pertaining to the equity investment is included in the “Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis” section of Note 6 ("Fair Value Measurements").Most of our other investments are not traded on an active market. We determine the fair value at which these investments should be recorded based on the nature of the specific investment and all available relevant information. This review may encompass such factors as the issuer’s past financial performance and future potential, the values of public companies in comparable businesses, the risks associated with the particular business or investment type, current market conditions, the nature and duration of resale restrictions, the issuer’s payment history, our knowledge of the industry, third-party data, and other relevant factors. During the first nine months of 2016, net gains from our principal investing activities (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) totaled $16 million, which includes $57 million of net unrealized losses. These amounts are recorded as “net gains (losses) from principal investing” on the income statement. Additional information regarding these investments is provided in Note 6 ("Fair Value Measurements").Deposits and other sources of fundsDomestic deposits are our primary source of funding. The composition of our average deposits is shown in Figure 9 in the section entitled “Net interest income.” During the third quarter of 2016, average domestic deposits were $94.9 billion and represented 86% of the funds we used to support loans and other earning assets, compared to $70 billion and 84% during the third quarter of 2015. The acquisition of First Niagara contributed $18.9 billion of average deposits which are spread across deposit products and consist primarily of consumer deposits. During the quarter, $1.6 billion of deposits were divested.Excluding the impact of First Niagara, average deposits increased $5.7 billion over the year-ago quarter. Interest-bearing deposits increased $5.9 billion driven by a $4.7 billion increase in NOW and money market deposit accounts and a $1.2 billion increase in certificates of deposits and other time deposits. The increase from the year-ago quarter reflects core deposit growth in our retail banking franchise and growth in escrow deposits from our commercial mortgage servicing business. Wholesale funds, consisting of deposits in our foreign office and short-term borrowings, averaged $1.8 billion during the third quarter of 2016, compared to $1.9 billion during the third quarter of 2015. The change from the third quarter of 2015 was caused by declines of $492 million in foreign office deposits and $281 million in federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements, partially offset by an increase of $619 million in bank notes and other short-term borrowings.134Table of ContentsCapitalAt September 30, 2016, our shareholders’ equity was $15 billion, up $4.3 billion from December 31, 2015. The following sections discuss certain factors that contributed to this change. For other factors that contributed to the change, see the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity and Note 18 ("Shareholders' Equity").CCAR and capital actions As part of its ongoing supervisory process, the Federal Reserve requires BHCs like KeyCorp to submit an annual comprehensive capital plan and to update that plan to reflect material changes in the BHC’s risk profile, business strategies, or corporate structure, including but not limited to changes in planned capital actions. In April 2016, we submitted to the Federal Reserve and provided to the OCC our 2016 capital plan under the annual CCAR process. On June 29, 2016, the Federal Reserve announced that it did not object to our 2016 capital plan. Share repurchases of up to $350 million were included in the 2016 capital plan, which is effective through the second quarter of 2017. As previously reported, we resumed our share repurchase program under the 2016 capital plan following the close of the First Niagara acquisition. We completed $65 million of common share repurchases in the third quarter of 2016, including repurchases to offset issuances of common shares under our employee compensation plans. DividendsAs previously reported, our 2015 capital plan proposed an increase in our quarterly common share dividend from $.075 to $.085 per share, which was approved by our Board in May 2016. An additional potential increase in our quarterly common share dividend, up to $.095 per share, will be considered by the Board for the second quarter of 2017, consistent with the 2016 capital plan. Further information regarding the capital planning process and CCAR is included under the heading “Regulatory capital and liquidity” in the “Supervision and Regulation” section beginning on page 10 of our 2015 Form 10-K.Consistent with the 2016 capital plan, we made a dividend payment of $.085 per share, or $72 million, on our common shares during the third quarter of 2016.We also made a quarterly dividend payment of $1.9375 per share, or $5.6 million, on our Series A Preferred Stock during the third quarter of 2016.Common shares outstandingOur common shares are traded on the NYSE under the symbol KEY with 42,629 holders of record at September 30, 2016. Our book value per common share was $12.78 based on 1.1 billion shares outstanding at September 30, 2016, compared to $12.51 per common share based on 835.8 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2015, and $12.47 per common share based on 835.3 million shares outstanding at September 30, 2015. At September 30, 2016, our tangible book value per common share was $10.14, compared to $11.22 per common share at December 31, 2015, and $11.17 per common share at September 30, 2015.Figure 29 shows activities that caused the change in outstanding common shares over the past five quarters.Figure 29.

Going forward we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stock-based compensation awards and for other corporate purposes.135Table of ContentsInformation on repurchases of common shares by KeyCorp is included in Part II, Item 2. “Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds” of this report.Capital adequacyCapital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance. All of KeyCorp's capital ratios remained in excess of regulatory requirements at September 30, 2016. Our capital and liquidity levels are intended to position us to weather an adverse credit cycle while continuing to serve our clients’ needs, as well as to meet the Regulatory Capital Rules described in the “Supervision and regulation” section of Item 2 of this report. Our shareholders’ equity to assets ratio was 11.04% at September 30, 2016, compared to 11.30% at December 31, 2015, and 11.22% at September 30, 2015. Our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.27% at September 30, 2016, compared to 9.98% at December 31, 2015, and 9.90% at September 30, 2015.The capital modifications mandated by the Regulatory Capital Rules, which became effective on January 1, 2015, for KeyCorp, require higher and better-quality capital and introduced a new capital measure, “Common Equity Tier 1.” The Rules phased outthe treatment of certain capital securities and cumulative preferred securities as eligible Tier 1 capital. The phase-out period, which began January 1, 2015, for standardized approach banking organizations such as KeyCorp, resulted in our trust preferred securities issued by the KeyCorp capital trusts being treated only as Tier 2 capital starting in 2016. The new minimum capital and leverage ratios under the Regulatory Capital Rules together with the estimated ratios of KeyCorp at September 30, 2016, calculated on a fully phased-in basis, are set forth under the heading “New minimum capital and leverage ratio requirements” in the “Supervision and regulation” section in Item 2 of this report.As of January 1, 2016, KeyCorp (and its banking subsidiaries) were each required to maintain, on a consolidated basis, a minimum Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0%, and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. At September 30, 2016, our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, and Tier 1 leverage ratio were 10.53%, 12.63%, and 10.22%, respectively, compared to 11.35%, 12.97%, and 10.72%, respectively, at December 31, 2015, and 10.87%, 12.47%, and 10.68%, respectively, at September 30, 2015. Information regarding the regulatory capital ratios of KeyCorp’s banking subsidiaries is presented annually, in KeyCorp’s 10-K.Common Equity Tier 1 is not formally defined by GAAP and is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. Figure 7 in the “Highlights of Our Performance” section reconciles Key shareholders’ equity, the GAAP performance measure, to Common Equity Tier 1, the corresponding non-GAAP measure. Beginning with the implementation of the Regulatory Capital Rules, deferred tax assets that arise from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are deductible from Common Equity Tier 1 on a phase-in basis. As of September 30, 2016, this balance was $1 million. As of January 1, 2016, KeyCorp (and its banking subsidiaries) were each required to maintain, on a consolidated basis, a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%. At September 30, 2016, our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 9.56%.136Table of ContentsFigure 30.

The most significant risks we face are credit, compliance, operational, liquidity, market, reputation, strategic, and model risks. Our risk management activities are focused on ensuring we properly identify, measure, and manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability. Certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section.The Board serves in an oversight capacity ensuring that Key’s risks are managed in a manner that is effective and balanced and adds value for the shareholders. The Board understands Key’s risk philosophy, approves the risk appetite, inquires about risk practices, reviews the portfolio of risks, compares the actual risks to the risk appetite, and is apprised of significant risks, both actual and emerging, and determines whether management is responding appropriately. The Board challenges management and ensures accountability.137Table of ContentsThe Board’s Audit Committee assists the Board in oversight of financial statement integrity, regulatory and legal requirements, independent auditors’ qualifications and independence, and the performance of the internal audit function and independent auditors. The Audit Committee meets with management and approves significant policies relating to the risk areas overseen by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has responsibility over all risk review functions, including internal audit, as well as financial reporting, legal matters, and fraud risk. The Audit Committee also receives reports on enterprise risk. In addition to regularly scheduled bi-monthly meetings, the Audit Committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases.The Board’s Risk Committee assists the Board in oversight of strategies, policies, procedures, and practices relating to the assessment and management of enterprise-wide risk, including credit, market, liquidity, model, operational, compliance, reputation, and strategic risks. The Risk Committee also assists the Board in overseeing risks related to capital adequacy, capital planning, and capital actions. The Risk Committee reviews and provides oversight of management’s activities related to the enterprise-wide risk management framework, which includes review of the ERM Policy, including the Risk Appetite Statement, and management and ERM reports. The Risk Committee also approves any material changes to the charter of the ERM Committee and significant policies relating to risk management.The Audit and Risk Committees meet jointly, as appropriate, to discuss matters that relate to each committee’s responsibilities. Committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting. All members of the Board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months.Our ERM Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer and comprising other senior level executives, is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite. The ERM Program encompasses our risk philosophy, policy, framework, and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company. The ERM Committee reports to the Board’s Risk Committee. Annually, the Board reviews and approves the ERM Policy, as well as the risk appetite, including corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories. We use a risk-adjusted capital framework to manage risks. This framework is approved and managed by the ERM Committee.Tier 2 Risk Governance Committees support the ERM Committee by identifying early warning events and trends, escalating emerging risks, and discussing forward-looking assessments. Risk Governance Committees include attendees from each of the Three Lines of Defense. The First Line of Defense is the Line of Business primarily responsible to accept, own, proactively identify, monitor, and manage risk. The Second Line of Defense comprises Risk Management representatives who provide independent, centralized oversight over all risk categories by aggregating, analyzing, and reporting risk information. Risk Review, our internal audit function, provides the Third Line of Defense in their role to provide independent assessment and testing of the effectiveness, appropriateness, and adherence to KeyCorp’s risk management policies, practices, and controls.The Chief Risk Officer ensures that relevant risk information is properly integrated into strategic and business decisions, ensures appropriate ownership of risks, provides input into performance and compensation decisions, assesses aggregate enterprise risk, monitors capabilities to manage critical risks, and executes appropriate Board and stakeholder reporting.Federal banking regulators continue to emphasize with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution. We believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks and conform to regulatory expectations.Market risk managementMarket risk is the risk that movements in market risk factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, credit spreads, and volatilities will reduce Key’s income and the value of its portfolios. These factors influence prospective yields, values, or prices associated with the instrument. For example, the value of a fixed-rate bond will decline when market interest rates increase, while the cash flows associated with a variable rate loan will increase when interest rates increase. The holder of a financial instrument is exposed to market risk when either the cash flows or the value of the instrument is tied to such external factors.We are exposed to market risk both in our trading and nontrading activities, which include asset and liability management activities. Our trading positions are carried at fair value with changes recorded in the income statement. These positions are subject to various market-based risk factors that impact the fair value of the financial instruments in the trading category. Our traditional banking loan and deposit products as well as long-term debt and certain short-term borrowings are nontrading positions. These positions are generally carried at the principal amount outstanding for assets and the amount owed for liabilities. The nontrading positions are subject to changes in economic value due to varying market conditions, primarily changes in interest rates.138Table of ContentsTrading market riskKey incurs market risk as a result of trading, investing, and client facilitation activities, principally within our investment banking and capital markets businesses. Key has exposures to a wide range of interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and commodity prices, as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads. Our primary market risk exposures are a result of trading activities in the derivative and fixed income markets and maintaining positions in these instruments. We maintain modest trading inventories to facilitate customer flow, make markets in securities, and hedge certain risks. The majority of our positions are traded in active markets.Management of trading market risks. Market risk management is an integral part of Key’s risk culture. The Risk Committee of our Board provides oversight of trading market risks. The ERM Committee and the Market Risk Committee regularly review and discuss market risk reports prepared by our MRM that contain our market risk exposures and results of monitoring activities. Market risk policies and procedures have been defined and approved by the Market Risk Committee, a Tier 2 Risk Governance Committee, and take into account our tolerance for risk and consideration for the business environment.The MRM is an independent risk management function that partners with the lines of business to identify, measure, and monitor market risks throughout our company. The MRM is responsible for ensuring transparency of significant market risks, monitoring compliance with established limits, and escalating limit exceptions to appropriate senior management. The various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well-managed and prudent. Market risk is monitored through various measures, such as VaR, and through routine stress testing, sensitivity, and scenario analyses. The MRM conducts stress tests for each covered position using historical worst case and standard shock scenarios. VaR, stressed VaR, and other analyses are prepared daily and distributed to appropriate management.Covered positions. We monitor the market risk of our covered positions, which includes all of our trading positions as well as all foreign exchange and commodity positions, regardless of whether the position is in a trading account. All positions in the trading account are recorded at fair value, and changes in fair value are reflected in our consolidated statements of income. Information regarding our fair value policies, procedures, and methodologies is provided in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Fair Value Measurements” on page 124 of our 2015 Form 10-K and Note 6 (“Fair Value Measurements”) in this report. Instruments that are used to hedge nontrading activities, such as bank-issued debt and loan portfolios, equity positions that are not actively traded, and securities financing activities, do not meet the definition of a covered position. The MRM is responsible for identifying our portfolios as either covered or non-covered. The Covered Position Working Group develops the final list of covered positions, and a summary is provided to the Market Risk Committee.Our significant portfolios of covered positions are detailed below. We analyze market risk by portfolios of covered positions, and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type. The descriptions below incorporate the respective risk types associated with each of these portfolios. •Fixed income includes those instruments associated with our capital markets business and the trading of securities as a dealer. These instruments may include positions in municipal bonds, bonds backed by the U.S. government, agency and corporate bonds, certain mortgage-backed securities, securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, money markets, and certain CMOs. The activities and instruments within the fixed income portfolio create exposures to interest rate and credit spread risks.•Interest rate derivatives include interest rate swaps, caps, and floors, which are transacted primarily to accommodate the needs of commercial loan clients. In addition, we enter into interest rate derivatives to offset or mitigate the interest rate risk related to the client positions. The activities within this portfolio create exposures to interest rate risk.•Credit derivatives generally include credit default swap indexes, which are used to manage the credit risk exposure associated with anticipated sales of certain commercial real estate loans. The transactions within the credit derivatives portfolio result in exposure to counterparty credit risk and market risk.VaR and stressed VaR. VaR is the estimate of the maximum amount of loss on an instrument or portfolio due to adverse market conditions during a given time interval within a stated confidence level. Stressed VaR is used to assess extreme conditions on market risk within our trading portfolios. MRM calculates VaR and stressed VaR on a daily basis, and the results are distributed to appropriate management. VaR and stressed VaR results are also provided to our regulators and utilized in regulatory capital calculations.We use a historical VaR model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions. Historical scenarios are customized for specific covered positions, and numerous risk factors are incorporated in the calculation. Additional consideration is given to the risk factors to estimate the exposures that contain optionality features, such as options and cancelable provisions. VaR is calculated 139Table of Contentsusing daily observations over a one-year time horizon, and approximates a 95% confidence level. Statistically, this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than VaR, on average, five out of 100 trading days, or three to four times each quarter. We also calculate VaR and stressed VaR at a 99% confidence level.The VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of possible gains and losses on our covered positions. However, there are limitations inherent in the VaR model since it uses historical results over a given time interval to estimate future performance. Historical results may not be indicative of future results, and changes in the market or composition of our portfolios could have a significant impact on the accuracy of the VaR model. We regularly review and enhance the modeling techniques, inputs and assumptions used. Our market risk policy includes the independent validation of our VaR model by Key’s Risk Management Group on an annual basis. The Model Risk Management Committee oversees the Model Validation Program, and results of validations are discussed with the ERM Committee.Actual losses for the total covered positions did not exceed aggregate daily VaR on any day during the quarters ended September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015. The MRM backtests our VaR model on a daily basis to evaluate its predictive power. The test compares VaR model results at the 99% confidence level to daily held profit and loss. Results of backtesting are provided to the Market Risk Committee. Backtesting exceptions occur when trading losses exceed VaR.We do not engage in correlation trading, or utilize the internal model approach for measuring default and credit migration risk. Our net VaR approach incorporates diversification, but our VaR calculation does not include the impact of counterparty risk and our own credit spreads on derivatives.The aggregate VaR at the 99% confidence level for all covered positions was $1.1 million at September 30, 2016, and $1.3 million at September 30, 2015. The decrease in aggregate VaR was primarily due to the decreased exposure in our fixed income and equity portfolios. Figure 31 summarizes our VaR at the 99% confidence level for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015. During these periods, none of our significant portfolios daily trading VaR numbers exceeded their VaR limits or stress VaR limits.Figure 31.

Figure 32 summarizes our stressed VaR for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015, as used for market risk capital charge calculation purposes.Figure 32.

Market risk is a component of our internal capital adequacy assessment. Our risk-weighted assets include a market risk-equivalent asset position, which consists of a VaR component, stressed VaR component, a de minimis exposure amount, and a specific risk add-on, which are added together to arrive at total market risk equivalent assets. Specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments, which is not accounted for by changes in broad market risk factors and is measured through a standardized approach. Specific risk calculations are run quarterly by the MRM, and approved by the Chief Market Risk Officer.140Table of ContentsNontrading market riskMost of our nontrading market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations and its impacts on our traditional loan and deposit products, as well as investments, hedging relationships, long-term debt, and certain short-term borrowings. Interest rate risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the EVE. Such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. We manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the EVE in accordance with our risk appetite and within Board-approved policy limits.Interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of customer preferences for loan and deposit products, economic conditions, the competitive environment within our markets, changes in market interest rates that affect client activity, and our hedging, investing, funding, and capital positions. The primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of reprice risk, basis risk, yield curve risk, and option risk.The management of nontrading market risk is centralized within Corporate Treasury. The Risk Committee of our Board provides oversight of nontrading market risk. The ERM Committee and the ALCO review reports on the components of interest rate risk described above as well as sensitivity analyses of these exposures. These committees have various responsibilities related to managing nontrading market risk, including recommending, approving, and monitoring strategies that maintain risk positions within approved tolerance ranges. The A/LM policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of interest rate risk and is administered by the ALCO. Internal and external emerging issues are monitored on a daily basis. The MRM, as the second line of defense, provides additional oversight.•“Reprice risk” is the exposure to changes in the level of interest rates and occurs when the volume of interest-bearing liabilities and the volume of interest-earning assets they fund (e.g., deposits used to fund loans) do not mature or reprice at the same time.•“Basis risk” is the exposure to asymmetrical changes in interest rate indexes and occurs when floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities reprice at the same time, but in response to different market factors or indexes.•“Yield curve risk” is the exposure to non-parallel changes in the slope of the yield curve (where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity) and occurs when interest-bearing liabilities and the interest-earning assets that they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve.•“Option risk” is the exposure to a customer or counterparty’s ability to take advantage of the interest rate environment and terminate or reprice one of our assets, liabilities, or off-balance sheet instruments prior to contractual maturity without a penalty. Option risk occurs when exposures to customer and counterparty early withdrawals or prepayments are not mitigated with an offsetting position or appropriate compensation.Net interest income simulation analysis. The primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis. For purposes of this analysis, we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on- and off-balance sheet positions, accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity. The analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments, including a most likely macro-economic scenario. Simulation modeling assumes that residual risk exposures will be managed to within the risk appetite and Board-approved policy limits.We measure the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if the federal funds target rate were to gradually increase or decrease over the next 12 months, and term rates were to move in a similar direction, although at a slower pace. Our standard rate scenarios encompass a gradual increase or decrease of 200 basis points, but due to the low interest rate environment, we have modified the standard decrease scenario to a gradual decrease of 50 basis points over three months with no change over the following nine months. After calculating the amount of net interest income at risk to interest rate changes, we compare that amount with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment. We also perform regular stress tests and sensitivities on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments. One set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of interest rate inputs on simulated exposures. Assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve, including steepening or flattening of the yield curve, changes in credit spreads, an immediate parallel change in market interest rates, and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates. Another set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of loan and deposit assumptions and assumed discretionary strategies on simulated exposures. Assessments are performed on changes to the following assumptions: 141Table of Contentsthe pricing of deposits without contractual maturities; changes in lending spreads; prepayments on loans and securities; other loan and deposit balance shifts; investment, funding and hedging activities; and liquidity and capital management strategies.Simulation analysis produces only a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on judgments related to assumption inputs into the simulation model. We tailor assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled, and validate those assumptions on a regular basis. Our simulations are performed with the assumption that interest rate risk positions will be actively managed through the use of on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments to achieve the desired residual risk profile. However, actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition, customer behavior, product pricing, market interest rates, investment, funding and hedging activities, and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events.Figure 33 presents the results of the simulation analysis at September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015. At September 30, 2016, our simulated exposure to changes in interest rates was moderately asset sensitive, and net interest income would benefit over time from either an increase in short-term or intermediate-term interest rates. Tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual increase or decrease in short-term interest rates over the next 12 months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 4%. In December 2015, the Federal Reserve increased the range for the federal funds target rate, which led to an increased modeled exposure to declining interest rates. Subsequent to the Federal Reserve’s action in December, we increased the magnitude of the declining rate scenario to 50 basis points, increasing our overall modeled exposure. The modeled exposure depends on the relationships of interest rates on our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, notably on instruments that are expected to react to the short end of the yield curve. As shown in Figure 33, we are operating within these levels as of September 30, 2016.Figure 33. Simulated Change in Net Interest Income September 30, 2016  Basis point change assumption (short-term rates)-50+200Tolerance level-4.00 %-4.00 %Interest rate risk assessment-2.73 %1.96 %September 30, 2015  Basis point change assumption (short-term rates)-25+200Tolerance level-4.00 %-4.00 %Interest rate risk assessment-.54 %2.39 %The results of additional sensitivity analysis of alternate interest rate paths and loan and deposit behavior assumptions indicate that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results presented in Figure 33. Net interest income is highly dependent on the timing, magnitude, frequency, and path of interest rate increases and the associated assumptions for deposit repricing relationships, lending spreads, and the balance behavior of transaction accounts. The unprecedented low level of interest rates increases the uncertainty of assumptions for deposit balance behavior and deposit repricing relationships to market interest rates. Recent balance growth in deposits has caused the uncertainty in assumptions to increase further. Our historical deposit repricing betas in the last rising rate cycle ranged between 50% and 60% for interest-bearing deposits, and we continue to make similar assumptions in our modeling. The sensitivity testing of these assumptions supports our confidence that actual results are likely to be within a 100 basis point range of modeled results.We will continue to monitor balance sheet flows and expect the benefit from rising rates to increase modestly prior to any increase in the federal funds rate. Our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume, mix, maturity, and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows. As changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy, management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile.We also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a three-year horizon. These simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a 12-month horizon. To capture longer-term exposures, we calculate exposures to changes of the EVE as discussed in the following section.Economic value of equity modeling. EVE complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond 12-, 24-, and 36-month horizons. EVE modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates, measuring the resulting change in the values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, and comparing those amounts with the base case of the current interest rate environment. Because the calculation of EVE under an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest rates in the current low rate environment results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than 200 basis point decrease in certain 142Table of Contentsyield curve term points, we have modified the standard declining rate scenario to an immediate 100 basis point decrease. This analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with non-contractual maturities. Those assumptions are based on historical behaviors, as well as our expectations. We develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our EVE will decrease by more than 15% in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates. We are operating within these guidelines as of September 30, 2016.Management of interest rate exposure. We use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate A/LM strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures. Specifically, we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities, issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates, and using derivatives — predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps, which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities.Figure 34 shows all swap positions that we hold for A/LM purposes. These positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. For example, fixed-rate debt is converted to a floating rate through a “receive fixed/pay variable” interest rate swap. The volume, maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader A/LM objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile, see Note 8 (“Derivatives and Hedging Activities”).Figure 34.

Liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions.Governance structureWe manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis. This approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity, as well as each entity’s capacity to manage through adverse conditions. The approach also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding.The management of consolidated liquidity risk is centralized within Corporate Treasury. Oversight and governance is provided by the Board, the ERM Committee, the ALCO, and the Chief Risk Officer. The Asset Liability Management Policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of liquidity risk and is administered by the ALCO. The MRM, as the second line of defense, provides additional oversight. Our current liquidity risk management practices are in compliance with the Federal Reserve Board’s Enhanced Prudential Standards and the OCC’s Heightened Standards for Large Insured National Banks.These committees regularly review liquidity and funding summaries, liquidity trends, peer comparisons, variance analyses, liquidity projections, hypothetical funding erosion stress tests, and goal tracking reports. The reviews generate a discussion of positions, trends, and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of our decisions. When liquidity pressure is elevated, 143Table of Contentspositions are monitored more closely and reporting is more intensive. To ensure that emerging issues are identified, we also communicate with individuals inside and outside of the company on a daily basis.Factors affecting liquidityOur liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events. An example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency. Examples of indirect events (events unrelated to us) that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war, natural disasters, political events, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund or hedge fund. Similarly, market speculation, or rumors about us or the banking industry in general, may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources.Following our announced acquisition of First Niagara in October 2015, S&P and Fitch affirmed Key’s ratings but changed the outlook to negative. Moody’s placed Key’s ratings under review for downgrade. On July 13, 2016, Moody’s subsequently confirmed Key’s ratings and changed the outlook from negative to stable, concluding their review.Our credit ratings at September 30, 2016, are shown in Figure 35. We believe these credit ratings, under normal conditions in the capital markets, will enable KeyCorp or KeyBank to issue fixed income securities to investors. As a result of the First Niagara acquisition on August 1, 2016, the credit ratings of First Niagara Bank were changed to match the credit ratings of KeyBank.Figure 35.

Liquidity risk is also derived from our deposit gathering activities and the ability of our customers to withdraw funds that do not have a stated maturity or to withdraw funds before their contractual maturity. The assessments of liquidity risk are measured under the assumption of normal operating conditions as well as under a stressed environment. We manage these exposures in accordance with our risk appetite, and within Board-approved policy limits.We regularly monitor our liquidity position and funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of hypothetical scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding. In the normal course of business, we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both KeyCorp and KeyBank. In a “heightened monitoring mode,” we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently, and use assumptions to reflect the changed market environment. Our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies. Hypothetical erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods. Ultimately, they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations. To compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures, we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed.We maintain a Contingency Funding Plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis. The plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions. It also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for managing liquidity through a problem period. As part of the plan, we maintain on-balance sheet liquid reserves referred to as our liquid asset portfolio, which consists of high quality liquid assets. During a problem period, that reserve could be used as a source of 144Table of Contentsfunding to provide time to develop and execute a longer-term strategy. The liquid asset portfolio at September 30, 2016, totaled $21.3 billion, consisting of $18.8 billion of unpledged securities, $466 million of securities available for secured funding at the FHLB, and $2 billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our Federal Reserve account. The liquid asset portfolio can fluctuate due to excess liquidity, heightened risk, or prefunding of expected outflows, such as debt maturities. Additionally, as of September 30, 2016, our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was $16.5 billion at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and $5.5 billion at the FHLB of Cincinnati. During the third quarter of 2016, Key’s outstanding FHLB of Cincinnati advances were reduced by $3.9 million due to repayments.Final U.S. liquidity coverage ratioUnder the Liquidity Coverage Rules, we are required to calculate the Modified LCR for Key. Implementation for Modified LCR banking organizations, like Key, began on January 1, 2016, with a minimum requirement of 90% coverage, reaching 100% coverage by January 1, 2017. For the third quarter of 2016, our Modified LCR was above 100%. In the future, we may change the composition of our investment portfolio, increase the size of the overall investment portfolio, and/or modify product offerings to enhance or optimize our liquidity position.Additional information about the Liquidity Coverage Ratio is included in the “Supervision and regulation” section under the heading “Liquidity coverage ratio” in Item 2 of this report.Long-term liquidity strategyOur long-term liquidity strategy is to be predominantly funded by core deposits. However, we may use wholesale funds to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio, meet daily cash demands, and allow management flexibility to execute business initiatives. Key’s client-based relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base that, in conjunction with intermediate and long-term wholesale funds managed to a diversified maturity structure and investor base, supports our liquidity risk management strategy. We use the loan-to-deposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies. Our target loan-to-deposit ratio, which we calculate as total loans, loans held for sale, and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by total deposits, is 90-100% (at September 30, 2016, our loan-to-deposit ratio was 85%).Sources of liquidityOur primary sources of liquidity include customer deposits, wholesale funding, and liquid assets. If the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances, we rely on wholesale funding or on-balance sheet liquid reserves. Conversely, excess cash generated by operating, investing, and deposit-gathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets.Liquidity programsWe have several liquidity programs, which are described in Note 18 (“Long-Term Debt”) beginning on page 208 of our 2015 Form 10-K, that are designed to enable KeyCorp and KeyBank to raise funds in the public and private debt markets. The proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. These liquidity programs are reviewed from time to time by the Board and are renewed and replaced as necessary. There are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs.On August 22, 2016, KeyBank issued $500 million of 1.60% Senior Bank Notes due August 22, 2019, under its Global Bank Note Program.On September 9, 2016, KeyCorp issued $525 million of depositary shares, each representing a 1/25th ownership interest in a share of our fixed-to-floating rate perpetual noncumulative Series D Preferred Stock. Our Series D Preferred Stock has a $1 par value with a $25,000 liquidation preference.Liquidity for KeyCorp The primary source of liquidity for KeyCorp is from subsidiary dividends, primarily from KeyBank. KeyCorp has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt; support customary corporate operations and activities (including acquisitions); support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries’ obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, and without adverse consequences; and pay dividends to shareholders.145Table of ContentsWe use a parent cash coverage months metric as the primary measure to assess parent company liquidity. The parent cash coverage months metric measures the months into the future where projected obligations can be met with the current amount of liquidity. KeyCorp generally issue term debt to supplement dividends from KeyBank to manage our liquidity position at or above our targeted levels. The parent company generally maintains cash and short-term investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over at least the next 24 months. At September 30, 2016, KeyCorp held $3 billion in short-term investments, which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations, including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our risk tolerance.Typically, KeyCorp meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from KeyBank and other non-bank subsidiaries, supplemented with term debt. Federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval. A national bank’s dividend-paying capacity is affected by several factors, including net profits (as defined by statute) for the two previous calendar years and for the current year, up to the date of dividend declaration. During the third quarter of 2016, KeyBank paid $125 million in dividends to KeyCorp, while other non-bank subsidiaries paid $50 million in dividends to KeyCorp. As of September 30, 2016, KeyBank had regulatory capacity to pay $678 million in dividends to KeyCorp without prior regulatory approval.Our liquidity position and recent activityOver the past quarter, our liquid asset portfolio, which includes overnight and short-term investments, as well as unencumbered, high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios, has increased as a result of an increase in unpledged securities and net customer loan and deposit flows. The liquid asset portfolio continues to exceed the amount that we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a longer-term solution.From time to time, KeyCorp or KeyBank may seek to retire, repurchase, or exchange outstanding debt, capital securities, preferred shares, or common shares through cash purchase, privately negotiated transactions or other means. During the quarter, KeyCorp redeemed $21 million of Trust Preferred securities that we acquired in the First Niagara acquisition.
