Item 1A: Risk Factors in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.    Any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of subsequent events or circumstances. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider all risks and uncertainties disclosed in our SEC filings, including our reports on Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q and our registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, all of which are accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov and at www.Key.com/IR.     Economic overview  During the second quarter of 2011, the economic recovery in the United States lost momentum. Job creation in the U.S. slowed as employers added 260,000 jobs in the second quarter of 2011, compared to the 497,000 jobs created in the first quarter of 2011. The average unemployment rate for the quarter rose to 9.1%, compared to the first quarter average of 8.9%. Despite the modest increase in the unemployment rate during the second quarter, the 9.1% rate is an improvement from the average rate of 9.6% seen for all of 2010. The 10 year average unemployment rate as of June 2011 was 6.3%.  Economic growth also faced headwinds from the earthquake in Japan in March 2011 and elevated food and energy prices. Production was delayed in many industries due to supply chain disruptions ongoing in Japan. The auto industry was especially impacted, and total U.S. auto sales for the second quarter declined by nearly 7% compared to the first quarter of the year. The average monthly rate of total consumer spending was unchanged in the second quarter of 2011, compared to an average monthly increase of .6% in the first quarter of 2011 and .4% for all of 2010. In the aggregate, consumer prices increased 3.6% for the twelve months ending in June 2011, up from the 2.7% and 1.5% annual increases at March 2011 and December 2010 respectively. Energy costs continued to contribute to the recent increase, as the national average price for a regular gallon of gasoline in the U.S. was nearly 30% higher at the end of June 2011 than a year earlier.  The persistence of a weak housing market continued to weigh on consumer wealth and confidence in the second quarter of 2011. June existing home sales were down 8.8% from the same month last year, while the median price of existing homes rose by only .8% over the same period. A continued high level of new foreclosures pressured existing home prices. Although foreclosures fell by 29% in June from a year earlier, they still remain at historically high levels. New home building activity showed some signs of improvement, although off of extremely low levels. June new home sales were up 1.6% from the same month a year ago, while the median price of new homes rose by 7.2% over the same period. Building activity also picked up as housing starts at the end of the quarter rose 16.7% from a year earlier.  Benchmark term interest rates ended the second quarter much lower, as renewed fears of a stalling economic recovery and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe emerged. These uncertainties sparked a flight to quality that sent the benchmark two-year Treasury yield down .37% from .83% at March 31, 2011 to .46% at June 30, 2011. The ten-year Treasury yield, which began the quarter at 3.47%, declined .31% to close the quarter at 3.16%. The Federal Reserve acknowledged the weakness in the economy and kept the federal funds target rate near zero in the second quarter of 2011 while maintaining its stance that the current economic conditions warrant keeping the rate at an exceptionally low level for an extended period. During the quarter, the Federal Reserve also continued to expand its holdings of Treasury securities as part of a round of quantitative easing originally announced in November 2010 and completed at the end of the second quarter of 2011. The Federal Reserve also maintained its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings, but offered no new accommodative policy, as it saw the economic soft patch largely as temporary and expected an economic rebound in the second half of 2011.     Long-term financial goals  Our long-term financial goals are as follows:     ¨   Target a loan to core deposit ratio range of 90% to 100%.      ¨   Return to a moderate risk profile by targeting a net charge-off ratio range of .40% to .50%.    63    Table of Contents    ¨   Grow high quality and diverse revenue streams by targeting a net interest margin in excess of 3.50% and ratio of noninterest income to total revenue of greater than 40%.      ¨   Create positive operating leverage and target an efficiency ratio in the range of 60 to 65%.      ¨   Achieve a return on average assets in the range of 1.00% to 1.25%.    Figure 1 shows the evaluation of our long-term financial goals for the second quarter of 2011.  Figure 1.

Strategic developments  We initiated the following actions during the first six months of 2011 to support our corporate strategy described in the “Introduction” section under the “Corporate Strategy” heading on page 30 of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.     ¨   During the second quarter of 2011, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $.03 per Common Share or $.12 on an annualized basis. This is a result of our return to sustained profitability, disciplined capital and expense management, and continued improvement in credit quality.      ¨   As previously reported, Key completed the repurchase of the $2.5 billion of Series B Preferred Stock and corresponding warrant issued to the U.S. Treasury Department. As a result of the repurchase, we recorded a $49 million one-time deemed dividend in the first quarter of 2011 related to the remaining difference between the repurchase price and the carrying value of the preferred shares at the time of repurchase. Beginning with the second quarter of 2011, the repurchase resulted in the elimination of quarterly dividends of $31 million and discount amortization of $4 million, or $140 million on an annual basis, related to these preferred shares. In total, Key paid $2.867 billion to the U.S. Treasury during the investment period in the form of dividends, principal and repurchase of the warrant, resulting in a return to the U.S. Treasury of $367 million above the initial investment of $2.5 billion on November 14, 2008.      ¨   During the second quarter of 2011, we continued to benefit from improved asset quality. Nonperforming assets declined $1.1 billion, and nonperforming loans decreased by $861 million from the year-ago quarter to $950 million and $842 million, respectively. Net charge-offs declined $301 million from the second quarter of 2010 to $134 million, or 1.11%, of average loan balances for the second quarter of 2011.      ¨   Our capital accounts remain strong with a Tier 1 common equity ratio of 11.14%, our loan loss reserves were adequate at 2.57% to period-end loans and we were core funded with a loan to deposit ratio of 86% at June 30, 2011.    64    Table of Contents    ¨   As of June 30, 2011, we had achieved $320 million of annual run-rate savings, placing us within our targeted savings goal of $300 million to $375 million. These savings were part of a formal corporate-wide initiative named Keyvolution, which is focused on business simplification, process improvement and demand management. Although the formal reporting of this initiative has concluded, we will continue to seek additional cost savings in this challenging revenue environment. However, we will not be reporting specifically on Keyvolution going forward as we consider the philosophy of Keyvolution to be a part of our normal operating rhythm. Instead, we will continue to manage our expenses and focus on delivering solutions that our clients value. In this regard we have established a target efficiency ratio of 60 — 65%. For the second quarter of 2011, our efficiency ratio was 66%.       Demographics  We have two major business segments: Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank.  Key Community Bank serves individuals and small to mid-sized businesses by offering a variety of deposit, investment, lending, and personalized wealth management products and services. These products and services are provided through our relationship managers and specialists residing in our 14-state branch network, which is organized into three internally defined geographic regions: Rocky Mountains and Northwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast.  Figure 2 shows the geographic diversity of Key Community Bank’s average deposits, commercial loans and home equity loans.  Figure 2.

Key Corporate Bank includes three lines of business that operate nationally, within and beyond our 14-state branch network.  The Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services business consists of two business units. Real Estate Capital professionals are located in select markets across the country and provide lending, debt placements, servicing, and equity and investment banking services to developers, brokers and owner investors dealing primarily with nonowner-occupied properties. This business unit is a Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriter and Servicer, Freddie Mac Program Plus Seller/Servicer and FHA-approved mortgagee. KeyBank Real Estate Capital is also one of the nation’s largest and highest rated commercial mortgage servicers. Figure 21, which appears later in this report in the “Loans and loans held for sale” section, shows the diversity of our commercial real estate lending business based on industry type and location. Corporate Banking Services provides cash management, interest rate derivatives, and foreign exchange products and services to clients served by Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. Through its Public Sector and Financial Institutions businesses, Corporate Banking Services also provides a full array of commercial banking products and services to government and not-for-profit entities and to community banks. A variety of cash management services are provided through the Global Treasury Management unit.  Equipment Finance is one of the largest bank-based equipment finance providers based in the U.S. This business unit meets the equipment leasing needs of companies worldwide and provides equipment manufacturers, distributors and resellers with funding options for their clients. Equipment finance specializes in the technology, healthcare, and renewable energy markets as well as other capital assets.  The Institutional and Capital Markets business consists of two business units. KeyBanc Capital Markets provides commercial lending, treasury management, investment banking, derivatives, foreign exchange, equity and debt underwriting and trading, and syndicated finance products and services. This business unit focuses primarily on emerging and middle-market companies in the Industrial, Consumer, Real Estate, Energy, Technology and Healthcare sectors. Our clients benefit from  65    Table of Contents  this business unit’s focused industry expertise and its consistent, integrated team approach, which helps our clients achieve their strategic objectives. Victory Capital Management is an investment advisory firm that manages or offers advice regarding investment portfolios. This business unit’s national client base consists of both institutional and retail clients derived from four primary channels: public plans, Taft-Hartley plans, corporations, and endowments and foundations.  Additional information regarding the products and services offered by our Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank segments are described further in this report in Note 16 (“Line of Business Results”).     Supervision and Regulation     Regulatory Reform Developments  On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. This Act is intended to address perceived deficiencies and gaps in the regulatory framework for financial services in the United States, reduce the risks of bank failures and better equip the nation’s regulators to guard against or mitigate any future financial crises, and manage systemic risk through increased supervision of systemically important financial companies (including nonbank financial companies). The Dodd-Frank Act implements numerous and far-reaching changes across the financial landscape affecting financial companies, including banks and bank holding companies such as Key. For a review of the various measures being taken as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, we refer to the risk-factor on page 12 in Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Many of the rulemakings required by the various regulatory agencies are still in the process of being developed and/or implemented. The following provides a summary of pertinent regulatory developments relating to the Dodd-Frank Act as well as other regulatory matters.     Interchange Fees  As previously reported, the Federal Reserve approved Regulation II, Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing (“Regulation II”), which limits debit card issuer interchange fees for electronic debit transactions and implements provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Regulation II reduces the maximum allowable interchange fee per transaction to $.21, plus a fraud allowance of five (5) basis points on the transaction value, and provides for an additional $.01 fraud prevention adjustment to the interchange fee for issuers that meet certain fraud prevention requirements. If interchange fees are set at the maximum amount allowed by Regulation II and we receive the fraud adjustment amount, we estimate that the impact on our debit interchange revenue stream will be an annualized decline of approximately $50 million to $60 million before any potential offsets from other fees or cost mitigation that may be implemented.  Based upon our review of the interim final rule and existing guidance, we currently believe we will be eligible to receive the fraud prevention adjustment. Our debit interchange revenue for the first six months of 2011 was $55 million. The relevant portions of Regulation II are effective October 1, 2011.     Regulation E pursuant to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978  For a discussion of final rules regarding Regulation E relating to the charging of overdraft fees and the estimated impact on our revenue, we refer you to the discussion of “Regulation E pursuant to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978” on page 32 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. For the first six months of 2011 deposit service charge income reflects the full impact to Key of the change in Regulation E. Compared to the same period last year, service charge income on deposit accounts is down $19 million or 12.2% which is consistent with our expectations.     Joint Proposed Rule on Incentive Compensation  On April 14, 2011, seven U.S. federal financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC, the Federal Office of Thrift Supervision, the National Credit Union Administration, the SEC and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, proposed a joint rule to implement the Dodd-Frank Act requirement that these agencies prohibit, at any financial institution with consolidated assets of at least $1 billion, incentive pay that they determine encourages inappropriate risks. Comments on the proposed joint rule were due by May 31, 2011.     Comprehensive Capital Plan  In November 2010, the Federal Reserve issued Revised Temporary Addendum to Supervisory Letter SR 09-4. This letter outlines specific criteria the Federal Reserve will consider when evaluating proposed capital actions by the 19 largest U.S. banking institutions that participated in the SCAP, including KeyCorp. These include actions such as increasing dividends,  66    Table of Contents  implementing common stock repurchase programs, or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments more broadly. The Federal Reserve is required to assess the capital adequacy of the 19 largest BHCs based upon a review of each BHC’s comprehensive capital plan. On January 7, 2011 we submitted our Comprehensive Capital Plan to the Federal Reserve. On March 18, 2011, the Federal Reserve informed us that it had no objections to the capital actions set forth in our Comprehensive Capital Plan following its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”). On June 10, 2011, we submitted to the Federal Reserve and provided to the OCC an updated Comprehensive Capital Plan, which set forth additional capital actions related to redemptions of certain outstanding capital securities. On August 1, 2011, the Federal Reserve informed us that it had no objections to the capital actions set forth in our updated capital plan. For a discussion of our capital actions, see the “Capital” section.     Capital Plan Proposal  On June 17, 2011, the Federal Reserve published in the Federal Register a proposed ruled on capital plans.  The proposal, which would amend Regulation Y, would require top-tier U.S. bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or greater to submit annual capital plans for review. According to the proposal, the capital plan review builds on the CCAR conducted earlier this year on the 19 largest financial institutions, and aims to ensure that institutions have robust, forward-looking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress.  Under the proposal, as part of the capital plan reviews, the Federal Reserve would evaluate institutions’ plans to make capital distributions, such as increasing dividend payments or repurchasing or redeeming stock. In some cases, such as when the Federal Reserve has previously objected to a capital plan, the institution would be required to receive approval from the Federal Reserve before making capital distributions. The proposal would institutionalize the recently completed CCAR exercise. The CCAR involved a forward-looking analysis of the capital plans at the 19 largest U.S. BHCs. The CCAR followed the SCAP, a standardized stress test led by the Federal Reserve in 2009. The Federal Reserve indicated in its proposal that as of March 31, 2011, thirty-five financial institutions would be affected by this proposal. Comments on the proposal were due by August 5, 2011.     Proposed Joint Guidance on Stress Testing  On June 15, 2011, the OCC, the Federal Reserve, and the FDIC published in the Federal Register proposed joint guidance on stress testing for banking organizations with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, including KeyBank and KeyCorp. The proposed joint guidance outlines high-level principles for stress testing practices, applicable to all Federal Reserve-supervised, FDIC-supervised, and OCC-supervised banking organizations with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets. The proposed guidance highlights the importance of stress testing as an ongoing risk management practice that supports a banking organization’s forward-looking assessment of its risks. Comments were due by July 29, 2011.     Systemically Important Financial Companies  On July 15, 2011, the FDIC published in the Federal Register a final rule implementing certain provisions of the orderly liquidation authority sections under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule is intended to establish a more comprehensive framework for the implementation of the FDIC’s orderly liquidation authority and will provide greater transparency to the process for the orderly liquidation of systemically important financial companies under the Dodd-Frank Act. The FDIC has also proposed a rule concerning the calculation of the maximum obligation that the FDIC may incur in connection with the liquidation of such covered companies under Title II of the Dodd-Frank Act.  Additional rules have been proposed by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve related to the requirement in the Dodd-Frank Act that systemically important financial companies create a “living will” and provide such living will to the FDIC and the Federal Reserve for review, and also related to the requirement that covered financial companies file quarterly reports with the FDIC and the Federal Reserve concerning the nature and extent of credit exposures between these companies and other significant financial companies.     Consumer Financial Protection Bureau  The Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), which consolidated most federal consumer financial protection authority with one office. The CFPB has rulemaking, supervision and enforcement powers, including the authority to examine certain bank or non-bank providers of consumer financial products and services, including KeyBank and certain other Key subsidiaries. The CFPB has the authority to promulgate rules to prohibit unfair, deceptive or  67    Table of Contents  abusive practices with respect to consumer financial products and services, as well as to promulgate new rulemakings under existing consumer financial statutes, e.g., Truth in Lending Act. The CFPB officially opened on July 21, 2011.     Critical accounting policies and estimates  Our business is dynamic and complex. Consequently, we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies. These choices are critical: not only are they necessary to comply with GAAP, they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance. All accounting policies are important, and all policies described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) on page 99 of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance.  In our opinion, some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility. These policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance, or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. Because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances, they may prove to be inaccurate, or we may find it necessary to change them.  We rely heavily on the use of judgment, assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions, including accounting for the allowance for loan and lease losses; contingent liabilities, guarantees and income taxes; derivatives and related hedging activities; and assets and liabilities that involve valuation methodologies. In addition, we may employ outside valuation experts to assist us in determining fair values of certain assets and liabilities. A brief discussion of each of these areas appears on pages 34 through 37 of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  At June 30, 2011, $21.6 billion, or 24%, of our total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Approximately 96% of these assets, before netting adjustments, were classified as Level 1 or Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. At June 30, 2011, $1.8 billion, or 2%, of our total liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Substantially all of these liabilities were classified as Level 1 or Level 2.  At June 30, 2011, $189 million, or .2%, of our total assets were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Approximately 10% of these assets were classified as Level 1 or Level 2. At June 30, 2011, there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  In addition, the education lending securitization trusts assets and liabilities were included on the balance sheet at June 30, 2011 at fair value, in the amount of $3.1 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, as a result of their consolidation on January 1, 2010.  During the first six months of 2011, we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates.     Highlights of Our Performance  Financial performance  For the second quarter of 2011, we announced net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $243 million, or $.26 per common share. Our second quarter 2011 results compare to net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $56 million, or $.06 per common share, for the second quarter of 2010. The second quarter 2011 results reflect an improvement in noninterest expense and lower credit costs from the same period one-year ago. Second quarter 2011 net income attributable to Key common shareholders was $234 million compared to net income attributable to Key common shareholders of $29 million for the same quarter one year ago.  For the six-month period ended June 30, 2011, net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders was $427 million, or $.46 per common share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $42 million, or $.05 per common share, for the same period one year ago. Net income attributable to Key common shareholders for the six-month period ended June 30, 2011, was $407 million compared to a net loss attributable to Key common shareholders of $67 million for the same period one year ago.  Our second quarter results represent another step forward for our company. They demonstrate our improvement in credit quality, disciplined expense management and continued execution of our business plan. We were also encouraged by the growth in our commercial, financial and agricultural loan portfolio, which benefited from the strategic alignment between our  68    Table of Contents  relationship-focused Community Bank and the deep industry expertise and advisory capabilities of our Corporate Bank. We believe we are well positioned for growth based on our strong capital and liquidity and our continued focus on meeting our clients’ borrowing needs.  During the second quarter of 2011, we continued to benefit from improved asset quality. Nonperforming assets declined $1.1 billion, and nonperforming loans decreased by $861 million from the year-ago quarter to $950 million and $842 million, respectively. Net charge-offs declined $301 million from the second quarter of 2010 to $134 million, or 1.11%, of average loan balances for the second quarter of 2011. Our credit quality trends have benefited from the early aggressive actions that we began over four years ago to exit higher risk lending activities. We have experienced continued improvement in all of our asset quality statistics. Over the past six quarters net charge-offs have declined 74%, nonperforming assets are down 61% to 1.98% of total loans, OREO and other nonperforming assets and our coverage ratio of loan and lease loss reserves to nonperforming loans is 146% as of June 30, 2011.  Our capital ratios remain strong. Our tangible common equity, Tier 1 common equity and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios at June 30, 2011, are 9.67%, 11.14%, and 13.93, respectively, compared to 7.65%, 8.07%, and 13.62%, respectively, at June 30, 2010. The Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend increase to $0.03 per common share for the second quarter of 2011.  As previously reported, Key completed the repurchase of the $2.5 billion of Series B Preferred Stock and corresponding warrant issued to the U.S. Treasury Department. As a result of the repurchase, we recorded a $49 million one-time deemed dividend in the first quarter of 2011 related to the remaining difference between the repurchase price and the carrying value of the preferred shares at the time of repurchase. Beginning with the second quarter of 2011, the repurchase resulted in the elimination of quarterly dividends of $31 million and discount amortization of $4 million, or $140 million on an annual basis, related to these preferred shares. In total, Key paid $2.867 billion to the U.S. Treasury during the investment period in the form of dividends, principal and repurchase of the warrant, resulting in a return to the U.S. Treasury of $367 million above the initial investment of $2.5 billion on November 14, 2008.  We have originated approximately $16.4 billion in new or renewed lending commitments to consumers and businesses during the first half of 2011, which is up 27% from $12.9 billion and for the same period one year ago. In addition, we expect to build 40 new branches in 2011, having opened 21 new branches in the first half of 2011 and 77 others in the prior two calendar years. Our multi-year branch building and renovation project has resulted in approximately one-third of Key’s 1,048 branches in its 14 state-branch network either being newly constructed or remodeled over the past four years.

In April 2009, we decided to wind down the operations of Austin, an investment subsidiary that specializes in managing hedge fund investments for its institutional customer base. As a result of these decisions, we have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations. The loss from discontinued operations for the six-months ended June 30, 2011, was primarily attributable to fair value adjustments related to the education lending securitization trusts.      (b)   March 31, 2011 includes a $49 million deemed dividend.      (c)   EPS may not foot due to rounding.    69    Table of Contents     Figure 4.

discontinue the education lending business conducted through Key Education Resources, the education payment and financing unit of KeyBank. In April 2009, we decided to wind down the operations of Austin, an investment subsidiary that specializes in managing hedge fund investments for its institutional customer base.      (b)   See Figure 5 entitled “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations,” which presents the computations of certain financial measures to “tangible common equity” and “Tier 1 common equity.” The table reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures, which provides a basis for period-to-period comparisons.      (c)   Represents period-end consolidated total loans and loans held for sale (excluding education loans in the securitizations trusts) divided by period-end consolidated total deposits (excluding deposits in foreign office).    70    Table of Contents     Figure 5 presents certain financial measures related to “tangible common equity” and “Tier 1 common equity.” The tangible common equity ratio has been a focus for some investors. We believe this ratio may assist investors in analyzing our capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock.  Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. Since the commencement of the SCAP in early 2009, the Federal Reserve has focused its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 risk-based capital known as Tier 1 common equity. Because the Federal Reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders’ equity (essentially Tier 1 risk-based capital less preferred stock, qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in Tier 1 risk-based capital, this focus on Tier 1 common equity is consistent with existing capital adequacy categories. This increased focus on Tier 1 common equity is also present in the Basel Committee’s Basel III guidelines, which U.S. regulators are expected to adopt pursuant to regulations that are expected to be issued in the second half of 2011. The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act also changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to bank holding companies by requiring regulators to create rules phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities as Tier 1 eligible capital. This three year phase-out period, which commences January 1, 2013, will ultimately result in our capital securities being treated only as Tier 2 capital.  Tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by GAAP nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations; this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity and Tier 1 common equity, we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases. Figure 5 also reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures.  The table also shows the computation for pre-provision net revenue, which is not formally defined by GAAP. Management believes that eliminating the effects of the provision for loan and lease losses makes it easier to analyze our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis.  Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.  71    Table of Contents  Figure 5.

Results of Operations     Net interest income  One of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets (such as loans and securities) and loan-related fee income, and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. There are several factors that affect net interest income, including:     ¨   the volume, pricing, mix and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities;      ¨   the volume and value of net free funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and equity capital;      ¨   the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk;      ¨   interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace; and      ¨   asset quality.    To make it easier to compare results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets (some taxable, some not), we present net interest income in this discussion on a “taxable-equivalent basis” (i.e., as if it were all taxable and at the same rate). For example, $100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as $154, an amount that — if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% — would yield $100.  72    Table of Contents  Figure 6 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense, and their respective yields or rates over the past five quarters. This figure also presents a reconciliation of taxable-equivalent net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with GAAP for each of those quarters. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized taxable-equivalent net interest income by average earning assets.  Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $570 million for the second quarter of 2011, and the net interest margin was 3.19%. These results compare to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $623 million and a net interest margin of 3.17% for the second quarter of 2010. The decrease in net interest income is attributable to a decline in earning assets, partially offset by lower funding costs resulting from continued improvement in the mix of deposits. This improved mix of deposits results from a reduction in the level of higher costing certificates of deposit.  Compared to the first quarter of 2011, taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $34 million, and the net interest margin declined 6 basis points. The decline in the net interest margin and net interest income reflects the impact of a $3.2 billion decline in average earning assets resulting from the repayment of the TARP preferred stock and the movement of approximately $1.5 billion of escrow deposits at the end of the first quarter of 2011. These escrow deposits were moved as a result of a change in the short-term ratings of KeyBank National Association by Moody’s in November 2010.  We expect the net interest margin to remain under some pressure given the outlook for interest rates and our asset sensitive position.  Average earning assets for the second quarter of 2011 totaled $72.0 billion, which was $7.1 billion, or 9.0%, lower than the second quarter of 2010. Average loans declined $6.5 billion primarily in our commercial portfolio, due to soft demand for both commercial and consumer credits during the past year and run-off in our exit portfolios. However, when compared to the first quarter of 2011, average total loans declined $.9 billion. This was a slower decline than we had been experiencing in prior quarters and indicates that we may be nearing an inflection point in our total loan portfolio. Our commercial, financial and agricultural loan portfolio showed its first quarterly growth in average balances since 2008, increasing $.6 billion or 3.7%, unannualized from the prior quarter. Securities available for sale increased $1.7 billion from the year ago quarter. This increase was due to investing excess cash flows from loan repayments and net deposit flows. However, when compared to the first quarter of 2011, securities available for sale decreased approximately $2.2 billion as a result of our repayment of TARP and the movement of escrow balances late in the first quarter as previously noted. For the third quarter of 2011, we are anticipating little change in the level of average earning assets.  73    Table of Contents  Figure 6.

Noninterest income  Our noninterest income was $454 million for the second quarter of 2011, compared to $492 million for the year-ago quarter, representing a decrease of $38 million, or 8%. Net gains (losses) from loan sales decreased $14 million from the second quarter of 2010. In addition, operating lease income and service charges on deposit accounts both declined $11 million compared to the same period one year ago. Consistent with Key’s expectations, the reduction in service charges on deposit accounts is a result of the changes associated with implementing Regulation E in the third quarter of 2010. Partially offsetting this decline in noninterest income from the second quarter of 2010 were increases in investment banking and capital markets income of $11 million and letter of credit and loan fees of $5 million.  For the six months ended June 30, 2011, noninterest income decreased $31 million, or 3%. The largest components of the decrease are $47 million in other income attributable to various miscellaneous items, a $23 million decrease in operating lease income due to product run-off and a $19 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts as a result of the implementation of Regulation E in the third quarter of 2010. Offsetting these decreases was a $45 million increase in investment banking and capital markets income (loss) attributable to higher syndication and equity capital markets fees, a $20 million increase in letter of credit and loan fees due to increased production, and an increase of $7 million in electronic banking fees due to higher customer volume.  76    Table of Contents  Figure 8.

Trust and investment services income  Trust and investment services are our largest source of noninterest income. The primary components of revenue generated by these services are shown in Figure 9. During the second quarter of 2011, trust and investment services income increased slightly over the same period one year ago.  Figure 9. Trust and Investment Services Income                                                                                Three months ended June 30,   Change   Six months ended June 30,   Change     dollars in millions   2011     2010     Amount   Percent   2011     2010     Amount   Percent             Brokerage commissions and fee income    $ 33      $ 35      $ (2 )     (5.7 ) %  $ 65      $ 68      $ (3 )     (4.4 ) %   Personal asset management and custody fees     40       37       3       8.1       78       74       4       5.4       Institutional asset management and custody fees     40       40       —       —       80       84       (4 )     (4.8 )           Total trust and investment services income    $ 113      $ 112      $ 1       .9  %   $ 223      $ 226      $ (3 )     (1.3 ) %                                                  A significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management. At June 30, 2011, our bank, trust and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of $59.3 billion, compared to $58.9 billion at June 30, 2010. As shown in Figure 10, the increase was attributable to equity market activities as a result of new inflows and market appreciation. Offsetting this increase were reductions in the securities lending and money market portfolios. The decline in the securities lending portfolio was due to our de-emphasizing this business causing lower transaction volume and client departures. When clients’ securities are lent out, the borrower must provide us with cash collateral, which is invested during the term of the loan. The difference between the revenue generated from the investment and the cost of the collateral is shared with the lending client. This business, although profitable, generates a significantly lower rate of return (commensurate with the lower level of risk) than other types of assets under management. The decline in the money market portfolio was due in part to the low rate environment as clients look for higher yields in other investment strategies. The decrease in the value of our portfolio of hedge funds is attributable to our second quarter 2009 decision to wind down the operations of Austin.  77    Table of Contents  Figure 10.

Service charges on deposit accounts  The decrease in service charges on deposit accounts during the second quarter and first six months of 2011 is due primarily to the implementation of Regulation E, which went into effect on July 1, 2010 for new clients and August 15, 2010 for our existing clients. This decrease in service charges on deposit accounts from the three and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 is consistent with our expectations related to these regulations.     Operating lease income  Operating lease income decreased $11 million, or 26% for the second quarter of 2011, and decreased $23 million, or 26% for the six months ended June 30, 2011 in our Equipment Finance line of business due to lower business volumes. Accordingly, as shown in Figure 12, operating lease expense also declined.     Investment banking and capital markets income  As shown in Figure 11, income from investment banking and capital markets activities increased $11 million, or 35% from the year-ago quarter and $45 million, or 113% from the six-month period ended one year ago.  Income from other investments increased by $7 million and dealer trading and derivatives income increased by $5 million from the year-ago quarter. Both the quarterly and year-to-date increases from the year-ago periods were due to: asset sales made by our Funds Management Group, credits recorded in the provision for losses related to customer derivatives compared to a provision recorded for the same period one year-ago, and the impact of the change in fair value of certain hedge instruments.  Investment banking income had no change compared to the year-ago quarter; but it increased by $10 million when compared to the six-month period ended one year ago. This was due to increased levels of debt and equity financings as a result of improving capital market and economic conditions.  Foreign exchange income slightly decreased as compared to the year-ago quarter but slightly increased when compared to the six-month period ended one year ago.  Figure 11.

Net gains from loan sales decreased by $14 million, or 56% from the second quarter of 2010. During the first six months of 2011, we recorded $30 million of net gains from loan sales, compared to net gains of $29 million during the first six months of 2010. These sales were primarily in the residential mortgage and commercial real estate portfolios and at values close to or above their carrying values recorded on our books.     Net gains (losses) from principal investing  Principal investments consist of direct and indirect investments in predominantly privately-held companies. Our principal investing income is susceptible to volatility since most of it is derived from mezzanine debt and equity investments in small to medium-sized businesses. These investments are carried on the balance sheet at fair value ($740 million at June 30, 2011, compared to $898 million at December 31, 2010, and $950 million at June 30, 2010). During the first half of 2011, employees who managed our various principal investments formed two independent entities that will serve as investment managers of these investments going forward. Under this new arrangement which was mutually agreeable to both parties, these individuals will no longer be employees of Key. As a result of these changes, during the second quarter of 2011, we deconsolidated certain of these direct and indirect investments, totaling $234 million. The net gains (losses) presented in Figure 8 derive from changes in fair values as well as sales of principal investments.     Noninterest expense  Noninterest expense was $680 million for the second quarter of 2011, compared to $769 million for the same period last year. For the first six months of the year, noninterest expense decreased $173 million, or 11% from the first six months of 2010.  As shown in Figure 12, the decrease for the second quarter of 2011 and the first six months of 2011 compared to the year-ago quarter and period were attributable to a decreases in net OREO expense attributable to gains on sales of OREO, decreases in FDIC insurance as a result of the change in the calculation method for deposit insurance assessments as discussed in the “Deposits and other sources of funds” section under the “The Dodd-Frank Act reform of deposit insurance” heading , increases in the credit to the provision for unfunded commitments as a result of improved credit quality and expense management philosophy adopted from our Keyvolution initiative.

The following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest expense and the factors that caused those elements to change.     Personnel  As shown in Figure 13, personnel expense, the largest category of our noninterest expense, decreased by $5 million, or 1%, when compared to the year-ago quarter and increased slightly from the first six months of 2010. This was due primarily to a $13 million decrease in employee benefits which was partially offset by an $8 million increase in incentive compensation when compared to the year-ago quarter. For the six months ended 2011, incentive compensation increased while employee benefits decreased when compared to the year-ago period. Improved performance was the driver behind the incentive  79    Table of Contents  compensation increases and a change in certain pension plan assumptions in the third quarter of 2010 was the cause for the decrease in employee benefits. For more information related to our pension plans, see Note 14 (“Employee Benefits”).  Figure 13.

Income related to the rental of leased equipment is presented in Figure 8 as “operating lease income.”     Income taxes  We recorded tax expense from continuing operations of $94 million for the second quarter of 2011, $111 million for the first quarter of 2011 and $11 million for the second quarter of 2010. For the first six months of 2011, we recorded tax expense from continuing operations of $205 million, compared to a tax benefit of $71 million for the same period last year.  Our federal tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate, primarily because we generate income from investments in tax-advantaged assets, such as corporate-owned life insurance, earn credits associated with investments in low-income housing projects, and make periodic adjustments to our tax reserves.  Additional information pertaining to how our tax expense (benefit) and the resulting effective tax rates were derived are included in Note 12 (“Income Taxes”) on page 138 of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  80    Table of Contents     Line of Business Results  This section summarizes the financial performance and related strategic developments of our two major business segments (operating segments), Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. Note 16 (“Line of Business Results”) describes the products and services offered by each of these business segments, provides more detailed financial information pertaining to the segments and their respective lines of business, and explains “Other Segments” and “Reconciling Items.”  Figure 14 summarizes the contribution made by each major business segment to our “taxable-equivalent revenue from continuing operations” and “income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Key” for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010.

Decreases in the provision for loan and lease losses and noninterest expenses were partially offset by lower net interest income and noninterest income in the second quarter of 2011.  Taxable-equivalent net interest income declined by $34 million, or 8%, from the second quarter of 2010, due to declines in average earning assets and average deposits. Average earning assets decreased by $1 billion, or 4%, from the year-ago quarter, reflecting reductions in the commercial loan and home equity loan portfolios. Average deposits declined by $3 billion, or 5%, as higher-costing certificates of deposit mature, partially offset by growth in noninterest-bearing deposits and NOW and money market deposit accounts.  Noninterest income decreased by $9 million, or 5%, from the year-ago quarter, due to lower service charges on deposits of $8 million from the implementation of Regulation E.  The provision for loan and lease losses declined by $42 million, or 35%, compared to the second quarter of 2010 due to improving economic conditions resulting in lower net charge-offs and nonperforming loans from the same period one year ago.  Noninterest expense declined by $4 million, or 1%, from the year-ago quarter. The decrease was driven by reductions in FDIC deposit insurance premiums of $20 million, offset by increases in personnel expense resulting from additional staffing for new branches and commercial lenders and various other operating costs.  81    Table of Contents  Figure 15.

This improvement in the second quarter of 2011 was a result of a substantial decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses as net charge-offs significantly declined between periods. Noninterest expense also decreased from the second quarter of 2010.  Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $24 million, or 12%, compared to the second quarter of 2010, primarily due to lower average earning assets and average deposits. Average earning assets decreased by $3.9 billion, or 18% from the year-ago quarter. Of this decrease, $3.7 billion was in the Real Estate Capital line of business as liquidity returned to the market for commercial real estate assets. Average deposits declined by $2.2 billion, or 18%, from one year ago primarily as a result of the movement of $1.5 billion in escrow balances within the Real Estate Capital line of business in the first quarter of 2011.  Noninterest income increased by $7 million, or 3%, from the second quarter of 2010. Contributing to the growth in noninterest income were increases in letter of credit and loan fees of $7 million and mortgage banking fees of $6 million. This improvement was partially offset by declines in operating lease revenue of $5 million and service charges on deposit accounts of $3 million.  The provision for loan and lease losses in the second quarter of 2011 was a credit of $76 million compared to a charge of $99 million for the same period one year ago. Key Corporate Bank continued to experience improved asset quality for the seventh quarter in a row.  82    Table of Contents  Noninterest expense decreased by $43 million, or 17%, from the second quarter of 2010 due in part to a $25 million decline in OREO expense. Also contributing to the improvement were decreases of $7 million in the provision for losses on lending-related commitments, $9 million in corporate support costs, and $4 million in operating lease expense. These improvements were partially offset by an increase in personnel expense of $6 million.  Figure 16.

Other Segments generated net income attributable to Key of $43 million for the second quarter of 2011, compared to net income attributable to Key of $28 million for the same period last year. These results are primarily attributable to a decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses of $17 million.  83    Table of Contents     Financial Condition     Loans and loans held for sale  At June 30, 2011, total loans outstanding from continuing operations were $47.8 billion, compared to $50.1 billion at December 31, 2010 and $53.3 billion at June 30, 2010. Loans related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business, which are excluded from total loans at June 30, 2011, December 31, 2010, and June 30, 2010, totaled $6.3 billion, $6.5 billion, and $6.6 billion, respectively. The decrease in our loans from continuing operations over the past twelve months reflects reductions in most of our portfolios, with the largest decline experienced in the commercial portfolio. However, our total loans decreased $712 million or 1.5% from the first quarter of 2011. This was a slower decline than what we had been experiencing in prior quarters and indicates that we may be nearing an inflection point in the loan portfolio where it will begin showing growth. While our clients remain somewhat cautious compared to prior recoveries, our lending pipelines are solid and we are actively supporting our clients’ borrowing needs. For more information on balance sheet carrying value, see Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the headings “Loans” and “Loans Held for Sale” on page 101 of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Commercial loan portfolio  Commercial loans outstanding were $32.7 billion at June 30, 2011, a decrease of $4.4 billion, or 12%, since June 30, 2010. This decrease was caused by continued soft demand for credit due to our clients’ use of the capital markets to raise debt and equity, pay downs on our portfolios and the run-off in our exit loan portfolio as we continue to reduce our risk. Our commercial loans decreased from March 31, 2011 by $610 million or 1.8%.     Commercial, financial and agricultural. Our Commercial, Financial and Agricultural loans, also referred to as “Commercial and Industrial,” represent 35% of our total loan portfolio at June 30, 2011, 33% at December 31, 2010 and 32% at June 30, 2010 and are the largest component of our total loans. These loans are comprised of fixed and variable rate loans to our large, middle market and small business clients. These loans decreased $230 million or 1% from one year ago and as compared to the first quarter of 2011, average loan balances have increased approximately $600 million or 3.7%, due to increased activity in our industrial sectors and middle market lending in all three of our regions.     Commercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans represent approximately 20% of our total loan portfolio. These loans include both owner and nonowner-occupied properties and constitute approximately 30% of our commercial loan portfolio. These loans have decreased $3.7 billion, or 28% to $9.7 billion at June 30, 2011, from $13.4 billion at June 30, 2010. When compared to the first quarter of 2011, these loans have decreased by a little more than $1 billion. This quarterly decrease is the result of continued market liquidity for these assets. We anticipate that this decrease will slow considerably during the third quarter of 2011 and stabilize or potentially grow by the fourth quarter of 2011.  As shown in Figure 17, at June 30, 2011, our commercial real estate portfolio included mortgage loans of $8.1 billion and construction loans of $1.6 billion representing 17% and 3% respectively, of our total loans. Nonowner-occupied loans represent 13% of our total loans and owner-occupied loans represent 7% of our total loans. The average size of mortgage loans originated during the second quarter of 2011 was $2.3 million, and our largest mortgage loan at June 30, 2011, had a balance of $65 million. At June 30, 2011, our average construction loan commitment was $3.6 million. Our largest construction loan commitment was $56 million and our largest construction amount outstanding was $49 million.  Our commercial real estate lending business is conducted through two primary sources: our 14-state banking franchise, and Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services, a national line of business that cultivates relationships both within and beyond the branch system. This line of business deals primarily with nonowner-occupied properties (generally properties for which at least 50% of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties) and accounted for approximately 57% of our average year-to-date commercial real estate loans during the second quarter of 2011, compared to 61% one year ago. Our commercial real estate business generally focuses on larger owners and operators of commercial real estate. Figure 17 includes commercial mortgage and construction loans in both Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. As shown in Figure 17, this loan portfolio is diversified by both property type and geographic location of the underlying collateral.  84    Table of Contents  Figure 17.

For the period 2008 — 2010, the secondary market for income-property loans was severely constrained. During this period of time, we provided interim financing for certain maturing income property loans. Beginning with the second half of 2010 and continuing throughout the second quarter of 2011, market liquidity for income property loans showed significant improvement. Consequently, our clients’ need for interim financing has diminished and our portfolio of nonowner-occupied income property loans has shown a steady decrease in outstanding principal balances. Since June 30, 2010 our nonowner occupied commercial real estate portfolio has been reduced by approximately $3 billion or 32%. Nonetheless, there are circumstances where a client requests a loan extension. In cases where the loan terms were extended at less than normal market rates for similar lending arrangements, we have transferred these loans to the Asset Recovery Group for resolution. In the second quarter of 2011, there were $87 million of new restructured loans included in nonperforming loans, of which $34 million related to commercial real estate.  As shown in Figure 17, at June 30, 2011, 65% of our commercial real estate loans were for nonowner-occupied properties compared to 70% at June 30, 2010. Approximately 23% and 33% of these loans were construction loans at June 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Typically, these properties are not fully leased at the origination of the loan. The borrower relies upon additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide the cash flow necessary to support debt service payments. Uncertain economic conditions generally slow the execution of new leases and may also lead to the turnover of existing leases, driving rental rates and occupancy rates down. As we have experienced during the first six months of 2011, we expect vacancy rates for retail, office and industrial space to remain elevated and possibly further increase through the remainder of 2011.  Commercial real estate fundamentals are bottoming, and for certain sectors (i.e., apartments) showing signs of improvement. According to Property and Portfolio Research, Inc., vacancy declined modestly across the four major property sectors in 2010 (with significant declines in apartment vacancy). Rent growth, however, remains negative for retail and industrial and basically flat for office. Rents should be nearing their trough, but are unlikely to post any meaningful gains over the near-term. If there is an interruption in the slow improvement in market fundamentals, any resulting effect would likely be most noticeable in the nonowner-occupied properties segment of our commercial real estate loan portfolio, particularly in the retail properties and office buildings components, which comprise 24% of our commercial real estate loans.  Commercial property values peaked in the fall of 2007, having experienced increases of approximately 30% since 2005 and 90% since 2001. The most recent Moody’s Real Estate Analytics, LLC Commercial Property Price Index shows a 49% drop  85    Table of Contents  in values from the peak in October 2007. The index is now at 98%, a 3.7% decrease from March 2011 and is at its lowest point since its inception in December of 2000. Market averages obscure divergent trends by asset quality and location. Over the past year, competition for the best assets in the top markets has driven prices higher, while weak demand and continued uncertainty is keeping prices for distressed assets low (and keeping trends negative). According to Moody’s Real Estate Analytics, LLC, the level of distressed sales in April was one of the highest in the past two years.  If the factors described above result in further weakening in the fundamentals underlying the commercial real estate market (i.e., vacancy rates, the stability of rental income and asset values), leading to reduced cash flow to support debt service payments, our ability to collect such payments and the strength of our commercial real estate loan portfolio could be adversely affected.     Commercial lease financing. We conduct financing arrangements through our Equipment Finance line of business and have both the scale and array of products to compete in the equipment lease financing business. Commercial lease financing receivables represented 19% of commercial loans at June 30, 2011, and 18% at June 30, 2010.     Commercial loan modification and restructuring  Certain commercial loans are modified and extended in the normal course of business for our clients. Loan modifications vary and are handled on a case by case basis with strategies responsive to the specific circumstances of each loan and borrower. In many cases, borrowers have other resources and can reinforce the credit with additional capital, collateral, guarantees or income sources.  Modifications are negotiated to achieve fair and mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan credit quality while at the same time meeting our clients’ financing needs. Modifications made to loans of creditworthy borrowers not experiencing financial difficulties and under circumstances where ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt are not classified as TDRs. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, TDR classification occurs when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a creditor concession has been granted.  Our concession types are primarily categorized as interest rate reductions, principal deferral, or forgiveness of principal. Loan extensions are sometimes coupled with these primary concession types. The table below provides the amount of TDRs by the primary type of concession made at each period end. With improving economic conditions and the restructuring of these loans to provide the best opportunity for successful repayment by the borrower, we have seen successes as measured by restructured loans returning to accrual status and consistent performance according to the restructured loan terms in each primary type of concession over the last three quarters.  Figure 18 shows our concession types for our commercial accruing and nonaccruing TDRs.  Figure 18.

Right-sizing the A note to sustainable cash flow should ultimately allow for its return to accrual status and thereupon a resumption of interest income recognition. Similarly, appropriately-sized A notes will allow for upgraded credit classification based on rehabilitated credit metrics including demonstrated payment performance. Other benefits include the borrower’s retention of ownership and control of the asset, deleveraged and sustainable capital structure (often sufficient to attract fresh capital into the transaction) and rehabilitation of local markets by minimizing distressed/fire sales.  As the objective of the multiple-note TDR is to achieve a fully performing and well-rated A note, we focus on sizing the A note to a level that is supported by cash flow available to service debt at current market terms and consistent with our customary underwriting standards. This typically will include a debt coverage ratio of 1.2 or better of cash flow to monthly payments of market interest and principal amortization of generally not more than 25 years.  The B note is typically an interest-only note with no required amortization until the property stabilizes and generates excess cash flow which is customarily applied directly to principal. The B note is subsequently evaluated at such time when accrual restoration of the A note is under consideration. In many cases, the B note has then been charged-off contemporaneously with the A note being returned to accrual status. Alternatively, both A and B notes may be simultaneously returned to accrual if credit metrics are supportive as set forth above. In many cases where a three note structure (A, B, C) has been utilized, the C notes are fully charged-off at the time of the TDR. In the very few instances where the C note is not charged-off, there is a pending equity event, additional leasing or pending sale of developed units that support the C note balance shortly after the TDR.  All loans processed as a TDR, including A notes and any non-charged-off B or C notes, are reported as TDRs during the year in which they are consummated. Returning an A note to accrual status requires a reasonable level of certainty that the balance of principal and interest is fully collectable over time.  Our policy requires a sustained period of timely principal and interest payments to restore a loan to accrual status. Primary repayment derived from property cash flow is evaluated for risk of continued sustainability while secondary repayment (collateral) is appraised to ensure that market value exceeds the carrying value of the A note with a sufficient excess (generally 20%). Although our policy is a guideline, considerable judgment is required to review each borrower’s circumstances.     Extensions  Certain commercial loans are modified and extended in the normal course of business for our clients. Project loans are typically refinanced into the permanent commercial loan market at maturity; however, due to the limited sources of permanent commercial mortgage financing available in the market today and the market-wide decline in leasing activity and rental rates, an increased number of loans have been extended. Extension terms take into account the specific circumstances of the client relationship, the status of the project and near-term prospects for both the client and the collateral. In all cases, pricing and loan structure are reviewed and (where necessary) modified to ensure the loan has been priced to achieve a market rate of return and loan terms (i.e., amortization, covenants and term) that are appropriate for the risk. Typical enhancements include one or more of the following: principal paydown, increased amortization, additional collateral, increased guarantees, and/or a cash flow sweep. As previously mentioned, some maturing construction loans have automatic  87    Table of Contents  extension options built in and in those cases where the borrower qualifies for the extension option, pricing and loan terms cannot be altered. Most project loans by their nature are “collateral-dependent” as cash flow from the project loans or the sale of the real estate provides for repayment of the loan.  Pricing of a loan is determined based on the strength of the borrowing entity and the strength of the guarantor if any. Therefore, pricing may remain the same (e.g., the loan is already priced at or above current market). We do not consider loan extensions in the normal course of business (under existing loan terms or at market rates) as TDRs, particularly when ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt and no concession has been made. In the case of loan extensions outside of the normal course of business—where either collection of all principal and interest is uncertain or a concession has been made, we would analyze such credit under the accounting guidance to determine whether it qualifies as a TDR. Extensions that qualify as TDRs are measured for impairment under the applicable accounting guidance.     Guarantors  A detailed guarantor analysis is conducted (1) for all new extensions of credit, (2) at the time of any material modification/extension, and (3) typically annually, as part of our on-going portfolio and loan monitoring procedures. This analysis includes submission by the guarantor entity of all appropriate financial statements including balance sheets, income statements, tax returns, and real estate schedules.  While the specific steps of each guarantor analysis may have some minor differences, the high level objectives include reaching a conclusion regarding the overall financial conditions of the guarantor entities, including: size, quality, and nature of asset base; net worth (adjusted to reflect our opinion of market value); leverage; standing liquidity; recurring cash flow; contingent and direct debt obligations; and near term debt maturities.  Borrower and guarantor financial statements are required at least annually within 90-120 days of the calendar/fiscal year end. Income statements and rent rolls for project collateral are required quarterly. In some cases, disclosure of certain information including liquidity, certifications, status of asset sales or debt resolutions, and real estate schedules may be required more frequently.  We routinely seek performance from guarantors of impaired debt, if the guarantor is solvent. In limited circumstances, we would not seek to enforce the guaranty, including situations in which we are precluded by bankruptcy and/or it is determined the cost to pursue a guarantor exceeds the value to be returned given the guarantor’s verified financial condition. We are often successful in obtaining either monetary payment and/or the cooperation of our solvent guarantors to help mitigate loss, cost and the expense of collections.  As of June 30, 2011, we had $363 million of mortgage and construction loans that had a loan to value ratio greater than 1.0 and were accounted for as performing loans. These loans were not considered impaired due to one or more of the following factors: underlying cash flow adequate to service the debt at a market rate of return with adequate amortization; a satisfactory borrower payment history; and acceptable guarantor support.     Consumer loan portfolio  Consumer loans outstanding decreased by $1.0 billion, or 6%, from one year ago. As shown in Figure 36 in the “Credit risk management” section, the majority of the reduction came from our exit loan portfolio. Most of the decrease is attributable to the marine segment.  The home equity portfolio is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio. Virtually this entire portfolio (94% at June 30, 2011) is derived primarily from the Regional Banking line of business within our Key Community Bank. The remainder of the portfolio, which has been in an exit mode since the fourth quarter of 2007, was originated from the Consumer Finance line of business and is now included in Other Segments. Home equity loans within Key Community Bank decreased by $344 million, or 4%, over the past twelve months.  Figure 20 summarizes our home equity loan portfolio by source at the end of each of the last five quarters, as well as certain asset quality statistics and yields on the portfolio as a whole.  88    Table of Contents  Figure 20.

As previously reported, we have experienced a decrease in our consumer loan portfolio. We expect that the portfolio will continue to decrease in future periods as a result of our actions to exit dealer-originated home equity loans and indirect retail lending for marine and recreational vehicle products, and discontinue the education lending business. We ceased originating new education loans effective December 5, 2009 and account for this business in discontinued operations.  In the latter half of 2010, there was public controversy surrounding the foreclosure practices of large home lenders. Our number of home loan foreclosures is small (the average number of new mortgage foreclosures serviced by Key and third parties, initiated per month, through June 30, 2011 was 139; mortgage loans serviced by Key and third parties outstanding at June 30, 2011 are approximately 229,000 loans) and primarily have occurred in our home equity loan portfolio. A review of our foreclosure processes completed in the first quarter of 2011 did not uncover any material defects in the process of signing and notarizing affidavits.     Loans held for sale  As shown in Note 3 (“Loans and Loans Held for Sale”), our loans held for sale decreased to $381 million at June 30, 2011 from $467 million at December 31, 2010 and totaled $699 million at June 30, 2010. Loans held for sale related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business, which are excluded from total loans held for sale December 31, 2010 and June 30, 2010, totaled $15 million and $92 million, respectively. There were no loans held for sale related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business at June 30, 2011.  At June 30, 2011, loans held for sale included $198 million of commercial mortgages, which decreased by $37 million from June 30, 2010, and $58 million of residential mortgage loans which decreased $23 million from June 30, 2010.     Loan sales  As shown in Figure 21, during the first six months of 2011, we sold $1.2 billion of commercial real estate loans, $688 million of residential real estate loans, and $64 million of commercial loans. Most of these sales came from the held-for-sale portfolio.  Figure 21 summarizes our loan sales for the first six months of 2011 and all of 2010.  89    Table of Contents  Figure 21.

Additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in Note 12 (“Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) under the heading “Recourse agreement with FNMA.”  We derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold. We earn noninterest income (recorded as “other income”) from fees for servicing or administering loans. This fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets. In addition, we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing of commercial real estate loans.     Securities  Our securities portfolio totaled $18.7 billion at June 30, 2011, compared to $22.0 billion at December 31, 2010, and $19.8 billion at June 30, 2010. At each of these dates, most of our securities consisted of securities available for sale, with the remainder consisting of held-to-maturity securities of less than $19 million.     Securities available for sale  The majority of our securities available-for-sale portfolio consists of CMOs, which are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities. CMOs generate interest income and serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements. At June 30, 2011, we had $18.5 billion invested in CMOs and other mortgage-backed securities in the available-for-sale portfolio, compared to $21.7 billion at December 31, 2010 and $19.6 billion at June 30, 2010.  As shown in Figure 23, all of our mortgage-backed securities are issued by government-sponsored enterprises or GNMA, and are traded in highly liquid secondary markets and recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. For more information about these securities, see Note 5 (“Fair Value Measurements”) under the heading “Qualitative Disclosures of Valuation Techniques.”  90    Table of Contents  Figure 23.

The net unrealized gains resulted from a decrease in market interest rates and were recorded in the AOCI component of shareholders’ equity. We continue to maintain a moderate asset-sensitive exposure to near-term changes in interest rates.  We periodically evaluate our securities available-for-sale portfolio in light of established A/LM objectives, changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio, and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. These evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning.  In addition, the size and composition of our securities available-for-sale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required (or elect) to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits. Although we generally use debt securities for this purpose, other assets, such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit, are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles.  During the second quarter of 2011, our investing activities continued to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs. In the second quarter, we continued to elect not to reinvest the monthly security cash flows. In the first quarter, we chose not to reinvest the monthly security cash flows during February and March and also sold approximately $1.6 billion of CMOs. These actions provided the liquidity necessary to address the funding requirements arising from the loss of certain escrow deposit balances related to commercial mortgage securitizations serviced by Key and rated by Moody’s, and also contributed to our preparations for TARP repayment in March 2011.

Such yields have been adjusted to a taxable-equivalent basis using the statutory federal income tax rate of 35%.      (b)   Excludes $5 million of securities at June 30, 2011, that have no stated yield.       Other investments  Principal investments — investments in equity and mezzanine instruments made by our Principal Investing unit — represented 62% of other investments at June 30, 2011. They include direct investments (investments made in a particular company) as well as indirect investments (investments made through funds that include other investors). Principal investments are predominantly made in privately held companies and are carried at fair value ($740 million at June 30, 2011, $898 million at December 31, 2010, and $950 million at June 30, 2010). During the first half of 2011, employees who managed our various principal investments formed two independent entities that will serve as investment managers of these investments going forward. Under this new arrangement which was mutually agreeable to both parties, these individuals will no longer be employees of Key. As a result of these changes, during the second quarter of 2011, we deconsolidated certain of these direct and indirect investments, totaling $234 million.  In addition to principal investments, “other investments” include other equity and mezzanine instruments, such as certain real estate-related investments that are carried at fair value, as well as other types of investments that generally are carried at cost.  Most of our other investments are not traded on an active market. We determine the fair value at which these investments should be recorded based on the nature of the specific investment and all available relevant information. Among other things, our review may encompass such factors as the issuer’s past financial performance and future potential, the values of public companies in comparable businesses, the risks associated with the particular business or investment type, current market conditions, the nature and duration of resale restrictions, the issuer’s payment history, our knowledge of the industry and third party data. During the first six months of 2011, net gains from our principal investing activities (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) totaled $52 million, which includes $41 million of net unrealized gains. These net gains are recorded as “net gains (losses) from principal investing” on the income statement.     Deposits and other sources of funds  Domestic deposits are our primary source of funding. During the second quarter of 2011, these deposits averaged $57.7 billion and represented 80% of the funds we used to support loans and other earning assets, compared to $63.6 billion and 80% during the same quarter in 2010. The composition of our average deposits is shown in Figure 6 in the section entitled “Net interest income.”  92    Table of Contents  The decrease in average domestic deposits in the second quarter of 2011, compared to the second quarter of 2010, was due to a decline in certificates of deposit ($100,000 or more) and other time deposits. This decline was offset by an increase in NOW and money market deposit accounts, and noninterest-bearing deposits. The mix of deposits continues to change as higher-costing certificates of deposit mature and re-price to current market rates and clients move their balances to transaction and nonmaturity deposit accounts, such as NOW and money market savings accounts, or look for other alternatives for investing in the current low-rate environment.  We have certificates of deposit of approximately $12.1 billion outstanding at June 30, 2011. Of this balance, $4.3 billion will mature over the next two quarters and $5.1 billion will mature in 2012. The average rates paid on the maturities for 2011 and 2012 are 1.51% and 2.69%, respectively. This compares to our average cost of certificates of deposit renewed during the first half of 2011 of 0.32%. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2011, approximately $1.5 billion of escrow deposits associated with Key’s mortgage servicing operations were moved to another financial institution as a result of the previously reported ratings downgrade of KeyBank by Moody’s in November 2010. We funded this movement of the escrow deposits by selling a similar amount of securities available for sale at the time of the transfer.  Wholesale funds, consisting of deposits in our foreign office and short-term borrowings, averaged $3.6 billion during the second quarter of 2011, compared to $3.2 billion during the year-ago quarter. The change from the second quarter of 2010 resulted from a $51 million increase in foreign office deposits, a $248 million increase in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase and a $133 million increase in bank notes and other short-term borrowings.     The Dodd-Frank Act’s reform of deposit insurance  The Dodd-Frank Act made permanent the current FDIC standard maximum deposit insurance coverage limit of $250,000, and provided for temporary unlimited FDIC deposit insurance until January 1, 2013, for non interest-bearing demand transaction accounts, including Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts, for all insured depository institutions effective December 31, 2010 (concurrent with the expiration date of the current TAG Program extension). Since December 31, 2010, KeyBank has offered noninterest-bearing demand transaction accounts, with unlimited FDIC deposit insurance, similar to when we participated in the TAG.  Substantially all of KeyBank’s domestic deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. The FDIC assesses an insured depository institution an amount for deposit insurance premiums equal to its deposit insurance assessment base times a risk-based assessment rate. Under the risk-based assessment system in effect for the first quarter of 2011, annualized deposit insurance premium assessments ranged from $.07 to $.775 for each $100 of assessable domestic deposits based on the institution’s risk category.  As discussed in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K on page 9 in the section titled “Federal Deposit Insurance Act,” under the heading “Deposit Insurance Assessments”, adhere to requirements imposed upon the DIF by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC adopted a final rule, effective April 1, 2011, changing the basis for assessments from domestic deposits to average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, and implementing a new assessment system. Under the new assessment system, KeyBank’s annualized deposit insurance premium assessments would range from $.025 to $.45 for each $100 of its new assessment base, depending on its new scorecard performance incorporating KeyBank’s regulatory rating, ability to withstand asset and funding related stress, and relative magnitude of potential losses to the FDIC in the event of KeyBank’s failure. We estimate that our 2011 expense for deposit insurance assessments will be $60 million to $90 million. As the end of the quarter, we had $335 million of prepaid FDIC insurance assessments remaining on our balance sheet from our December 2009 prepayment of 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012 estimated assessments. Prepayment was required of depository institutions under the FDIC’s restoration plan for the DIF.  Subsequent to the effective date of the new FDIC assessment system discussed above, on April 15, 2011, the FDIC published a Notice of Proposed Assessment Rate Adjustment Guidelines in the Federal Register. The guidelines describe the process that the FDIC would follow to determine whether an adjustment, upward or downward, to the score used to calculate the assessment rate for a large or highly complex institution, such as KeyBank, should be made; and to notify an institution of an adjustment, if any. The proposal sets forth guidelines for the FDIC’s use of its ability to adjust a large institution’s assessment rate provided for under the new assessment effective April 1, 2011. Comments on the proposed guidelines were due by May 31, 2011. If the FDIC determined KeyBank to have an upward adjustment our assessment could be affected thereby reducing the amount of estimated savings we have described in the preceding paragraph for 2011.  93    Table of Contents     Capital  At June 30, 2011, our shareholders’ equity was $9.7 billion, down $1.4 billion from December 31, 2010. The following discusses certain factors that contributed to the change in our shareholders’ equity. For other factors that contributed to the change, see the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity (Unaudited).     Updated Comprehensive Capital Plan and redemption notices for certain capital securities  On June 10, 2011, we submitted to the Federal Reserve and provided to the OCC an updated Comprehensive Capital Plan, which set forth additional capital actions related to redemptions of certain outstanding capital securities. On August 1, 2011, the Federal Reserve informed us that it had no objections to the capital actions set forth in our updated capital plan. As previously reported, on August 2, 2011, KeyCorp submitted redemption notices to the property trustee for the redemption in full of each of the following capital securities: KeyCorp Capital V, KeyCorp Capital VI, KeyCorp Capital VIII, and Union State Capital I.     Repurchase of TARP CPP preferred stock, warrant and completion of equity and debt offerings  As previously reported, Key completed the repurchase of the $2.5 billion of Series B Preferred Stock and corresponding warrant issued to the U.S. Treasury Department. As a result of the repurchase, we recorded a $49 million one-time deemed dividend in the first quarter of 2011 related to the remaining difference between the repurchase price and the carrying value of the preferred shares at the time of repurchase. Beginning with the second quarter of 2011, the repurchase resulted in the elimination of quarterly dividends of $31 million and discount amortization of $4 million, or $140 million on an annual basis, related to these preferred shares. In total, Key paid $2.867 billion to the U.S. Treasury during the investment period in the form of dividends, principal and repurchase of the warrant, resulting in a return to the U.S. Treasury of $367 million above the initial investment of $2.5 billion on November 14, 2008.     Dividends  During the first quarter of 2011, we made dividend payments of $31 million to the U.S. Treasury on the Series B Preferred Stock as a participant in the U.S. Treasury’s TARP CPP. The repurchase of this Preferred Stock in March 2011 eliminated future quarterly dividends of $31 million, or $125 million on an annual basis.  During the second quarter of 2011, we made a dividend payment of $1.9375 per share or $6 million on our Series A Preferred Stock.  During the second quarter of 2011, our Board of Directors approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $.03 per Common Share or $.12 on an annualized basis. As a result, during the second quarter of 2011, we made a dividend payment of $.03 per share, or $29 million, on our Common Shares.     Common shares outstanding  Our Common Shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol KEY. At June 30, 2011 our book value per Common Share was $9.88 based on 953.8 million shares outstanding at June 30, 2011, compared to $9.52 based on 880.6 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2010, and $9.19 based on 880.5 million shares outstanding at June 30, 2010. At June 30, 2011 our tangible book value per Common Share was $8.90 compared to $8.45 at December 31, 2010, and $8.10 at June 30, 2010.  Figure 26 shows activities that caused the change in outstanding Common Shares over the past five quarters.  Figure 26.

At June 30, 2011, we had 63.1 million treasury shares, compared to 65.7 million treasury shares at December 31, 2010 and 65.8 million treasury shares at June 30, 2010. Going forward we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stock-based compensation awards and for other corporate purposes.  In the past we have periodically repurchased Common Shares, for employee benefit plans without regulatory approval, in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions under a repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors. The existing program does not have an expiration date, and we have outstanding Board authority to repurchase 13.9 million shares. We did not repurchase any Common Shares during the first six months of 2011 or 2010. Regulatory approval will be required for any future Common Share repurchases, including under the existing Board authority.     Capital plan and proposed actions  In November 2010, the Federal Reserve issued Revised Temporary Addendum to Supervisory Letter SR 09-4. This letter outlines specific criteria the Federal Reserve will consider when evaluating proposed capital actions by the 19 largest U.S. banking institutions that participated in the SCAP, including KeyCorp. These include actions such as increasing dividends, implementing common stock repurchase programs, or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments more broadly. The Federal Reserve is required to assess the capital adequacy of the 19 largest BHCs based upon a review of each BHC’s comprehensive capital plan. On January 7, 2011 we submitted our Comprehensive Capital Plan to the Federal Reserve. On March 18, 2011, the Federal Reserve informed us that it had no objections to the capital actions set forth in our Comprehensive Capital Plan following its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”). On June 10, 2011 we submitted an updated capital plan to the Federal Reserve and provided it to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which set forth certain additional capital actions. For a discussion of our capital actions, see the “Capital” section.  As part of its ongoing supervisory process, the Federal Reserve requires a BHC to submit an annual Comprehensive Capital Plan as well as to update such plan to reflect material changes in a firm’s risk profile, business strategies, or corporate structure, including but not limited to changes in planned capital actions. On June 10, 2011, we submitted to the Federal Reserve and provided to the OCC an updated Comprehensive Capital Plan, which set forth additional capital actions related to redemptions of certain outstanding capital securities. On August 1, 2011, the Federal Reserve informed us that it had no objections to the capital actions set forth in our updated capital plan.  As previously reported, on August 2, 2011, KeyCorp submitted redemption notices to the property trustee for the redemption in full of each of the following capital securities: KeyCorp Capital V, KeyCorp Capital VI, KeyCorp Capital VIII, and Union State Capital I.  For a discussion of the Federal Reserve’s notice of proposed rulemaking on capital plans see the section titled Supervision and Regulation under the heading “Capital Plan Proposal.”     Capital adequacy  Capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance. All of our capital ratios remain in excess of regulatory requirements at June 30, 2011. Our capital and liquidity position us well to weather an adverse credit cycle while continuing to serve our clients’ needs, as well as to adjust to the application of any new regulatory capital standards expected to be promulgated under the Dodd-Frank Act or due to Basel III. Our shareholders’ equity to assets ratio was 10.95% at June 30, 2011, compared to 12.10% at December 31, 2010 and 11.49% at June 30, 2010. Our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 9.67% at June 30, 2011, compared to 8.19% at December 31, 2010 and 7.65% at June 30, 2010.  Banking industry regulators prescribe minimum capital ratios for bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries. Risk-based capital guidelines require a minimum level of capital as a percent of “risk-weighted assets.” Risk-weighted assets consist of total assets plus certain off-balance sheet and market items, subject to adjustment for predefined credit risk factors. Currently, banks and bank holding companies must maintain, at a minimum, Tier 1 capital as a percent of risk-weighted assets of 4.00% and total capital as a percent of risk-weighted assets of 8.00%. We expect U.S. regulators to introduce new regulatory capital guidelines later this year, responding to both the Dodd Frank Act and Basel III capital directives. As of June 30, 2011, our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and our total risk-based capital ratios were 13.93% and 17.88%, respectively, compared to 15.16% and 19.12%, respectively, at December 31, 2010.  95    Table of Contents  Another indicator of capital adequacy, the leverage ratio, is defined as Tier 1 capital as a percentage of average quarterly tangible assets. Bank holding companies that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the Federal Reserve’s risk-adjusted measure for market risk — as we have — must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 3.00%. All other bank holding companies must maintain a minimum ratio of 4.00%. As of June 30, 2011, our leverage ratio was 12.13% compared to 13.02% at December 31, 2010.  The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to bank holding companies by requiring regulators to create rules phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities being eligible Tier 1 risk-based capital.  This three year phase-out period, which commences January 1, 2013, will ultimately result in our capital securities issued by the KeyCorp and the Union State Bank capital trusts (“capital securities”) being treated only as Tier 2 capital. These changes in effect apply the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to depository institutions to BHCs, savings and loan holding companies, and nonbank financial companies identified as systemically important.  As of June 30, 2011, our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, leverage ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio were 13.93%, 12.13%, and 17.88%, respectively. The capital securities issued by the KeyCorp and the Union State Bank capital trusts contribute $1.8 billion or 240, 209, and 240 basis points to our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio, respectively, as of June 30, 2011.  Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act of 1950, prompt corrective action standards, Federal bank regulators group FDIC-insured depository institutions into five categories, ranging from “well capitalized” to “critically undercapitalized.” A “well capitalized” institution must meet or exceed the prescribed thresholds of 6.00% for Tier 1 risk-based capital, 5.00% for Tier 1 leverage capital, 10.00% for total risk-based capital and must not be subject to any written agreement, order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. If these provisions applied to bank holding companies, we would qualify as “well capitalized” at June 30, 2011. We believe there has not been any change in condition or event since that date that would cause our capital classification to change. Analysis on a pro forma basis, accounting for the phase-out of our capital securities as Tier 1 eligible (and therefore as Tier 2 instead) as of June 30, 2011, also determines that we would qualify as “well capitalized” under current regulatory guidelines, with the pro forma Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, pro forma leverage ratio, and pro forma total risk-based capital ratio being 11.53%, 10.04%, and 17.88%, respectively. The current regulatory defined categories serve a limited supervisory function. Investors should not use our pro forma ratios as a representation of our overall financial condition or prospects of KeyCorp or KeyBank.  Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. As a result of the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has intensified its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 risk-based capital, known as Tier 1 common equity, and its review of the consolidated capitalization of systemically important financial companies, including KeyCorp. Because the Federal Reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders’ equity (essentially Tier 1 risk-based capital less preferred stock, qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in Tier 1 risk-based capital, such a focus is consistent with existing capital adequacy guidelines and does not imply a new or ongoing capital standard. The capital modifications mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act and set forth in Basel III are consistent with the renewed focus on Tier 1 common equity and the consolidated capitalization of banks, BHCs, and covered nonbank financial companies, which resulted from the financial crisis. Because Tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by GAAP nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations, this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. Figure 5 in the “Highlights of Our Performance” section reconciles Key shareholders’ equity, the GAAP performance measure, to Tier 1 common equity, the corresponding non-GAAP measure. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio was 11.14% at June 30, 2011, compared to 9.34% at December 31, 2010, and 8.07% at June 30, 2010.  At June 30, 2011, we had a consolidated net deferred tax asset of $220 million compared to $442 million at December 31, 2010 and $589 million at June 30, 2010. Prior to the third quarter of 2009, we had been in a net deferred tax liability position. Generally, for risk-based capital purposes, deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income are limited to the lesser of: (i) the amount of deferred tax assets that a financial institution expects to realize within one year of the calendar quarter-end date, based on its projected future taxable income for the year, or (ii) 10% of the amount of an institution’s Tier 1 capital. Based on these restrictions, at June 30, 2011, $75 million of our net deferred tax assets were deducted from Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets compared to $158 million at December 31, 2010 and $354 million at June 30, 2010. We anticipate that the amount of our net deferred tax asset disallowed for risk-based capital purposes will continue to decline in coming quarters.  96    Table of Contents     Basel III  In December 2010, the Basel Committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation (“Basel III”). Basel III is a comprehensive set of reform measures designed to strengthen the regulation, supervision and risk management of the banking sector. A more thorough discussion of Basel III is included in our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K in the Supervision and Regulation section beginning on page 5, as well as in our Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2011 on page 94.  While the U.S banking regulators have yet to adopt Basel III, on January 1, 2013, banks with regulators adopting the Basel III capital framework in full would be required to meet the following minimum capital ratios — 3.5% common equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets, 4.5% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and 8.0% total capital to risk-weighted assets. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer will begin on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% and be phased in over a four-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019).  Basel III introduces for the first time an official definition and specific guideline minimums for Tier 1 common equity. When the requirements for the capital conservation buffer are included, the resulting minimum levels for Tier 1 capital and total risk-based capital will be higher than the U.S.’s current “well-capitalized” minimums.  The U.S. bank regulatory agencies have not yet set forth a formal timeline for a notice of proposed rulemaking or final adoption of regulations responsive to Basel III. However, they have indicated informally that a notice of proposed rulemaking likely will be released in the second half of 2011, with final amendments to regulations being adopted in mid-2012. Given our strong capital position, we expect to be able to satisfy the Basel III capital framework should U.S. capital regulations corresponding to it be finalized. While we also have a strong liquidity position, the Basel III liquidity framework could require us and other U.S. banks to initiate additional liquidity management initiatives, including adding additional liquid assets, issuing term debt, and modifying our product pricing for loans, commitments, and deposits. U.S. regulators have indicated that they may elect to make certain refinements to the Basel III liquidity framework. Accordingly, at this point it is premature to assess the impact of the Basel III liquidity framework.

The most significant risks we face are credit, liquidity, market, compliance, operational, strategic and reputation risks. We must properly and effectively identify, assess, measure, monitor, control and report such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability. Certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section.  During the second quarter of 2011, our management team continued to enhance our ERM Program and related practices. Our ERM Committee, which consists of the Chief Executive Officer and other Senior Executives, is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite. The ERM Program encompasses our risk philosophy, policy, framework and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company. The ERM Committee reports to the Risk Management Committee of our Board of Directors. Annually, the Board of Directors reviews and approves the ERM Program, as well as the risk appetite and corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories. We use a risk-adjusted capital framework to manage risks. This framework is approved and managed by the ERM Committee.  Our Board of Directors serves in an oversight capacity with the objective of managing our enterprise-wide risks in a manner that is effective, balanced and adds value for the shareholders. The Board inquires about risk practices, reviews the portfolio of risks, compares actual risks to the risk appetite and tolerances, and receives regular reports about significant risks — both actual and emerging. To assist in these efforts, the Board has delegated primary oversight responsibility for risk to the Audit Committee and the Risk Management Committee.  The Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for internal audit; financial reporting; compliance risk and legal matters; the implementation, management and evaluation of operational risk and controls; information security and fraud risk; and evaluating the qualifications and independence of the independent auditors. The Audit Committee discusses policies related to risk assessment and risk management and the processes related to risk review and compliance.  The Risk Management Committee has responsibility for overseeing the management of credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk (including the actions taken to mitigate these risks), as well as reputational and strategic risks relating to the foregoing. The Risk Management Committee also oversees the maintenance of appropriate regulatory and economic capital. The Risk Management Committee reviews the ERM reports and, approves any material changes to the charter of the ERM Committee.  The Audit and Risk Management Committees meet jointly, as appropriate, to discuss matters that relate to each committee’s responsibilities. In addition to regularly scheduled bi-monthly meetings, the Audit Committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases. Committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting. All members of the Board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months.  Federal banking regulators are reemphasizing with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution. We believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks, and comport with regulatory expectations.     Market risk management  The cash flows and values of financial instruments change as a function of changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity values, commodity prices and other market factors that influence prospective yields, values or prices associated with the instrument. For example, the value of a fixed-rate bond will decline if market interest rates increase, while the cash flows associated with a variable rate loan will increase when interest rates increase. The holder of a financial instrument is exposed to “market risk” when the cash flows and value of the instrument is tied to such external factors. Most of our market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations.  99    Table of Contents     Interest rate risk management  Interest rate risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the EVE. Such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates, and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. We manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the EVE in accordance with our risk appetite, and within policy limits established by the ERM Committee.  Interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products, economic conditions, the competitive environment within our markets and changes in market interest rates that affect client activity and our hedging, investing, funding and capital positions. The primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of basis risk, gap risk, yield curve risk and option risk.     ¨   We face “basis risk” when floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities reprice at the same time, but in response to different market factors or indices. Under those circumstances, even if equal amounts of assets and liabilities are repricing, interest expense and interest income may not change by the same amount.      ¨   “Gap risk” occurs if interest-bearing liabilities and the interest-earning assets they fund (for example, deposits used to fund loans) do not mature or reprice at the same time.      ¨   “Yield curve risk” is the exposure to non-parallel changes in the slope of the yield curve (where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity) if interest-bearing liabilities and the interest-earning assets they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve.      ¨   A financial instrument presents “option risk” when one party to the instrument can take advantage of changes in interest rates without penalty. For example, when interest rates decline, borrowers may choose to prepay fixed-rate loans and refinance at a lower rate. Such a prepayment gives us a return on our investment (the principal plus some interest), but unless there is a prepayment penalty, that return may not be as high as the return that would have been generated had payments been received over the original term of the loan. Deposits that can be withdrawn on demand also present option risk.       Net interest income simulation analysis. The primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis. For purposes of this analysis, we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on- and off-balance sheet positions accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity. The analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments, including a most likely macro economic scenario. Simulation modeling assumes that residual risk exposures will be managed to within the risk appetite.  Typically, the amount of net interest income at risk is measured by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if the federal funds target rate were to gradually increase or decrease by 200 basis points over the next twelve months, and term rates were to move in a similar fashion. In light of the low interest rate environment, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, we modified the standard rate scenario of a gradual decrease of 200 basis points over twelve months to a gradual decrease of 25 basis points over two months with no change over the following ten months. After calculating the amount of net interest income at risk to interest rate changes, we compare that amount with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment. We also perform regular stress tests and sensitivities on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments. One set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of interest rate inputs on simulated exposures. Assessments are performed using different shapes in the yield curve, including a sustained flat yield curve, an inverted slope yield curve, changes in credit spreads, an immediate parallel change in market interest rates and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates. Another set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of loan and deposit assumptions and assumed discretionary strategies on simulated exposures. Assessments are performed on changes to the following assumptions: the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities, changes in lending spreads, prepayments on loans and securities, other loan and deposit balance changes, investment, funding and hedging activities, and liquidity and capital management strategies.  Simulation analysis produces only a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on judgments related to assumption inputs into the simulation model. We tailor assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled, and validate those assumptions on a regular basis. Our simulations are performed with the assumption that interest rate risk positions will be actively managed through the use of on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments to achieve the desired residual risk profile. However, actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to  100    Table of Contents  unanticipated changes to the following inputs: balance sheet composition, customer behavior, product pricing, market interest rates, and investment, funding and hedging activities. Actual results may also differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events.  Figure 28 presents the results of the simulation analysis at June 30, 2011 and 2010. At June 30, 2011, our simulated exposure to a change in short-term interest rates was moderately asset sensitive. ALCO policy limits for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual increase or decrease in short-term interest rates over the next twelve months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 4%. As shown in Figure 28, we are operating within these limits.  Figure 28. Simulated Change in Net Interest Income                            June 30, 2011                             Basis point change assumption (short-term rates)     -25       +200       ALCO policy limits     -4.00  %     -4.00   %         Interest rate risk assessment     -.76  %     +4.01   %                               June 30, 2010                           Basis point change assumption (short-term rates)     -25       +200       ALCO policy limits     -4.00  %     -4.00   %         Interest rate risk assessment     -1.04  %     +3.42   %           As interest rates have remained at low levels for an extended period of time, we have gradually shifted from a liability-sensitive position to an asset-sensitive position as a result of balance growth in transaction deposits and declines in loan balances. Although outstanding derivative hedge positions have declined over the past year due to contractual maturities, recent changes in the mix of customer deposits and the anticipation of a continuation of this shift served to offset the affect of the decline in hedges on the simulated exposure. Our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume, mix, maturity and re-pricing of loan and deposit flows. As changes occur to the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy, management evaluates hedging opportunities that would change the reported interest rate risk profile.  The results of additional simulation analyses that make use of alternative interest rate paths and customer behavior assumptions indicate that net interest income improvement in a rising rate environment could be diminished, and actual results may be different than the policy simulation results in Figure 28. Net interest income improvements are highly dependent on the timing, magnitude, frequency and path of interest rate increases and assumption inputs for deposit re-pricing relationships, lending spreads and the balance behavior of transaction accounts.  We also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a three-year horizon. These simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a twelve-month horizon. To capture longer-term exposures, we calculate exposures to changes to the EVE as discussed in the following section.     Economic value of equity modeling. EVE complements net interest income simulation analysis since it estimates risk exposure beyond twelve- and twenty-four and thirty-six month horizons. EVE measures the extent to which the economic values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates, and measuring the resulting change in the values of assets and liabilities under multiple interest rate paths. Under the current level of market interest rates, the calculation of EVE under an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest rates results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than 200 basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points. This analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities. Those assumptions are based on historical behaviors, as well as our expectations. We develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our EVE will decrease by more than 15% in response to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates. We are operating within these guidelines.     Management of interest rate exposure. We use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate Asset Liability Management strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures. Specifically, we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities, issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates, and using derivatives — predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps, which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities.  101    Table of Contents  Figure 29 shows all swap positions which we hold for A/LM purposes. These positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. For example, fixed-rate debt is converted to a floating rate through a “receive fixed/pay variable” interest rate swap. The volume, maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader A/LM objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile, see Note 7 (“Derivatives and Hedging Activities”).  Figure 29.

Derivatives not designated in hedge relationships  Our derivatives that are not designated in hedge relationships are described in Note 7. We use a VAR simulation model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of this portfolio. Using two years of historical information, the model estimates the maximum potential one-day loss with a 95% confidence level. Statistically, this means that losses will exceed VAR, on average, five out of 100 trading days, or three to four times each quarter.  We manage exposure to market risk in accordance with VAR limits for trading activity that have been approved by the Market Risk Committee which was established as part of our ERM Program. At June 30, 2011, the aggregate one-day trading limit set by the committee was $6.2 million. We are operating within these constraints. During the first six months of 2011, our aggregate daily average, minimum and maximum VAR amounts were $1.3 million, $1.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively. During the same period one year ago, our aggregate daily average, minimum and maximum VAR amounts were $2.0 million, $1.5 million and $2.5 million, respectively.  In addition to comparing VAR exposure against limits on a daily basis, we monitor loss limits, use sensitivity measures and conduct stress tests. We report our market risk exposure to the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors.     Liquidity risk management  We define “liquidity” as the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences. Liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions.     Governance structure  We manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis. This approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity, as well as each entity’s capacity to manage through adverse conditions. It also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding.  Oversight of the liquidity risk management process is governed by the Risk Management Committee of the KeyCorp Board of Directors, the KeyBank Board of Directors, the ERM Committee and the ALCO. These groups regularly review various liquidity reports, including liquidity and funding summaries, liquidity trends, peer comparisons, variance analyses, liquidity projections, hypothetical funding erosion stress tests and goal tracking reports. The reviews generate a discussion of positions, trends and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of the decisions that we make. When liquidity pressure is elevated, monitoring of positions is heightened and reporting is more intensive. We communicate with individuals within and outside of the company on a daily basis to discuss emerging issues. In addition, we use a variety of daily liquidity reports to monitor the flow of funds.  102    Table of Contents     Factors affecting liquidity  Our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events. An example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency. Examples of indirect events (events unrelated to us) that could impact our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war, natural disasters, political events, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund or hedge fund. Similarly, market speculation, or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources.  During the first quarter of 2011, Moody’s (a credit rating agency that rates KeyCorp and KeyBank debt securities) indicated to KeyBank that certain escrow deposits associated with our mortgage servicing operations had to be moved to another financial institution which meets Moody’s minimum ratings threshold. As a result of this decision by Moody’s, on March 7, 2011, KeyBank transferred approximately $1.5 billion of these escrow deposit balances to an acceptably-rated institution which resulted in an immaterial impairment of the related mortgage servicing assets. KeyBank had ample liquidity reserves to offset the loss of these deposits and currently remains in a strong liquidity position.     Managing liquidity risk  We regularly monitor our funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding. In the normal course of business, we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both KeyCorp and KeyBank. In a “heightened monitoring mode,” we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently, and use assumptions so the stress tests are more strenuous and reflect the changed market environment. Erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods. Ultimately, they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations. To compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures, we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed.  We continue to reposition our balance sheet to reduce future reliance on wholesale funding and maintain a strong liquid asset portfolio. As our secured borrowings matured, in prior years they were not replaced. However, we retain the capacity to utilize secured borrowings as a contingent funding source.  We maintain a Contingency Funding Plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis. The Plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions. It also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for effectively managing liquidity through a problem period. As part of the Plan, we maintain a liquidity reserve through balances in our liquid asset portfolio which during a problem period could reduce our potential reliance on wholesale funding. The portfolio at June 30, 2011 totaled $13 billion. The liquid asset portfolio balance consisted of $7.1 billion of unpledged securities, $2.1 billion of securities available for secured funding at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and $3.8 billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our Federal Reserve account. Additionally, as of June 30, 2011, our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was $11.9 billion at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and $4.2 billion at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati.     Long-term liquidity strategy  Our long-term liquidity strategy is to be core deposit funded with reduced reliance on wholesale funding. Key’s client-based relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base, which support our liquidity risk management strategy. We use the loan to deposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies. Our target loan to deposit ratio is between 90-100%, which we calculate as total loans, loans held-for-sale, and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by domestic deposits.     Sources of liquidity  Our primary sources of funding include customer deposits, wholesale funding, liquid assets, and capital. If the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances, we rely on wholesale funding or liquid assets. Conversely, excess cash generated by operating, investing and deposit-gathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets. We actively manage liquidity using a variety of nondeposit sources, including short- and long-term debt, and secured borrowings.     Liquidity programs  We have several liquidity programs, which are described in Note 14 (“Short-Term Borrowings”) on page 144 of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which enable the parent company and KeyBank to raise funds in the public and private markets when the capital markets are functioning normally. The proceeds from most of these programs can be used for  103    Table of Contents  general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. Each of the programs is replaced or renewed as needed. There are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs.     Liquidity for KeyCorp  The parent company has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt; support customary corporate operations and activities (including acquisitions) and occasional guarantees of subsidiary’s obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences; and pay dividends to shareholders.  Our primary tool for assessing parent company liquidity is the net short-term cash position, which measures the ability to fund debt maturing in twenty-four months or less with existing liquid assets. Another key measure of parent company liquidity is the “liquidity gap,” which represents the difference between projected liquid assets and anticipated financial obligations over specified time horizons. We generally rely upon the issuance of term debt to manage the liquidity gap within targeted ranges assigned to various time periods.  Typically, the parent company meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from KeyBank. Federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval. A national bank’s dividend-paying capacity is affected by several factors, including net profits (as defined by statute) for the two previous calendar years and for the current year, up to the date of dividend declaration. During the first six months of 2011, KeyBank did not pay any dividends to the parent; however, nonbank subsidiaries paid the parent $45 million in dividends. As of the close of business on June 30, 2011, KeyBank would not have been permitted to pay dividends to the parent without prior regulatory approval. To compensate for the absence of dividends, the parent company has relied upon the issuance of long-term debt and stock. During the first six months of 2011, the parent did not make any capital infusions to KeyBank, compared to $100 million during the first six months of 2010.  The parent company generally maintains cash and short-term investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over the next twenty-four months. At June 30, 2011, the parent company held $1.9 billion in short-term investments, which we projected to be sufficient to repay our maturing debt obligations.  During the first quarter of 2011, the parent company completed a $625 million equity offering at a price of $8.85 per Common Share. In conjunction with the equity offering, the parent company issued $1 billion, 5.1% Senior Medium-Term Notes, Series I, during the first quarter of 2011. The proceeds from the sale of Common Shares and medium-term notes were used, along with other available funds, to repurchase the Series B Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury. The repurchase eliminated future quarterly dividends of $31 million and discount amortization of $4 million, or $140 million on an annual basis, related to these preferred shares.     Our liquidity position and recent activity  Over the past twelve months our liquid asset portfolio has increased, which includes overnight and short-term investments, as well as unencumbered, high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios. Liquidity stress scenarios include the loss of access to either unsecured or secured funding sources, as well as draws on unfunded commitments and significant deposit withdrawals.  From time to time, KeyCorp or its principal subsidiary, KeyBank, may seek to retire, repurchase or exchange outstanding debt, capital securities or preferred stock through cash purchase, privately negotiated transactions or other means. Such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity and capital requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.  We generate cash flows from operations, and from investing and financing activities. During the first six months of 2011, we used the proceeds from our debt and Common Share offerings as well as our securities available for sale portfolio (which we had previously accumulated from loan pay downs and maturities of short-term investments) to repurchase our Series B Preferred Stock issued to the U.S. Treasury as part of the TARP CPP and to pay dividends. As previously noted, the repurchase eliminated future quarterly dividends of $31 million and discount amortization of $4 million, or $140 million on an annual basis, related to these preferred shares.  The consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for each three month period ended June 30, 2011 and 2010.  104    Table of Contents     Credit ratings  Our credit ratings at June 30, 2011 are shown in Figure 30. We believe that these credit ratings, under normal conditions in the capital markets, will enable the parent company or KeyBank to issue fixed income securities to investors. Conditions in the credit markets have materially improved relative to the disruption experienced between the latter part of 2007 and 2009; however, while credit is more readily available, the cost of funds remains higher than what was experienced prior to the market disruption.  If our credit ratings fall below investment-grade, that event could have a material adverse effect on us. Such downgrades could adversely affect access to liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us. Ultimately, credit ratings downgrades could adversely affect our business operations and reduce our ability to generate income.  In the fourth quarter of 2010, Moody’s (a credit rating agency that rates KeyCorp and KeyBank debt securities) announced a one notch downgrade of KeyBanks’s short-term borrowings, senior long-term debt, and subordinated debt. As a result of this decision by Moody’s, on March 7, 2011, KeyBank transferred approximately $1.5 billion of certain escrow deposit balances to an acceptably-rated institution which resulted in an immaterial impairment of the related mortgage servicing assets. For more information regarding this transfer of escrow deposit balances see Note 8 (“Mortgage Servicing Assets”).  Figure 30.

Like other financial services institutions, we make loans, extend credit, purchase securities and enter into financial derivative contracts, all of which have related credit risk.     Credit policy, approval and evaluation  We manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program. The Credit Risk Committee approves both retail and commercial credit policies. These policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit. For more information about our credit policies, as well as related approval and evaluation processes, see the section entitled “Credit policy, approval and evaluation” on page 79 of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We maintain an active concentration management program to encourage diversification in our credit portfolios. For individual obligors, we employ a sliding scale of exposure, known as hold limits, which is dictated by the strength of the borrower. Our legal lending limit is approximately $2 billion for any individual borrower. However, internal hold limits generally restrict the largest exposures to less than 20% of that amount. As of June 30, 2011, we had two client relationships with loan commitments net of credit default swaps of more than $200 million. The average amount outstanding on these two individual net obligor commitments was $90 million at June 30, 2011. In general, our philosophy is to maintain a diverse portfolio with regard to credit exposures.  We actively manage the overall loan portfolio in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives, including the use of credit derivatives — primarily credit default swaps — to mitigate credit risk. Credit default swaps enable us to transfer a portion of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit to a third party. At June 30, 2011, we used credit default swaps with a notional amount of $810 million to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending obligations. We also sell credit derivatives — primarily index credit default swaps — to diversify and manage portfolio concentration and  105    Table of Contents  correlation risks. At June 30, 2011, the notional amount of credit default swaps sold by us for the purpose of diversifying our credit exposure was $345 million. Occasionally, we have provided credit protection to other lenders through the sale of credit default swaps. These transactions with other lenders generated fee income.  Credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Related gains or losses, as well as the premium paid or received for credit protection, are included in the trading income component of noninterest income. These swaps decreased our operating results by $9 million for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2011 and 2010.  We also manage the loan portfolio using portfolio swaps and bulk purchases and sales. Our overarching goal is to manage the loan portfolio within a specified range of asset quality.  Selected asset quality statistics for each of the past five quarters are presented in Figure 31. The factors that drive these statistics are discussed in the remainder of this section.  Figure 31.

Watch and criticized assets  Watch assets are troubled commercial loans with the potential to deteriorate in quality due to the client’s current financial condition and possible inability to perform in accordance with the terms of the underlying contract. Criticized assets are troubled loans and other assets that show additional signs of weakness that may lead, or have led, to an interruption in scheduled repayments from primary sources, potentially requiring us to rely on repayment from secondary sources, such as collateral liquidation. Criticized loan and lease outstandings showed improvement during the second quarter of 2011 decreasing 12.3% from the first quarter of 2011 and 44.4% from the year ago quarter.     Allowance for loan and lease losses  At June 30, 2011, the allowance for loan and lease losses was $1.2 billion, or 2.57% of loans, compared to $2.2 billion, or 4.16%, at June 30, 2010. The allowance includes $46 million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of $488 million at June 30, 2011, compared to $157 million that was allocated for impaired loans of $1.1 billion one year ago. For more information about impaired loans, see Note 4 (“Asset Quality”). At June 30, 2011, the allowance for loan and lease losses was 146.08% of nonperforming loans, compared to 130.30% at June 30, 2010.  We estimate the appropriate level of the allowance for loan and lease losses on at least a quarterly basis. The methodology used is described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses” on page 102 of our 2010 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Briefly, we apply historical loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions, changes in credit policies or underwriting standards, and changes in the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets. For all TDRs, regardless of size, as well as impaired loans having an outstanding balance greater than $2.5 million, we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss content and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate. A specific allowance also may be assigned — even when sources of repayment appear sufficient — if we remain uncertain about whether the loan will be repaid in full. The allowance for loan and lease losses at June 30, 2011, represents our best estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date.  As shown in Figure 32, our allowance for loan and lease losses decreased by $989 billion, or 45%, during the past twelve months. This contraction was associated with the improvement in credit quality of the loan portfolio, which has trended  106    Table of Contents  more favorably the past twelve months. Asset quality is improving and has resulted in favorable risk rating migration and a reduction in our general allowance. Our delinquency trends continue to decline while our roll rates keep improving. We attribute this to a more moderate level of economic activity, more favorable conditions in the capital markets, improvement in client income statements and continued run off in our exit loan portfolio. Our liability for credit losses on lending-related commitments decreased by $52 million to $57 million at June 30, 2011, compared to the same period one year ago. When combined with our allowance for loan and lease losses, our total allowance for credit losses represented 2.69% of loans at the end of the second quarter of 2011 compared to 4.36% at the end of the second quarter of 2010. We anticipate further reductions in the level of our allowance for loan and lease losses for the balance of 2011 as a result of our expectation of lower levels of net charge-offs and nonperforming loans as the economy continues to show signs of improvement.

Our provision for loan and lease losses was a credit of $8 million for the second quarter of 2011, compared to a provision of $228 million for the year-ago quarter. Our net loan charge-offs for the second quarter of 2011 exceeded the credit provision for loan and lease losses by $142 million. The decrease in our provision is due to the improving credit quality we have experienced in most of our loan portfolios and the reduction of our outstanding loan balances. Additionally, we continue to work our exit loans through the credit cycle, and reduce exposure in our higher-risk businesses including the residential properties portion of our construction loan portfolio, Marine/RV financing, and other selected leasing portfolios through the sale of certain loans, payments from borrowers or net charge-offs. As these outstanding loan balances decrease, so does their required allowance for loan and lease losses and corresponding provision.  107    Table of Contents     Net loan charge-offs  Net loan charge-offs for the second quarter of 2011 totaled $134 million, or 1.11% of average loans from continuing operations. These results compare to net charge-offs of $435 million, or 3.18%, for the same period last year. Figure 33 shows the trend in our net loan charge-offs by loan type, while the composition of loan charge-offs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in Figure 34.  Over the past twelve months, net charge-offs in the commercial loan portfolio decreased by $275 million, due primarily to commercial real estate related credits within the Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services line of business. Net charge-offs for this line of business declined by $136 million from the second quarter of 2010 and decreased $47 million from the first quarter of 2011. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2010, net loan charge-offs in the commercial loan portfolio decreased by $96 million which was attributable to declines in both the real estate — commercial mortgage and commercial, financial and agricultural portfolios. As shown in Figure 36, our exit loan portfolio accounted for $25 million, or 19%, of total net loan charge-offs for the second quarter of 2011. Our net loan charge-offs have declined each of the past six quarters and are at their lowest level since the first quarter of 2008.  Figure 33.

These assets totaled $950 million at June 30, 2011, and represented 1.98% of portfolio loans, OREO and other nonperforming assets, compared to $1.3 billion, or 2.66%, at December 31, 2010, and $2.1 billion, or 3.88%, at June 30, 2010. Nonperforming assets were down over $1.8 billion from their peak at September 30, 2009. Nonperforming assets are less than a billion dollars for the first time since December 31, 2007.

These concessions are made to improve the collectability of the loan and generally take the form of a reduction of the interest rate, extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance.    As shown in Figure 35, nonperforming assets decreased during the second quarter of 2011 which represents the seventh consecutive quarterly decline. Most of the reduction came from nonperforming loans held for sale and OREO in the commercial real estate lines of business. As shown in Figure 36, our exit loan portfolio accounted for $126 million, or 13%, of total nonperforming assets at June 30, 2011, compared to $145 million, or 13%, at March 31, 2011.  At June 30, 2011, the carrying amount of our commercial nonperforming loans outstanding represented 57% of their contractual amount owed, and total nonperforming loans outstanding represented 64% of their contractual amount owed and nonperforming assets in total were carried at 60% of their original contractual amount.  At June 30, 2011, our 20 largest nonperforming loans totaled $276 million, representing 33% of total nonperforming loans.  Figure 36 shows the composition of our exit loan portfolio at June 30, 2011 and March 31, 2011, the net charge-offs recorded on this portfolio for the second quarter of 2011 and the first quarter of 2011, and the nonperforming status of these loans at June 30, 2011 and March 31, 2011. The exit loan portfolio represented 10% of total loans and loans held for sale at June 30, 2011.

The types of activity that caused the change in our nonperforming loans during each of the last five quarters are summarized in Figure 38. As shown in this figure, nonperforming loans experienced another quarterly decrease as charge-offs decreased for the sixth consecutive quarter and loans sold and payments received on nonperforming loans increased in the second quarter of 2011 as compared to the second quarter of 2010, as market liquidity improved.  111    Table of Contents  Figure 38.

As shown in this figure, the decrease in the second quarter of 2011 from the first quarter of 2011 and the second quarter of 2010 was primarily attributable to a decrease in properties acquired through foreclosure or voluntary transfer from the borrower. We were successful in liquidating OREO at net gains resulting in a $3 million credit to OREO expense for the second quarter of 2011.  Figure 40.

Operational risk also encompasses compliance risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules and regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards. Due to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, large financial companies like Key will be subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation due to their systemic importance. This heightened level of regulation will increase our operational risk. We have created work teams to respond to and analyze the new regulatory requirements imposed upon us and that will be promulgated as a result of the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. Resulting operational risk losses and/or additional regulatory compliance costs could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation or forgone opportunities. We seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk, alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance, a system of internal controls and reporting.  112    Table of Contents  We continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with laws, rules and regulations, and to improve the oversight of our operational risk. For example, an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses. This tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action. We also rely upon software programs designed to assist in the assessment of operational risk and monitoring our control processes. This technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the Board of Directors.  Primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business. Our Operational Risk Management function manages the Operational Risk Management Program which provides the framework for the structure, governance, roles and responsibilities as well as the content to manage operational risk for Key. The Operational Risk Committee, a senior management committee, oversees our level of operational risk, and directs and supports our operational infrastructure and related activities. This committee and the Operational Risk Management function are an integral part of our ERM Program. Our Risk Review function periodically assesses the overall effectiveness of our Operational Risk Management Program and our system of internal controls. Risk Review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the Audit Committee, and independently supports the Audit Committee’s oversight of these controls.     Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk  The information presented in the “Market risk management” section of the Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition & Results of Operations, is incorporated herein by reference.     Item 4. Controls and Procedures  As of the end of the period covered by this report, KeyCorp carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of KeyCorp’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of KeyCorp’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, KeyCorp’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, as of the end of the period covered by this report, in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. No changes were made to KeyCorp’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, KeyCorp’s internal control over financial reporting.
