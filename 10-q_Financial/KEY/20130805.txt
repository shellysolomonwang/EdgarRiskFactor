Economic overview  The economy grew at a significantly slower pace in the second quarter of 2013, as consumer spending weakened and multiple factors subtracted from GDP. Manufacturing took a step back, with business conditions softening and production slowing sharply. Most metrics recovered somewhat in June which may indicate that the decline will be temporary. The trade deficit widened in the second quarter, as exports weakened and imports gained strength, resulting in a net drag on growth. While sequestration has had less of an impact than expected, federal outlays posted another sharp decline and government spending subtracted from GDP for the third consecutive quarter.  As noted, the slower pace of growth in consumption was an important factor weighing on GDP. Weakness was due in part to a significant decline in spending on utilities, primarily resulting from the surge in cold weather-related spending that occurred in the first quarter of 2013. Consistent with much of the recovery to date, spending on durable goods led gains, with strength concentrated in autos. Vehicle sales averaged 15.3 million units in the second quarter, in-line with the first quarter of 2013, but surged to 15.9 million units in June. Retail sales excluding autos were fairly weak, averaging growth of just 0.1% per month, down from 0.3% in the first quarter. Consumer confidence improved further in the second quarter of 2013, benefiting from strong gains in equity prices and continued progress in housing. The Conference Board measure of confidence ended the quarter at 81.4%, up nearly 20 points from the March reading of 61.9%. Energy prices were somewhat volatile through the second quarter of 2013, but inflation trended lower, providing another boost to confidence and consumption. Core personal consumption expenditures were up just 1.1% year-over-year as of May 2013.    88    Table of Contents In spite of this sluggish economic backdrop, the labor market continued its recovery, with 589,000 jobs added in the second quarter of 2013 (broadly in-line with performance over the past several quarters). Gains, however, remain concentrated in lower wage and part-time employment, which is keeping downward pressure on wage growth. Unemployment was unchanged at 7.6%, as an expanding labor force offset growth in household employment. Participation remains disconcertingly low, but did move a bit higher in June 2013 to 63.5%.  The housing market made further progress in the second quarter of 2013, despite a modest retreat in housing starts. As of May 2013, sales were up over 15% year-over-year for existing homes and 38% for new homes. Driven by continued improvement in demand and tight inventories, price appreciation accelerated, with the CoreLogic Home Price Index up 12.2% year-over-year in May Investors have played an important role, helping to clear inventory and attract primary buyers in the most distressed markets. In June 2013, housing starts totaled 836,000, well below the March 2013 total of one million, but still up 10% year-over-year. The volatile multifamily segment is largely to blame for the decline in housing starts quarter-over-quarter.  Speculation around the potential Federal Reserve tapering of asset purchases drove interest rates sharply higher in May and June. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury started the quarter at just 1.87%, and ended the quarter 65 basis points higher, at 2.52%. The content and tone of Federal Reserve communications were a significant factor, with rates rising far more than the economic data would suggest.   Long-term financial goals  Our long-term financial goals are as follows:      ¿   Target a loan-to-core deposit ratio range of 90% to 100%;      ¿   Maintain a moderate risk profile by targeting a net charge-off ratio range of .40% to .60%;      ¿   Grow high quality and diverse revenue streams by targeting a net interest margin in excess of 3.50%, and ratio of noninterest income to total revenue of greater than 40%;      ¿   Create positive operating leverage and target a cash efficiency ratio in the range of 60% to 65%; and      ¿   Achieve a return on average assets in the range of 1.00% to 1.25%.

The after-tax realized gain which was originally estimated to be $145 million to $155 million is now expected to be in the range of $100 million to $115 million. The cash portion of the gain will be between $75 million and $90 million. The difference from the original estimate is due to higher than expected client attrition that has taken place during the consent process. We have received no objection from the Federal Reserve to use the cash portion of the gain for Common Share repurchases. The Board intends to consider these additional Common Share repurchases at its September meeting.      ¿   We acquired substantially all third-party commercial loan servicing rights, including CMBS Master, Primary and Special Servicing (as well as Life and other servicing) from Bank of America’s Global Mortgages & Securitized Products business, and entered into a subservicing agreement with Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC related to all CMBS Primary Servicing. This acquisition allows us to leverage our existing platform and dramatically changes the competitive profile of our commercial loan servicing business, positioning us as the third largest servicer of commercial and multi-family loans and the fifth largest special servicer of CMBS in the U.S. The initial closing of this transaction occurred in June 2013 with the final closing expected in the third quarter of 2013.      ¿   We expanded our mobile offering with the launch of new remote deposit capabilities that add accessibility and functionality for both our consumer and commercial clients.      ¿   We continue to make progress on our efficiency initiative. We have realized $171 million in annualized expense savings through the second quarter of 2013, and remain on target to reach our goal of $200 million in annualized savings by the end of 2013. During the second quarter of 2013 we consolidated 33 branches and realigned our Community Bank organization to strengthen our relationship-based business model, while responding to economic factors and evolving client expectations.      ¿    As previously reported, on January 7, 2013, we submitted to the Federal Reserve and provided to the OCC under the annual CCAR process our 2013 capital plan. On March 14, the Federal Reserve announced that it did not object to our 2013 capital plan. Accordingly, at its March 2013 meeting, our Board authorized the repurchase of up to $426 million of our Common Shares in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. During the second quarter we    90    Table of Contents       completed $112 million of Common Share repurchases on the open market under our 2013 capital plan. Common Share repurchases under the new 2013 capital plan authorization are expected to be executed through the first quarter of 2014.      ¿   Our 2013 capital plan also proposed an increase in our quarterly Common Share dividend from $.05 to $.055 per share. Consistent with the 2013 capital plan, the Board, at its May and July 2013 meetings, declared quarterly dividends of $.055 per Common Share for the second and third quarters of 2013, respectively.  Demographics  We have two major business segments: Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank.  Key Community Bank serves individuals and small to mid-sized businesses by offering a variety of deposit, investment, lending, and personalized wealth management products and business advisory services. These products and services are provided through our relationship managers and specialists working in our 13-state branch network, which is organized into three internally defined geographic regions: Rocky Mountains and Northwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast.  Figure 4 shows the geographic diversity of Key Community Bank’s average deposits, commercial loans, and home equity loans.  Figure 4.

Key Corporate Bank is a full-service corporate and investment bank focused principally on serving the needs of middle market clients in six industry sectors: consumer, energy, healthcare, industrial, public sector and real estate. Key Corporate Bank delivers a broad product suite of banking and capital markets products to its clients, including syndicated finance, debt- and equity capital markets, commercial payments, equipment finance, commercial mortgage banking, derivatives, foreign exchange, financial advisory and public finance. Key Corporate Bank also delivers many of its product capabilities to clients of Key Community Bank.  Further information regarding the products and services offered by our Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank segments is included in this report in Note 18 (“Line of Business Results”).    91    Table of Contents Supervision and regulation  Regulatory reform developments  On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act became law. It was intended to address perceived deficiencies and gaps in the regulatory framework for financial services in the U.S., reduce the risks of bank failures, better equip the nation’s regulators to guard against or mitigate any future financial crises, and manage systemic risk through increased supervision of bank and nonbank SIFIs, such as KeyCorp and KeyBank. Further discussion concerning the Dodd-Frank Act, related regulatory developments, and the risks that they present to Key is available in under the heading “Supervision and Regulation” in Item 1. Business and under the heading “II. Compliance Risks” in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2012 Form 10-K. Many of the proposed rules referenced in our prior reports continue to remain pending. The following provides a summary of relevant regulatory developments relating to the Dodd-Frank Act or that relate to our results this quarter.   Supervisory and company-run stress testing  On March 7, 2013, the Federal Reserve published the results of its Dodd-Frank Annual Stress Test (“DFAST”), and on March 14, 2013, the Federal Reserve published the results of its CCAR. Each of these stress tests is required under the Dodd-Frank Act for certain banking organizations, including KeyCorp. On March 8, 2013, KeyCorp and KeyBank published the results of their annual company-run stress tests, which are also required by the Dodd-Frank Act. KeyCorp passed DFAST and, as previously reported, its 2013 capital plan under CCAR was not objected to by the Federal Reserve.  Enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements  On January 5, 2012, the Federal Reserve published proposed Regulation YY – Enhanced Prudential Standards – as part of its efforts to implement enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements to be imposed upon SIFIs pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. It generally applies to SIFIs like KeyCorp and includes a wide range of measures addressing issues such as risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits, liquidity requirements, single-counterparty credit limits, risk management, supervisory and company-run stress testing requirements, and early remediation. On February 22, 2013, the Federal Reserve extended the period for comment on the proposed rule to April 30, 2013. We continue to monitor the implementation of this rule.  Debit card and interchange fees and routing  On July 31, 2013, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a ruling in NACS v. Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, vacating the Federal Reserve’s Final Rule on Debit Card and Interchange Fees and Routing. Retail merchants and merchant groups challenged the Federal Reserve’s final rule, which had allowed debit card issuers to recover from merchants an interchange fee of $.21 per transaction, a fee of five basis points of the value of the transaction and an additional $.01 fraud prevention adjustment. The district court held that this fee structure, and the final rule’s requirements regarding the number of networks over which each debit card transaction can be processed, did not comply with the Durbin Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act. The district court stayed its ruling until the Federal Reserve issues a new rule, and in the meantime will consider whether the Federal Reserve should provide an interim rule. We continue to monitor these developments.  New regulatory capital rules  In July 2013, the Federal banking regulators approved the final Basel III capital framework for U.S. banking organizations (the “Regulatory Capital Rules”). Besides Basel III implementation in the U.S., the Regulatory Capital Rules also address two capital-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act: first, the provision requiring that the general risk-based and leverage capital requirements applicable to FDIC-insured deposit institutions that are not “advanced approaches” depository institutions (such as KeyBank) act as a floor for the requirements applicable to all BHCs (such as KeyCorp) as well as to all “advanced approaches” banking organizations; and, second, the provision requiring that references to external credit ratings be removed from the regulators’ rules and replaced with alternative standards of creditworthiness.  The Regulatory Capital Rules are lengthy and complex, and we are evaluating their impact on Key. In general, however, the Regulatory Capital Rules largely adhere to the NPRs as initially proposed in 2012 and replace the regulators’ Basel I-based general rules with a standardized approach based in substantial part upon the standardized approach in Basel II that was never adopted for U.S. banking organizations. The Regulatory Capital Rules also consolidate into a single regulation, with a single set of definitions used with common meanings, the regulators’ existing general risk-based capital rules, advanced approaches risk-based capital rules, leverage capital rules, and market risk rules.  Based on our preliminary analysis, there are at least three noteworthy changes from the NPRs that are in the Regulatory Capital Rules. The first change relates to the treatment of AOCI. This change permits banking organizations not subject to the advanced approaches provisions, such as Key, to make a one-time permanent election to opt-out of the requirement to include all components of AOCI (excluding accumulated net gains and losses on cash flow hedges related to items that are not fair-valued on the balance sheet) in common equity Tier 1 capital. The second change relates to the risk weightings for residential mortgage loans. Unlike the treatment of such loans under the NPRs that would have applied risk weightings to residential mortgages ranging from 35% to 200% based on the loan’s loan-to-value and product features associated with higher risk, the Regulatory Capital Rules retain the current treatment for such exposures (i.e., 50% risk weight for most first-lien exposures that are prudently underwritten and performing according to their original terms and 100% risk weight for other residential mortgage exposures). The third change relates to the treatment of mortgage servicing assets (“MSAs”). Under the NPRs, the amount of a banking organization’s MSAs that could be included in regulatory capital could not exceed    92    Table of Contents  90% of the fair value of its MSAs. If the amount of MSAs included in regulatory capital (after applying the individual 10% and 15% aggregate common equity Tier 1 deduction thresholds) was greater than 90% of the fair value of a banking organization’s MSAs, then the banking organization would have been required to deduct an additional amount of MSAs from regulatory capital until no more than 90% of the fair value of its MSAs was included. This 90% MSA fair value limitation was eliminated in the Regulatory Capital Rules. However, all amounts of MSAs not deducted under the 10% and 15% common equity Tier 1 deduction thresholds and included in regulatory capital must be assigned a 250% risk weight.  While the Regulatory Capital Rules are effective January 1, 2014, the mandatory compliance date for Key as a “standardized approach” banking organization begins on January 1, 2015 and is subject to transitional provisions extending to January 1, 2019.  New Minimum Capital Requirements  Under the Regulatory Capital Rules, banking organizations subject to the standardized approach provisions, like Key, will be required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in Figure 5, below. At June 30, 2013, Key had a Tier 1 common equity ratio of 11.18% under current Basel I. Also at June 30, 2013, based on the fully phased-in Regulatory Capital Rules, Key estimates that its capital and leverage ratios, after adjustment for market risk, would be as set forth in Figure 5.  Figure 5. Estimated Ratios vs. Minimum Capital Ratios Calculated Under the Fully Phased-In Regulatory Capital Rules                      Ratios (including Capital conservation buffer)    Key 6-30-2013 Estimated      Proposed  Minimum 1-1-2015      Phase-in Period    Proposed  Minimum 1-1-2019     Common Equity Tier 1     10.8  %      4.5  %    None     4.5  %    Capital conservation buffer (a)          —     1/1/16 - 1/1/19     2.5     Common Equity Tier 1 + Capital conservation buffer          4.5     1/1/16 - 1/1/19     7.0     Tier 1 Capital     11.1       6.0     None     6.0     Tier 1 Capital + Capital conservation buffer          4.5     1/1/16 - 1/1/19     8.5     Total Capital     12.2       8.0     None     8.0     Total Capital + Capital conservation buffer          8.0     1/1/16 - 1/1/19     10.5     Leverage (b)     10.3       4.0     None     4.0              (a) Capital conservation buffer must consist of Common Equity Tier 1 capital.

(b) Key is not subject to the proposed 3% supplemental leverage ratio requirement imposed under the advanced approaches portion of the Regulatory Capital Rules.  Revised Prompt Corrective Action Standards  Under the Regulatory Capital Final Rules, the prompt corrective action capital category threshold ratios applicable to FDIC-insured depository institutions, such as KeyBank will be revised effective January 1, 2015. Figure 6 identifies the proposed capital category threshold ratios for a well capitalized and an adequately capitalized institution under current law and the Regulatory Capital Rules.  Figure 6. Revised Prompt Corrective Action Well Capitalized and Adequately Capitalized Capital Category Ratios  under the Regulatory Capital Rules                         Prompt Corrective Action   Capital Category        Well Capitalized     Adequately Capitalized    Ratio    Final Rule     Current      Final Rule     Current           Common Equity Tier 1 Risk-Based     6.5  %      N/A       4.5  %      N/A     Tier 1 Risk-Based     8.0       6.0  %      6.0       4.0  %    Total Risk-Based     10.0       10.0       8.0       8.0     Tier 1 Leverage     5.0       5.0       4.0       3.0 or 4.0          We believe that, as of June 30, 2013, KeyCorp and KeyBank would meet all capital adequacy requirements under the Regulatory Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis if such requirements were currently effective. As previously indicated, the prompt corrective action requirements only apply to FDIC-insured depository institutions and not to BHCs. Nevertheless, if such prompt corrective action capital categories applied to BHCs, we believe that KeyCorp would meet all prompt corrective action capital and leverage ratio requirements for a well-capitalized capital category at June 30, 2013, under the Regulatory Capital Rules on a fully phased-in basis if such requirements were currently effective.    93    Table of Contents New Assessments, Fees and Other Charges  As previously reported, Section 318 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires the Federal Reserve to charge SIFIs and institutions regulated by it new assessments, fees and other charges in connection with their examination, supervision, and regulation of such companies. On April 18, 2013, the Federal Reserve published a proposed rule to establish an annual assessment of SIFIs. The proposed rule outlines how the Federal Reserve would determine which companies are assessed, estimate the total expenses that are necessary or appropriate to carry out its supervisory and regulatory responsibilities for such companies, determine the amount of each company's assessment, and bill for and collect the assessments. Under the proposal, each calendar year would be an assessment period. The Federal Reserve would notify each company of the amount of its assessment no later than July 15 of the year following the assessment period. Payments would be due by September 30. Under the proposal, 2012 would be the first assessment period and payments would not be collected until the rule is finalized. Using the methodologies in the proposal, the Federal Reserve estimates that for 2012 there would be approximately 70 companies assessed and the Federal Reserve would collect a total of approximately $440 million. Key estimates that its initial assessment under the proposed rule would be approximately $1.7—$2.0 million. The comment period on the proposed rule expired on June 16, 2013.  Highlights of Our Performance  Financial performance  For the second quarter of 2013, we announced net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $193 million, or $.21 per Common Share. Our second quarter of 2013 results compare to net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $217 million, or $.23 per Common Share, for the second quarter of 2012.  Our taxable-equivalent net interest income was $586 million for the second quarter of 2013, and the net interest margin was 3.13%. These results compare to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $544 million and a net interest margin of 3.06% for the second quarter of 2012. Net interest income increased $42 million or 7.7% when compared to second quarter of 2012. Recognizing that asset yields remain under pressure and given our higher levels of liquidity, we expect the net interest margin to experience modest pressure in the range of one to three basis points per quarter in the second half of the year.  Our noninterest income was $429 million for the second quarter of 2013, compared to $457 million for the year-ago quarter. Operating lease income and other leasing gains decreased $39 million primarily due to a $31 million gain on the early terminations of leveraged leases one year ago, and net gains (losses) from principal investing decreased by $17 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in investment banking and debt placement fees and cards and payments income of $11 million each, and an increase in trust and investment services income of $10 million.  Our noninterest expense was $711 million for the second quarter of 2013, compared to $693 million for the same period last year. Personnel expense increased $29 million due to an increase in severance expense primarily associated with our efficiency initiative and higher incentive compensation expense accruals. Nonpersonnel expense decreased $11 million from one year ago. Business services and professional fees declined $14 million, and marketing expense and OREO expense each decreased $6 million. These declines were partially offset by an increase in net occupancy of $10 million primarily due to charges related to the consolidation of 33 branches during the second quarter of 2013. Intangible asset amortization on credit cards and other intangible asset amortization associated with the third quarter 2012 acquisitions of the credit card portfolio and 37 branches in Western New York also increased $9 million in total.  We continue to make progress on our efficiency initiative. We have realized $171 million in annualized expense savings through the second quarter of 2013, and remain on target to reach our goal of $200 million in annualized savings by the end of 2013. During the second quarter of 2013, we consolidated 33 branches and realigned our Community Bank organization around our core relationship strategy to drive profitability.  Average loans were $52.7 billion for the second quarter of 2013, an increase of $3.3 billion or 6.6% compared to the second quarter of 2012. Commercial, financial and agricultural loans grew by $2.9 billion over the year-ago quarter, with strong growth across Key’s business segments. In addition, the third quarter 2012 credit card portfolio and Western New York branch acquisitions added $1 billion of mostly consumer loans. This growth was partially offset by declines in the commercial real estate portfolio, the equipment lease portfolio, which included the early termination of certain leveraged leases in the exit portfolio in 2012, and run-off of consumer loans in the designated exit portfolio. Our outlook for loan growth remains positive and consistent with our prior guidance of mid-single digit growth for the year driven by commercial,    94    Table of Contents  financial and agricultural loans. We anticipate average earning assets for the balance of 2013 to be relatively flat with the second quarter 2013 level of $75.2 billion.  Average deposits, excluding deposits in foreign office, totaled $64.9 billion for the second quarter of 2013, an increase of $4.6 billion compared to the year-ago quarter. The growth reflects an increase in demand deposits of $2.7 billion and interest-bearing non-time deposits of $4.2 billion (including the impact of Key’s third quarter 2012 Western New York branch acquisition, which added $2 billion of mostly interest-bearing nontime deposits). This deposit growth was partially offset by $2.3 billion of run-off from one year ago in certificates of deposit and other time deposits.  Our provision for loan and lease losses was $28 million for the second quarter of 2013, compared to $21 million for the year-ago quarter. Our allowance for loan and lease losses was $876 million, or 1.65% of total period-end loans at June 30, 2013, compared to 1.79% at June 30, 2012.  At June 30, 2013, our nonperforming loans totaled $652 million and represented 1.23% of period-end portfolio loans, compared to 1.32% at June 30, 2012. Nonperforming assets at June 30, 2013, totaled $693 million and represented 1.30% of period-end portfolio loans and OREO and other nonperforming assets, compared to 1.51% at June 30, 2012. OREO balances declined $10 million from one year ago to $18 million at June 30, 2013.  Our capital ratios remain strong. Our tangible common equity, Tier 1 common equity and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios at June 30, 2013, are 9.96%, 11.18%, and 11.93%, respectively, compared to 10.44%, 11.63%, and 12.45%, respectively, at June 30, 2012. We have continued to return capital to our shareholders by repurchasing Common Shares and through our quarterly Common Share dividend. In the second quarter, we repurchased $112 million of Common Shares under our 2013 capital plan.  Figure 7 shows our continuing and discontinued operating results for the current, past and year-ago quarters. Our financial performance for each of the past five quarters is summarized in Figure 1.

In September 2009, we decided to discontinue the education lending business conducted through Key Education Resources, the education payment and financing unit of KeyBank National Association. In February 2013, we announced an agreement to sell Victory to a private equity fund. As a result of these decisions, Key has accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations. The income (loss) from discontinued operations for the periods presented was primarily attributable to fair value adjustments related to the education lending securitization trusts.      (b) EPS may not foot due to rounding.  Figure 8 presents certain non-GAAP financial measures related to “tangible common equity,” “return on tangible common equity” and “Tier 1 common equity.” Tier 1 common equity, a non-GAAP financial measure, is a component of Tier 1 risk-based capital. Tier 1 common equity is not formally defined by GAAP or prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations applicable to us before January 1, 2015. However, since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity and Tier 1 common equity, we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases. Figure 8 also reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures.  Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and BHC capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. Since early 2009, the Federal Reserve has focused its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 common equity. Because the Federal Reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders’ equity (essentially Tier 1 risk-based capital less preferred    95    Table of Contents  stock, qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in Tier 1 risk-based capital, this focus on Tier 1 common equity is consistent with existing capital adequacy categories. The newly adopted Regulatory Capital Rules, described in more detail under the section “Supervision and regulation” of this report, also make Tier 1 common equity a priority. The Regulatory Capital Rules change the regulatory capital standards that apply to BHCs by phasing out the treatment of trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred securities as Tier 1 eligible capital. By 2016, our trust preferred securities will only be included in Tier 2 capital.  The table also shows the computation for pre-provision net revenue, which is not formally defined by GAAP. We believe that eliminating the effects of the provision for loan and lease losses makes it easier to analyze our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis.  The cash efficiency ratio and adjusted cash efficiency ratio are ratios of two non-GAAP performance measures. As such, there are no directly comparable GAAP performance measures. The cash efficiency ratio performance measure removes the impact of our intangible asset amortization from the calculation. The adjusted cash efficiency ratio further removes the impact of the efficiency initiative charges. We believe these ratios provide greater consistency and comparability between our results and those of our peer banks. Additionally, these ratios are used by analysts and investors as they develop earnings forecasts and peer bank analysis.  Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.    96    Table of Contents Figure 8.

Results of Operations  Net interest income  One of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets (such as loans and securities) and loan-related fee income, and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. There are several factors that affect net interest income, including:      ¿   the volume, pricing, mix and maturity of earning assets, and interest-bearing liabilities;      ¿   the volume and value of net free funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and equity capital;      ¿   the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk;      ¿   interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace; and      ¿   asset quality.  To make it easier to compare results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets (some taxable, some not), we present net interest income in this discussion on a “taxable-equivalent basis” (i.e., as if it were all taxable and at the same rate). For example, $100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as $154, an amount that — if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% — would yield $100.  Figure 9 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense, and their respective yields or rates over the past five quarters. This figure also presents a reconciliation of taxable-equivalent net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with GAAP for each of those quarters. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized taxable-equivalent net interest income by average earning assets.  Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $586 million for the second quarter of 2013, and the net interest margin was 3.13%. These results compare to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $544 million and a net interest margin of 3.06% for the second quarter of 2012. The increase in the net interest margin was primarily a result of a change in funding mix from the redemption of certain trust preferred securities, maturity of long-term debt, and maturity of higher-costing certificates of deposit over the past year.  Compared to the first quarter of 2013, taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $3 million, and the net interest margin declined by 11 basis points. The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to lower replacement yields on new loans and investments as compared to the yield on maturing loans and investments. This decline was partially offset by an increase in average earning asset balances and a higher day count in the second quarter. The decline in the net interest margin was largely attributable to a six basis point impact from lower loan yields and fees as well as a five basis point impact from higher levels of liquidity and securities. The net interest margin was also negatively impacted by approximately two basis points from the termination and maturity of $4.4 billion of interest rate swaps that were not replaced, as Key continues to increase its asset sensitivity to be better positioned for a rise in short-term interest rates.      99    Table of Contents Average earning assets for the second quarter of 2013 totaled $75.2 billion, compared to $71.9 billion for the second quarter of 2012. The increase was primarily attributable to commercial, financial and agricultural loans, which grew by $2.9 billion from the year-ago quarter. In addition, the credit card portfolio and Western New York branch acquisitions in the third quarter of 2012 added $1 billion of mostly consumer loans. This growth was partially offset by managed declines in the commercial real estate portfolio, the commercial lease financing portfolio, which included the early termination of certain leveraged leases in the exit portfolio in 2012, and run-off of consumer loans in the designated exit portfolio.  As shown in Figure 9, the yield was impacted by lower spreads on commercial loans, lower security yields, and an increase in lower yielding short-term investments.    100    Table of Contents Figure 9.

Noninterest income  As shown in Figure 11, noninterest income was $429 million for the second quarter of 2013, compared to $457 million for the year-ago quarter, a decrease of $28 million, or 6.1%. Operating lease income and other leasing gains decreased $39 million primarily due to a $31 million gain on the early terminations of leveraged leases one year ago, and net gains (losses) from principal investing decreased by $17 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in investment banking and debt placement fees and cards and payments income of $11 million each, and the increase in trust and investment services income of $10 million.  For the six months ended June 30, 2013, noninterest income decreased $45 million, or 5.0% from the same period one year ago. Operating lease income and other leasing gains decreased $68 million primarily due to a $51 million gain on the early terminations of leveraged leases in the prior year. Net gains (losses) from principal investing also declined $44 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in investment banking and debt placement fees of $29 million, cards and payments income of $19 million, trust and investment services income of $9 million, and other income of $12 million.    103    Table of Contents Figure 11.

For the quarter ended June 30, 2012, fixed income and equity securities trading activities constitute the majority of this amount. Income related to foreign exchange, interest rate derivative trading, and credit portfolio management was less than $1 million.      (b) The allocation between proprietary and nonproprietary is made based upon whether the trade is conducted for the benefit of Key or Key's clients rather than based upon the proposed rulemaking under the Volcker Rule. The prohibitions and restrictions on proprietary trading activities contemplated by the Volcker Rule and the rules proposed thereunder are not yet final. Therefore, the ultimate impact of the rules proposed under the Volcker Rule is not yet known.  The following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest income and the factors that caused those elements to change.    104    Table of Contents Trust and investment services income  Trust and investment services income is our largest source of noninterest income and consists of brokerage commissions, trust and asset management commissions, and insurance income. The assets under management that primarily generate these revenues are shown in Figure 13. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, trust and investment services income increased $10 million, or 11.1% and $9 million, or 4.8%, respectively, as compared to the same periods one year ago.  A significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management. At June 30, 2013, our bank, trust and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of $35.5 billion, compared to $35.1 billion at June 30, 2012. As shown in Figure 13, an increase in the equity portfolio was partially offset by decreases in the securities lending, fixed income, and money market portfolios. Our securities lending business has been declining due to our de-emphasis of this business resulting in lower transaction volumes, client departures, and fewer assets under management.  Figure 13.

Operating lease income and other leasing gains  Operating lease income and other leasing gains decreased $39 million, or 67.2%, for the second quarter of 2013 and $68 million, or 61.8% for the six months ended June 30, 2013 as compared to the same periods one year ago. The decreases were primarily due to gains on the early termination of leveraged leases for the same periods one year ago. Product run-off also contributed to the decline in operating lease income and other leasing gains. Accordingly, as shown in Figure 14, operating lease expense also declined.  Cards and payments income  Cards and payments income, which consists of debit card, consumer and commercial credit card, and merchant services income, increased $11 million, or 35.5%, from the year-ago quarter and $19 million, or 31.7% for the six months ended June 30, 2013, primarily due to the third quarter 2012 credit card portfolio acquisition.  Other income  Other income, which consists of gain on sale of certain loans; mortgage servicing revenue, net of amortization; other service charges; and certain dealer trading income, decreased $2 million, or 7.1% from the year-ago quarter. Other income increased $12 million, or 26.1%, for the six months ended June 30, 2013 as compared to the same period one year ago due to favorable results across several income categories.    105    Table of Contents Noninterest expense  As shown in Figure 14, noninterest expense was $711 million for the second quarter of 2013, compared to $693 million for the year-ago quarter, representing an increase of $18 million or 2.6%. Personnel expense increased $29 million due to an increase in severance expense primarily associated with our efficiency initiative and higher incentive compensation accruals. Nonpersonnel expense decreased $11 million from one year ago. Business services and professional fees declined $14 million, and marketing expense and OREO expense each decreased $6 million. These declines were partially offset by an increase in net occupancy of $10 million primarily due to charges related to the consolidation of 33 branches during the second quarter of 2013. Intangible asset amortization on credit cards and other intangible asset amortization associated with the third quarter 2012 acquisitions of the credit card portfolio and 37 branches in Western New York also increased $9 million in total.  The amount of noninterest expense for the second quarter of 2013 attributable to our 2012 acquisitions was $26 million spread across several expense categories, including $3 million of personnel expense, $9 million of intangible asset amortization, and $5 million of loan servicing fees. During the second quarter of 2013, costs associated with our efficiency initiative totaling $37 million were also incurred.  For the six months ended June 30, 2013, noninterest expense increased $20 million, or 1.5% compared to the same period one year ago. Personnel expense increased $48 million due to an increase in severance expense primarily associated with our efficiency initiative, as well as increases due to annual merit and incentive compensation. Nonpersonnel expense decreased $28 million from one year ago. Business services and professional fees declined $16 million, marketing expense decreased $13 million, and OREO expense and operating lease expense were each $9 million lower. These declines were partially offset by an increase in intangible asset amortization of $20 million as a result of the 2012 acquisitions of the credit card portfolio and Western New York branches. Net occupancy also increased $10 million primarily due to charges related to the consolidation of 38 branches during the first half of 2013.  The amount of noninterest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2013, attributable to our 2012 acquisitions was $54 million spread across several expense categories, including $7 million of personnel expense, $20 million of intangible asset amortization, and $10 million of loan servicing fees. For the six months ended June 30, 2013, costs associated with our efficiency initiative totaling $52 million were also incurred.  Figure 14.

The following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest expense and the factors that caused those elements to change.   Personnel  As shown in Figure 15, personnel expense, the largest category of our noninterest expense, increased by $29 million, or 7.7%, when compared to the year-ago quarter. Severance expense increased $15 million, or 500% as a result of staff reductions related to our efficiency initiative. Incentive compensation accruals also increased $11 million, or 16.7%. Higher    106    Table of Contents  levels of contract labor on technology initiatives resulted in a $6 million, or 46.2% increase. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation of $4 million, or 30.8%. For the six months ended June 30, 2013, personnel expense increased $48 million, or 6.4% compared to the same period one year ago. Personnel expense increases included incentive compensation accruals of $24 million, or 19%, severance expense of $20 million, or 285.7%, and technology contract labor of $12 million, or 48%. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation of $7 million, or 26.9% when compared to the same period one year ago.  Figure 15.

These declines were attributable to product run-off. Income related to the rental of leased equipment is presented in Figure 11 as “operating lease income and other leasing gains.”  Intangible asset amortization  Intangible asset amortization increased $9 million compared to the year-ago quarter and $20 million for the six months ended June 30, 2013, as compared to the same period one year ago as a result of the 2012 acquisitions of the credit card portfolio and 37 branches in Western New York.  Other expense  Other expense is comprised of various miscellaneous expense items. The $5 million, or 6.3% increase in the current quarter compared to the year-ago quarter and the $7 million, or 4% decrease in the first six months of 2013 as compared to the same period one year ago reflects fluctuations in several of those line items.  Income taxes  We recorded tax expense from continuing operations of $72 million for the second quarter of 2013, $70 million for the first quarter of 2013 and $54 million for the second quarter of 2012. For the first six months of 2013, we recorded tax expense from continuing operations of $142 million compared to tax expense of $127 million for the same period last year.  Our federal tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate, primarily because we generate income from investments in tax-advantaged assets, such as corporate-owned life insurance, earn credits associated with investments in low-income housing projects, and make periodic adjustments to our tax reserves.  Additional information pertaining to how our tax expense (benefit) and the resulting effective tax rates were derived are included in Note 12 (“Income Taxes”) on page 175 of our 2012 Form 10-K.    107    Table of Contents Line of Business Results  This section summarizes the financial performance and related strategic developments of our two major business segments (operating segments), Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. Note 18 (“Line of Business Results”) describes the products and services offered by each of these business segments, provides more detailed financial information pertaining to the segments and explains “Other Segments” and “Reconciling Items.”  Figure 16 summarizes the contribution made by each major business segment to our “taxable-equivalent revenue from continuing operations” and “income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Key” for the three- and six-month periods ended June 30, 2013 and 2012.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income increased by $1 million, or .3%, from the second quarter of 2012. Average loans and leases grew 10.4% while average deposits increased 3.2% from one year ago. The Western New York branch and credit card portfolio acquisitions contributed $30 million to net interest income, $1 billion to average loans and leases, and $2 billion to deposits. The positive contribution to net interest income from the acquisitions was partially offset by a lower earnings credit applied to deposits in the current period compared to the same period one year ago as a result of the continued low-rate environment.  Noninterest income increased by $17 million, or 9.4%, from the year-ago quarter. Cards and payments income increased $11 million as a result of the third quarter 2012 credit card portfolio acquisition. Trust and investment services income increased $7 million, primarily due to an increase in assets under management resulting from strong market performance and increased production.  The provision for loan and lease losses was a charge of $41 million compared to a credit of $4 million for the second quarter of 2012. Net loan charge-offs, including the 2012 credit card portfolio acquisition, decreased $4 million from the same period one year ago.    108    Table of Contents Noninterest expense increased by $1 million, or .2% from the year-ago quarter. Expense reductions resulting from Key’s efficiency initiative substantially offset the increase in expenses associated with our third quarter 2012 Western New York branch and credit card portfolio acquisitions.

placement fees were up $13 million, or 18.8% from the prior year    •   Average loan balances up 8.6% from the prior year    •   Average deposits up 25.7% from the prior year  As shown in Figure 18, Key Corporate Bank recorded net income attributable to Key of $117 million for the second quarter of 2013, compared to $95 million for the same period one year ago.  Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $1 million, or .5% compared to the second quarter of 2012. Average earning assets increased $1.5 billion, or 7.2%, from the year-ago quarter, driving a $2 million increase in earning asset spread. Average deposit balances increased $3.2 billion, or 25.7%, from the year-ago quarter, driven by the continued execution of health care strategies and increase in public sector deposits. However, these increases in balances were offset by declines in the deposit spread as a result of the continued low-rate environment.    109    Table of Contents Noninterest income increased by $6 million, or 3.3%, from the second quarter of 2012. Investment banking and debt placement fees increased $13 million, partially offset by a decrease in operating lease income and other leasing gains of $8 million compared to the year-ago quarter.  The provision for loan and lease losses was a credit of $10 million compared to a charge of $4 million for the second quarter of 2012. There were net loan recoveries of $6 million for the second quarter of 2013 compared to net loan charge-offs of $9 million for the same period one year ago.  Noninterest expense decreased by $11 million, or 5.2%, from the second quarter of 2012. This decline was driven by decreases in professional fees, operating lease expense, and the provision (credit) for losses on lending-related commitments compared to the second quarter of 2012.

Other Segments generated net income attributable to Key of $70 million for the second quarter of 2013, compared to net income attributable to Key of $49 million for the same period last year. These results were primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income of $44 million and a decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses of $25 million. These improvements were partially offset by a decline in noninterest income of $52 million primarily due to decreases in operating lease income and other leasing gains of $32 million and net gains (losses) from principal investing of $17 million.    110    Table of Contents Financial Condition  Loans and loans held for sale  At June 30, 2013, total loans outstanding from continuing operations were $53.1 billion, compared to $52.8 billion at December 31, 2012 and $49.6 billion at June 30, 2012. Loans related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business, which are excluded from total loans at June 30, 2013, December 31, 2012, and June 30, 2012, totaled $5.0 billion, $5.2 billion, and $5.5 billion, respectively. The increase in our outstanding loans from continuing operations over the past twelve months results primarily from increased lending activity in our commercial, financial and agricultural portfolio along with the previously discussed credit card portfolio and branch acquisition. For more information on balance sheet carrying value, see Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the headings “Loans” and “Loans Held for Sale” on pages 119-120 of our 2012 Form 10-K.  Commercial loan portfolio  Commercial loans outstanding were $37 billion at June 30, 2013, an increase of $2.4 billion, or 7%, compared to June 30, 2012.  Commercial, financial and agricultural. Our commercial, financial and agricultural loans, also referred to as “Commercial and Industrial,” represented 45% of our total loan portfolio at June 30, 2013, 44% at December 31, 2012, and 42% at June 30, 2012, and are the largest component of our total loans. These loans are originated by both Key Corporate Bank and Key Community Bank and are comprised of fixed and variable rate loans to our large, middle market and small business clients.

We have experienced growth in new high credit quality loan commitments, and utilization with clients in our middle market segment, and as well as our Institutional and Capital Markets business. While there was loan growth in most industry classifications compared to the year ago quarter, the most significant growth occurred in the public utilities industry classification, which increased by 52.9%. Our two largest industry classifications—services and manufacturing—increased by 15.5% and 9.3%, respectively, when compared to the year ago quarter. The services and manufacturing industries represented 23.2% and 17.3%, respectively, of the total commercial, financial and agricultural loan portfolio at June 30, 2013, compared to 22.8% and 17.9%, respectively, at June 30, 2012. At the end of each of the quarterly periods provided in Figure 19 above, loans in the services and manufacturing industry classifications accounted for over 40% of our total commercial, financial and agricultural loan portfolio.    111    Table of Contents Services and manufacturing are focus areas where we maintain dedicated industry verticals that are staffed by relationship managers who possess deep industry experience and knowledge. Our loans in the services classification grew by $740 million, or 15.5%, compared to last year. The growth in the services loan portfolio was largely related to increases in lending to large corporate, middle market, and business banking clients and was partially offset by decreases in loans to clients in private bank and real estate. Loans in the manufacturing classification grew by $350 million, or 9.3%, compared to the same period one year ago. Increases in lending to large corporate, middle market, and business banking clients accounted for the majority of the growth in this classification.  Commercial real estate loans. Our commercial real estate (“CRE”) lending business is conducted through two primary sources: our 14-state banking franchise, and KeyBank Real Estate Capital, a national line of business that cultivates relationships with owners of CRE located both within and beyond the branch system. This line of business deals primarily with nonowner-occupied properties (generally properties for which at least 50% of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties) and accounted for approximately 57% of our average year-to-date commercial real estate loans, compared to 68% one year ago. KeyBank Real Estate Capital generally focuses on larger owners and operators of commercial real estate.  CRE loans represent 16% of our total loan portfolio at June 30, 2013 compared to 17% one year ago. These loans include both owner and nonowner occupied properties which at June 30, 2013 represented 23% of our commercial loan portfolio compared to 25% one year ago. These loans have decreased $47 million, or 0.6%, to $8.5 billion at June 30, 2013, from $8.6 billion at June 30, 2012. This decrease in our CRE portfolio has resulted from many of our clients taking advantage of historically low long-term interest rates to refinance their loans in the permanent loan market. We have also been de-risking the portfolio by changing our focus from developers to owners of completed and stabilized CRE.  Figure 20 includes commercial mortgage and construction loans in both Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. As shown in Figure 20, this loan portfolio is diversified by both property type and geographic location of the underlying collateral.  As shown in Figure 20, at June 30, 2013, our CRE portfolio included mortgage loans of $7.5 billion and construction loans of $1.1 billion, representing 14% and 2%, respectively, of our total loans. At June 30, 2013, nonowner-occupied loans represented 64% of our total CRE loans and owner-occupied loans represented 36% of our total CRE loans. The average size of mortgage loans originated during the second quarter of 2013 was $3.5 million, and our largest mortgage loan at June 30, 2013, had a balance of $73 million. At June 30, 2013, our average construction loan commitment was $4.5 million. Our largest construction loan commitment was $56.7 million, and our largest construction loan amount outstanding was $56 million.  Also shown in Figure 20, 65% of our commercial real estate loans at both June 30, 2013 and 2012 were for nonowner-occupied properties. Approximately 16% and 18% of these loans were construction loans at June 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Typically, these properties are not fully leased at the origination of the loan. The borrower relies upon additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide the cash flow necessary to support debt service payments. A significant decline in economic growth, and in turn, rental rates and occupancy would adversely affect our portfolio of construction loans.    112    Table of Contents Figure 20.

Our nonowner occupied commercial real estate portfolio has increased by 0.3%, or approximately $17 million, since June 30, 2012.  If the economic recovery stalls, it may weaken the commercial real estate market fundamentals (i.e., vacancy rates, the stability of rental income and asset values), leading to reduced cash flow to support debt service payments. Reduced client cash flow would adversely affect our ability to collect such payments. Accordingly, the value of our commercial real estate loan portfolio could be adversely affected.  Commercial lease financing. We conduct commercial lease financing arrangements through our Key Equipment Finance line of business and have both the scale and array of products to compete in the equipment lease financing business. Commercial lease financing receivables represented 13% of commercial loans at June 30, 2013, and 15% at June 30, 2012.  Commercial loan modification and restructuring  We modify and extend certain commercial loans in the normal course of business for our clients. Loan modifications vary and are handled on a case by case basis with strategies responsive to the specific circumstances of each loan and borrower. In many cases, borrowers have other resources and can reinforce the credit with additional capital, collateral, guarantees or income sources.  Modifications are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan credit quality while at the same time meeting our clients’ financing needs. Modifications made to loans of creditworthy borrowers not experiencing financial difficulties and under circumstances where ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt are not classified as TDRs. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, a loan is classified as a TDR only when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a creditor concession has been granted.  Our concession types are primarily interest rate reductions, forgiveness of principal, and other modifications. Loan extensions are sometimes coupled with these primary concession types. Because economic conditions have improved modestly and we have restructured loans to provide the optimal opportunity for successful repayment by the borrower,    113    Table of Contents  certain of our restructured loans have returned to accrual status and consistently performed under the restructured loan terms over the past year.  If the loan terms are extended at less than normal market rates for similar lending arrangements, our Asset Recovery Group is consulted to help determine if any concession granted would result in designation as a TDR. Transfer to our Asset Recovery Group is considered for any commercial loan determined to be a TDR. During the second quarter of 2013, there were $40 million of new restructured commercial loans.  For more information on concession types for our commercial accruing and nonaccruing TDRs, see Note 4 (“Asset Quality”).  Figure 21.

First, we create an A note. As the objective of this TDR note structure is to achieve a fully performing and well-rated A note, we focus on sizing that note to a level that is supported by cash flow available to service debt at current market terms and consistent with our customary underwriting standards. This note structure typically will include a debt coverage ratio of 1.2 or better of cash flow to monthly payments of market interest, and principal amortization of generally not more than 25 years. (These metrics are adjusted from time to time based upon changes in long-term markets and “take out underwriting standards” of our various lines of business.) Appropriately sized A notes are more likely to return to accrual status, allowing us to resume recognizing interest income. As the borrower’s payment performance improves, these restructured notes typically also allow for an upgraded internal quality risk rating classification. Moreover, the borrower retains ownership and control of the underlying collateral (typically, commercial real estate), the borrower’s capital structure is strengthened (often to the point that fresh capital is attracted to the transaction), and local markets are spared distressed/fire sales.  The B note typically is an interest-only note with no required amortization until the property stabilizes and generates excess cash flow. This excess cash flow customarily is applied directly to the principal of the A note. We evaluate the B note when we consider returning the A note to accrual status. In many cases, the B note is charged off at the same time the A note is returned to accrual status. Alternatively, both A and B notes may be simultaneously returned to accrual if credit metrics are supportive.  Restructured nonaccrual loans may be returned to accrual status based on a current, well documented evaluation of the credit, which would include analysis of the borrower’s financial condition, prospects for repayment under the modified terms, and alternate sources of repayment such as the value of loan collateral. We wait a reasonable period (generally a minimum of six months) to establish the borrower’s ability to sustain historical repayment performance before returning the loan to accrual status. Sustained historical repayment performance prior to the restructuring also may be taken into account. The primary consideration for returning a restructured loan to accrual status is the reasonable assurance that the full contractual principal balance of the loan and the ongoing contractually required interest payments will be fully repaid. Although our policy is a guideline, considerable judgment is required to review each borrower’s circumstances.  All loans processed as TDRs, including A notes and any non-charged-off B notes, are reported as TDRs during the calendar year in which the restructure took place.    114    Table of Contents Additional information regarding TDRs is provided in Note 4 (“Asset Quality”).  Extensions. Project loans typically are refinanced into the permanent commercial loan market at maturity, but sometimes they are modified and extended. Extension terms take into account the specific circumstances of the client relationship, the status of the project, and near-term prospects for both the client and the collateral. In all cases, pricing and loan structure are reviewed and, where necessary, modified to ensure the loan has been priced to achieve a market rate of return and loan terms that are appropriate for the risk. Typical enhancements include one or more of the following: principal paydown, increased amortization, additional collateral, increased guarantees, and a cash flow sweep. Some maturing construction loans have automatic extension options built in; in those cases, pricing and loan terms cannot be altered.  Loan pricing is determined based on the strength of the borrowing entity and the strength of the guarantor, if any. Therefore, pricing for an extended loan may remain the same because the loan is already priced at or above current market.  We do not consider loan extensions in the normal course of business (under existing loan terms or at market rates) as TDRs, particularly when ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt and no concession has been made. In the case of loan extensions where either collection of all principal and interest is uncertain or a concession has been made, we would analyze such credit under the accounting guidance to determine whether it qualifies as a TDR. Extensions that qualify as TDRs are measured for impairment under the applicable accounting guidance.  Guarantors. We conduct a detailed guarantor analysis (1) for all new extensions of credit, (2) at the time of any material modification/extension, and (3) typically annually, as part of our on-going portfolio and loan monitoring procedures. This analysis requires the guarantor entity to submit all appropriate financial statements, including balance sheets, income statements, tax returns, and real estate schedules.  While the specific steps of each guarantor analysis may vary, the high level objectives include determining the overall financial conditions of the guarantor entities, including: size, quality, and nature of asset base; net worth (adjusted to reflect our opinion of market value); leverage; standing liquidity; recurring cash flow; contingent and direct debt obligations; and near term debt maturities.  Borrower and guarantor financial statements are required at least annually within 90-120 days of the calendar/fiscal year end. Income statements and rent rolls for project collateral are required quarterly. We may require certain information, such as liquidity, certifications, status of asset sales or debt resolutions, and real estate schedules to be provided more frequently.  We routinely seek performance from guarantors of impaired debt if the guarantor is solvent. We may not seek to enforce the guaranty if we are precluded by bankruptcy or we determine the cost to pursue a guarantor exceeds the value to be returned given the guarantor’s verified financial condition. We often are successful in obtaining either monetary payment or the cooperation of our solvent guarantors to help mitigate loss, cost and the expense of collections.  As of June 30, 2013, we had $6.8 million of mortgage and construction loans that had a loan-to-value ratio greater than 1.0, and were accounted for as performing loans. These loans were not considered impaired due to one or more of the following factors: (i) underlying cash flow adequate to service the debt at a market rate of return with adequate amortization; (ii) a satisfactory borrower payment history; and (iii) acceptable guarantor support.  Consumer loan portfolio  Consumer loans outstanding increased by $1.1 billion, or 7.2%, from one year ago. The home equity portfolio is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio. Approximately 96% of this portfolio at June 30, 2013, is derived from our Key Community Bank within our 13 state footprint. The remainder of the portfolio, which has been in an exit mode since the fourth quarter of 2007, was originated from the Consumer Finance line of business and is now included in Other Segments. Home equity loans in Key Community Bank increased by $572 million, or 6%, over the past twelve months as a result of stabilized home values, improved employment, and favorable borrowing conditions.  As shown in Figure 17, we hold the first lien position for approximately 57% of the Key Community Bank home equity portfolio at June 30, 2013, and 54% at June 30, 2012. For consumer loans with real estate collateral, we track borrower performance monthly. Regardless of the lien position, credit metrics are refreshed quarterly, including recent Fair Isaac Corporation scores as well as original and updated loan-to-value ratio. This information is used in establishing the ALLL. Our methodology is described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses” that begins on page 120 of our 2012 Form 10-K.    115    Table of Contents Regulatory guidance issued in January 2012 addressed specific risks and required actions within home equity portfolios associated with second lien loans. At June 30, 2013, 43% of our home equity portfolio is secured by second lien mortgages. On at least a quarterly basis, we continue to monitor the risk characteristics of these loans when determining whether our loss estimation methods are appropriate.  Figure 22 summarizes our home equity loan portfolio by source at the end of each of the last five quarters, as well as certain asset quality statistics and yields on the portfolio as a whole.

(b) Includes $72 million of performing secured loans that were discharged through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not formally re-affirmed as addressed in regulatory guidance that was updated in the third quarter of 2012. Such loans have been designated as nonperforming and TDRs.      (c) From continuing operations.  Loans held for sale  As shown in Note 3 (“Loans and Loans Held for Sale”), our loans held for sale decreased to $402 million at June 30, 2013 from $599 million at December 31, 2012 and totaled $656 million at June 30, 2012.  At June 30, 2013, loans held for sale included $318 million of commercial mortgages, which decreased by $205 million from June 30, 2012, and $48 million of residential mortgage loans, which decreased $42 million from June 30, 2012.  Loan sales  As shown in Figure 23, during the first six months of 2013, we sold $1,695 million of commercial real estate loans, $554 million of residential real estate loans, $159 million of commercial lease financing loans, and $219 million of commercial loans. Most of these sales came from the held-for-sale portfolio; however, $78 million of these loan sales related to the held-to-maturity portfolio.  Loan sales classified as held for sale generated net gains of $64 million in the first six months of 2013 and are included in “investment banking and debt placement fees” and “other income” on the income statement.  Among the factors that we consider in determining which loans to sell are:      ¿   our business strategy for particular lending areas;      ¿   whether particular lending businesses meet established performance standards or fit with our relationship banking strategy;      ¿   our A/LM needs;      ¿   the cost of alternative funding sources;      ¿   the level of credit risk;    116    Table of Contents   ¿   capital requirements; and      ¿   market conditions and pricing.  Figure 23 summarizes our loan sales for the first six months of 2013 and all of 2012.  Figure 23.

In the event of default by a borrower, we are subject to recourse with respect to approximately $1.2 billion of the $173 billion of loans administered or serviced at June 30, 2013. Additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in Note 15 (“Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) under the heading “Recourse agreement with FNMA.”  We derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold. We earn noninterest income (recorded as “other income”) from fees for servicing or administering loans. This fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets. In addition, we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing of commercial real estate loans.  Securities  Our securities portfolio totaled $18 billion at June 30, 2013, compared to $16 billion at December 31, 2012, and $17.6 billion at June 30, 2012. Available-for-sale securities were $13.3 billion at June 30, 2013, compared to $12.1 billion at December 31, 2012, and $13.2 billion at June 30, 2012. Held-to-maturity securities were $4.7 billion at June 30, 2013, compared to $3.9 billion at December 31, 2012, and $4.4 billion at June 30, 2012. Essentially all of our held-to-maturity securities portfolio was invested in CMOs at June 30, 2013.  As shown in Figure 25, all of our mortgage-backed securities, which include both securities available for sale and held-to-maturity securities, are issued by government-sponsored enterprises or GNMA, and are traded in highly liquid secondary markets. These securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value for the available-for-sale portfolio and at cost for the held-to-maturity portfolio. For more information about these securities, see Note 5 (“Fair Value Measurements”) under the heading “Qualitative Disclosures of Valuation Techniques” and Note 6 (“Securities”).    117    Table of Contents Figure 25.

Securities available for sale  The majority of our securities available-for-sale portfolio consists of CMOs, which are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities. CMOs generate interest income and serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements. At June 30, 2013, we had $13.2 billion invested in CMOs and other mortgage-backed securities in the available-for-sale portfolio, compared to $12 billion at December 31, 2012, and $13.1 billion at June 30, 2012.  We periodically evaluate our securities available-for-sale portfolio in light of established A/LM objectives, changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio, and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. These evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning.  In addition, the size and composition of our securities available-for-sale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required (or elect) to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits. Although we generally use debt securities for this purpose, other assets, such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit, are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles.  Throughout 2012 and in the first half of 2013, our investing activities continued to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs. Our actions to not reinvest the monthly security cash flows at various times during this time period served to provide the liquidity necessary to address our funding requirements. These funding requirements included ongoing loan growth and occasional debt maturities, as well as the Western New York branch acquisition in July 2012 (including credit card assets obtained in September 2012) and the acquisition of Key-branded credit card assets in August 2012.    118    Table of Contents Figure 26 shows the composition, yields and remaining maturities of our securities available for sale.

(b) Excludes $5 million of securities at June 30, 2013, that have no stated yield.    119    Table of Contents Other investments  Principal investments — investments in equity and mezzanine instruments made by our Principal Investing unit — represented 59% of other investments at June 30, 2013. They include direct investments (investments made in a particular company) as well as indirect investments (investments made through funds that include other investors). Principal investments are predominantly made in privately held companies and are carried at fair value ($612 million at June 30, 2013, $627 million at December 31, 2012, and $724 million at June 30, 2012).  In addition to principal investments, “other investments” include other equity and mezzanine instruments, such as certain real estate-related investments that are carried at fair value, as well as other types of investments that generally are carried at cost.  Most of our other investments are not traded on an active market. We determine the fair value at which these investments should be recorded based on the nature of the specific investment and all available relevant information. This review may encompass such factors as the issuer’s past financial performance and future potential, the values of public companies in comparable businesses, the risks associated with the particular business or investment type, current market conditions, the nature and duration of resale restrictions, the issuer’s payment history, our knowledge of the industry, third-party data and other relevant factors. During the first six months of 2013, net gains from our principal investing activities (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) totaled $15 million, which includes $2 million of net unrealized losses. These net gains are recorded as “net gains (losses) from principal investing” on the income statement. Additional information regarding these investments is provided in Note 5 (“Fair Value Measurements”).  Deposits and other sources of funds  Domestic deposits are our primary source of funding. During the second quarter of 2013, average domestic deposits were $64.9 billion and represented 86% of the funds we used to support loans and other earning assets, compared to $60.3 billion and 84% during the same quarter of 2012. The composition of our average deposits is shown in Figure 9 in the section entitled “Net interest income.”  The increase in average domestic deposits in the second quarter of 2013, compared to the second quarter of 2012, was due to the growth in demand deposits of $2.7 billion and interest-bearing non-time deposits of $4.2 billion (including the impact of our third quarter 2012 Western New York branch acquisition, which added $2 billion of mostly interest-bearing non-time deposits). This deposit growth was partially offset by $2.3 billion of run-off from one year ago in certificates of deposit and other time deposits. Improved funding mix and previous maturities of our certificates of deposit have reduced the cost of total domestic deposits from .47% for the second quarter of 2012 to .26% for the second quarter of 2013.  Wholesale funds, consisting of deposits in our foreign office and short-term borrowings, averaged $2.8 billion during second quarter of 2013, compared to $3.1 billion during second quarter of 2012. The change from 2012 resulted from a $186 million decrease in foreign office deposits, a $101 million decrease in bank notes and other short-term borrowings, and a $35 million decrease in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase.    120    Table of Contents Capital  At June 30, 2013, our shareholders’ equity was $10.2 billion, down $42 million from December 31, 2012. The following sections discuss certain factors that contributed to this change. For other factors that contributed to the change, see the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity.   CCAR and capital actions  As part of its ongoing supervisory process, the Federal Reserve requires BHCs like KeyCorp to submit an annual comprehensive capital plan and to update that plan to reflect material changes in a firm’s risk profile, business strategies, or corporate structure, including but not limited to changes in planned capital actions. As previously reported, on January 7, 2013, we submitted to the Federal Reserve and provided to the OCC under the annual CCAR process our 2013 capital plan. On March 14, the Federal Reserve announced that it did not object to our 2013 capital plan. At its March 2013 meeting, our Board authorized up to $426 million of Common Share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The authorization was expressly in addition to any amounts remaining under preexisting authority. Common Share repurchases under the current authorization are expected to be executed through the first quarter of 2014.  As previously reported, on February 21, 2013, we announced an agreement to sell our investment management subsidiary, Victory Capital Management, and our broker-dealer affiliate, Victory Capital Advisors, to a private equity fund. The after-tax realized gain which was originally estimated to be $145 million to $155 million is now expected to be in the range of $100 million to $115 million. The cash portion of the gain will be between $75 million and $90 million. The difference from the original estimate is due to higher than expected client attrition that has taken place during the consent process. We have received no objection from the Federal Reserve to use the cash portion of the gain for Common Share repurchases. The Board intends to consider these additional Common Share repurchases at its September meeting.  During the second quarter of 2013, we completed $112 million of Common Share repurchases on the open market under our 2013 capital plan.  Dividends  As previously reported, our 2013 capital plan also proposed an increase in our quarterly Common Share dividend from $.05 to $.055 per share. Consistent with the 2013 capital plan, the Board, at its May and July 2013 meetings, declared quarterly dividends of $.055 per Common Share for the second and third quarters of 2013, respectively. Other changes to future dividends may be evaluated by the Board of Directors based upon our earnings, financial condition, and other factors, including regulatory review. Further information regarding the capital plan process and CCAR is included in the “Supervision and Regulation” section of our 2012 Form 10-K in Item 1. Business under the heading “Capital Assessment and Review of Capital Actions.”  During the second quarter of 2013, we made a dividend payment of $.055 per Common Share, or $49 million, on our Common Shares. We made a dividend payment of $.05 per share, or $47 million, during the first quarter of 2013.  Also in the second quarter of 2013, we made a dividend payment of $1.9375 per share, or $6 million, on our Series A Preferred Stock.  Common shares outstanding  Our Common Shares are traded on the NYSE under the symbol KEY with 31,261 holders of record at June 30, 2013. At June 30, 2013 our book value per Common Share was $10.89 based on 912.9 million shares outstanding at June 30, 2013, compared to $10.78 based on 925.8 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2012, and $10.43 based on 945.5 million shares outstanding at June 30, 2012. At June 30, 2013 our tangible book value per Common Share was $9.77 compared to $9.67 at December 31, 2012, and $9.45 at June 30, 2012.  Figure 28 shows activities that caused the change in outstanding Common Shares over the past five quarters.  Figure 28.

At June 30, 2013, we had 104.1 million treasury shares, compared to 91.2 million treasury shares at December 31, 2012 and 71.5 million treasury shares at June 30, 2012. Going forward we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stock-based compensation awards and for other corporate purposes.  Information on repurchases of Common Shares by KeyCorp is included in Part II, Item 2. “Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds” of this report.  Capital adequacy  Capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance. All of our capital ratios remain in excess of regulatory requirements at June 30, 2013. Our capital and liquidity are intended to position us to weather an adverse credit cycle while continuing to serve our clients’ needs, as well as to adjust to the Regulatory Capital Rules described in this report under the heading “Supervision and regulation.”. Our shareholders’ equity to assets ratio was 11.29% at June 30, 2013, compared to 11.51% at December 31, 2012 and 11.74% at June 30, 2012. Our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 9.96% at June 30, 2013, compared to 10.15% at December 31, 2012 and 10.44% at June 30, 2012.  Banking industry regulators prescribe minimum capital ratios for BHCs like KeyCorp and their banking subsidiaries. Risk-based capital guidelines require a minimum level of capital as a percent of “risk-weighted assets.” Risk-weighted assets consist of total assets plus certain off-balance sheet and market risk items, subject to adjustment for predefined credit risk factors. Currently, banks and BHCs must maintain, at a minimum, Tier 1 capital as a percent of risk-weighted assets of 4.00% and total capital as a percent of risk-weighted assets of 8.00%. As of June 30, 2013, our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and our total risk-based capital ratios were 11.93% and 14.65%, respectively, compared to 12.15% and 15.13%, respectively, at December 31, 2012 and 12.45% and 15.83%, respectively at June 30, 2012.  Another indicator of capital adequacy, the leverage ratio, is defined as Tier 1 capital as a percentage of average quarterly tangible assets. BHCs that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the Federal Reserve’s risk-adjusted measure for market risk — as we have — must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 3.00%. All other BHCs must maintain a minimum ratio of 4.00%. As of June 30, 2013, our leverage ratio was 11.25%, compared to 11.41% at December 31, 2012 and 11.35% at June 30, 2012.  The adoption of the Regulatory Capital Rules changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to BHCs by phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities as eligible Tier 1 capital. The phase-out period, beginning January 1, 2015, will result in our trust preferred securities issued by the KeyCorp capital trusts being treated only as Tier 2 capital by 2016. These changes apply the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to depository institutions to BHCs, savings and loan holding companies, and nonbank financial companies identified as systemically important. The section titled “Supervision and regulation” of this report contains more detailed information regarding the Regulatory Capital Rules, and the section titled “Supervision and Regulation” under Item 1. Business of our 2012 Form 10-K contains additional information regarding capital.  As of June 30, 2013, our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, leverage ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio were 11.93%, 11.25%, and 14.65%, respectively. The trust preferred securities issued by the KeyCorp capital trusts contribute $339 million or 41, 39, and 41 basis points to our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and total risk-based capital ratio, respectively, as of June 30, 2013. The new minimum capital ratios together with the estimated capital ratios of Key at June 30, 2013, calculated on a fully phased-in basis under the Regulatory Capital Rules are set forth in Figure 4 of this report.  Federal bank regulators group FDIC-insured depository institutions into five categories, ranging from “well-capitalized” to “critically undercapitalized.” A “well-capitalized” institution must meet or exceed the prescribed threshold ratios of 6.00% for Tier 1 risk-based capital, 5.00% for Tier 1 leverage capital, and 10.00% for total risk-based capital and must not be subject to any written agreement, order or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. If these provisions applied to BHCs, we believe we would qualify as “well-capitalized” at June 30, 2013, and we believe there has not been any change in condition or event since that date that would cause a change in capital category. Analysis on an estimated basis, accounting for the phase-out of our trust preferred securities as Tier 1 eligible (and therefore as Tier 2 instead) as of June 30, 2013, also determines that we would qualify as “well-capitalized” under current regulatory guidelines (Basel I), with the estimated Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, estimated leverage ratio, and estimated total risk-based capital ratio being 11.52%, 10.86%, and 14.65%, respectively. Figure 6 in the “Supervision and regulation” section above, describes    122    Table of Contents  the new threshold capital ratios for a “well capitalized” and an “adequately capitalized” institution under the Regulatory Capital Rules. The regulatory defined capital categories serve a limited supervisory function. Investors should not use our estimated ratios as a representation of our overall financial condition or prospects of KeyCorp. A discussion of the regulatory capital standards and other related capital adequacy regulatory standards is included in the section “Supervision and Regulation” under Item 1. Business of our 2012 Form 10-K under the heading “Capital.”  Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and BHC capital adequacy based on both the amount and composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. As a result of the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has intensified its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 risk-based capital, known as Tier 1 common equity, and its review of the consolidated capitalization of systemically important financial companies, including KeyCorp. The capital modifications mandated by the Regulatory Capital Rules are consistent with the renewed focus on Tier 1 common equity and the consolidated capitalization of banks, BHCs, and covered nonbank financial companies, which resulted from the financial crisis. Tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by GAAP nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations; this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. Figure 8 in the “Highlights of Our Performance” section reconciles Key shareholders’ equity, the GAAP performance measure, to Tier 1 common equity, the corresponding non-GAAP measure. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio was 11.18% at June 30, 2013, compared to 11.36% at December 31, 2012 and 11.63% at June 30, 2012.  Generally, for risk-based capital purposes, deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income are limited to the lesser of: (i) the amount of deferred tax assets that a financial institution expects to realize within one year of the calendar quarter-end date, based on its projected future taxable income for the year, or (ii) 10% of the amount of an institution’s Tier 1 capital. At June 30, 2013, December 31, 2012 and June 30, 2012, we had no net deferred tax assets deducted from Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets. At June 30, 2013, for Key’s consolidated operations, we had a federal net deferred tax asset of $151 million and a state deferred tax liability of $4 million compared to a federal deferred tax asset of $83 million and $61 million and a state deferred tax liability of $13 million and $27 million at December 31, 2012 and June 30, 2012, respectively. We have recorded a valuation allowance of $2 million against the gross deferred tax assets associated with certain state net operating loss carryforwards and state credit carryforwards.  Regulatory Capital Rules  The Regulatory Capital Rules provide for the phase-out of Tier 1 capital treatment for capital securities beginning in January 2015. As a result, our outstanding trust preferred securities will, by 2016, become Tier 2 capital. The “Supervision and regulation” section of this report contains a more detailed discussion of the Regulatory Capital Rules. Figure 5 in the “Supervision and regulation” section above discloses the new minimum capital ratios together with the estimated capital ratios of Key at June 30, 2013, calculated on a fully phased-in basis under the Regulatory Capital Rules. Given our strong capital position, we expect to be able to satisfy the capital framework established under the Regulatory Capital Rules on our compliance date of January 1, 2015.    123    Table of Contents Figure 29 represents the details of our regulatory capital position at June 30, 2013, December 31, 2012 and June 30, 2012, under the existing Basel I standards.

(c) The allowance for loan and lease losses included in Tier 2 capital is limited by regulation to 1.25% of the sum of gross risk-weighted assets plus low level exposures and residual interests calculated under the direct reduction method, as defined by the Federal Reserve.

(d) This ratio is Tier 1 capital divided by average quarterly total assets as defined by the Federal Reserve less: (i) goodwill, (ii) the disallowed intangible assets described in footnote (b), and (iii) deductible portions of nonfinancial equity investments; plus assets derecognized as an offset to AOCI resulting from the adoption and subsequent application of the applicable accounting guidance for defined benefit and other postretirement plans.    124    Table of Contents Risk Management  Overview  Like all financial services companies, we engage in business activities and assume the related risks. The most significant risks we face are credit, liquidity, market, compliance, operational, strategic, and reputation risks. Our risk management activities are focused on ensuring we properly identify, measure and manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability. Certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section.  The KeyCorp Board of Directors (the “Board”) serves in an oversight capacity ensuring that Key’s risks are managed in a manner that is effective and balanced and adds value for the shareholders. The Board understands Key’s risk philosophy, approves the risk appetite, inquires about risk practices, reviews the portfolio of risks, compares the actual risks to the risk appetite and is apprised of significant risks, both actual and emerging, and determines whether management is responding appropriately. The Board challenges management and ensures accountability.  The Board’s Audit Committee assists the Board in oversight of financial statement integrity, regulatory and legal compliance, independent auditors’ qualifications and independence and all risk review functions including internal audit. The Audit Committee discusses policies related to risk assessment and risk management and the processes related to risk review and compliance. The Audit Committee has responsibility over financial reporting, compliance risk and legal matters, the implementation, management and evaluation of operational risk controls and information, security and fraud risk, and associated reputation and strategic risks.  The Board’s Risk Committee assists the Board in oversight of strategies, policies, procedures and practices relating to the management of credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, and liquidity risk, including the actions taken to mitigate these risks, as well as reputational and strategic risks. The Risk Committee also oversees the maintenance of appropriate regulatory and economic capital, reviews the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) reports, and approves any material changes to the charter of the ERM Committee.  The Audit and Risk Committees meet jointly, as appropriate, to discuss matters that relate to each committee’s responsibilities. In addition to regularly scheduled bi-monthly meetings, the Audit Committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases. Committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting. All members of the Board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months.  Our ERM Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer and comprised of other senior level executives, is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite. The ERM Program encompasses our risk philosophy, policy, framework and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company. The ERM Committee reports to the Board’s Risk Committee. Annually, the Board reviews and approves the ERM Program, as well as the risk appetite and corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories. We use a risk-adjusted capital framework to manage risks. This framework is approved and managed by the ERM Committee.  Tier 2 Risk Governance Committees support the ERM Committee by identifying early warning events and trends, escalating emerging risks and discussing forward-looking assessments. Membership of the Risk Governance Committees includes representatives from each of the Three Lines of Defense. The First Line of Defense is the Line of Business primarily responsible to accept, own, proactively identify, monitor and manage risk. The Second Line of Defense comprises Risk Management representatives who provide independent, centralized oversight over all risk categories by aggregating, analyzing and reporting risk information. Risk Review provides the Third Line of Defense in their role to provide independent assessment and testing of the effectiveness, appropriateness and adherence to KeyCorp’s risk management policies, practices and controls.  The Chief Risk Officer ensures that relevant risk information is properly integrated into strategic and business decisions, ensures appropriate ownership of risks, provides input into performance and compensation decisions, assesses aggregate enterprise risk, monitors capabilities to manage critical risks, and executes appropriate Board and stakeholder reporting.    125    Table of Contents Federal banking regulators continue to emphasize with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution. We believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks, and conform to regulatory expectations.    126    Table of Contents Market risk management  The cash flows and values of financial instruments change as a function of changes in market rates or prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, credit spreads, or volatilities. These factors influence prospective yields, values, or prices associated with the instrument. For example, the value of a fixed-rate bond will decline when market interest rates increase, while the cash flows associated with a variable rate loan will increase when interest rates increase. The holder of a financial instrument is exposed to market risk when either the cash flows or the value of the instrument is tied to such external factors.  We manage our market risk differently based on whether the financial instrument is associated with trading or nontrading operations and activities. Our trading positions are carried at fair value with changes recorded in the income statement. These positions are subject to various market-based risk factors that impact the fair value of the financial instruments in the trading category. Our traditional banking loan and deposit products as well as long-term debt and certain short-term borrowings are nontrading positions. These positions are generally carried at the principal amount outstanding for assets and the amount owed for liabilities. The nontrading positions are subject to changes in economic value due to varying market conditions, primarily changes in interest rates.  Trading market risk  Key incurs market risk as a result of trading, investing, and client facilitation activities, principally within our investment banking and capital markets business. Key has exposures to a wide range of interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and commodity prices, as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads. Our primary market risk exposures are a result of trading activities in the derivative and fixed income markets and maintaining positions in these instruments. We maintain modest trading inventories to facilitate customer flow, make markets in securities, and hedge certain risks. The majority of our positions are traded in active markets.  Management of trading market risks. Market risk management is an integral part of Key’s risk culture. The Market Risk Committee, headed by our Chief Market Risk Officer, along with the Risk Committee of our Board and the ERM Committee (collectively, the “Committees”) provide oversight of the management of trading market risks. Market risk policies and procedures have been defined and approved by the Market Risk Committee and take into account our tolerance for risk and consideration for the business environment. The Committees regularly review and discuss market risk reports prepared by our Market Risk Management group (“MRM”) that contain our market risk exposures and results of monitoring activities.   MRM is an independent risk management function that partners with the lines of business to identify, measure, and monitor market risks throughout our company. MRM is responsible for ensuring transparency of significant market risks, monitoring compliance with established limits, and escalating limit exceptions to appropriate senior management. Market risk is monitored through various measures, such as VaR, and through routine stress testing, sensitivity, and scenario analyses. MRM conducts stress tests for each covered position using historical worst case and standard shock scenarios. VaR, stressed VaR, and other analyses are prepared daily and distributed to appropriate management.  Covered positions. We monitor the market risk of our covered positions, which includes all of our trading positions as well as all foreign exchange and commodity positions, regardless of whether the position is in a trading account. The trading account includes on-and off-balance sheet positions in financial instruments acquired with the intent to profit from price variations. All positions in the trading account are recorded at fair value, and changes in fair value are reflected in our consolidated statements of income. Information regarding our fair value policies, procedures and methodologies is provided in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Fair Value Measurements” on page 122 of our 2012 Form 10-K and Note 5 (“Fair Value Measurements”) in this report. Instruments that are used to hedge nontrading activities, such as bank issued debt and loan portfolios, equity positions that are not actively traded, and securities financing activities do not meet the definition of a covered position. MRM is responsible for identifying our portfolios as either covered or non-covered. The Covered Position Working Group develops the final list of covered positions, and a summary is provided to the Market Risk Committee.  Our significant portfolios of covered positions are detailed below. We analyze market risk by portfolios of covered positions, and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type. The descriptions below incorporate the respective risk types associated with each of these portfolios.        •    Fixed income includes those instruments associated with our capital markets business and the trading of securities as a dealer. These instruments include positions in municipal bonds, bonds backed by the U.S. government, agency    127    Table of Contents       and corporate bonds, certain mortgage-backed securities, securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, money markets, and certain collateralized CMOs. The activities and instruments within the fixed income portfolio create exposures to interest rate and credit spread risks.      •   Foreign exchange includes foreign currency spots, forwards and options. We enter into contracts for these types of instruments primarily to accommodate the needs of clients. These activities result in exposures to foreign currency risk.      •   Interest rate derivatives include interest rate swaps, caps and floors, which are transacted primarily to accommodate the needs of commercial loan clients. In addition, we enter into interest rate derivatives to offset or mitigate the interest rate risk related to the client positions. The activities within this portfolio create exposures to interest rate risk.      •   Credit derivatives include credit default swaps, which are used to mitigate loan portfolio credit risk, and credit default swap indexes, which are used to manage the credit risk exposure associated with anticipated sales of certain commercial real estate loans. The transactions within the credit derivatives portfolio result in exposure to credit risk.  VaR and stressed VaR. VaR is the estimate of the maximum amount of loss on an instrument or portfolio due to adverse market conditions during a given time interval within a stated confidence level. Stressed VaR is used to assess the extreme conditions on market risk within our trading portfolios. MRM calculates VaR and stressed VaR on a daily basis, and the results are distributed to appropriate management. VaR and stressed VaR results are also provided to our regulators and utilized in regulatory capital calculations.  We use a VaR simulation model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions. Historical scenarios are customized for specific covered positions, and numerous risk factors are incorporated in the calculation. VaR is calculated using daily observations over a one-year time horizon, and approximates a 95% confidence level. Statistically, this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than VaR, on average, five out of 100 trading days, or three to four times each quarter. We also calculate VaR and stressed VaR at a 99% confidence level. Two years of historical data were used in the simulation during 2012. Beginning in February 2013, the simulation uses historical data from the previous year, as we believe it more appropriately reflects the current market conditions and the risks associated with our portfolios. This change resulted in a decrease in VaR results of approximately 2% at the 95% confidence level and 15% at the 99% confidence level. We also utilize factors to estimate the exposures that contain optionality features, such as options and cancellable provisions.  The VaR model is an effective tool in estimating ranges of possible gains and losses on our covered positions. However, there are limitations inherent in the VaR model since it uses historical results over a given time interval to estimate future performance. Historical results may not be indicative of future results, and changes in the market or composition of our portfolios could have a significant impact on the accuracy of the VaR model. We regularly review and enhance the modeling techniques, inputs and assumptions used. Our market risk policy includes the independent validation of our VaR model by Key’s Risk Management Group on an annual basis. The Model Risk Management Committee oversees the Model Validation Program, and results of validations are discussed with the ERM Committee.  MRM backtests our VaR model on a daily basis to evaluate its predictive power. The test compares VaR model results at the 99% confidence level to observed daily profit and loss. Results of backtesting are provided to the Market Risk Committee. Backtesting exceptions occur when trading losses exceed VaR. Actual losses did not exceed daily trading VaR on any day during the quarters ended June 30, 2013 and 2012.  We do not engage in correlation trading, or utilize the internal model approach for measuring default and credit migration risk. Our net VaR approach incorporates diversification, but our VaR calculation does not include the impact of counterparty risk and our own credit spreads on derivatives.  The aggregate VaR at the 99% confidence level for all covered positions was $1.7 million at June 30, 2013, and $1.9 million at June 30, 2012. The decrease in aggregate VaR was primarily due to reduced exposures in interest rate and credit derivatives as well as the change from using two years of historical data to one year for the VaR simulation, which was partially offset by an increase in the fixed income VaR. Figure 30 summarizes our VaR at the 99% confidence level for significant portfolios of covered positions for the second quarter of 2013 and 2012.    128    Table of Contents Figure 30.

The aggregate stressed VaR for all covered positions was $5.2 million at June 30, 2013. Figure 31 summarizes our stressed VaR for significant portfolios of covered positions for the second quarter of 2013 as used for market risk capital charge calculation purposes. Stressed VaR was not calculated for market risk regulatory capital purposes during 2012.  Figure 31. Stressed VaR for Significant Portfolios of Covered Positions                                2013        Three months ended June 30,          in millions   High     Low     Mean     June 30,            Trading account assets:                       Fixed income     3.7       1.0       1.9       1.8      Derivatives:                       Interest rate     0.9       0.7       0.7       0.8      Foreign exchange     0.2       —       0.1       —      Credit     3.2       0.7       1.6       2.4           Internal capital adequacy assessment. Market risk is a component of our internal capital adequacy assessment. Our risk-weighted assets include a market risk equivalent asset position, which consists of a VaR component, stressed VaR component, and a specific risk add-on. Specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments, which is not accounted for by changes in broad market risk factors. Specific risk is measured through a standardized approach for positions where the VaR model does not capture specific risk. Specific risk calculations are run quarterly by MRM, and approved by the Chief Market Risk Officer. The VaR, stressed VaR, and specific risk components are added together to arrive at a total market risk equivalent assets calculation.  Nontrading market risk  Most of our market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations. Interest rate risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the EVE. Such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. We manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the EVE in accordance with our risk appetite, and within Board approved policy limits.  Interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of consumer preferences for loan and deposit products, economic conditions, the competitive environment within our markets and changes in market interest rates that affect client activity and our hedging, investing, funding and capital positions. The primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of gap risk, basis risk, yield curve risk and option risk.      ¿   “Gap risk” is the exposure to changes in interest rates and occurs when the volume of interest-bearing liabilities and the volume of interest-earning assets they fund (for example, deposits used to fund loans) do not mature or reprice at the same time.      ¿   “Basis risk” is the exposure to asymmetrical changes in interest rate indexes and occurs when floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities reprice at the same time, but in response to different market factors or indexes.    129    Table of Contents   ¿   “Yield curve risk” is the exposure to non-parallel changes in the slope of the yield curve (where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity) and occurs when interest-bearing liabilities and the interest-earning assets they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve.      ¿   “Option risk” is the exposure to a customer or counterparty’s ability to take advantage of the interest rate environment and terminate or reprice one of our assets, liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments prior to contractual maturity without a penalty. Option risk occurs when exposures to customer and counterparty early withdrawals or early prepayments are not mitigated with an offsetting position or appropriate compensation.  Oversight of nontrading market risk is governed by the Risk Committee of our Board, the ERM Committee and the ALCO. These committees regularly review various reports, including interest rate risk summaries, trends, peer comparisons, variance analyses, projections, and sensitivity analyses. The reviews generate a discussion of positions, trends and directives on interest rate risk and inform a number of our decisions. Guidance for the oversight and management of interest rate risk is provided through the asset/liability management policy, which is governed by the ALCO. We communicate with individuals within and outside of the company on a daily basis to discuss emerging issues.  Net interest income simulation analysis. The primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis. For purposes of this analysis, we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on- and off-balance sheet positions, accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity. The analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments, including a most likely macro-economic scenario. Simulation modeling assumes that residual risk exposures will be managed to within the risk appetite.  We measure the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if the federal funds target rate were to gradually increase or decrease over the next twelve months, and term rates were to move in a similar fashion. Our standard rate scenarios encompass a gradual increase or decrease of 200 basis points, but due to the low interest rate environment, a gradual decrease of 25 basis points over two months with no change over the following ten months is applied. After calculating the amount of net interest income at risk to interest rate changes, we compare that amount with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment. We also perform regular stress tests and sensitivities on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments. One set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of interest rate inputs on simulated exposures. Assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve, including a sustained flat yield curve, an inverted slope yield curve, changes in credit spreads, an immediate parallel change in market interest rates, and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates. Another set of stress tests and sensitivities assesses the effect of loan and deposit assumptions and assumed discretionary strategies on simulated exposures. Assessments are performed on changes to the following assumptions: the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities; changes in lending spreads; prepayments on loans and securities; other loan and deposit balance shifts; investment, funding and hedging activities; and liquidity and capital management strategies.  Simulation analysis produces only a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on judgments related to assumption inputs into the simulation model. We tailor assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled, and validate those assumptions on a regular basis. Our simulations are performed with the assumption that interest rate risk positions will be actively managed through the use of on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments to achieve the desired residual risk profile. However, actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition, customer behavior, product pricing, market interest rates, investment, funding and hedging activities, and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events. Figure 32 presents the results of the simulation analysis at June 30, 2013, and 2012. At June 30, 2013, our simulated exposure to changes in interest rates was moderately asset sensitive. Policy limits for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual increase or decrease in short-term interest rates over the next twelve months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 4%. As shown in Figure 32, we are operating within these limits.    130    Table of Contents Figure 32. Simulated Change in Net Interest Income                  June 30, 2013                     Basis point change assumption (short-term rates)     -25        +200      ALCO policy limits     -4.00  %      -4.00  %          Interest rate risk assessment     -1.12  %      2.30  %              June 30, 2012                   Basis point change assumption (short-term rates)     -25        +200      ALCO policy limits     -4.00  %      -4.00  %          Interest rate risk assessment     -1.05  %      +2.01  %         The results of additional sensitivity analysis of alternate interest rate paths and loan and deposit behavior assumptions indicates that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results presented in Figure 32. Net interest income is highly dependent on the timing, magnitude, frequency, and path of interest rate increases and assumption inputs for deposit repricing relationships, lending spreads, and the balance behavior of transaction accounts. The unprecedented low level of interest rates increases the uncertainty when modeling future deposit balances and repricing behavior. Our sensitivity testing of both assumptions and variables suggests a range of 2-3% in our simulated exposure to a gradual 200 basis point increase in rates is reasonable at this time. Increases in both short term and intermediate term rates are expected to benefit net interest income over time. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the FOMC expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens, and in particular expects to keep the federal funds rate at exceptionally low levels. Key will continue to monitor balance sheet flows and expects the benefit to rising rates to increase prior to any increase in the federal funds rate. Our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume, mix, maturity, and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows. As changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy, management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile. We also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a three-year horizon. These simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a twelve-month horizon. To capture longer-term exposures, we calculate exposures to changes to the EVE as discussed in the following section.  Economic value of equity modeling. EVE complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond twelve-, twenty-four and thirty-six month horizons. EVE modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates, measuring the resulting change in the values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, and comparing those amounts with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment. Because the calculation of EVE under an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest rates in the current low rate environment results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than 200 basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points, we have modified the standard declining rate scenario to an immediate 100 basis point decrease. This analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with non-contractual maturities. Those assumptions are based on historical behaviors, as well as our expectations. We develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our EVE will decrease by more than 15% in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates. We are operating within these guidelines.  Management of interest rate exposure. We use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate A/LM strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures. Specifically, we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities, issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates, and using derivatives — predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps, which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities.  Figure 33 shows all swap positions that we hold for A/LM purposes. These positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. For example, fixed-rate debt is converted to a floating rate through a “receive fixed/pay variable” interest rate swap. The volume, maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader A/LM objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile, see Note 7 (“Derivatives and Hedging Activities”).    131    Table of Contents Figure 33.

(b) Excludes accrued interest of $64 million and $62 million for June 30, 2013, and 2012, respectively.   Liquidity risk management  We define “liquidity” as the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences. Liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions.  Governance structure  We manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis. This approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity, as well as each entity’s capacity to manage through adverse conditions. The approach also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to sufficient wholesale funding.  Oversight of the liquidity risk management process is governed by the Board’s Risk Committee, the KeyBank Board of Directors, the ERM Committee and the ALCO. These groups regularly review various liquidity reports, including liquidity and funding summaries, liquidity trends, peer comparisons, variance analyses, liquidity projections, hypothetical funding erosion stress tests and goal tracking reports. The reviews generate a discussion of positions, trends and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of our decisions. When liquidity pressure is elevated, positions are monitored more closely and reporting is more intensive. We communicate with individuals within and outside of the company on a daily basis to discuss emerging issues.  Factors affecting liquidity  Our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events. An example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency. Examples of indirect events (events unrelated to us) that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war, natural disasters, political events, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund or hedge fund. Similarly, market speculation, or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources.  Our credit ratings at June 30, 2013, are shown in Figure 34. We believe that these credit ratings, under normal conditions in the capital markets, will enable the parent company or KeyBank to issue fixed income securities to investors.    132    Table of Contents Figure 34.

In the normal course of business, we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both KeyCorp and KeyBank. In a “heightened monitoring mode,” we may conduct the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently, and use assumptions so the stress tests are more strenuous and reflect the changed market environment. Our testing incorporates estimates for loan and deposit lives based on our historical studies. Erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods. Ultimately, they determine the periodic effects that major direct and indirect events would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations. To compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures, we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed.  We maintain a Contingency Funding Plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis. The plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions. It also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for managing liquidity through a problem period. As part of the plan, we maintain a liquidity reserve through balances in our liquid asset portfolio. During a problem period, that reserve could be used as a source of funding to provide time to develop and execute a longer-term strategy. The liquid asset portfolio at June 30, 2013, totaled $9.9 billion, consisting of $5.9 billion of unpledged securities, $1.2 billion of securities available for secured funding at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, and $2.8 billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our Federal Reserve account. The liquid asset portfolio can fluctuate due to excess liquidity, heightened risk, or prefunding of expected outflows, such as debt maturities. Additionally, as of June 30, 2013, our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was $15.0 billion at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and $2.9 billion at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati.  Long-term liquidity strategy  Our long-term liquidity strategy is to be predominantly funded by core deposits. However, we may use wholesale funds to sustain an adequate liquid asset portfolio, meet daily cash demands, and allow management flexibility to execute business initiatives. Key’s client-based relationship strategy provides for a strong core deposit base which, in conjunction with intermediate and long-term wholesale funds managed to a diversified maturity structure and investor base, supports our liquidity risk management strategy. We use the loan to deposit ratio as a metric to monitor these strategies. Our target loan to deposit ratio is 90-100% (at June 30, 2013, our loan to deposit ratio was 84%), which we calculate as total loans, loans held for sale, and nonsecuritized discontinued loans divided by domestic deposits.  Sources of liquidity  Our primary sources of liquidity include customer deposits, wholesale funding and liquid assets. If the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances, we rely on wholesale funding or liquid assets. Conversely, excess cash generated by operating, investing and deposit-gathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets.  Liquidity programs  We have several liquidity programs, which are described in Note 15 (“Long-Term Debt”) on page 184 of our 2012 Form 10-K, that enable the parent company and KeyBank to raise funds in the public and private markets when the capital markets are    133    Table of Contents  functioning normally. The proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. Each of the programs is replaced or renewed as needed. There are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs.  KeyBank maintains a $20 billion Global Bank Note Program that allows KeyBank to issue notes, domestically and abroad, with original maturities of seven days or more for senior notes or five years or more for subordinated notes. These notes may be denominated in U.S. dollars or in foreign currencies. Each note will be the sole obligation of KeyBank.  In the first half of 2013, Key’s outstanding note balance decreased by $181 million. Key also had maturities of $26 million in Euro medium-term notes and repayments of $250 million in Federal Home Loan Bank advances. KeyCorp had maturities of $750 million in medium-term notes.   Liquidity for KeyCorp  The parent company has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt; support customary corporate operations and activities (including acquisitions); support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries’ obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, and without adverse consequences; and pay dividends to shareholders.  We use three primary measures to assess parent company liquidity: net cash position, a cash coverage metric, and the liquidity gap. The net cash position measures the ability to fund debt maturing in 24 months or less with existing liquid assets. The cash coverage metric measures the ability to meet all projected obligations. The “liquidity gap” represents the difference between projected liquid assets and anticipated financial obligations over several time horizons. We generally issue term debt to manage our liquidity position within targeted ranges. The parent company generally maintains cash and short-term investments in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over the next 24 months. At June 30, 2013, KeyCorp held $1.1 billion in short-term investments, which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations, including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our policies.  Typically, the parent company meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from KeyBank. Federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval. A national bank’s dividend-paying capacity is affected by several factors, including net profits (as defined by statute) for the two previous calendar years and for the current year, up to the date of dividend declaration. During the first half of 2013, KeyBank and nonbank subsidiaries did not make any dividend payments to the parent. The parent did not make any capital infusions to KeyBank during the first half of 2013. As of June 30, 2013, KeyBank has capacity to pay $210 million in dividends to KeyCorp without prior regulatory approval.  Our liquidity position and recent activity  Over the past twelve months our liquid asset portfolio, which includes overnight and short-term investments, as well as unencumbered, high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios, has decreased as a result of debt maturities, trust preferred securities redemptions, and net customer loan and deposit flows. However, the liquid asset portfolio still continues to exceed the amount we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a longer term solution. The issuance of $1 billion of Senior Bank Notes in January 2013 provided additional liquidity to support normal business flows and maintain our liquid asset portfolio within target levels.  From time to time, KeyCorp or KeyBank may seek to retire, repurchase or exchange outstanding debt, capital securities, preferred shares or Common Shares through cash purchase, privately negotiated transactions or other means. We periodically repurchase Common Shares in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions under our 2013 capital plan authorized by our Board and not objected to by the Federal Reserve. Additional information on repurchases of Common Shares by KeyCorp is included in Part II, Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities or Use of Proceeds of this report. Such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity and capital requirements, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and other factors. The amounts involved may be material, individually or collectively.  We generate cash flows from operations and from investing and financing activities. We have approximately $218 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in international tax jurisdictions as of June 30, 2013. As we consider alternative long-term strategic and liquidity plans, opportunities to repatriate these amounts would result in approximately    134    Table of Contents  $20 million in taxes to be paid. If we were to cease operations in all international tax jurisdictions, the total amount of taxes to be paid would increase to approximately $37 million. Accordingly, we have included the total amount as a deferred tax liability at June 30, 2013.  The consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the six month periods ended June 30, 2013, and 2012.  Credit risk management  Credit risk is the risk of loss to us arising from an obligor’s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms. Like other financial services institutions, we make loans, extend credit, purchase securities and enter into financial derivative contracts, all of which have related credit risk.  Credit policy, approval and evaluation  We manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program. The Credit Risk Committee approves both retail and commercial credit policies. These policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit.  Our credit risk management team is responsible for credit approval, is independent of our lines of business, and consists of senior officers who have extensive experience in structuring and approving loans. Only credit risk management members are authorized to grant significant exceptions to credit policies. It is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate, but most major lending units have been assigned specific thresholds to keep exceptions at a manageable level.  Loan grades are assigned at the time of origination, verified by the credit risk management team and periodically reevaluated thereafter. Most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or scoring. This risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling. Commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings. The first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation; the second rating reflects expected recovery rates on the credit facility. Default probability is determined based on, among other factors, the financial strength of the borrower, an assessment of the borrower’s management, the borrower’s competitive position within its industry sector, and our view of industry risk within the context of the general economic outlook. Types of exposure, transaction structure and collateral, including credit risk mitigants, affect the expected recovery assessment.  Our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans. These models, known as scorecards, forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant. The scorecards are embedded in the application processing system, which allows for real-time scoring and automated decisions for many of our products. We periodically validate the loan grading and scoring processes.  We maintain an active concentration management program to encourage diversification in our credit portfolios. For individual obligors, we employ a sliding scale of exposure, known as hold limits, which is dictated by the strength of the borrower. Our legal lending limit is approximately $1.6 billion for any individual borrower. However, internal hold limits generally restrict the largest exposures to less than 20% of that amount. As of June 30, 2013, we had five client relationships with loan commitments net of credit default swaps of more than $200 million. The average amount outstanding on these five individual net obligor commitments was $41 million at June 30, 2013. In general, our philosophy is to maintain a diverse portfolio with regard to credit exposures.  We actively manage the overall loan portfolio in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives and concentration risk tolerances to mitigate credit risk. We utilize credit default swaps to transfer a portion of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit to a third party. At June 30, 2013, we used credit default swaps with a notional amount of $672 million to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending obligations. We may also sell credit derivatives — primarily single name credit default swaps — to offset our purchased credit default swap position prior to maturity. At June 30, 2013, we had sold credit default swaps outstanding with a total notional of $77 million.  Credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Related gains or losses, as well as the premium paid or received for credit protection, are included in the trading income component of noninterest income.  We may also manage the loan portfolio using portfolio swaps and bulk purchases and sales. Our overarching goal is to manage the loan portfolio within a specified range of asset quality.    135    Table of Contents Allowance for loan and lease losses  At June 30, 2013, the ALLL was $876 million, or 1.65% of loans, compared to $888 million, or 1.79%, at June 30, 2012. The allowance includes $34 million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of $464 million at June 30, 2013, compared to $48 million that was allocated for impaired loans of $411 million one year ago. For more information about impaired loans, see Note 4 (“Asset Quality”). At June 30, 2013, the allowance for loan and lease losses was 134.36% of nonperforming loans, compared to 135.16% at June 30, 2012.  Selected asset quality statistics for each of the past five quarters are presented in Figure 35. The factors that drive these statistics are discussed in the remainder of this section.  Figure 35.

(b) June 30, 2013, March 31, 2013, December 31, 2012, and September 30, 2012 amounts exclude $19 million, $22 million, $23 million, and $25 million, respectively, of PCI loans acquired in July 2012.  We estimate the appropriate level of the ALLL on at least a quarterly basis. The methodology used is described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses on page 102 of our 2012 10-K.” Briefly, we apply expected loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions, changes in credit policies or underwriting standards, and changes in the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets.  For all commercial and consumer TDRs, regardless of size, as well as impaired commercial loans with an outstanding balance greater than $2.5 million, we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss content and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate. We estimate the extent of impairment by comparing the recorded investment of the loan with the estimated present value of its expected cash flows, the fair value of its underlying collateral or the loan’s observable market price. A specific allowance also may be assigned — even when sources of repayment appear sufficient — if we remain uncertain about whether the loan will be repaid in full. On at least a quarterly basis, we evaluate the appropriateness of our loss estimation methods to reduce differences between estimated incurred losses and actual losses. The ALLL at June 30, 2013, represents our best estimate of the probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date.  As shown in Figure 36, our ALLL decreased by $12 million, or 1%, during the past twelve months. This contraction was associated with the improvement in credit quality of the loan portfolio, which has trended more favorably over the past twenty four months. The quality of new loan originations and decreasing NPLs and net charge-offs has resulted in a reduction in our general allowance. Our delinquency trends showed continued improvement in 2012 and 2013. We attribute this improvement to improving economic activity, more favorable conditions in the housing market, and continued run off in our exit loan portfolio. Our liability for credit losses on lending-related commitments decreased by $14 million to $37 million at June 30, 2013, compared to the same period one year ago. When combined with our allowance for loan and lease losses, our total allowance for credit losses represented 1.72% of loans at the end of the second quarter of 2013, compared to 1.89% at the end of the second quarter of 2012. We expect the allowance to decrease as a percent of total loans during the remainder of 2013 as a result of the continued improvement in credit quality that is anticipated.    136    Table of Contents Figure 36.

Our provision (credit) for loan and lease losses was $28 million for second quarter of 2013, compared to $21 million for the year-ago quarter. Our net loan charge-offs were $45 million for the second quarter 2013 compared to $77 million for the second quarter of 2012. The increase in our provision is primarily due to the acquisition of the credit card portfolio during the third quarter of 2012. Additionally, we continue to reduce our exit loans and leases, as well as our exposure in our higher-risk businesses, including the residential properties portion of our construction loan portfolio, Marine/RV financing, and other selected leasing portfolios through the sale of certain loans, payments from borrowers or net charge-offs.    137    Table of Contents Net loan charge-offs  Net loan charge-offs for the second quarter of 2013 totaled $45 million, or .34% of average loans, compared to net loan charge-offs of $77 million, or .63% for the same period last year. Figure 37 shows the trend in our net loan charge-offs by loan type, while the composition of loan charge-offs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in Figure 38.  Over the past twelve months, net loan charge-offs decreased $32 million. This decrease is attributable to improvement in asset quality statistics as shown in Figure 38. As shown in Figure 40, our exit loan portfolio contributed a total of $10 million in net loan charge-offs for the second quarter of 2013. Net loan recoveries for the first quarter of 2013 in our exit loan portfolio were $1 million. The increase in net loan charge-offs in our exit loan portfolio were primarily driven by higher levels of net loan charge-offs in the consumer exit loan portfolios partially offset by recoveries in the commercial exit loan portfolio.

(b) June 30, 2013, March 31, 2013, December 31, 2012, and September 30, 2012 amounts exclude $19 million, $22 million, $23 million, and $25 million, respectively, of PCI loans acquired in July 2012.      (c) Restructured loans (i.e., troubled debt restructurings) are those for which Key, for reasons related to a borrower’s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. These concessions are made to improve the collectability of the loan and generally take the form of a reduction of the interest rate, extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance. The majority of the increase in restructured loans included in nonperforming loans during the second half of 2012 was a result of updated regulatory guidance in the third quarter of 2012.  As shown in Figure 39, nonperforming assets decreased during the second quarter of 2013. Most of the reduction came from nonperforming loans in our Real estate — commercial mortgage and nonperforming loans held for sale portfolios, partially offset by an increase in nonperforming loans in our Home equity — Key Community Bank portfolio. As shown in Figure 40, our exit loan portfolio accounted for $63 million, or 9%, of our total nonperforming assets at June 30, 2013, compared to $66 million, or 9%, at March 31, 2013.  At June 30, 2013, the carrying amount of our commercial nonperforming loans outstanding represented 63% of their contractual amount owed, total nonperforming loans outstanding represented 76% of their contractual amount owed, and nonperforming assets in total were carried at 74% of their original contractual amount.  At June 30, 2013, our twenty largest nonperforming loans totaled $191 million, representing 29% of total nonperforming loans.    140    Table of Contents Figure 40 shows the composition of our exit loan portfolio at June 30, 2013 and March 31, 2013, the net charge-offs recorded on this portfolio for the second quarter of 2013 and the first quarter of 2013, and the nonperforming status of these loans at June 30, 2013 and March 31, 2013. The exit loan portfolio represented 5% of total loans and loans held for sale at June 30, 2013.

These events include, among other things, threats to our cybersecurity, as we are reliant upon information systems and the internet to conduct our business activities.  Operational risk also encompasses compliance risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules and regulations, prescribed practices, and ethical standards. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, large financial companies like Key will be subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation due to their systemic importance. This heightened level of regulation will increase our operational risk. We have created work teams to respond to and analyze the regulatory requirements that will be promulgated as a result of the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. Resulting operational risk losses and/or additional regulatory compliance costs could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation or foregone opportunities.  We seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk, alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance, and a system of internal controls and reporting. We continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws, rules and regulations. For example, an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses. This tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action. We also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes. This technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the Board.  The Operational Risk Management Program provides the framework for the structure, governance, roles and responsibilities as well as the content to manage operational risk for Key. Primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business. The Operational Risk Committee, a senior management committee, oversees our level of operational risk and directs and supports our operational infrastructure and related activities. This committee and the Operational Risk Management function are an integral part of our ERM Program. Our Risk Review function periodically assesses the overall effectiveness of our Operational Risk Management Program and our system of internal controls. Risk Review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the Audit Committee, and independently supports the Audit Committee’s oversight of these controls.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  Our business is dynamic and complex. Consequently, we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies. These choices are critical: not only are they necessary to comply with GAAP, they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance. All accounting policies are important, and all policies described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) beginning on page 117 of our 2012 Form 10-K should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance.  In our opinion, some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility. These policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance, or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. Because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances, they may prove to be inaccurate, or we may find it necessary to change them.  We rely heavily on the use of judgment, assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions, including accounting for the allowance for loan and lease losses; contingent liabilities, guarantees and income taxes; derivatives and related hedging activities; and assets and liabilities that involve valuation methodologies. In addition, we may employ outside valuation experts to assist us in determining fair values of certain assets and liabilities. A brief discussion of each of these areas appears on pages 120 through 128 of our 2012 Form 10-K.  At June 30, 2013, $15.3 billion, or 16.9%, of our total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Approximately 95.9% of these assets, before netting adjustments, were classified as Level 1 or Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. At June 30, 2013, $1.1 billion, or 1.4%, of our total liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Substantially all of these liabilities were classified as Level 1 or Level 2.  During the second quarter of 2013, $38 million, or .1% of our total assets were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. All of these assets were classified as Level 3. At June 30, 2013, there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.    143    Table of Contents In addition, the education lending securitization trusts assets and liabilities were included on the balance sheet at June 30, 2013 at fair value, in the amount of $2.3 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively.  During the first six months of 2013, we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates.    144    Table of Contents European Sovereign Debt Exposures  Our total European sovereign and non-sovereign debt exposure is presented in Figure 44.

(b) This column represents contracts to hedge our balance sheet asset and liability needs, and to accommodate our clients’ trading and/or hedging needs. Our derivative mark-to-market exposures are calculated and reported on a daily basis. These exposures are largely covered by cash or highly marketable securities collateral with daily collateral calls.      (c) Other Europe consists of the following countries: Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, and Ukraine. Approximately 95% of our exposure in Other Europe is in Belgium, Finland, and Sweden.  Our credit risk exposure is largely concentrated in developed countries with emerging market exposure essentially limited to commercial facilities. At-risk exposures in the rest of the world, which are actively monitored by management, total $1 million.    145    Table of Contents     Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk  The information presented in the “Market risk management” section of the Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition & Results of Operations is incorporated herein by reference.        Item 4. Controls and Procedures  As of the end of the period covered by this report, KeyCorp carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of KeyCorp’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of KeyCorp’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, KeyCorp’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, as of the end of the period covered by this report, in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. No changes were made to KeyCorp’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, KeyCorp’s internal control over financial reporting.  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  Item 1. Legal Proceedings  As of June 30, 2013, KeyCorp and its subsidiaries are defendants or putative defendants in a variety of legal proceedings, in the form of regulatory/government investigations as well as private, civil litigation and arbitration proceedings. The private, civil litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both government agencies and self-regulatory bodies. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation and involve a variety of claims (including common law tort, contract claims, securities, ERISA, and consumer protection claims). At times, these legal proceedings may present novel claims or legal theories.  On at least a quarterly basis, we assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings utilizing the latest information available. For those matters where it is probable that we will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements. These legal reserves may be increased or decreased to reflect any relevant developments on a quarterly basis. Where a loss is not probable or the amount of the loss is not estimable, we have not accrued legal reserves, consistent with applicable accounting guidance. Because the outcome of legal proceedings is inherently uncertain, based on information currently available to us, advice of counsel, and the availability of insurance coverage and indemnification from third parties, we believe that our established reserves are adequate and the liabilities arising from the legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the inherent uncertainty in legal proceedings there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution will not exceed established reserves. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter, or a combination of matters, may be material to our results of operation for a particular period, depending upon the size of the loss or our income for that particular period.  The information presented in the Legal Proceedings section of Note 15 (“Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements is incorporated herein by reference.
