Economic overview  During the first quarter of 2012, the economic recovery in the United States continued. Job creation in the U.S. picked up as employers added 635,000 jobs, compared to the 492,000 jobs created in the fourth quarter of 2011. This growth was the strongest quarter of job creation since 2006. The average unemployment rate for the quarter fell to 8.3%, an improvement from the fourth quarter average of 8.7% and the average rate of 9.0% seen for all of 2011, but still remained elevated from the 10 year historical average of 6.6%.  Improvements in the labor market contributed to increased consumer spending during the first quarter of 2012. Total consumer spending increased on average 0.5% in the first quarter of 2012 compared to an average 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2011. Consumers increased spending in the face of rising oil and gas prices during the first quarter of 2012. The average price per gallon of gasoline rose 21% in March 2012 from levels seen in December 2011. Overall consumer prices increased 2.8% for the first quarter of 2012, down slightly from the 3.2% annual increase seen for all of 2011.  The improvement in the labor market coincided with better consumer sentiment and a better housing market. The real estate market exhibited a promising start for 2012. March 2012 new home sales were up 8% from one year ago, while the median price of new homes rose by 6.3% over the same period last year. March 2012 existing home sales were up 5.2% from the same month last year, while the median price of existing homes are up 2.5% over the same period last year. Building activity also improved as housing starts for the quarter rose on average 30% from a year earlier. While job growth and low mortgage rates have provided support to the housing sector, foreclosures remain a dominant influence on the market. Foreclosures fell on average by 17% from a year earlier but still remain at historically high levels.  Due to the improving economic data in the U.S. and the emerging investor confidence that the effects of the European sovereign debt crisis had been contained, Treasury yields rose throughout the first quarter of 2012. The benchmark two-year Treasury yield ended the first quarter at 0.33%, up from 0.24% at December 31, 2011. The ten-year Treasury yield, which began the quarter at 1.88%, increased 0.33% to close the first quarter of 2012 at 2.21%. The Federal Reserve kept the federal funds target rate near zero in the first quarter of 2012. While acknowledging some improvement in the economy, the Federal Open Market Committee (“FOMC”) further strengthened its stance for accommodative monetary policy by stating that the federal funds rate would likely remain at exceptionally low levels at least through late 2014. The FOMC also enhanced its commitment to transparency by publishing the FOMC members’ interest rate forecasts for the first time in its history.  Long-term financial goals  Our long-term financial goals are as follows:      ¿ Target a loan to core deposit ratio range of 90% to 100%.      ¿ Return to a moderate risk profile by targeting a net charge-off ratio range of .40% to .50%.      ¿ Grow high quality and diverse revenue streams by targeting a net interest margin in excess of 3.50% and ratio of noninterest income to total revenue of greater than 40%.      ¿ Create positive operating leverage and target an efficiency ratio in the range of 60 to 65%.      ¿ Achieve a return on average assets in the range of 1.00% to 1.25%.  Figure 2 shows the evaluation of our long-term financial goals for the first quarter of 2012.    75    Table of Contents Figure 2.

Strategic developments  We initiated the following actions during the first three months of 2012 to support our corporate strategy described in the “Introduction” section under the “Corporate Strategy” heading on page 39 of our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.      ¿ On January 9, 2012, we submitted to the Federal Reserve and provided to the OCC under the annual CCAR process our 2012-2013 Comprehensive Capital Plan. At its March 2012 meeting, our Board authorized the purchase in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions of up to $312 million of our Common Shares. This authorization was expressly in addition to any amounts remaining under preexisting authority. Pursuant to our 2012 capital plan submitted to the Federal Reserve as part of CCAR and not objected to by the Federal Reserve, KeyCorp has authority to purchase up to $344 million of our Common Shares, including $312 million for general repurchase and up to $32 million for repurchase in connection with employee elections under our compensation and benefit programs. Our existing repurchase program does not have an expiration date. Common Share repurchases under the current authorization commenced in April 2012 and are expected to be executed on through the first quarter of 2013. Our 2012 capital plan also includes an increase in our Common Share dividend from $.03 to $.05 per share that will be evaluated by our Board of Directors at its regular May Board meeting.      ¿ As previously reported, on January 11, 2012, Key signed a purchase and assumption agreement to acquire 37 retail banking branches in Buffalo and Rochester, NY. The deposits associated with these branches total approximately $2.4 billion, while loans total approximately $400 million. The transaction is expected to close early third quarter of 2012, subject to customary closing conditions. On April 18, 2012, we received regulatory approval from the OCC for the transaction.      ¿ As previously announced, we committed $5 billion in lending capital to small- and medium-sized businesses for the period of three years. Since beginning this program in September of 2011, we have made over $2.4 billion in lending commitments to small business owners who we believe are critical to our nation’s economic recovery and job creation.  Demographics  We have two major business segments: Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank.  Key Community Bank serves individuals and small to mid-sized businesses by offering a variety of deposit, investment, lending, and personalized wealth management products and business advisory services. These products and services are    76    Table of Contents  provided through our relationship managers and specialists working in our 14-state branch network, which is organized into three internally defined geographic regions: Rocky Mountains and Northwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast.

Key Corporate Bank includes three lines of business that operate nationally, within and beyond our 14-state branch network: Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services; Equipment Finance; and Institutional and Capital Markets.  The Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services business consists of two business units.      l Real Estate Capital professionals who are located in select markets across the country and provide financial services for public and private owners, investors and developers of nonowner-occupied commercial real estate properties. In addition to direct loans, this business unit is a Fannie Mae Delegated Underwriter and Servicer, Freddie Mac Program Plus Seller/Servicer and FHA-approved mortgagee. KeyBank Real Estate Capital is also one of the nation’s largest and highest rated commercial mortgage servicers. Figure 17, which appears later in this report in the “Loans and loans held for sale” section, shows the diversity of our commercial real estate lending business based on industry type and location.      l Corporate Banking Services provides cash management, interest rate derivatives, and foreign exchange products and services to existing clients. Through its Public Sector and Financial Institutions businesses, Corporate Banking Services also provides a full array of commercial banking products and services to government and not-for-profit entities and to community banks. A variety of commercial payment products are provided through the Enterprise Commercial Payments Group.  Equipment Finance meets the equipment financing needs of companies worldwide and provides equipment manufacturers, distributors and resellers with funding options for their clients. Equipment finance specializes in the technology, healthcare, and renewable energy markets as well as other capital assets.  The Institutional and Capital Markets business consists of two business units:      l KeyBanc Capital Markets provides commercial lending, treasury management, investment banking, derivatives, foreign exchange, equity and debt underwriting and trading, and syndicated finance products and services, primarily to emerging and middle-market companies in the Industrial, Consumer, Real Estate, Energy, Technology and Healthcare sectors. This business unit’s focused industry expertise and its consistent, integrated team approach help our clients achieve their strategic objectives.      l Victory Capital Management is an investment advisory firm that manages or offers advice regarding investment portfolios. This business unit’s national client base consists of both institutional and retail clients derived from four primary channels: public plans, Taft-Hartley plans, corporations, and endowments and foundations.  Additional information regarding the products and services offered by our Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank segments are described further in this report in Note 16 (“Line of Business Results”).    77    Table of Contents Supervision and Regulation  Regulatory reform developments  On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. This Act is intended to address perceived deficiencies and gaps in the regulatory framework for financial services in the United States, reduce the risks of bank failures and better equip the nation’s regulators to guard against or mitigate any future financial crises, and manage systemic risk through increased supervision of systemically important financial companies (including nonbank financial companies). The Dodd-Frank Act implements numerous and far-reaching changes across the financial landscape affecting financial companies, including banks and bank holding companies such as Key. Further discussion concerning the Dodd-Frank Act and the risks that it presents to Key is available in our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “II. Compliance Risks” beginning on page 15 in Item 1A “Risk Factors.” A number of proposed rules referenced in our prior reports continue to remain pending. The following provides a summary of pertinent regulatory developments relating to the Dodd-Frank Act or that relate to our results this quarter.  Stress Testing  On January 24, 2012, the OCC published its proposed rule on annual stress tests to be performed by national banks, such as KeyBank, having total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion. Such tests are required by the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition to the annual stress testing requirement, under the proposal, these banks, including KeyBank, would be subject to certain reporting and disclosure requirements. KeyBank will be required to conduct its first stress test and report results to our regulators in January 2013. The comment period for the proposed rule ended on April 30, 2012.  Interchange fees  As previously reported, the Federal Reserve approved Regulation II, Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing (“Regulation II”), which limits debit card issuer interchange fees for electronic debit transactions and implements provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. If interchange fees are set at the maximum amount allowed by Regulation II and we receive the fraud adjustment amount, we continue to estimate that the impact on our debit interchange revenue stream will be an annualized decline of approximately $50 million to $60 million before any potential offsets from other fees or cost mitigation that may be implemented. The relevant portions of Regulation II became effective on October 1, 2011.  Our debit interchange revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2012 was $13 million, compared to $26 million for the same period in 2011, which is consistent with our expectations originally reported in our Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2011.  Enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements  On January 5, 2012, the Federal Reserve published in the Federal Register its proposed rule on Enhanced Prudential Standards and Early Remediation Requirements for covered companies, as part of its efforts to implement a regulatory scheme pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act applicable to systemically important financial companies. The proposed rule provides concrete rules to complement the Federal Reserve’s existing efforts to enhance the supervisory framework for covered companies. The proposed rule applies to U.S. bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, like KeyCorp, and includes a wide range of measures addressing issues such as capital, liquidity, credit exposure limits, stress testing, risk management and early remediation. Comments to this proposed rule were due by April 30, 2012.  Highlights of Our Performance  Financial performance  For the first quarter of 2012, we announced net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $199 million, or $.21 per Common Share. Our first quarter of 2012 results compare to net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $184 million, or $.21 per Common Share, for the first quarter of 2011. The first quarter 2012 results continued to benefit from improved asset quality. The results for the first quarter of 2011 included a deemed dividend of $49 million, or $.06 per diluted Common Share related to the accelerated amortization of the discount on the repurchased preferred shares from the U.S. Treasury. First quarter 2012 net income attributable to Key common shareholders was $194 million compared to net income attributable to Key common shareholders of $173 million for the same quarter one year ago.    78    Table of Contents Our financial results demonstrate continued progress as we execute our relationship strategy, strengthen our balance sheet and maintain disciplined expense control. Our average commercial, financial and agricultural loan portfolio grew for the fourth consecutive quarter and increased 7.2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011 and 20.4% from the year ago quarter. This growth continues to be broad-based across our franchise, as well as in the targeted client segments of industrial, energy and healthcare in Key Corporate Bank. As previously announced, we committed $5 billion in lending capital to small- and medium-sized businesses for the period of three years. Since beginning this program in September of 2011, we have made over $2.4 billion in lending commitments to small business owners who we believe are critical to our nation’s economic recovery and job creation.  During the first quarter of 2012, we continued to benefit from improved asset quality. Net charge-offs declined $92 million from the first quarter of 2011 to $101 million, or .82%, of average loan balances for the first quarter of 2012, compared to $193 million, or 1.59% of average loan balances for the same period one year ago. Nonperforming assets declined $322 million, and nonperforming loans decreased by $219 million from the year-ago quarter to $767 million and $666 million, respectively. Our reserve for loan losses stood at $944 million or 1.92% of period-end loans representing 141.7% coverage of nonperforming loans at March 31, 2012. This reserve compares to an allowance for loan and lease losses of $1.4 billion or 2.83% of period end loans representing 155% coverage of nonperforming loans for the year-ago quarter. Looking to the balance of 2012, we anticipate continued modest improvement in asset quality and net charge-offs.  During the first quarter of 2012, we originated approximately $8.3 billion in new or renewed lending commitments to consumers and businesses, an increase from $6.9 billion for the same period one year ago. In 2012, we expect to open approximately half the number of branches we opened in each of the last three years. Excluding our pending acquisition of 37 branches in upstate New York, we do not expect our overall branch count to materially change. In addition, we continue to make investments such as modernizing our branch network, enhancing our online and mobile capabilities and adding more client-facing positions.  We received several industry honors and recognitions in the first quarter of 2012. These honors include an award from Corporate Insight’s Bank Monitor regarding our online banking capabilities and various small business and middle market awards.  Our capital ratios remain strong. Our tangible common equity, Tier 1 common equity and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios at March 31, 2012, are 10.26%, 11.55%, and 13.29%, respectively, compared to 9.16%, 10.74%, and 13.48%, respectively, at March 31, 2011. Our first quarter of 2012 capital ratios place us in the top quartile of our peer group. Our capital priorities remain as follows:      ¿ maintaining strong capital for organic growth,      ¿ increase the dividend,      ¿ return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases, and      ¿ remain disciplined around opportunities to invest in our business model and our franchise.  As previously announced, we submitted to the Federal Reserve and provided to the OCC under the annual CCAR process our 2012-2013 Comprehensive Capital Plan. At its March 2012 meeting, our Board authorized the purchase in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions of up to $312 million of our Common Shares. This authorization was expressly in addition to any amounts remaining under preexisting authority. Pursuant to our 2012 capital plan submitted to the Federal Reserve as part of CCAR and not objected to by the Federal Reserve, KeyCorp has authority to purchase up to $344 million of our Common Shares, including $312 million for general repurchase and up to $32 million for repurchase in connection with employee elections under our compensation and benefit programs. Our existing repurchase program does not have an expiration date. Common Share repurchases under the current authorization commenced in April 2012 and are expected to be executed on through the first quarter of 2013. Our 2012 capital plan also includes an increase in our Common Share dividend from $.03 to $.05 per share that will be evaluated by our Board of Directors at its regular May Board meeting.  Figure 4 shows our continuing and discontinued operating results for the current, past and year-ago quarters. Our financial performance for each of the past five quarters is summarized in Figure 1.    79    Table of Contents Figure 4.

In September 2009, we decided to discontinue the education lending business conducted through Key Education Resources, the education payment and financing unit of KeyBank. As a result of these decisions, we have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations. The loss from discontinued operations for the three months ended March 31, 2012, was primarily attributable to fair value adjustments related to the education lending securitization trusts.

(c) Earnings per share may not foot due to rounding.  Figure 5 presents certain non-GAAP financial measures related to “tangible common equity” and “Tier 1 common equity.” Tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by GAAP nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations; this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity and Tier 1 common equity, we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases. Figure 5 also reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures.  Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. Since the commencement of the CCAR process in early 2009, the Federal Reserve has focused its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 risk-based capital known as Tier 1 common equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Because the Federal Reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders’ equity (essentially Tier 1 risk-based capital less preferred stock, qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in Tier 1 risk-based capital, this focus on Tier 1 common equity is consistent with existing capital adequacy categories. This increased focus on Tier 1 common equity is also present in the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s (the “Basel Committee”) final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation (“Basel III”), which U.S. regulators are expected to implement in the near future. The enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act also changes the regulatory capital standards that apply to bank holding companies by requiring regulators to create rules phasing out the treatment of capital securities and cumulative preferred securities as Tier 1 eligible capital. This three year phase-out period, which commences January 1, 2013, will ultimately result in our capital securities being treated only as Tier 2 capital.  The table also shows the computation for pre-provision net revenue, which is not formally defined by GAAP. Management believes that eliminating the effects of the provision for loan and lease losses makes it easier to analyze our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis.  Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.    80    Table of Contents                   Figure 5.

There were no disallowed deferred tax assets at March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011.  Results of Operations  Net interest income  One of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets (such as loans and securities) and loan-related fee income, and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. There are several factors that affect net interest income, including:      ¨ the volume, pricing, mix and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities;      ¨ the volume and value of net free funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and equity capital;      ¨ the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk;      ¨ interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace; and      ¨ asset quality.  To make it easier to compare results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets (some taxable, some not), we present net interest income in this discussion on a “taxable-equivalent basis” (i.e., as if it were all taxable and at the same rate). For example, $100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as $154, an amount that — if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% — would yield $100.  Figure 6 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense, and their respective yields or rates over the past five quarters. This figure also presents a reconciliation of taxable-equivalent net interest income    81    Table of Contents  to net interest income reported in accordance with GAAP for each of those quarters. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized taxable-equivalent net interest income by average earning assets.  Taxable-equivalent net interest income was $559 million for the first quarter of 2012, and the net interest margin was 3.16%. These results compare to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $604 million and a net interest margin of 3.25% for the first quarter of 2011. The decrease in net interest income is attributed to a decline in both the net interest margin and earning assets. The net interest margin has been under pressure as a result of the continuation of the low-rate environment contracting the spread between lending rates and funding costs.  We anticipate the net interest margin to remain relatively stable in the second quarter of 2012 with the level we experienced during the first quarter of 2012. In the second half of 2012, we anticipate the net interest margin expanding as a result of our debt and deposit maturity and repricing opportunities during the remainder of 2012.  Average earning assets for the first quarter of 2012 totaled $71 billion, which was $3.8 billion, or 5%, lower than the first quarter of 2011 primarily due to decreases in our securities available for sale which were slightly offset by increases in our average loans. The return on average assets for the first quarter of 2012 was 1.02%. Average securities available-for-sale decreased $5.9 billion from the year ago quarter. This change was due to movement of CMOs into our securities held-to-maturity category in response to potential changes in regulatory capital rules. We also used the proceeds of security cash flows to fund loans and repay maturing short- and long-term debt. Average loans increased $118 million primarily in our commercial portfolio. This increase was due to strong growth in our commercial, financial and agricultural loan portfolio, for the fourth consecutive quarter, and slight growth in our consumer real estate portfolio. We attribute this growth to our commercial clients beginning to make capital investments in their operations and taking advantage of the historically low current interest rates and available liquidity. Decreases in our remaining commercial real estate and consumer portfolios caused primarily by run-off in our exit portfolios and some soft demand for consumer credit offset these aforementioned increases.  As shown in Figure 6, the yield on commercial lease financing was impacted by the early termination of a leverage lease which resulted in the write off of $6 million of capitalized loan origination costs.    82    Table of Contents Figure 6.

Noninterest income  Our noninterest income was $472 million for the first quarter of 2012, compared to $457 million for the year-ago quarter, representing an increase of $15 million, or 3%. Gains on leased equipment increased $23 million due primarily to a $20 million gain related to the early termination of a leverage lease and other noninterest income items increased $16 million. These increases were partially offset by a $13 million decrease in operating lease income and a $13 million decline in electronic banking fees as a result of new government pricing controls on debit transactions that went into effect on October 1, 2011.

The primary components of revenue generated by these services are shown in Figure 9. During the first quarter of 2012, trust and investment services income remained essentially unchanged compared to the same period one year ago.  Figure 9.

At March 31, 2012, our bank, trust and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of $52.6 billion, compared to $61.5 billion at March 31, 2011. As shown in Figure 10, the decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in the equity, securities lending, and money market portfolios, partially offset from growth in fixed income assets under management. The decline in the equity portfolio was due in part to asset outflows. The decrease in the value of our portfolio of hedge funds is attributable to our second quarter 2009 decision to wind down the operations of Austin (results included in discontinued operations). During first quarter of 2012, Victory Capital Management decided to wind down the Victory Money Market Mutual Funds effective April 30, 2012. Clients were notified of this decision, and offered an array of alternative investment options including FDIC insured deposit products, other Money Market Mutual Funds, or the assets were transferred back to the fund holder. Our securities lending business has been declining due to our de-emphasis of this business resulting in lower transaction volumes, client departures and fewer assets under management.  Figure 10.

Operating lease income  Operating lease income decreased $13 million, or 37%, for the first quarter of 2012 in our Equipment Finance line of business due to product run-off. Accordingly, as shown in Figure 12, operating lease expense also declined.  Investment banking and capital markets income (loss)  As shown in Figure 11, income from investment banking and capital markets activities remained unchanged from the year-ago quarter.  Investment banking income decreased $6 million from a year-ago quarter due to lower equity originations income.  Income from other investments increased by $3 million from a year-ago quarter due to asset sales made by our Funds Management Group.    86    Table of Contents Dealer trading and derivatives income increased by $5 million from the year-ago quarter due largely to improved fixed income sales and equity sales activity which were partially offset by a $10 million increase in the provision for losses related to customer derivatives.  Foreign exchange income remained essentially unchanged compared to prior reporting periods.  Figure 11.

In both quarters, income related to foreign exchange and interest rate derivative trading was less than $1 million and was offset by losses from our credit portfolio management activities.      (b) The allocation between proprietary and non-proprietary is made based upon whether the trade is conducted for the benefit of Key or Key’s clients rather than based upon the proposed rulemakings under the Volcker Rule. The prohibitions and restrictions on proprietary trading activities contemplated by the Volcker Rule and the rules proposed thereunder are not yet final. Therefore, the ultimate impact of the rules proposed under the Volcker Rule is not yet known.  Other income  Other income increased $16 million, or 94% from the year-ago quarter due to an increase in mortgage servicing income, fair value hedge accounting adjustments and various other items.  Noninterest expense  As shown in Figure 12, noninterest expense was $703 million for the first quarter of 2012, compared to $701 million for the same period last year.  Personnel expense increased $14 million due to increased salaries and stock-based compensation expenses, partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation. Nonpersonnel expense decreased $12 million compared to the same period one year ago with declines in operating lease expense, FDIC assessments and OREO expense being offset by increases in marketing, the provision (credit) for losses on lending-related commitments and other expense.

Personnel  As shown in Figure 13, personnel expense, the largest category of our noninterest expense, increased by $14 million, or 4%, when compared to the first three months of 2011. This change was due primarily to increased salaries from an expanded sales force, an increase in stock-based compensation, and higher medical claim benefits. These increases were partially offset by reduced levels of incentive compensation and severance.  Figure 13.

Income related to the rental of leased equipment is presented in Figure 8 as “operating lease income.”  FDIC Assessment  The decrease in FDIC insurance is a result of the change in the calculation method for deposit insurance assessments as discussed in the “Deposits and other sources of funds” section under the “The Dodd-Frank Act reform of deposit insurance” heading on page 71 of our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Other expense  Other expense is comprised of various miscellaneous expense items. The $19 million increase is attributable to increases in several of those line items.  Income taxes  We recorded tax expense from continuing operations of $75 million for the first quarter of 2012 and $111 million for the first quarter of 2011.  Our federal tax expense (benefit) differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate, primarily because we generate income from investments in tax-advantaged assets, such as corporate-owned life insurance, earn credits associated with investments in low-income housing projects, and make periodic adjustments to our tax reserves.  Additional information pertaining to how our tax expense (benefit) and the resulting effective tax rates were derived is included in Note 12 (“Income Taxes”) on page 165 of our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.    88    Table of Contents Line of Business Results  This section summarizes the financial performance and related strategic developments of our two major business segments (operating segments), Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. Note 16 (“Line of Business Results”) describes the products and services offered by each of these business segments, provides more detailed financial information pertaining to the segments and certain lines of business, and explains “Other Segments” and “Reconciling Items.”  Figure 14 summarizes the contribution made by each major business segment to our “taxable-equivalent revenue from continuing operations” and “income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Key” for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2012 and 2011.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income declined by $25 million, or 7%, from the first quarter of 2011. Average loans and leases grew 1% while average deposits declined 1% from one year ago. Given the continued low-rate environment, the value derived from deposits was less in the current period.  Noninterest income decreased by $12 million, or 6%, from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to a $13 million decline in electronic banking fees resulting from new government pricing controls on debit transactions that went into effect on October 1, 2011.  The provision for loan and lease losses declined by $9 million, or 82%, compared to the first quarter of 2011 due to lower net loan charge-offs from the same period one year ago. Net loan charge-offs were $49 million for the first quarter of 2012, down $27 million from the $76 million incurred in the same period one year ago.  Noninterest expense increased by $9 million, or 2%, from the year-ago quarter. An increase in internally allocated costs and the provision (credit) for losses on lending-related commitments was partially offset by a reduction in FDIC deposit insurance assessments and a decline in personnel expense from one year ago.    89    Table of Contents Figure 15.

Taxable-equivalent net interest income was flat compared to the first quarter of 2011 as the decreased value derived from deposits was offset by an increase in average earning assets. Although average deposits increased $274 million, or 2%, the deposit spread decreased $11 million due to the prolonged low-rate environment. Average earning assets increased $869 million, or 4% from the year-ago quarter, and combined with lower levels of nonperforming assets, led to a $12 million increase in earning asset spread.  Noninterest income declined by $5 million, or 2%, from the first quarter of 2011. A decrease in operating lease income and trust and investment services income was partially offset by an increase in net gains (losses) from loan sales compared to the year-ago quarter.  The provision for loan and lease losses in the first quarter of 2012 was a charge of $13 million compared to a credit of $21 million for the same period one year ago. The charge in the first quarter of 2012 related to the increase in loans and leases,    90    Table of Contents  partially offset by continued improvement in the portfolio’s asset quality for the tenth consecutive quarter. Net loan charge-offs in the first quarter of 2012 were $25 million compared to $75 million for the same period one year ago.  Noninterest expense increased by $3 million, or 1% from the first quarter of 2011. A decrease in operating lease expense was partially offset by increases in other operating expenses.  Figure 16.

Other Segments  Other Segments consist of Corporate Treasury, Key’s Principal Investing unit and various exit portfolios. Other Segments generated net income attributable to Key of $45 million for the first quarter of 2012, compared to net income attributable to Key of $58 million for the same period last year. These results were primarily attributable to an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses of $52 million in the exit portfolio, due to a charge of $27 million for the first quarter of 2012, compared to a credit of $25 million for the year-ago quarter. This increase was partially offset by a $14 million net gain resulting from the early termination of a leveraged lease in the first quarter of 2012 ($20 million gain on leased equipment less a $6 million charge for the write-off of capitalized loan origination costs).    91    Table of Contents Financial Condition  Loans and loans held for sale  At March 31, 2012, total loans outstanding from continuing operations were $49.2 billion, compared to $49.6 billion at December 31, 2011 and $48.6 billion at March 31, 2011. Loans related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business, which are excluded from total loans at March 31, 2012, December 31, 2011, and March 31, 2011, totaled $5.7 billion, $5.8 billion, and $6.3 billion, respectively. The increase in our outstanding loans from continuing operations over the past twelve months results primarily from increased lending activity in our commercial, financial and agricultural portfolio. For more information on balance sheet carrying value, see Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the headings “Loans” and “Loans Held for Sale” on pages 116-117 of our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Commercial loan portfolio  Commercial loans outstanding were $34.6 billion at March 31, 2012, an increase of $1.3 million, or 4%, compared to March 31, 2011.  Commercial, financial and agricultural. Our Commercial, Financial and Agricultural loans, also referred to as “Commercial and Industrial,” represent 40% of our total loan portfolio at March 31, 2012, 39% at December 31, 2011 and 34% at March 31, 2011 and are the largest component of our total loans. These loans are comprised of fixed and variable rate loans to our large, middle market and small business clients. These period end loans increased $3.3 billion or 20% from one year ago. As compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, quarterly average loan balances have increased approximately $1.3 billion, or 7.2%, due to increased activity in our industrial sectors and middle market lending in all three of our regions.  Commercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans represent approximately 18% of our total loan portfolio. These loans include both owner and nonowner-occupied properties and constitute approximately 26% of our commercial loan portfolio. These loans have decreased $1.6 billion, or 15%, to $9.1 billion at March 31, 2012, from $10.7 billion at March 31, 2011.  Commercial property markets improved further from the fourth quarter of 2012, with vacancies relatively flat. Rental income growth continued for the multifamily and warehouse property types, although at a moderated pace. Rental income growth declined for the office and retail property types. Assuming the modest economic recovery continues, we believe commercial real estate market fundamentals will improve through 2012, positively impacting rental income growth for all major property types.  The most recent Moody’s CPPI index (January 2012) reflects a value decline of 41% from its peak in the fall of 2007, which compares to a decline of 49% in April 2011 from the fall of 2007 peak. Market averages obscure divergent trends by asset quality and location. Prices for major assets have improved significantly over the past two years in major markets. Conversely, distressed asset prices remain low nationwide due to continued economic uncertainty, which is keeping market average trends negative.  Our commercial real estate lending business is conducted through two primary sources: our 14-state banking franchise, and KeyBank Real Estate Capital, a national line of business that cultivates relationships both within and beyond the branch system. This line of business deals primarily with nonowner-occupied properties (generally properties for which at least 50% of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties) and accounted for approximately 55% of our average year-to-date commercial real estate loans, compared to 58% one year ago. Our commercial real estate business generally focuses on larger owners and operators of commercial real estate. Figure 17 includes commercial mortgage and construction loans in both Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. As shown in Figure 17, this loan portfolio is diversified by both property type and geographic location of the underlying collateral.  As shown in Figure 17, at March 31, 2012, our commercial real estate portfolio included mortgage loans of $7.8 billion and construction loans of $1.3 billion, representing 16% and 3%, respectively, of our total loans. Nonowner-occupied loans represented 12% of our total loans and owner-occupied loans represented 6% of our total loans. The average size of mortgage loans originated during the first quarter of 2012 was $3.1 million, and our largest mortgage loan at March 31, 2012, had a balance of $65 million. At March 31, 2012, our average construction loan commitment was $3.9 million. Our largest construction loan commitment was $56 million, and our largest construction loan amount outstanding was $48 million.  Also shown in Figure 17, at March 31, 2012, 65% of our commercial real estate loans were for nonowner-occupied properties compared to 67% at March 31, 2011. Approximately 18% and 22% of these loans were construction loans at March 31, 2012    92    Table of Contents  and 2011, respectively. Typically, these properties are not fully leased at the origination of the loan. The borrower relies upon additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide the cash flow necessary to support debt service payments. Uncertain economic conditions generally slow the execution of new leases and may also lead to the turnover of existing leases, driving rental rates and occupancy rates down. As we have experienced during the first three months of 2012, we expect vacancy rates for retail, office and industrial space to remain elevated throughout 2012.  Figure 17.

Since March 31, 2011, our nonowner occupied commercial real estate portfolio has been reduced by approximately $1.2 billion, or 17%, as many of our clients have taken advantage of opportunities to permanently refinance their loans at historically low interest rates.  If the economic recovery stalls, it may weaken commercial real estate market fundamentals (i.e., vacancy rates, the stability of rental income and asset values), leading to reduced cash flow to support debt service payments. Reduced client cash flow would adversely affect our ability to collect such payments. Accordingly, the value of our commercial real estate loan portfolio could be adversely affected.  Commercial lease financing. We conduct financing arrangements through our Key Equipment Finance line of business and have both the scale and array of products to compete in the equipment lease financing business. Commercial lease financing receivables represented 17% of commercial loans at March 31, 2012, and 19% at March 31, 2011.  Commercial loan modification and restructuring  Certain commercial loans are modified and extended in the normal course of business for our clients. Loan modifications vary and are handled on a case by case basis with strategies responsive to the specific circumstances of each loan and borrower. In many cases, borrowers have other resources and can reinforce the credit with additional capital, collateral, guarantees or income sources.  Modifications are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan credit quality while at the same time meeting our clients’ financing needs. Modifications made to loans of creditworthy borrowers not experiencing financial difficulties and under circumstances where ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt are not classified as    93    Table of Contents  TDRs. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, TDR classification occurs when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and a creditor concession has been granted.  Our concession types are primarily categorized as interest rate reductions, principal deferral, or forgiveness of principal. Loan extensions are sometimes coupled with these primary concession types. As a result of improving economic conditions combined with the restructuring of these loans to provide the optimal opportunity for successful repayment by the borrower, we have seen certain of our restructured loans returning to accrual status and consistent performance under the restructured loan terms for each primary type of concession over the past year.  In cases where the loan terms were extended at less than normal market rates for similar lending arrangements, we have transferred these loans to the Asset Recovery Group for resolution. During the first three months of 2012, there were $86 million of new restructured loans included in nonperforming loans, of which $8 million related to commercial real estate.  For more information on concession types for our commercial accruing and nonaccruing TDRs, see Note 4 (“Asset Quality”).  Figure 18 quantifies restructured loans and TDRs.  Figure 18.

Right-sizing the A note to sustainable cash flow should ultimately allow for its return to accrual status and thereupon a resumption of interest income recognition. Similarly, appropriately-sized A notes will allow for upgraded credit classification based on rehabilitated credit metrics, including demonstrated payment performance. Other benefits include the borrower’s retention of ownership and control of the asset, deleveraged and sustainable capital structure (often sufficient to attract fresh capital into the transaction) and rehabilitation of local markets by minimizing distressed/fire sales.  We use an A-B note structure for our TDRs, breaking the existing loan into two tranches. First, we create an A note. As the objective of this TDR note structure is to achieve a fully performing and well-rated A note, we focus on sizing that note to a level that is supported by cash flow available to service debt at current market terms and consistent with our customary underwriting standards. This note structure will typically include a debt coverage ratio of 1.2 or better of cash flow to monthly payments of market interest, and principal amortization of generally not more than 25 years. (These metrics are adjusted from time to time based upon changes in long-term markets and take out underwriting standards of our various lines of business.) Appropriately sized A notes are more likely to return to accrual status, allowing us to resume recognizing interest income. As the borrower’s payment performance improves, these restructured notes also typically allow for upgraded internal quality risk rating classification. Moreover, as noted above, the borrower retains ownership and control of the underlying collateral (typically, commercial real estate), the borrower’s capital structure is strengthened (often to the point that fresh capital is attracted to the transaction), and local markets are spared distressed/fire sales.  The B note is typically an interest-only note with no required amortization until the property stabilizes and generates excess cash flow. This excess cash flow is customarily applied directly to the principal of the A note. We evaluate the B note when we consider returning the A note to accrual status. In many cases, the B note is charged off at the same time the A note is returned to accrual status. Alternatively, both A and B notes may be simultaneously returned to accrual if credit metrics are supportive.    94    Table of Contents Restructured nonaccrual loans may be returned to accrual status based on a current, well documented evaluation of the credit, which would include analysis of the borrower’s financial condition, prospects for repayment under the modified terms and or alternate sources of repayment such as the value of loan collateral. Establishment of the borrower’s ability to sustain historical repayment performance would require a reasonable period (generally a minimum of 6 months) prior to the date on which the loan is returned to accrual status. Sustained historical repayment performance for a reasonable time prior to the restructuring may be taken into account. The primary consideration for returning a restructured loan to accrual status is the reasonable assurance that the full contractual principal balance of the loan along with ongoing contractually required interest payments can be expected to be fully repaid. Although our policy is a guideline, considerable judgment is required to review each borrower’s circumstances.  All loans processed as a TDR, including A notes and any non-charged-off B notes, are reported as TDRs during the calendar year in which the restructure took place.  Extensions. Certain commercial loans are modified and extended in the normal course of business for our clients. Project loans are typically refinanced into the permanent commercial loan market at maturity; however, due to the limited sources of permanent commercial mortgage financing available in the market today and the market-wide decline in leasing activity and rental rates, an increased number of loans have been extended. Extension terms take into account the specific circumstances of the client relationship, the status of the project and near-term prospects for both the client and the collateral. In all cases, pricing and loan structure are reviewed and (where necessary) modified to ensure the loan has been priced to achieve a market rate of return and loan terms (i.e., amortization, covenants and term) that are appropriate for the risk. Typical enhancements include one or more of the following: principal paydown, increased amortization, additional collateral, increased guarantees, and/or a cash flow sweep. As previously mentioned, some maturing construction loans have automatic extension options built in and in those cases where the borrower qualifies for the extension option, pricing and loan terms cannot be altered. Most project loans by their nature are “collateral-dependent” as cash flow from the project loans or the sale of the real estate provides for repayment of the loan.  Pricing of a loan is determined based on the strength of the borrowing entity and the strength of the guarantor, if any. Therefore, pricing may remain the same (e.g., the loan is already priced at or above current market). We do not consider loan extensions in the normal course of business (under existing loan terms or at market rates) as TDRs, particularly when ultimate collection of all principal and interest is not in doubt and no concession has been made. In the case of loan extensions outside of the normal course of business—where either collection of all principal and interest is uncertain or a concession has been made— we would analyze such credit under the accounting guidance to determine whether it qualifies as a TDR. Extensions that qualify as TDRs are measured for impairment under the applicable accounting guidance.  Guarantors. A detailed guarantor analysis is conducted (1) for all new extensions of credit, (2) at the time of any material modification/extension, and (3) typically annually, as part of our on-going portfolio and loan monitoring procedures. This analysis includes submission by the guarantor entity of all appropriate financial statements, including balance sheets, income statements, tax returns, and real estate schedules.  While the specific steps of each guarantor analysis may have some minor differences, the high level objectives include reaching a conclusion regarding the overall financial conditions of the guarantor entities, including: size, quality, and nature of asset base; net worth (adjusted to reflect our opinion of market value); leverage; standing liquidity; recurring cash flow; contingent and direct debt obligations; and near term debt maturities.  Borrower and guarantor financial statements are required at least annually within 90-120 days of the calendar/fiscal year end. Income statements and rent rolls for project collateral are required quarterly. In some cases, disclosure of certain information including liquidity, certifications, status of asset sales or debt resolutions, and real estate schedules may be required more frequently.  We routinely seek performance from guarantors of impaired debt, if the guarantor is solvent. In limited circumstances, we would not seek to enforce the guaranty, including situations in which we are precluded by bankruptcy and/or it is determined the cost to pursue a guarantor exceeds the value to be returned given the guarantor’s verified financial condition. We are often successful in obtaining either monetary payment and/or the cooperation of our solvent guarantors to help mitigate loss, cost and the expense of collections.  As of March 31, 2012, we had $60 million of mortgage and construction loans that had a loan to value ratio greater than 1.0, and were accounted for as performing loans. These loans were not considered impaired due to one or more of the following    95    Table of Contents  factors: (i) underlying cash flow adequate to service the debt at a market rate of return with adequate amortization; (ii) a satisfactory borrower payment history; and (iii) acceptable guarantor support.  Consumer loan portfolio  Consumer loans outstanding decreased by $650 million, or 4%, from one year ago. Most of the decrease is attributable to our exit portfolio, as shown in Figure 35 in the “Credit risk management” section.  The home equity portfolio is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio. Approximately 95% of this portfolio at March 31, 2012 is derived from our Key Community Bank. The remainder of the portfolio, which has been in an exit mode since the fourth quarter of 2007, was originated from the Consumer Finance line of business and is now included in Other Segments. Home equity loans from our Key Community Bank decreased by $268 million, or 3%, over the past twelve months.  As shown in Figure 15, we hold the first lien position for approximately 53% of the Key Community Bank home equity portfolio at March 31, 2012 and March 31, 2011. For consumer loans with real estate collateral, we track borrower performance monthly. Credit metrics including updated FICO scores as well as original and updated LTVs regardless of lien position are updated at least quarterly. This information is used in establishing the ALLL. Our methodology is described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses” on page 117 of our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Figure 19 summarizes our home equity loan portfolio by source at the end of each of the last five quarters, as well as certain asset quality statistics and yields on the portfolio as a whole.

As previously reported, we have experienced a decrease in our consumer loan portfolio. We expect that the portfolio will continue to decrease in future periods as a result of our actions to exit dealer-originated home equity loans and indirect retail lending for marine and recreational vehicle products. We ceased originating new education loans effective December 5, 2009 and account for this business in discontinued operations.  Loans held for sale  As shown in Note 3 (“Loans and Loans Held for Sale”), our loans held for sale decreased to $511 million at March 31, 2012 from $728 million at December 31, 2011 and totaled $426 million at March 31, 2011. Loans held for sale related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business, which are excluded from total loans held for sale at March 31, 2011, totaled $14 million. There were no loans held for sale related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business at March 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011.  At March 31, 2012, loans held for sale included $362 million of commercial mortgages, which increased by $75 million from March 31, 2011, and $76 million of residential mortgage loans, which increased $24 million from March 31, 2011.  Loan sales  As shown in Figure 20, during the first three months of 2012, we sold $715 billion of commercial real estate loans, $400 million of residential real estate loans, and $36 million of commercial loans. Most of these sales came from the held-for-sale portfolio.    96    Table of Contents Figure 20 summarizes our loan sales for the first three months of 2012 and all of 2011.  Figure 20.

Additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in Note 12 (“Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) under the heading “Recourse agreement with FNMA.”  We derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold. We earn noninterest income (recorded as “other income”) from fees for servicing or administering loans. This fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets. In addition, we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing of commercial real estate loans.  Securities  Our securities portfolio totaled $17.7 billion at March 31, 2012, compared to $18.1 billion at December 31, 2011, and $19.5 billion at March 31, 2011. Available-for-sale securities were $14.6 billion at March 31, 2012, compared to $16 billion at December 31, 2011, reflecting the liquidity needs arising from changes in our loan and deposit balances and investments in held-to-maturity securities. Held-to-maturity securities were $3 billion at March 31, 2012, compared to $2.1 billion at December 31, 2011, primarily reflecting increases in agency mortgage-backed securities as we continue to prepare for potential future changes in regulatory capital rules. At March 31, 2012, we had $3 billion in CMOs in our held-to-maturity securities portfolio.  As shown in Figure 22, all of our mortgage-backed securities, which include both securities available for sale and held-to-maturity securities, are issued by government-sponsored enterprises or GNMA, and are traded in highly liquid secondary markets. These securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value for the available-for-sale portfolio and at cost for the held-to-maturity portfolio. For more information about these securities, see Note 5 (“Fair Value Measurements”) under the heading “Qualitative Disclosures of Valuation Techniques” and Note 6 (“Securities”).    97    Table of Contents Figure 22.

Securities available-for-sale  The majority of our securities available-for-sale portfolio consists of CMOs, which are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities. CMOs generate interest income and serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements. At March 31, 2012, we had $14.6 billion invested in CMOs and other mortgage-backed securities in the available-for-sale portfolio, compared to $15.9 billion at December 31, 2011, and $19.3 billion at March 31, 2011.  During the first three months of 2012, we had net losses of $17 million from CMOs and other mortgage-backed securities, of which all were net unrealized losses. The net unrealized losses resulted from an increase in market interest rates and were recorded in the AOCI component of shareholders’ equity. We continue to maintain a moderate asset-sensitive interest rate risk position.  We periodically evaluate our securities available-for-sale portfolio in light of established A/LM objectives, changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio, and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. These evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning.  In addition, the size and composition of our securities available-for-sale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required (or elect) to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits. Although we generally use debt securities for this purpose, other assets, such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit, are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles.  During the first quarter of 2012, our investing activities continued to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs. For most of the first half of 2011, we chose not to reinvest the monthly security cash flows and also sold approximately $1.6 billion of CMOs. These actions provided the liquidity necessary to address the funding requirements arising from the loss of certain escrow deposit balances related to commercial mortgage securitizations serviced by Key and rated by Moody’s, and also contributed funds for our TARP repayment in March 2011.  Figure 23 shows the composition, yields and remaining maturities of our securities available for sale.

Our held-to-maturity securities have increased during the second half of 2011 and into 2012 due to purchases of Federal Agency CMOs as we increased this portfolio in response to potential future changes in regulatory capital rules.

(b) Excludes $5 million of securities at March 31, 2012, that have no stated yield.    99    Table of Contents Other investments  Principal investments — investments in equity and mezzanine instruments made by our Principal Investing unit — represented 61% of other investments at March 31, 2012. They include direct investments (investments made in a particular company) as well as indirect investments (investments made through funds that include other investors). Principal investments are predominantly made in privately held companies and are carried at fair value ($729 million at March 31, 2012, $709 million at December 31, 2011, and $943 million at March 31, 2011). During the first half of 2011, employees who managed our various principal investments formed two independent entities that now serve as investment managers of these investments. Under this arrangement, which was mutually agreeable to both parties, these individuals are no longer employees of Key. As a result of these changes, which were made during the second quarter of 2011, we deconsolidated certain of these direct and indirect investments, totaling $234 million.  In addition to principal investments, “other investments” include other equity and mezzanine instruments, such as certain real estate-related investments that are carried at fair value, as well as other types of investments that generally are carried at cost.  Most of our other investments are not traded on an active market. We determine the fair value at which these investments should be recorded based on the nature of the specific investment and all available relevant information. This review may encompass such factors as the issuer’s past financial performance and future potential, the values of public companies in comparable businesses, the risks associated with the particular business or investment type, current market conditions, the nature and duration of resale restrictions, the issuer’s payment history, our knowledge of the industry, third party data and other factors determined relevant. During the first three months of 2012, net gains from our principal investing activities (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) totaled $35 million, which includes $28 million of net unrealized gains. These net gains are recorded as “net gains (losses) from principal investing” on the income statement. Additional information regarding these investments is provided in Note 5 (“Fair Value Measurements”).  Deposits and other sources of funds  Domestic deposits are our primary source of funding. During the first quarter of 2012, average deposits were $58.9 billion and represented 82% of the funds we used to support loans and other earning assets, compared to $59.0 billion and 78% during the same quarter of 2011. The composition of our average deposits is shown in Figure 6 in the section entitled “Net interest income.”  The decrease in average domestic deposits in the first quarter of 2012, compared to the first quarter of 2011, was due to a decline in certificates of deposit ($100,000 or more) and other time deposits and was partially offset by an increase in NOW and money market deposit accounts, and noninterest-bearing deposits. The mix of deposits continues to change as higher-costing certificates of deposit mature and re-price to current market rates and clients move their balances to transaction and nonmaturity deposit accounts, such as NOW and money market savings accounts, or look for other alternatives for investing in the current low-rate environment.  Approximately $5.5 billion of our certificates of deposit outstanding at March 31, 2012, mature over the next three quarters. The maturities of these certificates of deposit are as follows: $2.5 billion at a 1.54% cost mature in the second quarter of 2012, $1.9 billion at a 2.92% cost mature in the third quarter of 2012, and $1.1 billion at a 2.64% cost mature in the fourth quarter of 2012. These re-pricing opportunities will benefit our net interest margin. These certificates of deposit maturities and improved funding mix have reduced the cost of total deposits, which is down 4 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2011.  Wholesale funds, consisting of deposits in our foreign office and short-term borrowings, averaged $3.1 billion during the first quarter of 2012, compared to $4.2 billion during the year-ago quarter. The change from the first quarter of 2011 resulted from a $271 million decrease in foreign office deposits, a $525 million decrease in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and a $248 million decrease in bank notes and other short-term borrowings.  On January 11, 2012, we signed a purchase and assumption agreement to acquire 37 retail branches in Buffalo and Rochester, NY. The deposits associated with these branches total approximately $2.4 billion, while loans total approximately $400 million. This excess liquidity will be available to fund debt maturities and loan growth. The transaction is expected to close early third quarter of 2012, subject to customary closing conditions. On April 18, 2012, we received regulatory approval from the OCC for the transaction.    100    Table of Contents Capital  At March 31, 2012, our shareholders’ equity was $10.1 billion, up $194 million from December 31, 2011. The following sections discuss certain factors that contributed to this change. For other factors that contributed to the change, see the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity.  As previously reported, on January 1, 2010, we adopted new consolidation accounting guidance which required us to consolidate our education loan securitization trusts (classified as discontinued assets and liabilities). As a result, we consolidated our education loan securitization trusts and made a corresponding $45 million cumulative effect adjustment. That consolidation added $2.8 billion in discontinued assets, and the same amount of liabilities and equity to our balance sheet; loans constituted $2.6 billion of the assets. During the third quarter of 2011, we determined that the $45 million cumulative effect adjustment made related to the consolidation of these trusts on January 1, 2010 was incorrect. Further information regarding this error and its correction is provided in Note 11 (“Acquisition and Discontinued Operations”).  Comprehensive capital assessment review and capital actions  As part of its ongoing supervisory process, the Federal Reserve requires a BHC to submit an annual Comprehensive Capital Plan as well as to update such plan to reflect material changes in a firm’s risk profile, business strategies, or corporate structure, including but not limited to changes in planned capital actions. On January 9, 2012, we submitted to the Federal Reserve and provided to the OCC under the annual CCAR process our 2012-2013 Comprehensive Capital Plan. At its March 2012 meeting, our Board authorized the purchase in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions of up to $312 million of our Common Shares. This authorization was expressly in addition to any amounts remaining under preexisting authority. Pursuant to our 2012 capital plan submitted to the Federal Reserve as part of CCAR and not objected to by the Federal Reserve, KeyCorp has authority to purchase up to $344 million of our Common Shares, including $312 million for general repurchase and up to $32 million for repurchase in connection with employee elections under our compensation and benefit programs. Our existing repurchase program does not have an expiration date. Common Share repurchases under the current authorization commenced in April 2012 and are expected to be executed on through the first quarter of 2013. Our 2012 capital plan also includes an increase in our Common Share dividend from $.03 to $.05 per share that will be evaluated by our Board of Directors at its regular May Board meeting. Future increases will be evaluated by the Board of Directors based upon our earnings, financial condition, and other factors, including regulatory review. On April 18, 2012, we received regulatory approval from the OCC for the transaction. Further information regarding the capital plan process and CCAR is included in the “Supervision and Regulation” section under the heading “Capital Assessment and Review of Capital Actions” beginning on page 8 of our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act provide for the phase-out of Tier 1 capital treatment for capital securities beginning in 2013. As a result, our outstanding capital securities will eventually become Tier 2 capital. Management continues to evaluate its options with respect to the remaining outstanding capital securities. A notice of proposed rulemaking related to the implementation of Basel III is expected in the first half of 2012. This proposal is expected to include the phase-out of trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital treatment.  On April 16, 2012, KeyCorp commenced a consent solicitation from the holders of record as of April 10, 2012 of the outstanding trust preferred securities (“Trust Preferred Securities”) of KeyCorp Capital VII for the termination of the Replacement Capital Covenant, dated as of February 27, 2008, as amended (the “RCC”), by KeyCorp in favor of and for the benefit of each Covered Debtholder (as defined in such RCC). On April 27, 2012, KeyCorp announced that, effective as of April 26, 2012, a majority of the holders of record of the Trust Preferred Securities in liquidation amount of KeyCorp Capital VII consented to terminate the RCC. Pursuant to the terms of the consent solicitation, the termination of the RCC therefore became effective on April 26, 2012. Should KeyCorp elect to redeem KeyCorp Capital X, it may now do so without complying with the RCC.  Repurchase of TARP CPP preferred stock, warrant and completion of equity and debt offerings  As previously reported during the first half of 2011, Key completed the repurchase of the $2.5 billion of Series B Preferred Stock and corresponding warrant issued to the U.S. Treasury Department. As a result of the repurchase, we recorded a $49 million one-time deemed dividend in the first quarter of 2011 related to the remaining difference between the repurchase price and the carrying value of the preferred shares at the time of repurchase. On April 20, 2011 we repurchased the warrant directly from the U.S. Treasury for $70 million. Beginning with the second quarter of 2011, the repurchase resulted in the elimination of quarterly dividends of $31 million and discount amortization of $4 million, or $140 million on an annual basis, related to these preferred shares. In total, Key paid $2.867 billion to the U.S. Treasury during the investment period in the    101    Table of Contents  form of dividends, principal and repurchase of the warrant, resulting in a return to the U.S. Treasury of $367 million above the initial investment of $2.5 billion on November 14, 2008.  Dividends  During the first quarter of 2012, we made a dividend payment of $.03 per share, or $29 million, on our Common Shares. As noted above, our Board of Directors will evaluate an increase in our quarterly dividend from $.03 per share to $.05 per share at its regular May Board meeting.  Also during the first quarter of 2012, we made a dividend payment of $1.9375 per share or $6 million on our Series A Preferred Stock.  During the first quarter of 2011, we made dividend payments of $31 million to the U.S. Treasury on the Series B Preferred Stock as a participant in the U.S. Treasury’s TARP CPP. The repurchase of this Preferred Stock in March 2011 eliminated future quarterly dividends of $31 million, or $125 million on an annual basis.  Common shares outstanding  Our Common Shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol KEY with 33,451 holders of record at March 30, 2012. At March 31, 2012 our book value per Common Share was $10.26 based on 956.1 million shares outstanding at March 31, 2012, compared to $10.09 based on 953.0 million shares outstanding at December 31, 2011, and $9.58 based on 953.9 million shares outstanding at March 31, 2011.
