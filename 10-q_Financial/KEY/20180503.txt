Item 1A. Risk Factors.Regulatory capital requirementsThe final rule to implement the Basel III international capital framework (“Basel III”) was effective January 1, 2015, with a multi-year transition period ending on December 31, 2018 (“Regulatory Capital Rules”). The Basel III capital framework and the U.S. implementation of the Basel III capital framework are discussed in more detail in Item 1. Business of our 2017 Form 10-K under the heading “Supervision and Regulation - Regulatory capital requirements.”Under the Regulatory Capital Rules, standardized approach banking organizations, such as KeyCorp and KeyBank, are required to meet the minimum capital and leverage ratios set forth in Figure 4 below. At March 31, 2018, Key had an estimated Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 9.91% under the fully phased-in Regulatory Capital Rules. Also at March 31, 2018, based on the fully phased-in Regulatory Capital Rules, Key estimates that its capital and leverage ratios, after adjustment for market risk, would be as set forth in Figure 4.11Table of ContentsFigure 4.

As a standardized approach banking organization, KeyCorp is not subject to the countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% imposed upon an advanced approaches banking organization under the Regulatory Capital Rules.(c)As a standardized approach banking organization, KeyCorp is not subject to the 3% supplemental leverage ratio requirement, which became effective January 1, 2018.Revised prompt corrective action framework The federal prompt corrective action (“PCA”) framework under the FDIA groups FDIC-insured depository institutions into one of five prompt corrective action capital categories: “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” and “critically undercapitalized.” In addition to implementing the Basel III capital framework in the United States, the Regulatory Capital Rules also revised the prompt corrective action capital category threshold ratios applicable to FDIC-insured depository institutions such as KeyBank, with an effective date of January 1, 2015. The revised Prompt Corrective Action Framework table in Figure 5 identifies the capital category thresholds for a “well capitalized” and an “adequately capitalized” institution under the Prompt Corrective Action Framework. Figure 5.

However, investors should not regard this determination as a representation of the overall financial condition or prospects of KeyBank because the prompt corrective action framework is intended to serve a limited supervisory function. Moreover, it is important to note that the prompt corrective action framework does not apply to BHCs, like KeyCorp.Recent regulatory capital-related developmentsOn September 27, 2017, the federal banking agencies issued a joint proposal to simplify certain aspects of the Regulatory Capital Rules for standardized approach banking organizations (the “Simplification Proposal”), including Key. In anticipation of the Simplification Proposal, on August 22, 2017, the agencies issued a companion proposal to extend the current capital treatment for certain items that are part of the Simplification Proposal and also subject to the multi-year transition period for the Regulatory Capital Rules, which ends on December 31, 2018 (the “Transitions Proposal”). The Transitions Proposal was published as a final rule in the Federal Register on November 21, 2017, and is expected to alleviate the burden that would have resulted from the continued phase-in of those capital requirements as the agencies seek public comment on and work to finalize the Simplification Proposal. The Simplification Proposal and the Transitions Proposal are discussed in more detail in Item 1. Business of our 2017 Form 10-K under the heading “Supervision and Regulation - Regulatory capital requirements - Recent regulatory capital-related developments.”In December 2017, the Basel Committee released its final revisions to Basel III. The revisions seek to restore credibility in the calculation of risk-weighted assets and improve the comparability of regulatory capital ratios across banking organizations. The revisions are discussed in more detail in Item 1. Business of our 2017 Form 10-K under 12Table of Contentsthe heading “Supervision and Regulation - Regulatory capital requirements - Recent regulatory capital-related developments.” The U.S. federal banking agencies released a statement announcing their support for the Basel Committee’s efforts, but cautioned that they will consider how to appropriately incorporate these revisions into the Regulatory Capital Rules, and that any proposed changes based on the Basel Committee revisions would be subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking. In view of the prohibition under the Dodd-Frank Act on the use of credit ratings in federal regulation, there is some uncertainty as to whether or how the agencies would implement the ratings-based aspects of the Basel Committee revisions to Basel III, as well as any other aspect of the Basel Committee revisions that permit the U.S. agencies to exercise home-country discretion, for example, due to differences in accounting or market practices, and legal requirements.Subsequently, in February 2018, the Basel Committee released for public consultation a proposal to update the Pillar 3 disclosure framework, to more appropriately align it to the changes adopted under the Basel Committee’s final revisions to Basel III. The public consultation period ends on May 25, 2018. Before any action is taken by the federal banking agencies with respect to the revised Pillar 3 disclosure framework, it first must be adopted in final form by the Basel Committee, and the federal agencies must determine whether and to what extent they will implement the final revisions to Basel III released by the Basel Committee in December 2017. Capital planning and stress testingOn December 7, 2017, the Federal Reserve released for public comment a package of proposals that would increase the transparency of its stress testing program while maintaining the Federal Reserve’s ability to test the resilience of the nation’s largest, most complex banks. The proposals responded to public and industry calls for more transparency around the CCAR program. The proposals are discussed in more detail in Item 1. Business of our 2017 Form 10-K under the heading “Supervision and Regulation - Regulatory capital requirements - Recent developments in capital planning and stress testing.”In a separate release, published April 10, 2018, the Federal Reserve invited comment on a proposal to integrate certain aspects of the Federal Reserve’s Regulatory Capital Rules with the CCAR and stress test rules, in order to simplify the overall capital framework that is currently applicable to banking organizations subject to the capital plan rule (including KeyCorp). Under the proposal, the Federal Reserve would (1) amend the capital conservation buffer requirement under the Regulatory Capital Rules by replacing the static risk-weighted assets component of the buffer with a new measure, the stress capital buffer, which would be based on the results of an individual banking organization’s annual supervisory stress test; (2) introduce a stress leverage buffer requirement that would replace the existing Tier 1 leverage requirement under CCAR; (3) modify certain assumptions under the supervisory stress test; (4) remove the 30% dividend payout ratio limitation as a criterion for heightened supervisory scrutiny of an organization’s capital plan; and (5) eliminate the CCAR quantitative objection. Under the proposed rule, a banking organization would not be subject to any limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments if it satisfies all minimum capital requirements and its capital conservation requirement (as amended to incorporate the stress capital buffer), stress leverage buffer requirement, and, if applicable, the advanced approaches capital conservation buffer requirement and supplementary leverage ratio standard (the latter two of which do not apply to KeyCorp). If it is adopted as a final rule, the proposal would be effective December 31, 2018; however, the stressed capital buffer and stress leverage buffer requirements would generally not be effective until October 1, 2019. Key expects that the proposal would have a marginally favorable impact on its capital requirements. Liquidity requirementsIn October 2014, the federal banking agencies published a final rule to implement the Basel III liquidity coverage ratio (“Basel III LCR”) for U.S. banking organizations (the “Liquidity Coverage Rules”) that establishes a minimum LCR for certain internationally active bank and nonbank financial companies (excluding KeyCorp) and a modified version of the LCR (“Modified LCR”) for BHCs and other depository institution holding companies with over $50 billion in consolidated assets that are not internationally active (including KeyCorp). KeyBank will not be subject to the LCR or the Modified LCR under the Liquidity Coverage Rules unless the OCC affirmatively determines that application to KeyBank is appropriate in light of KeyBank’s asset size, level of complexity, risk profile, scope of operations, affiliation with foreign or domestic covered entities, or risk to the financial system.13Table of ContentsUnder the Liquidity Coverage Rules, KeyCorp must calculate a Modified LCR on a monthly basis, and was required to satisfy a minimum Modified LCR requirement of 100% by January 1, 2017. At March 31, 2018, Key’s Modified LCR was above 100%. In the future, KeyCorp may change the composition of our investment portfolio, increase the size of the overall investment portfolio, and modify product offerings to enhance or optimize our liquidity position.Net stable funding ratioThe federal banking agencies commenced the U.S. implementation of the Basel III net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) in April and May 2016, with the release of a proposed rule to implement a NSFR requirement for certain internationally active banking organizations (excluding KeyCorp) and a modified version of the minimum NSFR requirement (“Modified NSFR”) for BHCs and other depository institution holding companies with over $50 billion in consolidated assets that are not internationally active (including KeyCorp), together with quarterly public disclosure requirements. The proposed rule would require banking organizations to satisfy a minimum NSFR requirement of 1.0 on an ongoing basis. However, banking organizations subject to the Modified NSFR (like KeyCorp) would be required to maintain a lower minimum amount of available stable funding, equal to 70% of the required stable funding under the NSFR. The proposed rule was scheduled to be effective on January 1, 2018; however, it has not been adopted in final form. The comment period for the NPR expired on August 5, 2016. If the proposed NSFR requirement is adopted as a final rule, then similar to actions taken in connection with the implementation of the Liquidity Coverage Rules, KeyCorp may adjust its balance sheet or modify product offerings to enhance its liquidity position.Resolution and recovery planningBHCs with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, like KeyCorp, are required to periodically submit to the Federal Reserve and FDIC a plan discussing how the company could be rapidly and efficiently resolved if the company failed or experienced material financial distress. Insured depository institutions with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets, like KeyBank, are also required to submit a resolution plan to the FDIC. These plans are due annually, usually by December 31 of each year. For 2015, these resolution plans, the third required fromKeyCorp and KeyBank, were submitted on December 1, 2015. KeyCorp and KeyBank were not required to submitresolution plans for 2016 because the FDIC and Federal Reserve deferred such requirement (for 38 firms, includingKeyCorp) until December 2017 and the FDIC deferred such requirement (for a number of insured depositoryinstitutions, including KeyBank) until July 1, 2018. On December 1, 2017, KeyCorp submitted its resolution plan to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. The Federal Reserve and FDIC make available on their websites the public sections of resolution plans for the companies, including KeyCorp and KeyBank, that submitted plans. The public section of the resolution plans of KeyCorp and KeyBank is available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/resolution-plans.htm and https://www.fdic.gov/regulations/reform/resplans/.On September 28, 2016, the OCC released final guidelines that establish standards for recovery planning by certain large OCC-regulated institutions, including KeyBank. The guidelines require such institutions to establish a comprehensive framework for evaluating the financial effects of severe stress events, and recovery actions an institution may pursue to remain a viable, going concern during a period of severe financial stress. Under the final guidelines, an institution’s recovery plan must include triggers to alert the institution of severe stress events, escalation procedures, recovery options, and a process for periodic review and approval by senior management and the board of directors. The recovery plan should be tailored to the complexity, scope of operations, and risk profile of the institution. Because KeyBank had average total consolidated assets of greater than $100 billion but less than $750 billion as reported on KeyBank’s Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income for the four most recent consecutive quarters prior to January 1, 2017, it was required to be in compliance with the guidelines not later than January 1, 2018. We believe that KeyBank is in compliance with the guidelines.14Table of ContentsDeposit insurance and assessmentsAs required under the Dodd-Frank Act, in March 2015, the FDIC approved a final rule to impose a surcharge on the quarterly deposit insurance assessments of insured depository institutions having total consolidated assets of at least $10 billion (like KeyBank). The surcharge is 4.5 cents per $100 of the institution’s assessment base (after making certain adjustments). The final rule became effective on July 1, 2016. As of July 1, 2016, KeyBank must pay a surcharge to assist in bringing the reserve ratio to the statutory minimum of 1.35%. Surcharges will continue through the quarter that the DIF reserve ratio reaches or exceeds 1.35%, but not later than December 31, 2018. If the reserve ratio does not reach 1.35% by December 31, 2018 (provided it is at least 1.15%), the FDIC will impose a shortfall assessment on March 31, 2019, on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more (like KeyBank).In December 2016, the FDIC issued a final rule that imposes recordkeeping requirements on insured depository institutions with two million or more deposit accounts (including KeyBank) in order to facilitate rapid payment of insured deposits to customers if the institutions were to fail. The rule requires those insured depository institutions to: (i) maintain complete and accurate data on each depositor’s ownership interest by right and capacity for all of the institution’s deposit accounts; and (ii) develop the capability to calculate the insured and uninsured amounts for each deposit owner within 24 hours of failure. The FDIC will conduct periodic testing of compliance with these requirements, and institutions subject to the rule must submit to the FDIC a certification of compliance, signed by the KeyBank chief executive officer, and deposit insurance coverage summary report on or before the mandatory compliance date and annually thereafter. The final rule became effective on April 1, 2017, with a mandatory compliance date of April 1, 2020. The FDIC has been releasing Frequently Asked Questions for Part 370 on a rolling basis, and has committed to continue this practice as institutions subject to the rule present issues associated with its implementation that require FDIC consultation. Supervision and governanceOn August 3, 2017, the Federal Reserve published an NPR to align its supervisory rating system for large financialinstitutions, including KeyCorp, with the post-crisis supervisory programs for these firms (the “LFI Rating System”).If adopted in final form, the LFI Rating System would provide a supervisory evaluation of whether an institutionpossesses sufficient operational strength and resilience to maintain safe and sound operations through a range ofconditions, and assess an institution’s capital planning and positions, liquidity risk management and positions, andgovernance and controls. Institutions subject to the LFI Rating System would be rated using the following scale:Satisfactory, Satisfactory Watch, Deficient-1, and Deficient-2, with the Satisfactory Watch rating intended to be usedas a transitory rating to allow an institution time to remediate a concern identified during the supervisory evaluation.The governance and controls component of the LFI Rating System is the subject of two separate, but relatedproposals: (1) proposed guidance regarding supervisory expectations for boards of directors of large financialinstitutions; and (2) proposed guidance regarding core principles for effective senior management, businessmanagement, and independent risk management and controls for large financial institutions. On January 4, 2018, the Federal Reserve released the final component of the proposed LFI Rating System — proposed guidance regarding core principles for effective senior management, business management, andindependent risk management and controls for large financial institutions. The proposals and guidance are discussed in more detail in Item 1. Business of our 2017 Form 10-K under the heading “Supervision and Regulation - Other Regulatory Developments under the Dodd-Frank Act - Supervision and governance.” ERISA fiduciary standardIn April 2016, the Department of Labor published final rules and amendments to certain prohibited transaction exemptions regarding which service providers would be regarded as fiduciaries under ERISA for making investment advice recommendations to: (i) certain retirement plan fiduciaries, participants, or beneficiaries; and (ii) owners or beneficiaries of individual retirement accounts and health savings accounts, among other retirement plans. The purpose of the rules is to place fiduciary obligations, rather than the lesser legal obligations that currently apply, on these service providers. Accordingly, the rules subject any financial institution making recommendations for either the purchase or sale of investments in or rollover of the respective retirement plan to certain fiduciary obligations under ERISA such as an impartial conduct standard and not selling certain investment products whose compensation may raise a conflict of interest for the advisor without entering into a contract providing certain disclosures and legal remedies to the customer. Under the Department of Labor’s original rules, the impartial 15Table of Contentsstandard requirement for financial institutions and their advisors was to become effective April 10, 2017. However, in response to a Presidential Order, the Department of Labor extended the effective date to June 9, 2017. The contract provisions were required to be in place by January 1, 2018. However, on November 29, 2017, the Department of Labor extended the applicability of the contract rules until July 1, 2019, while it continues to review requested comments concerning whether to modify, further delay, or rescind these rules in whole or in part. On March 15, 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit invalidated the rule in its entirety. Other federal courts have upheld the rule. It is unclear what impact these decisions will have on the rules.Results of OperationsEarnings overviewThe following chart provides a reconciliation of net income from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders for the three months ended March 31, 2017, to the three months ended March 31, 2018 (dollars in millions): The following discussion explains the key factors that caused these elements to change.Net interest incomeOne of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets (such as loans and securities) and loan-related fee income, and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. There are several factors that affect net interest income, including: •the volume, pricing, mix, and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities;•the volume and value of net free funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and equity capital;•the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk;•interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace;•asset quality; and•fair value accounting of acquired earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.To make it easier to compare both the results across several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets (some taxable, some not), we present net interest income in this discussion on a “TE basis” (i.e., as if all income were taxable and at the same rate). For example, $100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as $126, an amount that, if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 21%, would yield $100. Prior to 2018, $100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as $154, an amount that, if taxed at the previous statutory federal income tax rate of 35%, would yield $100.16Table of ContentsFigure 6 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense, and their respective yields or rates over the past five quarters. This figure also presents a reconciliation of TE net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with GAAP for each of those quarters. The net interest margin, which is an indicator of the profitability of the earning assets portfolio less cost of funding, is calculated by dividing annualized TE net interest income by average earning assets.TE net interest income was $952 million for the first quarter of 2018, and the net interest margin was 3.15%, compared to TE net interest income of $929 million and a net interest margin of 3.13% for the first quarter of 2017, reflecting the benefit from higher interest rates and low deposit betas. First quarter 2018 net interest income included $33 million of purchase accounting accretion, a decline of $20 million from the first quarter of 2017. In 2018, we expect net interest income to be in the range of $3.95 billion to $4.05 billion.Average loans were $86.9 billion for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $794 million compared to the first quarter of 2017, reflecting broad-based growth in commercial and industrial loans with middle-market clients, as well as strength in auto lending as the company expands into existing geographies and dealer relationships. In addition, reductions in commercial real estate loans over the past year reflect significantly higher debt placements and paydowns. For 2018, we anticipate average loans to be in the range of $88.5 billion to $89.5 billion.Average deposits totaled $102.6 billion for the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $478 million compared to the year-ago quarter. Certificates of deposits and other time deposits increased $1.5 billion, reflecting strength in Key’s retail banking franchise and growth from commercial relationships. Additionally, consumer noninterest-bearing balances grew 10% from the prior year. NOW and money-market deposit accounts declined $792 million, partially driven by a shift to higher-yielding deposit products and the managed exit of certain higher cost corporate and public sector deposits. For 2018, we anticipate average deposits to be in the range of $104.5 billion to $105.5 billion.17Table of ContentsFigure 6.

The decrease of $2 million in our provision for credit losses was related to a decrease in net loan-charge offs during the first quarter of 2018 compared to one year ago. In 2018, we expect the provision to slightly exceed net loan charge-offs to provide for loan growth.Noninterest incomeAs shown in Figure 8, noninterest income was $601 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $577 million for the year-ago quarter. Noninterest income represented 39% of total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to 38% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. In 2018, we expect noninterest income to be in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion.The following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest income and the factors that caused those elements to change.20Table of ContentsFigure 8. Noninterest Income (a)Other noninterest income includes operating lease income and other leasing gains, corporate services income, corporate-owned life insurance income, consumer mortgage income, mortgage servicing fees, net gains (losses) from principal investing, and other income. See the "Consolidated Statements of Income" in Item 1. Financial Statements of this report.Trust and investment services income Trust and investment services income consists of brokerage commissions, trust and asset management fees, and insurance income. The assets under management that primarily generate these revenues are shown in Figure 9. For the three months ended March 31, 2018, trust and investment services income decreased $2 million, or 1.5%, compared to the same period one year ago, primarily due to a decrease in fixed income brokerage commissions. A significant portion of our trust and investment services income depends on the value and mix of assets under management. At March 31, 2018, our bank, trust, and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of $39.0 billion, compared to $37.4 billion at March 31, 2017. As shown in Figure 9, the increase in assets under management was primarily attributable to market growth over the past twelve months.21Table of ContentsFigure 9. Assets Under Management in millionsMarch 31, 2018December 31, 2017September 30, 2017June 30, 2017March 31, 2017Assets under management by investment type:     Equity$23,629$24,081$23,342$22,824$22,522Securities lending8379478768071,095Fixed income11,09810,93011,00910,81910,497Money market3,4393,6303,4333,1633,303Total assets under management$39,003$39,588$38,660$37,613$37,417      Investment banking and debt placement feesInvestment banking and debt placement fees consists of syndication fees, debt and equity financing fees, financial adviser fees, gains on sales of commercial mortgages, and agency origination fees. Investment banking and debt placement fees increased $16 million, or 12.6%, from the year-ago quarter, primarily related to the Cain Brothers acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as continued growth in our core franchise. In the first quarter of 2018, commercial mortgage banking and mergers and acquisitions advisory fees contributed to the strong performance. Cards and payments incomeCards and payments income, which consists of debit card, consumer and commercial credit card, and merchant services income, decreased $3 million, or 4.6%, from the year-ago quarter. Cards and payments income and other expense both declined due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard. The new accounting standard had no net impact to income during the first quarter of 2018. Excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, cards and payments increased $8 million from the year-ago quarter driven by strength in our core products and the impact of the Key Merchant Services acquisition in the second quarter of 2017.Service charges on deposit accountsService charges on deposit accounts increased $2 million, or 2.3%, for the three months ended March 31, 2018, compared to the same period one year ago. The increase from the three months ended March 31, 2017, was driven by an increase in account analysis fees.Other noninterest incomeOther noninterest income includes operating lease income and other leasing gains, corporate services income,corporate-owned life insurance income, consumer mortgage income, mortgage servicing fees, net gains (losses)from principal investing, and other income. Other noninterest income increased $11 million, or 6.7%, from the year-ago quarter. Operating lease income and other leasing gains contributed to the increase, up $9 million from the year-ago period, driven by higher originations. Corporate services income grew $8 million related to higher loan and derivative trading income. These increases were partially offset by a decline in other income. Noninterest expenseAs shown in Figure 10, noninterest expense was $1.0 billion for the first quarter of 2018 and first quarter of 2017. Figure 10 gives a breakdown of our major categories of noninterest expense as a percentage of total noninterest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018. In 2018, we expect noninterest expense to be in the range of $3.85 billion to $3.95 billion.Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, we no longer separately report merger-related charges.22Table of ContentsFigure 10. Noninterest Expense (a)Other noninterest expense includes equipment, operating lease expense, marketing, FDIC assessment, intangible asset amortization, OREO expense, net, and other expense. See the "Consolidated Statements of Income" in Item 1. Financial Statements of this report.(a)See Figure 2 entitled “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations,” which presents the computations of certain financial measures related to “cash efficiency.” The table reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures, which provides a basis for period-to-period comparisons.Figure 11.

This increase was largely due to recent acquisitions, as well as accelerated technology investments and higher performance-based compensation.23Table of ContentsFigure 12.

This decrease was primarily due to lower property reserve and rental expenses.Other noninterest expenseOther noninterest expense includes equipment, operating lease expense, marketing, FDIC assessment, intangible asset amortization, OREO expenses, and other miscellaneous expense categories. Other noninterest expense decreased $23 million, or 8.7%, from the year-ago quarter. Other expense declined from a year ago, primarily driven by a $20 million philanthropic contribution made in the first quarter of 2017. These declines are partially offset by higher marketing expense, higher operating lease expenses driven by increased volumes, and costs related to recent acquisitions.Income taxesWe recorded tax expense from continuing operations of $62 million for the first quarter of 2018 and $94 million for the first quarter of 2017.Our federal tax expense differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate, primarily because we generate income from investments in tax-advantaged assets, such as corporate-owned life insurance and credits associated with renewable energy and low-income housing investments, and make periodic adjustments to our tax reserves. Tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2018, and March 31, 2017, was affected by net discrete income tax benefits of $26 million and $19 million, respectively. Excluding those benefits, the tax expense for the first quarter of 2018 was $88 million.Additional information pertaining to how our tax expense (benefit) and the resulting effective tax rates were derived is included in Note 14 (“Income Taxes”) beginning on page 156 of our 2017 Form 10-K.Line of Business ResultsThis section summarizes the financial performance of our two major business segments (operating segments): Key Community Bank and Key Corporate Bank. Note 18 (“Line of Business Results”) describes the products and services offered by each of these business segments, provides more detailed financial information pertaining to the segments, and explains “Other Segments” and “Reconciling Items.”Figure 13 summarizes the contribution made by each major business segment to our “taxable-equivalent revenue from continuing operations” and “income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to Key” for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018, and March 31, 2017.24Table of ContentsFigure 13.

Key Community Bank summary of operationsAs shown in Figure 14, Key Community Bank recorded net income attributable to Key of $196 million for the first quarter of 2018, compared to $147 million for the same period one year ago.TE net interest income increased in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017, primarily attributable to the benefit from higher interest rates and growth in loans. Average loans and leases increased from the year-ago quarter largely driven by a $1.1 billion, or 6.1%, increase in commercial and industrial loans. Average deposit balances increased from the year-ago quarter driven by increases in certificates of deposits and other time deposits.The provision for credit losses increased slightly from the year-ago quarter while net loan charge-offs were flat as overall credit quality was stable.Noninterest income was up from the year-ago quarter, driven by higher assets under management from market growth, as well as increases across several fee categories. During the first quarter of 2018, cards and payments income and other expense both declined due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard resulting in no net impact to income. Excluding the impact of the new revenue recognition accounting standard, cards and payments income increased from the year-ago quarter driven by strength in our core products and the impact of the Key Merchant Services acquisition in the second quarter of 2017. Noninterest expense increased from the year-ago quarter, as personnel expense increased $17 million driven by recent acquisitions and ongoing investments, including our residential mortgage platform and HelloWallet. Nonpersonnel expense increased $26 million driven by technology development costs, marketing expenses, higher volume related expenses, and the impact of recent acquisitions, including HelloWallet and Key Merchant Services. 25Table of ContentsFigure 14.

TE net interest income decreased in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the first quarter of 2017, primarily attributable to lower spreads on earning assets and lower purchase accounting accretion. Average loans and leases increased from the year-ago quarter largely driven by a $1.2 billion, or 5.2%, increase in commercial and industrial loans. Average deposit balances decreased from the year-ago quarter driven by the managed exit of higher cost corporate and public sector deposits. The provision for credit losses and net loan charge-offs both decreased slightly from the year-ago quarter as overall credit quality continued to improve.Noninterest income was up from the year-ago quarter, driven by higher investment banking and debt placement fees related to the acquisition of Cain Brothers as well as continued growth in our core franchise. Operating lease income and other leasing gains increased due to higher originations, and corporate services income increased due 26Table of Contentsto higher derivatives revenues. These increases were partially offset by a decline in other noninterest income related to lower gains from certain real estate investments.Noninterest expense increased from the year-ago quarter, largely driven by higher operating lease expense and intangible asset amortization.Figure 15.

Commercial and industrial loans are the largest component of our loan portfolio, representing 50% of our total loan portfolio at March 31, 2018, and 48% at December 31, 2017. This portfolio is approximately 83% variable rate and consists of loans originated in both Key Corporate Bank and Key Community Bank to large corporate, middle market, and small business clients.Commercial and industrial loans totaled $44.3 billion at March 31, 2018, an increase of $2.5 billion, or 5.9%, compared to December 31, 2017. The growth was broad-based and spread across most industry categories, including increased lending in the financial, commercial real estate, and utilities industries, which combined accounted for approximately 65% of the growth at March 31, 2018.Commercial real estate loans. Our commercial real estate portfolio includes both mortgage andconstruction loans, and is originated through two primary sources: our 15-state banking franchise, and KeyBankReal Estate Capital, a national line of business that cultivates relationships with owners of commercial real estatelocated both within and beyond the branch system. Approximately 69% of our average commercial real estate loans are generated by our KeyBank Real Estate Capital line of business. Nonowner-occupied properties, generally properties for which at least 50% of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties, represented 79% of total commercial real estate loans outstanding at March 31, 2018. Construction loans, which provide a stream of funding for properties not fully leased at origination to support debt service payments over the term of the contract or project, represented 12% of commercial real estate loans at period end.29Table of ContentsAt March 31, 2018, commercial real estate loans totaled $15.9 billion, which includes $1.9 billion of construction loans. Compared to December 31, 2017, this portfolio decreased $180 million, or 1.1%. We continue to focus primarily on owners of completed and stabilized commercial real estate in accordance with our relationship strategy.As shown in Figure 18, our commercial real estate loan portfolio includes various property types and geographiclocations of the underlying collateral. These loans include commercial mortgage and construction loans in both KeyCommunity Bank and Key Corporate Bank. Figure 18.

As shown in Figure 14, we held the first lien position for approximately 60% of the Key Community Bank home equity portfolio at both March 31, 2018, and March 31, 2017. For loans with real estate collateral, we track borrower performance monthly. Regardless of the lien position, credit metrics are refreshed quarterly, including recent FICO scores as well as updated loan-to-value ratios. This information is used in establishing the ALLL. Our methodology is described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses” beginning on page 102 of our 2017 Form 10-K.30Table of ContentsFigure 19.

Sales of loans classified as held for sale generated net gains of $44 million in the first three months of 2018.Among the factors that we consider in determining which loans to sell are: •our business strategy for particular lending areas;•whether particular lending businesses meet established performance standards or fit with our relationship banking strategy;•our A/LM needs;•the cost of alternative funding sources;•the level of credit risk;•capital requirements; and•market conditions and pricing.Figure 20 summarizes our loan sales for the first three months of 2018 and all of 2017.Figure 20.

Additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in Note 15 (“Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) under the heading “Recourse agreement with FNMA.”We derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold. We earn noninterest income (recorded as “mortgage servicing fees”) from fees for servicing or administering loans. This fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets. In addition, we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing loans. Additional information about our mortgage servicing assets is included in Note 8 (“Mortgage Servicing Assets”).SecuritiesOur securities portfolio totaled $30.1 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $30.0 billion at December 31, 2017. Available-for-sale securities were $17.9 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $18.1 billion at December 31, 2017. Held-to-maturity securities were $12.2 billion at March 31, 2018, and $11.8 billion at December 31, 2017.As shown in Figure 22, all of our mortgage-backed securities, which include both securities available for sale and held-to-maturity securities, are issued by government-sponsored enterprises or GNMA and traded in liquid secondary markets. These securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value for the available-for-sale portfolio and at amortized cost for the held-to-maturity portfolio. For more information about these securities, see Note 5 (“Fair Value Measurements”) under the heading “Qualitative Disclosures of Valuation Techniques,” and Note 6 (“Securities”).Figure 22.

CMOs are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities. These mortgage securities generate interest income, serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements, and provide liquidity value under regulatory requirements.We periodically evaluate our securities available for sale portfolio in light of established A/LM objectives, changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio, the regulatory requirements, and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. These evaluations may cause us to take steps to adjust our overall balance sheet positioning.In addition, the size and composition of our securities available for sale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required (or elect) to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds 32Table of Contentsand trust deposits. Although we generally use debt securities for this purpose, other assets, such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit, are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles.Our investing activities continue to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs. Our actions to not reinvest the monthly security cash flows at various times provide the liquidity necessary to address our funding requirements. These funding requirements include ongoing loan growth and occasional debt maturities. At other times, we may make additional investments that go beyond the replacement of maturities or mortgage security cash flows as our liquidity position and/or interest rate risk management strategies may require. Lastly, our focus on investing in high quality liquid assets, including GNMA securities, is related to liquidity management strategies to satisfy regulatory requirements.Figure 23 shows the composition, yields, and remaining maturities of our securities available for sale.

Breakdown of Deposits at March 31, 2018  Deposits are our primary source of funding. At March 31, 2018, our deposits totaled $104.8 billion, a decrease of $484 million compared to December 31, 2017. Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased $2.1 billion, which were elevated during the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of short-term escrows and seasonal deposit inflows. Partly offsetting the decline in noninterest-bearing deposits were increases in NOW and money market deposit accounts, which increased $979 million, and certificates of deposits and other time deposits, which increased $576 million, reflecting strength in Key’s retail banking franchise and growth from commercial relationships. Wholesale funds, consisting of short-term borrowings and long-term debt, totaled $15.5 billion at March 31, 2018, compared to $15.3 billion at December 31, 2017. The increase in wholesale funds from December 31, 2017, reflects an increase in short-term borrowings as a result of strong commercial loan growth and seasonal deposit outflows during the first quarter of 2018.CapitalThe objective of capital management is to maintain capital levels consistent with our risk appetite and of a sufficient amount to operate under a wide range of economic conditions. We have identified four primary uses of capital:1. Investing in our businesses, supporting our clients, and loan growth;2. Maintaining or increasing our Common Share dividend;3. Returning capital in the form of Common Share repurchases to our shareholders; and4. Remaining disciplined and opportunistic about how we invest in our franchise to include selective acquisitionsover time.The following sections discuss certain ways we have deployed our capital. For further information, see the Consolidated Statements of Changes in Equity and Note 17 (“Shareholders' Equity”).34Table of ContentsDividendsConsistent with our 2017 capital plan, we paid a quarterly dividend of $.105 per Common Share, for the first quarter of 2018. We made a payment of $12.50 per depositary share on the depositary shares related to our Series D Preferred Stock during the first quarter of 2018, for a total of $7 million. We made a payment of $.382813 per depositary share on the depositary shares related to our Series E Preferred Stock during the first quarter of 2018, for a total of $8 million.Further information regarding the capital planning process and CCAR is included under the heading “Capital planning and stress testing” in the “Supervision and Regulation” section beginning on page 12 of our 2017 Form 10-K. Common shares outstandingOur Common Shares are traded on the NYSE under the symbol KEY with 35,674 holders of record at March 31, 2018. Our book value per Common Share was $13.07 based on 1.065 billion shares outstanding at March 31, 2018, compared to $13.09 per Common Share based on 1.069 billion shares outstanding at December 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, our tangible book value per Common Share was $10.35, compared to $10.35 per Common Share at December 31, 2017.Figure 26 shows activities that caused the change in outstanding common shares over the past five quarters.Figure 26.

This decrease was primarily due to common share repurchases under our 2017 capital plan.At March 31, 2018, we had 191.8 million treasury shares, compared to 187.6 million treasury shares at December 31, 2017. Going forward we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stock-based compensation awards and for other corporate purposes.Information on repurchases of Common Shares by KeyCorp is included in Part II, Item 2. “Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds” of this report.35Table of ContentsCapital adequacyCapital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance. All of our capital ratios remained in excess of regulatory requirements at March 31, 2018. Our capital and liquidity levels are intended to position us to weather an adverse operating environment while continuing to serve our clients’ needs, as well as to meet the Regulatory Capital Rules described in the “Supervision and regulation” section of Item 2 of this report. Our shareholders’ equity to assets ratio was 10.90% at March 31, 2018, compared to 10.91% at December 31, 2017. Our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 8.22% at March 31, 2018, compared to 8.23% at December 31, 2017. The minimum capital and leverage ratios under the Regulatory Capital Rules together with the estimated ratios of KeyCorp at March 31, 2018, calculated on a fully phased-in basis, are set forth under the heading “Basel III” in the “Supervision and Regulation” section in Item 1 of our 2017 Form 10-K.Figure 27 represents the details of our regulatory capital positions at March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, under the Regulatory Capital Rules.

The most significant risks we face are credit, compliance, operational, liquidity, market, reputation, strategic, and model risks. Our risk management activities are focused on ensuring that we properly identify, measure, and manage such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness, and to maximize profitability.The Board serves in an oversight capacity, ensuring that Key’s risks are managed in a manner that is not only effective and balanced, but also adds value for the shareholders. The Board understands Key’s risk philosophy, approves the risk appetite, inquires about risk practices, reviews the portfolio of risks, compares the actual risks to the risk appetite, and is apprised of significant risks, both actual and emerging, and determines whether management is responding appropriately. The Board challenges management and ensures accountability.The Board’s Audit Committee assists the Board in oversight of financial statement integrity, regulatory and legal requirements, independent auditors’ qualifications and independence, and the performance of the internal audit function and independent auditors. The Audit Committee meets with management and approves significant policies relating to the risk areas overseen by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee has responsibility over all risk review functions, including internal audit, as well as financial reporting, legal matters, and fraud risk. The Audit Committee also receives reports on enterprise risk. In addition to regularly scheduled bi-monthly meetings, the Audit Committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases.The Board’s Risk Committee assists the Board in oversight of strategies, policies, procedures, and practices relating to the assessment and management of enterprise-wide risk, including credit, market, liquidity, model, operational, compliance, reputation, and strategic risks. The Risk Committee also assists the Board in overseeing risks related to capital adequacy, capital planning, and capital actions. The Risk Committee reviews and provides oversight of management’s activities related to the enterprise-wide risk management framework, which includes review of the ERM Policy, including the Risk Appetite Statement, and management and ERM reports. The Risk Committee also approves any material changes to the charter of the ERM Committee and significant policies relating to risk management.The Audit and Risk Committees meet jointly, as appropriate, to discuss matters that relate to each committee’s responsibilities. Committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting. All members of the Board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months.Our ERM Committee, chaired by the Chief Executive Officer and comprising other senior level executives, is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite. The ERM Program encompasses our risk philosophy, policy, framework, and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company. The ERM Committee reports to the Board’s Risk Committee. Annually, the Board reviews and approves the ERM Policy, as well as the risk appetite, including corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories. We use a risk-adjusted capital framework to manage risks. This framework is approved and managed by the ERM Committee.Tier 2 Risk Governance Committees support the ERM Committee by identifying early warning events and trends, escalating emerging risks, and discussing forward-looking assessments. Risk Governance Committees include attendees from each of the Three Lines of Defense. The First Line of Defense is the line of business primarily responsible to accept, own, proactively identify, monitor, and manage risk. The Second Line of Defense comprises Risk Management representatives who provide independent, centralized oversight over all risk categories by aggregating, analyzing, and reporting risk information. Risk Review, our internal audit function, provides the Third Line of Defense in its role to provide independent assessment and testing of the effectiveness of, appropriateness of, and adherence to KeyCorp’s risk management policies, practices, and controls. The Chief Risk Officer ensures that relevant risk information is properly integrated into strategic and business decisions, ensures appropriate ownership of risks, provides input into performance and compensation decisions, assesses aggregate enterprise risk, monitors capabilities to manage critical risks, and executes appropriate Board and stakeholder reporting.37Table of ContentsFederal banking regulators continue to emphasize with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution. We believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks, and conform to regulatory expectations.Market risk managementMarket risk is the risk that movements in market risk factors, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, commodity prices, credit spreads, and volatilities will reduce Key’s income and the value of its portfolios. These factors influence prospective yields, values, or prices associated with the instrument. We are exposed to market risk both in our trading and nontrading activities, which include asset and liability management activities. Information regarding our fair value policies, procedures, and methodologies is provided in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Fair Value Measurements” on page 103 of our 2017 Form 10-K and Note 5 (“Fair Value Measurements”) in this report. Trading market riskKey incurs market risk as a result of trading activities that are used in support of client facilitation and hedging activities, principally within our investment banking and capital markets businesses. Key has exposures to a wide range of risk factors including interest rates, equity prices, foreign exchange rates, credit spreads, and commodity prices, as well as the associated implied volatilities and spreads. Our primary market risk exposures are a result of trading and hedging activities in the derivative and fixed income markets, including securitization exposures. At quarter-end, we did not have any re-securitization positions. We maintain modest trading inventories to facilitate customer flow, make markets in securities, and hedge certain risks including but not limited to credit risk and interest rate risk. The risks associated with these activities are mitigated in accordance with the Market Risk hedging policy. The majority of our positions are traded in active markets. Market risk management is an integral part of Key’s risk culture. The Risk Committee of our Board provides oversight of trading market risks. The ERM Committee and the Market Risk Committee regularly review and discuss market risk reports prepared by our MRM group that contain our market risk exposures and results of monitoring activities. Market risk policies and procedures have been defined and approved by the Market Risk Committee, a Tier 2 Risk Governance Committee, and take into account our tolerance for risk and consideration for the business environment. Information regarding monitoring of trading positions and the activities related to the Market Risk Rule compliance can be found within the latest 10-K. VaR and stressed VaR. VaR is the estimate of the maximum amount of loss on an instrument or portfolio due to adverse market conditions during a given time interval within a stated confidence level. Stressed VaR is used to assess extreme conditions on market risk within our trading portfolios. The MRM group calculates VaR and stressed VaR on a daily basis, and the results are distributed to appropriate management. VaR and stressed VaR results are also provided to our regulators and utilized in regulatory capital calculations. We use a historical simulation VaR model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and credit spreads on the fair value of our covered positions and other non-covered positions. We analyze market risk by portfolios, and do not separately measure and monitor our portfolios by risk type. VaR is calculated using daily observations over a one-year time horizon, and approximates a 95% confidence level. Statistically, this means that we would expect to incur losses greater than VaR, on average, five out of 100 trading days, or three to four times each quarter. We also calculate VaR and stressed VaR at a 99% confidence level. For more information regarding our VaR model, its governance and assumptions see ”Market Risk Management” in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” on page 68 of our 2017 Form 10-K.Actual losses for the total covered positions did not exceed aggregate daily VaR on any day during the quarters ended March 31, 2018, and March 31, 2017. The MRM group backtests our VaR model on a daily basis to evaluate its predictive power. The test compares VaR model results at the 99% confidence level to daily held profit and loss. Results of backtesting are provided to the Market Risk Committee. Backtesting exceptions occur when trading losses exceed VaR. We do not engage in correlation trading, or utilize the internal model approach for measuring default and credit migration risk. Our net VaR approach incorporates diversification, but our VaR calculation does not include the impact of counterparty risk and our own credit spreads on derivatives.38Table of ContentsThe aggregate VaR at the 99% confidence level with a one day holding period for all covered positions was $1 million at March 31, 2018, and $2 million at March 31, 2017. The decrease in aggregate VaR was primarily due to the decreased exposure in our fixed income portfolios. Starting with the third quarter of 2017, the aggregate VaR does not include the VaR for the credit derivatives that represented the hedging activities for the commercial real estate warehouse portfolio. These activities are no longer considered as covered portfolios. Figure 28 summarizes our VaR at the 99% confidence level with a one day holding period for significant portfolios of covered positions for the three months ended March 31, 2018, and March 31, 2017.Figure 28.

Market risk is a component of our internal capital adequacy assessment. Our risk-weighted assets include a market risk-equivalent asset amount, which consists of a VaR component, stressed VaR component, a de minimis exposure amount, and a specific risk add-on including the securitization positions. The aggregate market value of the securitization positions as defined by the Market Risk Rule was $52 million at March 31, 2018. This amount included $25 million of mortgage-backed securities positions and $27 million of asset-backed securities positions. Specific risk is the price risk of individual financial instruments, which is not accounted for by changes in broad market risk factors and is measured through a standardized approach. Market risk weighted assets, including the specific risk calculations, are run quarterly by the MRM in accordance with the Market Risk Rule, and approved by the Chief Market Risk Officer.Nontrading market riskMost of our nontrading market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations and its impacts on our traditional loan and deposit products, as well as investments, hedging relationships, long-term debt, and certain short-term borrowings. Interest rate risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the EVE. Such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. We manage the exposure to changes in net interest income and the EVE in accordance with our risk appetite and in accordance with the Board approved ERM policy.Interest rate risk positions are influenced by a number of factors including the balance sheet positioning that arises out of customer preferences for loan and deposit products, economic conditions, the competitive environment within our markets, changes in market interest rates that affect client activity, and our hedging, investing, funding, and capital positions. The primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of reprice risk, basis risk, yield curve risk, and option risk.39Table of Contents•“Reprice risk” is the exposure to changes in the level of interest rates and occurs when the volume of interest-bearing liabilities and the volume of interest-earning assets they fund (e.g., deposits used to fund loans) do not mature or reprice at the same time.•“Basis risk” is the exposure to asymmetrical changes in interest rate indices and occurs when floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities reprice at the same time, but in response to different market factors or indexes.•“Yield curve risk” is the exposure to nonparallel changes in the slope of the yield curve (where the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity) and occurs when interest-bearing liabilities and the interest-earning assets that they fund do not price or reprice to the same term point on the yield curve.•“Option risk” is the exposure to a customer or counterparty’s ability to take advantage of the interest rate environment and terminate or reprice one of our assets, liabilities, or off-balance sheet instruments prior to contractual maturity without a penalty. Option risk occurs when exposures to customer and counterparty early withdrawals or prepayments are not mitigated with an offsetting position or appropriate compensation.The management of nontrading market risk is centralized within Corporate Treasury. The Risk Committee of our Board provides oversight of nontrading market risk. The ERM Committee and the ALCO review reports on the interest rate risk exposures described above. In addition, the ALCO reviews reports on stress tests and sensitivity analyses related to interest rate risk. These committees have various responsibilities related to managing nontrading market risk, including recommending, approving, and monitoring strategies that maintain risk positions within approved tolerance ranges. The A/LM policy provides the framework for the oversight and management of interest rate risk and is administered by the ALCO. The MRM, as the second line of defense, provides additional oversight.Net interest income simulation analysis. The primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis. For purposes of this analysis, we estimate our net interest income based on the current and projected composition of our on- and off-balance sheet positions, accounting for recent and anticipated trends in customer activity. The analysis also incorporates assumptions for the current and projected interest rate environments, and balance sheet growth projections based on a most likely macroeconomic view. The results of simulation analysis reflect management’s desired interest rate risk positioning. The modeling incorporates investment portfolio and swap portfolio balances consistent with management’s desired interest rate risk positioning. The simulation model estimates the amount of net interest income at risk by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if interest rates were to gradually increase or decrease over the next 12 months. Our standard rate scenarios encompass a gradual, parallel increase or decrease of 200 basis points, but due to the low interest rate environment, we have modified the standard decrease scenario to a gradual, parallel decrease of 150 basis points over nine months with no change over the following three months. After calculating the amount of net interest income at risk to interest rate changes, we compare that amount with the net interest income generated in an unchanged interest rate environment.Figure 30 presents the results of the simulation analysis at March 31, 2018, and March 31, 2017. At March 31, 2018, our simulated impact to changes in interest rates was modestly asset-sensitive. In March 2018, the Federal Reserve increased the range for the Federal Funds Target Rate, which led to an increase in the magnitude of the declining rate scenario to 150 basis points. Tolerance levels for risk management require the development of remediation plans to maintain residual risk within tolerance if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual, parallel 200 basis point increase or 150 basis point decrease in interest rates over the next 12 months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 5.5%. As a result of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases, our modeled exposure to declining rates remains close to our tolerance levels.Figure 30. Simulated Change in Net Interest Income March 31, 2018    Basis point change assumption (short-term rates)-150 +200 Tolerance level-5.50%-5.50%Interest rate risk assessment-5.46%3.22%March 31, 2017    Basis point change assumption (short-term rates)-100 +200 Tolerance level-5.50%-5.50%Interest rate risk assessment-4.03%1.05%40Table of ContentsSimulation analysis produces a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on assumptions input into the model. We tailor certain assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled, and validate those assumptions on a regular basis. However, actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to unanticipated changes to the balance sheet composition, customer behavior, product pricing, market interest rates, changes in management’s desired interest rate risk positioning, investment, funding and hedging activities, and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events.We also perform regular stress tests and sensitivity analyses on the model inputs that could materially change the resulting risk assessments. Assessments are performed using different shapes of the yield curve, including steepening or flattening of the yield curve, immediate changes in market interest rates, and changes in the relationship of money market interest rates. Assessments are also performed on changes to the following assumptions: loan and deposit balances, the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities, changes in lending spreads, prepayments on loans and securities, investment, funding and hedging activities, and liquidity and capital management strategies.The results of additional assessments indicate that net interest income could increase or decrease from the base simulation results presented in Figure 30. Net interest income is highly dependent on the timing, magnitude, frequency, and path of interest rate changes and the associated assumptions for deposit repricing relationships, lending spreads, and the balance behavior of transaction accounts. If fixed rate assets increase by $1 billion, or fixed rate liabilities decrease by $1 billion, then the benefit to rising rates would decrease by approximately 30 basis points. If the interest bearing liquid deposit beta assumption increases or decreases by 5% (e.g. 40% to 45%), then the benefit to rising rates would change by approximately 90 basis points.Our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the competitive environment and client behavior that may affect the actual volume, mix, maturity, and repricing characteristics of loan and deposit flows. Treasury discretionary activities related to funding, investing, and hedging may also change as a result of changes in customer business flows, or changes in management’s desired interest rate risk positioning. As changes occur to both the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy, management proactively evaluates hedging opportunities that may change our interest rate risk profile.We also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second and third years of a three-year horizon. These simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a 12-month horizon. To capture longer-term exposures, we calculate exposures to changes of the EVE as discussed in the following section.Economic value of equity modeling. EVE complements net interest income simulation analysis as it estimates risk exposure beyond 12-, 24-, and 36-month horizons. EVE modeling measures the extent to which the economic values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates, measuring the resulting change in the values of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet instruments, and comparing those amounts with the base case of the current interest rate environment. Because the calculation of EVE under an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest rates in the current low rate environment results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than 200 basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points, we have modified the standard declining rate scenario to an immediate 150 basis point decrease. This analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with non-contractual maturities. Those assumptions are based on historical behaviors, as well as our expectations. We develop remediation plans that would maintain residual risk within tolerance if this analysis indicates that our EVE will decrease by more than 15% in response to an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates. We are operating within these guidelines as of March 31, 2018.Management of interest rate exposure. We use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate A/LM strategies to achieve the desired risk profile while managing to our objectives for capital adequacy and liquidity risk exposures. Specifically, we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities, issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates, and using derivatives — predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps, which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities.Figure 31 shows all swap positions that we hold for A/LM purposes. These positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. For example, fixed-rate debt is converted to a floating rate through a “receive fixed/pay variable” 41Table of Contentsinterest rate swap. The volume, maturity, and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader A/LM objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our risk profile, see Note 7 (“Derivatives and Hedging Activities”).Figure 31.

Liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions.Factors affecting liquidityOur liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events. An example of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency. Examples of indirect events (events unrelated to us) that could impair our access to liquidity would be an act of terrorism or war, natural disasters, political events, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund or hedge fund. Similarly, market speculation, or rumors about us or the banking industry in general, may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources.Our credit ratings at March 31, 2018, are shown in Figure 32. We believe these credit ratings, under normal conditions in the capital markets, would enable KeyCorp or KeyBank to issue fixed income securities to investors. Figure 32.

As of March 31, 2018, our loan-to-deposit ratio was 87%. In addition, we also have available unused sources of wholesale funding and liquid assets and borrowing capacity at the FHLB of Cincinnati and Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. Our liquid asset portfolio at March 31, 2018, totaled $22.3 billion, consisting of $20.8 billion of unpledged securities, $264 million of securities available for secured funding at the FHLB, and $1.3 billion of net balances of federal funds sold and balances in our Federal Reserve account. Additionally, as of March 31, 2018, our unused borrowing capacity secured by loan collateral was $25.0 billion at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and $7.0 billion at the FHLB. During the first quarter of 2018, our outstanding FHLB of Cincinnati advances were increased by $494 million as term advances were added. During the first quarter of 2018, KeyBank issued $500 million of 3.375% Senior Bank Notes due March 7, 2023, under its Global Bank Note Program.Liquidity for KeyCorp The primary source of liquidity for KeyCorp is from subsidiary dividends, primarily from KeyBank. KeyCorp has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt, support customary corporate operations and activities (including acquisitions), support occasional guarantees of subsidiaries’ obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner, and without adverse consequences, and pay dividends to shareholders.At March 31, 2018, KeyCorp held $2.1 billion in cash, which we projected to be sufficient to meet our projected obligations, including the repayment of our maturing debt obligations for the periods prescribed by our risk tolerance.Typically, KeyCorp meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from KeyBank. During the first quarter of 2018, KeyBank paid $375 million in dividends to KeyCorp. As of March 31, 2018, KeyBank had regulatory capacity to pay $1.0 billion in dividends to KeyCorp without prior regulatory approval.Our liquidity position and recent activityOver the past quarter, our liquid asset portfolio, which includes overnight and short-term investments, as well as unencumbered, high quality liquid securities held as protection against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios, has decreased as a result of lower balances held at the Federal Reserve and a decrease in unpledged securities. The liquid asset portfolio continues to exceed the amount that we estimate would be necessary to manage through an adverse liquidity event by providing sufficient time to develop and execute a longer-term solution.We generate cash flows from operations and from investing and financing activities. We have approximately $177 million of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments in international tax jurisdictions as of March 31, 2018. As we consider alternative long-term strategic and liquidity plans, opportunities to repatriate these amounts would result in approximately $2 million in taxes to be paid. We have included the appropriate amount as a deferred tax liability at March 31, 2018.The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018, and March 31, 2017.For more information regarding liquidity governance structure, factorings affecting liquidity, management of liquidity risk at KeyBank and KeyCorp, long-term liquidity strategies, and other liquidity programs see ”Liquidity Risk Management” in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” on page 73 of our 2017 Form 10-K.Credit risk managementCredit risk is the risk of loss to us arising from an obligor’s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms. Like other financial services institutions, we make loans, extend credit, purchase securities, add financial and payments products, and enter into financial derivative contracts, all of which have related credit risk.43Table of ContentsCredit policy, approval, and evaluationWe manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program. The Credit Risk Committee approves management credit policies and recommends for approval significant credit policies to the appropriate Board or Board committee. These policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit.Our credit risk management team and certain individuals within our lines of business, to whom credit risk management has delegated limited credit authority, are responsible for credit approval. Individuals with assigned credit authority are authorized to grant exceptions to credit policies. It is not unusual to make exceptions to established policies when mitigating circumstances dictate, however, a corporate level tolerance has been established to keep exceptions at an acceptable level based upon portfolio and economic considerations.Our credit risk management team uses risk models to evaluate consumer loans. These models, known as scorecards, forecast the probability of serious delinquency and default for an applicant. The scorecards are embedded in the application processing system, which allows for real-time scoring and automated decisions for many of our products. We periodically validate the loan grading and scoring processes.We maintain an active concentration management program to mitigate concentration risk in our credit portfolios. For individual obligors, we employ a sliding scale of exposure, known as hold limits, which is dictated by the type of loan and strength of the borrower. Our legal lending limit is approximately $2.2 billion for any individual borrower. However, internal hold limits generally restrict the largest exposures to less than 20% of that amount. As of March 31, 2018, we had 16 client relationships with loan commitments net of credit default swaps of more than $200 million. The average amount outstanding on these 16 individual net obligor commitments was $110 million at March 31, 2018. In general, our philosophy is to maintain a diverse portfolio with regard to credit exposures.Credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.

The methodology used is described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses” beginning on page 102 of our 2017 Form 10-K. Briefly, our allowance applies incurred loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics. We exercise judgment to assess any adjustment to the incurred loss rates for the impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions, lending policies including underwriting standards, and the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets. The ALLL at March 31, 2018, represents our best estimate of the incurred credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date. For more information about impaired loans, see Note 4 (“Asset Quality”).44Table of ContentsAs shown in Figure 34, our ALLL from continuing operations increased by $4 million, or 0.5%, from December 31, 2017. Our commercial ALLL increased by $7 million, or 1.0%, from December 31, 2017, primarily because of loan growth in the commercial and industrial loan portfolio, as well as credit quality migration. Our consumer ALLL decreased by $3 million, or 2.1%, from December 31, 2017, primarily due to continued improvement in credit quality metrics. Figure 34.

As shown in Figure 37, nonperforming assets at March 31, 2018, increased $35 million from December 31, 2017. This increase was largely driven by credit migration within our commercial and industrial loan portfolio.

These concessions are made to improve the collectability of the loan and generally take the form of a reduction of the interest rate, extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance.Figure 38 shows the types of activity that caused the change in our nonperforming loan balance during each of the last five quarters.Figure 38.

These events include, among other things, threats to our cybersecurity, as we are reliant upon information systems and the Internet to 47Table of Contentsconduct our business activities. Operational risk also encompasses compliance risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules and regulations, prescribed practices, and ethical standards. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, large financial companies like Key are subject to heightened prudential standards and regulation. This heightened level of regulation has increased our operational risk. Resulting operational risk losses and/or additional regulatory compliance costs could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation, or foregone opportunities.We seek to mitigate operational risk through identification and measurement of risk, alignment of business strategies with risk appetite and tolerance, and a system of internal controls and reporting. We continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of our operational risk and to ensure compliance with laws, rules, and regulations. For example, an operational event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational risk and losses. This tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action. We also rely upon software programs designed to assist in assessing operational risk and monitoring our control processes. This technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the Board.The Operational Risk Management Program provides the framework for the structure, governance, roles, and responsibilities, as well as the content, to manage operational risk for Key. The Compliance Risk Committee serves the same function in managing compliance risk for Key. Primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business. The Operational Risk Committee and Compliance Risk Committee are senior management committees that oversee our level of operational and compliance risk and direct and support our operational and compliance infrastructure and related activities. These committees and the Operational Risk Management and Compliance functions are an integral part of our ERM Program. Our Risk Review function regularly assesses the overall effectiveness of our Operational Risk Management and Compliance Programs and our system of internal controls. Risk Review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the Risk and Audit Committees and independently supports the Risk Committee’s oversight of these controls.CybersecurityWe maintain comprehensive Cyber Incident Response Plans, and we devote significant time and resources to maintaining and regularly updating our technology systems and processes to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks, and other technology assets against attempts by third parties to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems, or cause other damage. We and many other U.S. financial institutions have experienced distributed denial-of-service attacks from technologically sophisticated third parties. These attacks are intended to disrupt or disable online banking services and prevent banking transactions. We also periodically experience other attempts to breach the security of our systems and data. These cyberattacks have not, to date, resulted in any material disruption of our operations or material harm to our customers, and have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Cyberattack risks may also occur with our third-party technology service providers, and may result in financial loss or liability that could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Cyberattacks could also interfere with third-party providers’ ability to fulfill their contractual obligations to us. Recent high-profile cyberattacks have targeted retailers, credit bureaus, and other businesses for the purpose of acquiring the confidential information (including personal, financial, and credit card information) of customers, some of whom are customers of ours. We may incur expenses related to the investigation of such attacks or related to the protection of our customers from identity theft as a result of such attacks. We may also incur expenses to enhance our systems or processes in order to protect our customers whose information may have been exposed through the recent breach of the Equifax credit bureau or other external security incidents. Risks and exposures related to cyberattacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking, and other technology-based products and services by us and our clients.48Table of ContentsCritical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur business is dynamic and complex. Consequently, we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies. These choices are critical – not only are they necessary to comply with GAAP, they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance. All accounting policies are important, and all policies described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) beginning on page 100 of our 2017 Form 10-K should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance. Note 1 (“Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies”) of this report should also be reviewed for more information on accounting standards that have been adopted during the period.In our opinion, some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility. These policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance, or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. Because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances, they may prove to be inaccurate, or we may find it necessary to change them.We rely heavily on the use of judgment, assumptions, and estimates to make a number of core decisions, including accounting for the ALLL; contingent liabilities, guarantees and income taxes; derivatives and related hedging activities; and assets and liabilities that involve valuation methodologies. In addition, we may employ outside valuation experts to assist us in determining fair values of certain assets and liabilities. A brief discussion of each of these areas appears on pages 86 through 89 of our 2017 Form 10-K. During the first three months of 2018, we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates. 49Table of ContentsAccounting and Reporting DevelopmentsAccounting Guidance Pending Adoption at March 31, 2018StandardRequired Adoption DescriptionEffect on Financial Statements or Other Significant MattersASU 2016-02,Leases (Topic 842)ASU 2018-01, Leases (Topic 842): Land Easement Practical ExpedientJanuary 1, 2019 Early adoption is permittedThe ASU creates ASC Topic 842, Leases, and supersedes Topic 840, Leases. The ASU requires that a lessee recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Leveraged leases that commenced before the effective date of the new guidance are grandfathered. The recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. However, the ASU will require both types of leases to be recognized on the balance sheet. It also requires disclosures to better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements, providing additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. Upon transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach.Key has formed a cross-functional team to oversee the implementation of this ASU. Implementation efforts are ongoing, including the review of our lease portfolios and related lease accounting policies, the review of our service contracts for embedded leases, and the deployment of a new lease software solution. Key’s adoption of this ASU, which is expected to occur January 1, 2019, will result in an increase in right-of-use assets and associated lease liabilities, arising from operating leases in which Key is the lessee, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet.The amount of the right-of-use assets and associated lease liabilities recorded upon adoption will be based primarily on the present value of unpaid future minimum lease payments, the amount of which will depend on the population of leases in effect at the date of adoption. Key’s minimum future rental payments under noncancelable operating leases would be measured and recognized when the new guidance is adopted (refer to Note 22 (“Commitments, Contingent Liabilities, and Guarantees” in our 2017 Form 10-K). While these leases represent a large majority of the leases that are within scope of the new leasing standard, we continue to review service contracts to identify potential additional leases embedded in those arrangements that would be within the scope of the new standard. Between now and January 1, 2019, Key will likely have changes to the lease portfolio as we continue to evaluate and execute branch and occupancy optimization initiatives. In addition to final determination of the lease portfolio at the effective date, the initial measurement of the right-of-use asset and the corresponding liability will be affected by certain key assumptions such as expectations of renewals or extensions and the interest rate to be used to discount the future lease obligations. Up through the date of adoption, the evaluation of the impact of the standard will be adjusted based on new leases that are executed, leases that are terminated prior to the effective date, and any leases with changes to key assumptions or expectations such as renewals and extensions, and discount rates. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on the recognition of operating lease expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income.ASU 2017-08,PremiumAmortization onPurchasedCallable DebtSecuritiesJanuary 1, 2019Early adoption is permitted.The ASU amends ASC Topic 310-20, Receivables — Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs, and shortens the amortization period to the earliest call date for certain callable debt securities held at a premium. Securities held at a discount will continue to be amortized to maturity.The guidance should be implemented on a modifiedretrospective basis using a cumulative-effect adjustment.The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.ASU 2016-13Measurement ofCredit Losses onFinancialInstrumentsJanuary 1, 2020Early adoption is permitted as of January 1, 2019The ASU amends ASC Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, and significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The standard replaces today’s “incurred loss” approach with an “expected loss” model for instruments such as loans and HTM securities that are measured at amortized cost. The standard requires credit losses relating to AFS debt securities to be recorded through an allowance rather than a reduction of the carrying amount. It also changes the accounting for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans. The ASU retains many of the current disclosure requirements in current GAAP and expands certain disclosure requirements. This new guidance will affect the accounting for our loans, debt securities held to maturity and available for sale, and liabilities for credit losses on unfunded lending-related commitments as well as purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination.Key has formed a cross-functional implementation working group comprised of teams throughout Key, including finance and credit. The implementation team has developed a project plan that results in the adoption of the standard on January 1, 2020. During 2017, the implementation team focused on understanding the standard, identifying and researching key interpretive issues and designing models. The implementation team is also in the process of assessing governance related to the reasonable and supportable forecast period and continues to assess whether data that is required to comply with the standard is available and accurate. During 2018, the focus will be on execution and implementation, continued review and challenge of our models, data resolution, processes and controls, and reporting. Key expects that the new guidance will generally result in an increase in its allowance for credit losses, as it will cover credit losses over the full remaining expected life of loans and commitments and will consider future changes in macroeconomic conditions. Since the magnitude of the anticipated increase in the allowance for credit losses will be impacted by economic conditions and trends in the Company’s portfolio at the time of adoption, the quantitative impact cannot yet be reasonably estimated.ASU 2017-04,Simplifying theTest for GoodwillImpairmentJanuary 1, 2020Early adoption is permittedThe ASU amends ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other and eliminates the second step of the test for goodwill impairment. Under the new guidance, entities will compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, the entity is required to recognize an impairment charge for this amount. The new method applies to all reporting units and the performance of a qualitative assessment is still allowable.The guidance should be implemented using a prospective approach.The adoption of this accounting guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.50Table of ContentsEuropean Sovereign and Nonsovereign Debt ExposuresOur total European sovereign and Nonsovereign debt exposure is presented in Figure 39.Figure 39.

Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)1. Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of KeyCorp and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Some previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to current reporting practices.The consolidated financial statements include any voting rights entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the applicable accounting guidance for consolidations, we consolidate a VIE if we have: (i) a variable interest in the entity; (ii) the power to direct activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the entity’s economic performance; and (iii) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE (i.e., we are considered to be the primary beneficiary). Variable interests can include equity interests, subordinated debt, derivative contracts, leases, service agreements, guarantees, standby letters of credit, loan commitments, and other contracts, agreements, and financial instruments. See Note 9 (“Variable Interest Entities”) for information on our involvement with VIEs.We use the equity method to account for unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or VIEs if we have significant influence over the entity’s operating and financing decisions (usually defined as a voting or economic interest of 20% to 50%, but not controlling). Unconsolidated investments in voting rights entities or VIEs in which we have a voting or economic interest of less than 20% are carried at the cost measurement alternative or at fair value. Investments held by our registered broker-dealer and investment company subsidiaries (principal investing entities and Real Estate Capital line of business) are carried at fair value.We believe that the unaudited consolidated interim financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal recurring nature and disclosures that are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full year. The interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our 2017 Form 10-K.In preparing these financial statements, subsequent events were evaluated through the time the financial statements were issued. Financial statements are considered issued when they are widely distributed to all shareholders and other financial statement users or filed with the SEC.57Table of ContentsAccounting Guidance Adopted in 2018 StandardDate of AdoptionDescriptionEffect on Financial Statements or Other Significant MattersASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)ASU 2015-14, Deferral of Effective DateASU 2016-08, Principal versus Agent ConsiderationsASU 2016-10, Identifying Performance Obligations and LicensingASU 2016-11, Rescission of SEC Guidance because of Accounting Standard Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF MeetingASU 2016-12, Narrow-scope Improvements and Practical ExpedientsASU 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with CustomersJanuary 1, 2018These ASUs supersede the revenue recognition guidance in ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance. The core principle of these ASUs is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. These ASUs can be implemented using a retrospective method, or a cumulative-effect approach to new contracts and existing contracts with performance obligations as of the effective date. On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606), using the modified retrospective method for those contracts which were not completed as of that date. Results for reporting periods beginning January 1, 2018 are presented under ASC 606. As allowed under the new guidance, the comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. As a result of adopting ASC 606, we changed the timing of recognition for revenues related to insurance commissions, securities underwriting, and deposit account maintenance fees, however, those changes did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, results of operations, equity, or cash flows as of the adoption date or for the three months ended March 31, 2018. The presentation of underwriting costs and reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses related to underwriting and M&A advisory services was changed from net to gross within the income statement as Key acts as the principal in the transactions. Securities underwriting revenue is recorded within "investment banking and debt placement fees" and underwriting costs and reimbursed out-of-pocket expenses within "other expense" on the income statement. Additionally, because Key acts as an agent, certain credit and debit card reward costs and certain card network costs were changed from a gross presentation to net within "cards and payment income" on the income statement. Credit and debit card reward costs and card network costs were recorded as "other expense" on the income statement in prior periods. These changes in presentation did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2018. ASC 606 requires quantitative disclosure of the allocation of the transaction price to the remaining performance obligations when those amounts are expected to be recognized as revenue. However, the standard provides exemptions from this disclosure for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice for services provided. Most of our revenue subject to ASC 606 fits into one of these exemptions, or is immaterial. We elected to use the optional exemption to not disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price to remaining performance obligations. ASU 2017-12,Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging ActivitiesJanuary 1, 2018The ASU amends ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, to simplify the requirements for hedge accounting and facilitate financial reporting that more closely aligns with an entity’s risk management activities. Key amendments include: eliminating the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness, requiring changes in the value of the hedging instrument to be presented in the same income statement line as the earnings effect of the hedged item, and the ability to measure the hedged item based on the benchmark interest rate component of the total contractual coupon for fair value hedges. Additional disclosures are also required for reporting periods subsequent to the date of adoption.The guidance should be implemented on a modified retrospective basis to existing hedge relationships as of the adoption date.On January 1, 2018 we adopted this ASU using a modified retrospective basis. Accordingly, our financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, include an immaterial cumulative-effect adjustment to decrease opening retained earnings to reflect the application of the new guidance as of January 1, 2018. The primary impact to Key at adoption was the election to measure the change in fair value of hedged items in fair value hedges on the basis of the benchmark interest rate component of contractual coupon cash flows. This change has resulted in a reduction of hedge ineffectiveness for impacted fair value hedges.Instruments designated as hedges are recorded at fair value and included in “accrued income and other assets” or “accrued expense and other liabilities” on the balance sheet. Under the revised guidance, the change in the fair value of an instrument designated as a fair value hedge is recorded in earnings at the same time and in the same income statement line as the offsetting change in the fair value of the hedged item. For cash flow hedges, the change in the fair value of an instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is initially recorded in AOCI on the balance sheet. This amount is subsequently reclassified into income when the hedged transaction affects earnings and is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item.58Table of ContentsStandardDate of AdoptionDescriptionEffect on Financial Statements or Other Significant MattersASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial LiabilitiesJanuary 1, 2018The ASU amends ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments-Overall, and requires equity investments, except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or consolidated, to be measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income. If there is no readily determinable fair value, the guidance allows entities the ability to measure investments at cost less impairment, whereby impairment is based on a qualitative assessment. The guidance eliminates the requirement to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost and changes the presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities on the balance sheet or in the footnotes. If an entity has elected the fair value option to measure liabilities, the new accounting guidance requires the portion of the change in the fair value of a liability resulting from credit risk to be presented in OCI.With the exception of disclosure requirements that will be adopted prospectively, the ASU must be adopted on a modified retrospective basis.The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash PaymentsJanuary 1, 2018The ASU amends ASC Topic 230, Statement of Cash Flows, and clarifies how cash receipts and cash payments in certain transactions should be presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. These specific transactions include, but are not limited to, debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, contingent considerations made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, and distributions from equity method investees. This guidance also clarifies that in instances of cash flows with multiple aspects that cannot be separately identified, classification should be based on the activity that is likely to be the predominant source of or use of cash flow.The guidance should be implemented using a retrospective approach.The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.ASU 2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a BusinessJanuary 1, 2018The ASU amends Topic 805, Business Combinations, and clarifies the definition of a business and removes the requirement for a market participant to consider whether it could replace missing elements in an integrated set of assets and activities. The guidance states that if substantially all of the fair value of the assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business.The guidance should be implemented using a prospective approach. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.ASU 2017-05, Other Income- Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial AssetsJanuary 1, 2018The ASU amends ASC Topic 610-20, Other Income - Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets to clarify the scope of the Topic byclarifying the definition of the term "in substance nonfinancial asset" and also adding guidance for partial sales of nonfinancial assets. Under the new guidance, an entity will derecognize a nonfinancial asset when it does not have or ceases to have a controlling interest in the legal entity that holds the asset and when control of the asset has transferred in accordance with ASC 606. The ASU can be adopted on a retrospective or modified retrospective approach.The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.ASU 2017-07, Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit CostJanuary 1, 2018The ASU amends ASC Topic 715, Compensation - Retirement Benefits, and requires service costs to be included in the same line item as certain other compensation costs related to services rendered by employees. We record compensation costs under personnel expense on the income statement. Other elements of net benefit cost should be presented separately.The guidance should be implemented on a retrospective basis.The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.ASU 2017-09, Scope of Modification AccountingJanuary 1, 2018The ASU amends ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, and clarifies when changes to terms and conditions for share-based payment awards should be accounted for as modifications. Under the new guidance, entities should apply the modification guidance unless the fair value of the modified award is the same as the fair value of the original award immediately before modification, the vesting conditions of the modified award are the same as the vesting conditions of the original award immediately before modification, and the classification of the modified award (as equity or liability instrument) is the same as the classification of the original award immediately before modification.The guidance should be applied on a prospective basis.The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.59Table of Contents2. Earnings Per Common Share Basic earnings per share is the amount of earnings (adjusted for dividends declared on our preferred stock) available to each common share outstanding during the reporting periods. Diluted earnings per share is the amount of earnings available to each common share outstanding during the reporting periods adjusted to include the effects of potentially dilutive common shares. Potentially dilutive common shares include stock options and other stock-based awards. Potentially dilutive common shares are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in the periods where the effect would be antidilutive.

Asset Quality We assess the credit quality of the loan portfolio by monitoring net credit losses, levels of nonperforming assets, delinquencies, and credit quality ratings as defined by management.Credit Quality IndicatorsThe prevalent risk characteristic for both commercial and consumer loans is the risk of loss arising from an obligor’s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms. Evaluation of this risk is stratified and monitored by the loan risk rating grades assigned for the commercial loan portfolios and the refreshed FICO score assigned for the consumer loan portfolios. Most extensions of credit are subject to loan grading or scoring. Loan grades are assigned at the time of origination, verified by credit risk management, and periodically re-evaluated thereafter. This risk rating methodology blends our judgment with quantitative modeling. Commercial loans generally are assigned two internal risk ratings. The first rating reflects the probability that the borrower will default on an obligation; the second rating reflects expected recovery rates on the credit facility. Default probability is determined based on, among other factors, the financial strength of the borrower, an assessment of the borrower’s management, the borrower’s competitive position within its industry sector, and our view of industry risk in the context of the general economic outlook. Types of exposure, transaction structure, and collateral, including credit risk mitigants, affect the expected recovery assessment.Commercial Credit Exposure — Excluding PCICredit Risk Profile by Creditworthiness Category (a), (b)  Commercial and industrialRE — CommercialRE — ConstructionCommercial leaseTotalin millionsMarch 31,December 31,March 31,December 31,March 31,December 31,March 31,December 31,March 31,December 31,RATING2018201720182017201820172018201720182017Pass$42,191$39,833$13,159$13,328$1,815$1,894$4,503$4,730$61,668$59,785Criticized (Accruing)1,8601,790564482513890902,5652,400Criticized (Nonaccruing)18915333302256229191Total$44,240$41,776$13,756$13,840$1,868$1,934$4,598$4,826$64,462$62,376           (a)Credit quality indicators are updated on an ongoing basis and reflect credit quality information as of the dates indicated.(b)The term criticized refers to those loans that are internally classified by Key as special mention or worse, which are asset quality categories defined by regulatory authorities.

Acquired loans that were previously modified by First Niagara in a TDR are no longer classified as TDRs at the Acquisition Date. An acquired loan may only be classified as a TDR if a modification meeting the above TDR criteria is performed after the Acquisition Date. PCI loans cannot be classified as TDRs. All commercial and consumer loan TDRs, regardless of size, are individually evaluated for impairment to determine the probable loss content and are assigned a specific loan allowance. This designation has the effect of moving the loan from the general reserve methodology (i.e., collectively evaluated) to the specific reserve methodology (i.e., individually evaluated) and may impact the ALLL through a charge-off or increased loan loss provision. These components affect the ultimate allowance level.As TDRs are individually evaluated for impairment under the specific reserve methodology, subsequent defaults do not generally have a significant additional impact on the ALLL. Commitments outstanding to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loan terms have been modified in TDRs are $2 million and $2 million at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.Our loan modifications are handled on a case-by-case basis and are negotiated to achieve mutually agreeable terms that maximize loan collectability and meet the borrower’s financial needs. The consumer TDR other concession category primarily includes those borrowers’ debts that are discharged through bankruptcy and have not been formally re-affirmed. At March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, the recorded investment of consumer residential mortgage loans in the process of foreclosure was approximately $155 million and $142 million, respectively. At March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, we had $28 million and $31 million, respectively, of OREO which included the carrying value of foreclosed residential real estate of approximately $22 million and $26 million, respectively.The following table shows the post-modification outstanding recorded investment by concession type for our commercial and consumer accruing and nonaccruing TDRs that occurred during the periods indicated:65Table of Contents Three Months Ended March 31,in millions20182017Commercial loans:  Interest rate reduction——Forgiveness of principal——Extension of Maturity Date$1$3Payment or Covenant Modification/Deferment—25Bankruptcy Plan Modification——Total$1$28Consumer loans:  Interest rate reduction$8$2Forgiveness of principal——Other1213Total$20$15Total commercial and consumer TDRs$21$43The following table summarizes the change in the post-modification outstanding recorded investment of our accruing and nonaccruing TDRs during the periods indicated: Three Months Ended March 31,in millions20182017Balance at beginning of the period$317280Additions2147Payments(19)(14)Charge-offs(2)$(11)Balance at end of period (a)$317$302   A further breakdown of TDRs included in nonperforming loans by loan category for the periods indicated are as follows:March 31, 2018Number ofLoansPre-modificationOutstandingRecordedInvestmentPost-modificationOutstandingRecordedInvestmentdollars in millionsLOAN TYPE   Nonperforming:   Commercial and industrial30$109$77Commercial real estate:   Commercial mortgage7149Total commercial real estate loans7149Total commercial loans3712386Real estate — residential mortgage2641717Home equity loans1,1336861Consumer direct loans10422Credit cards27711Consumer indirect loans8681613Total consumer loans2,64610494Total nonperforming TDRs2,683227180Prior-year accruing:(a)   Commercial and industrial143013Commercial real estate   Commercial mortgage233Total commercial real estate loans233Total commercial loans163316Real estate — residential mortgage5163231Home equity loans1,3387862Consumer direct loans7443Credit cards49322Consumer indirect loans4503323Total consumer loans2,871149121Total prior-year accruing TDRs2,887182137Total TDRs5,570$409$317    (a)All TDRs that were restructured prior to January 1, 2018, and are fully accruing.66Table of ContentsA further breakdown of TDRs included in nonperforming loans by loan category as of December 31, 2017, follows:December 31, 2017Numberof LoansPre-modificationOutstandingRecordedInvestmentPost-modificationOutstandingRecordedInvestmentdollars in millionsLOAN TYPE   Nonperforming:   Commercial and industrial20$109$86Commercial real estate:   Commercial mortgage81612Total commercial real estate loans81612Total commercial loans2812598Real estate — residential mortgage3081818Home equity loans1,0256457Consumer direct loans11422Credit cards32221Consumer indirect loans8251613Total consumer loans2,59410291Total nonperforming TDRs2,622227189Prior-year accruing: (a)  Commercial and Industrial43013Total commercial loans43013Real estate — residential mortgage4843131Home equity loans1,2767559Consumer direct loans4832Credit cards43011Consumer indirect loans3203122Total consumer loans2,558141115Total prior-year accruing TDRs2,562171128Total TDRs5,184$398$317    (a)All TDRs that were restructured prior to January 1, 2017, and are fully accruing.Commercial loan TDRs are considered defaulted when principal and interest payments are 90 days past due.

During the three months ended March 31, 2018, there were no commercial loan TDRs and 41 consumer loan TDRs with a combined recorded investment of $1 million that experienced payment defaults after modifications resulting in TDR status during 2017. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, there were no commercial loan TDRs and 3 consumer loan TDRs with a combined recorded investment of less than $1 million that experienced payment defaults after modifications resulting in TDR status during 2016. ALLL and Liability for Credit Losses on Unfunded Lending-Related Commitments We determine the appropriate level of the ALLL on at least a quarterly basis. The methodology is described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses” beginning on page 102 of our 2017 Form 10-K.The ALLL on the acquired non-impaired loan portfolio is estimated using the same methodology as the originated portfolio, however, the estimated ALLL is compared to the remaining accretable yield to determine if an ALLL must be recorded. For PCI loans, Key estimates cash flows expected to be collected quarterly. Decreases in expected cash flows are recognized as impairment through a provision for loan and lease losses and an increase in the ALLL. There was $3 million of provision for loan and lease losses on PCI loans during the three months ended March 31, 2018.

We establish the amount of this reserve by considering both historical trends and current market conditions quarterly, or more often if deemed necessary. Changes in the liability for credit losses on unfunded lending-related commitments are summarized as follows: Three months ended March 31,in millions20182017Balance at beginning of period$57$55Provision (credit) for losses on lending-related commitments3(7)Balance at end of period$60$48   69Table of ContentsPCI Loans Purchased loans that have evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination and for which it is probable, at acquisition, that all contractually required payments will not be collected are deemed PCI. Several factors were considered when evaluating whether a loan was considered a PCI loan, including the delinquency status of the loan, updated borrower credit status, geographic information, and updated LTV. In accordance with ASC 310-30, excluded from the purchased impaired loans were leases, revolving credit arrangements, and loans held for sale. The excess of a PCI loan's contractually required payments over the amount of its undiscounted cash flows expected to be collected is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. The nonaccretable difference, which is not accreted into income, reflects estimated future credit losses and uncollectible contractual interest expected to be incurred over the life of the PCI loan. The excess of cash flows expected to be collected over the carrying amount of the PCI loans is referred to as the accretable yield. This amount is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the PCI loans or pools using the level yield method. Over the life of PCI loans, Key evaluates the remaining contractual required payments receivable and estimates cash flows expected to be collected. Contractually required payments receivable may increase or decrease for a variety of reasons, for example, when the contractual terms of the loan agreement are modified, when interest rates on variable rate loans change, or when principal and/or interest payments are received. Cash flows expected to be collected on PCI loans are estimated by incorporating several key assumptions similar to the initial estimate of fair value. These key assumptions include probability of default, loss given default, and the amount of actual prepayments after the Acquisition Date. Increases in expected cash flows of PCI loans subsequent to acquisition are recognized prospectively through adjustment of the yield on the loans or pools over its remaining life, while decreases in expected cash flows are recognized as impairment through a provision for loan and lease losses and an increase in the ALLL. The difference between the fair value of a non-impaired acquired loan and contractual amounts due at the acquisition date is accreted into income over the estimated life of the loan. Contractually required payments represent the total undiscounted amount of all uncollected principal and interest payments. We have PCI loans from two separate acquisitions, one in 2012 and one in 2016. The following tables present the roll-forward of the accretable yield and the beginning and ending outstanding unpaid principal balance and carrying amount of all PCI loans for the three months ended March 31, 2018, and the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.

Fair Value MeasurementsFair Value DeterminationWe have established and documented our process for determining the fair values of our assets and liabilities, where applicable. Fair value is based on quoted market prices, when available, for identical or similar assets or liabilities. In the absence of quoted market prices, we determine the fair value of our assets and liabilities using valuation models or third-party pricing services. Both of these approaches rely on market-based parameters, when available, such as interest rate yield curves, option volatilities, and credit spreads, or on unobservable inputs. Unobservable inputs may be based on our judgment, assumptions, and estimates related to credit quality, liquidity, interest rates, and other relevant inputs.We make liquidity valuation adjustments to the fair value of certain assets to reflect the uncertainty in the pricing and trading of the instruments when we are unable to observe recent market transactions for identical or similar instruments. Liquidity valuation adjustments are based on the following factors: •the amount of time since the last relevant valuation;•whether there is an actual trade or relevant external quote available at the measurement date; and•volatility associated with the primary pricing components.We ensure that our fair value measurements are accurate and appropriate by relying upon various controls, including: •an independent review and approval of valuation models and assumptions;•recurring detailed reviews of profit and loss; and•a validation of valuation model components against benchmark data and similar products, where possible.We recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period. Quarterly, we review any changes to our valuation methodologies to ensure they are appropriate and justified, and refine our valuation methodologies if more market-based data becomes available. The Fair Value Committee, which is governed by ALCO, oversees the valuation process. Various working groups that report to the Fair Value Committee analyze and approve the underlying assumptions and valuation adjustments. Changes in valuation methodologies for Level 1 and Level 2 instruments are presented to the Accounting Policy group for approval. Changes in valuation methodologies for Level 3 instruments are presented to the Fair Value Committee for approval. The working groups are discussed in more detail in the qualitative disclosures within this note. Formal documentation of the fair valuation methodologies is prepared by the lines of business and support areas as appropriate. The documentation details the asset or liability class and related general ledger accounts, valuation techniques, fair value hierarchy level, market participants, accounting methods, valuation methodology, group responsible for valuations, and valuation inputs.Additional information regarding our accounting policies for determining fair value is provided in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Fair Value Measurements.”Qualitative Disclosures of Valuation TechniquesLoans. Most loans recorded as trading account assets are valued based on market spreads for similar assets since they are actively traded. Therefore, these loans are classified as Level 2 because the fair value recorded is based on observable market data for similar assets.Securities (trading and available for sale). We own several types of securities, requiring a range of valuation methods: •Securities are classified as Level 1 when quoted market prices are available in an active market for the identical securities. Level 1 instruments include exchange-traded equity securities.•Securities are classified as Level 2 if quoted prices for identical securities are not available, and fair value is determined using pricing models (either by a third-party pricing service or internally) or quoted prices of similar securities. These instruments include municipal bonds, bonds backed by the U.S. government, corporate bonds, agency residential and CMBS, securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, money markets, and certain agency and corporate CMOs. Inputs to the pricing models include standard inputs (i.e. yields, benchmark 71Table of Contentssecurities, bids, and offers), actual trade data (i.e. spreads, credit ratings, and interest rates) for comparable assets, spread tables, matrices, high-grade scales, and option-adjusted spreads.•Securities are classified as Level 3 when there is limited activity in the market for a particular instrument. To determine fair value in such cases, depending on the complexity of the valuations required, we use internal models based on certain assumptions or a third-party valuation service. At March 31, 2018, our Level 3 instruments consist of debt securities. Our Corporate Strategy group is responsible for reviewing the valuation model and determining the fair value of these investments on a quarterly basis. The securities are valued using a cash flow analysis of the associated private company issuers. The valuations of the securities are negatively affected by projected net losses of the associated private companies and positively affected by projected net gains.The valuations provided by the third-party pricing service are based on observable market inputs, which include benchmark yields, reported trades, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data obtained from market research publications. Inputs used by the third-party pricing service in valuing CMOs and other mortgage-backed securities also include new issue data, monthly payment information, whole loan collateral performance, and “To Be Announced” prices. In valuations of securities issued by state and political subdivisions, inputs used by the third-party pricing service also include material event notices.On a monthly basis, we validate the pricing methodologies utilized by our third-party pricing service to ensure that the fair value determination is consistent with the applicable accounting guidance and that our assets are properly classified in the fair value hierarchy. To perform this validation, we: •review documentation received from our third-party pricing service regarding the inputs used in their valuations and determine a level assessment for each category of securities;•substantiate actual inputs used for a sample of securities by comparing the actual inputs used by our third-party pricing service to comparable inputs for similar securities; and•substantiate the fair values determined for a sample of securities by comparing the fair values provided by our third-party pricing service to prices from other independent sources for the same and similar securities. We analyze variances and conduct additional research with our third-party pricing service and take appropriate steps based on our findings.Principal investments. Principal investments consist of investments in equity and debt instruments made by our principal investing entities. They include direct investments (investments made in a particular company) and indirect investments (investments made through funds that include other investors). Our principal investing entities are accounted for as investment companies in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, whereby each investment is adjusted to fair value with any net realized or unrealized gain/loss recorded in the current period’s earnings. This process is a coordinated and documented effort by the Principal Investing Entities Deal Team (individuals from one of the independent investment managers who oversee these instruments), accounting staff, and the Investment Committee (individual employees and one of the independent investment managers). This process involves an in-depth review of the condition of each investment depending on the type of investment.Our direct investments include investments in debt and equity instruments of private companies. In most cases, quoted market prices are not available for our direct investments, and we must perform valuations using other methods. These direct investment valuations are an in-depth analysis of the condition of each investment and are based on the unique facts and circumstances related to each individual investment. There is a certain amount of subjectivity surrounding the valuation of these investments due to the combination of quantitative and qualitative factors that are used in the valuation models. Therefore, these direct investments are classified as Level 3 assets.Our indirect investments include primary and secondary investments in private equity funds engaged mainly in venture- and growth-oriented investing. These investments do not have readily determinable fair values. Indirect investments are valued using a methodology that is consistent with accounting guidance allowing us to estimate fair value based upon net asset value per share (or its equivalent, such as member units or an ownership interest in partners’ capital to which a proportionate share of net assets is attributed). Under the requirements of the VolckerRule, we will be required to dispose of some or all of our indirect investments. On February 14, 2017, Key’sapplication for an extension to comply with this rule for illiquid funds was approved. Key will retain certain indirectinvestments until the earlier of the date on which the investment is conformed or is expected to mature, but no later than July 21, 2022; as of March 31, 2018, we have not committed to a plan to sell these investments, therefore, these investments continue to be valued using the net asset value per share methodology.72Table of ContentsThe following table presents the fair value of our direct and indirect principal investments and related unfunded commitments at March 31, 2018, as well as financial support provided for the three months ended March 31, 2018, and March 31, 2017.

Operations of the business enterprises are handled by management of the portfolio company. The purpose of funding these enterprises is to provide financial support for business development and acquisition strategies. We infuse equity capital based on an initial contractual cash contribution and later from additional requests on behalf of the companies’ management.(b)Our indirect investments consist of buyout funds, venture capital funds, and fund of funds. These investments are generally not redeemable. Instead, distributions are received through the liquidation of the underlying investments of the fund. An investment in any one of these funds typically can be sold only with the approval of the fund’s general partners. We estimate that the underlying investments of the funds will be liquidated over a period of one to six years. The purpose of funding our capital commitments to these investments is to allow the funds to make additional follow-on investments and pay fund expenses until the fund dissolves. We, and all other investors in the fund, are obligated to fund the full amount of our respective capital commitments to the fund based on our and their respective ownership percentages, as noted in the applicable Limited Partnership Agreement.Other Equity Investments. Our other equity investments are direct investments in equity instruments of private companies. Quoted market prices are not available for these investments and we must perform valuations using other methods in a similar manner to our direct principal investments. There is a certain amount of subjectivity surrounding the valuation of these investments due to the combination of quantitative and qualitative factors that are used in the valuation models. Accordingly, these investments are classified as Level 3 assets.Loans Held for Sale. As of August 1, 2016, we account for our residential mortgage loans held for sale at fair value on a recurring basis. The election of the fair value option aligns the accounting for the residential mortgages held for sale with the related forward mortgage loan sale commitments. Residential mortgage loans are valued based on quoted market prices, where available, prices for other traded mortgage loans with similar characteristics, and purchase commitments and bid information received from market participants. The prices are adjusted as necessary to include the embedded servicing value in the loans and to take into consideration the specific characteristics of certain loans that are priced based on the pricing of similar loans. These adjustments represent unobservable inputs to the valuation, but are not considered significant given the relative insensitivity of the fair value of the loans when changes are made to these inputs. Accordingly, the majority of residential mortgage loans held for sale are classified as Level 2. Our residential mortgage activity also includes temporarily unsalable residential mortgage loans that are included in “Loans, net of unearned income” and loans with salability issues included in “Loans held for sale” on the balance sheet. These loans have an origination defect that makes them temporarily unable to be sold into the performing loan sales market. Because transaction details regarding sales of this type of loan are often unavailable, unobservable bid information from brokers and investors is heavily relied upon. Accordingly, based on the significance of unobservable inputs, these loans are classified as Level 3. Derivatives. Exchange-traded derivatives are valued using quoted prices and, therefore, are classified as Level 1 instruments. However, only a few types of derivatives are exchange-traded. The majority of our derivative positions are valued using internally developed models, based on market convention, that use observable market inputs, such as interest rate curves, LIBOR and Overnight Index Swap discount rates and curves, index pricing curves, foreign currency curves, and volatility surfaces (a three-dimensional graph of implied volatility against strike price and maturity), as well as current prices for mortgage securities and investor supplied prices. These derivative contracts, which are classified as Level 2 instruments, include interest rate swaps, certain options, cross-currency swaps, credit default swaps, and forward mortgage loan sale commitments. We have several customized derivative instruments and risk participations that are classified as Level 3 instruments. These derivative positions are priced monthly by our MRM group using a model acquired from a third party that employs a credit valuation adjustment methodology. The model utilizes inputs consisting of available market data, including bond spreads and asset values, as well as unobservable, internally derived assumptions, such as loss probabilities and internal risk ratings of customers. Swap details with the customer and our related participation percentage, if applicable, are obtained from our derivatives accounting system. Applicable customer rating information is obtained from the relevant loan system and represents an unobservable input to this valuation process. In summary, the fair value represents an estimate of the amount that the risk participation counterparty 73Table of Contentswould need to pay/receive as of the measurement date based on the probability of customer default on the swap transaction and the fair value of the underlying customer swap. Therefore, a higher loss probability and a lower credit rating would negatively affect the fair value of the risk participations and a lower loss probability and higher credit rating would positively affect the fair value of the risk participations. We use interest rate lock commitments for our residential mortgage business. These instruments are accounted for as derivatives and valued using models containing unobservable significant inputs. For valuation purposes, the loan amount associated with each interest rate lock commitment is adjusted by its modeled pull through (an unobservable input) defined as the percentage of loans that will close prior to the expiration of the rate lock commitment, as adjusted for approved changes to the terms. Based on the significance of unobservable inputs, these instruments are classified as Level 3.Market convention implies a credit rating of “AA” equivalent in the pricing of derivative contracts, which assumes that all counterparties have the same creditworthiness. To reflect the actual exposure on our derivative contracts related to both counterparty and our own creditworthiness, we record a fair value adjustment in the form of a credit valuation adjustment. The credit component is determined by individual counterparty based on the probability of default and considers master netting and collateral agreements. The credit valuation adjustment is classified as Level 3. Our MRM group is responsible for the valuation policies and procedures related to this credit valuation adjustment. A weekly reconciliation process is performed to ensure that all applicable derivative positions are covered in the calculation, which includes transmitting customer exposures and reserve reports to trading management, derivative traders and marketers, derivatives middle office, and accounting personnel. On a quarterly basis, MRM prepares the credit valuation adjustment calculation, which includes a detailed reserve comparison with the previous quarter, an analysis for change in reserve, and a reserve forecast to ensure that the credit valuation adjustment recorded at period end is sufficient. 74Table of ContentsAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring BasisCertain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis in accordance with GAAP.

Level 1 and Level 2 instruments are not included in the following table, therefore, the gains or losses shown do not include the impact of our risk management activities.76Table of Contentsin millionsBeginning of Period BalanceGains (Losses) Included in Other Comprehensive IncomeGains (Losses) Included in EarningsPurchasesSalesSettlementsTransfers OtherTransfers into Level 3 (a)Transfers out of Level 3 (a)End of Period Balance (f)Unrealized Gains (Losses) Included in EarningsThree months ended March 31, 2018               Securities available for sale               Other securities$20$——  ————— — $20— Other investments               Principal investments               Direct13—$(1)(b)  ————— — 12$(1)(b)  Equity investments               Direct3—— ————$4 — 7— Loans held for sale1—— ————— — 1— Loans held for investment2—— ————— — 2— Derivative instruments (c)               Interest rate9—(1)(d) ————1(e)  $(5)(e)  4— Credit1—(5)(d) ——$4—— — —— Other (f)3—— ————— — 3— in millionsBeginning of Period BalanceGains (Losses) Included in Other Comprehensive IncomeGains (Losses) Included in EarningsPurchasesSalesSettlementsTransfers OtherTransfers into Level 3 (a)Transfers out of Level 3 (a)End of Period BalanceUnrealized Gains (Losses) Included in EarningsThree months ended March 31, 2017               Securities available for sale               Other securities$17——  ————— — $17— Other investments               Principal investments               Direct27$—$(2)(b)  —$(4)——— — 21$(6)(b) Derivative instruments (c)               Interest rate7—— ————$1(e)  $(3)(e)  5— Credit1—(3)(d)  ——$3—— — 1— Other (g)2—— ———$2— — 4— (a)Our policy is to recognize transfers into and transfers out of Level 3 as of the end of the reporting period.(b)Realized and unrealized gains and losses on principal investments are reported in “other income” on the income statement.

The adjustments to fair value generally result from the application of accounting guidance that requires assets and liabilities to be recorded at the lower of cost or fair value, or assessed for impairment. There were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017. The following table presents our assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017: March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017in millionsLevel 1Level 2Level 3Total Level 1Level 2Level 3 TotalASSETS MEASURED ON A NONRECURRING BASIS          Impaired loans—$3—$3 ——$9 $9Accrued income and other assets——$77 —$5133(a) 138Total assets on a nonrecurring basis at fair value—$3$7$10 —$5$142 $147           (a)At December 31, 2017, we recorded $31 million of impairment related to $119 million of LIHTC and Historic Tax Credit investments impacted by the enactment of the TCJ Act. Refer to the “LIHTC and Historic Tax Credit Investments” section below for a description of the valuation technique and inputs applied for this fair value measurement.Impaired loans. Loans are evaluated for impairment on a quarterly basis. Loans included in the previous quarter’s review are re-evaluated, and if their values have changed materially, the underlying information (loan balance and in most cases, collateral value) is compared. Material differences are evaluated for reasonableness, and the relationship managers and their senior managers consider these differences and determine if any adjustment is necessary. The inputs are developed and substantiated on a quarterly basis based on current borrower developments, market conditions, and collateral values. The following two internal methods are used to value impaired loans: •Cash flow analysis considers internally developed inputs, such as discount rates, default rates, costs of foreclosure, and changes in collateral values.•The fair value of the collateral, which may take the form of real estate or personal property, is based on internal estimates, field observations, and assessments provided by third-party appraisers. We perform or reaffirm 77Table of Contentsappraisals of collateral-dependent impaired loans at least annually. Appraisals may occur more frequently if the most recent appraisal does not accurately reflect the current market, if the debtor is seriously delinquent or chronically past due, or there has been a material deterioration in the performance of the project or condition of the property. Adjustments to outdated appraisals that result in an appraisal value less than the carrying amount of a collateral-dependent impaired loan are reflected in the ALLL.We adjust the carrying amount of our impaired loans when there is evidence of probable loss and the expected fairvalue of the loan is less than its contractual amount. The amount of the impairment may be determined based onthe estimated present value of future cash flows, the fair value of the underlying collateral, or the loan’s observablemarket price. Impaired loans with a specifically allocated allowance based on a cash flow analysis or the value ofthe underlying collateral are classified as Level 3 assets. Impaired loans with a specifically allocated allowancebased on an observable market price that reflects recent sale transactions for similar loans and collateral areclassified as Level 2 assets.Impairment valuations are back-tested each quarter, based on a look-back of actual incurred losses on closed dealspreviously evaluated for impairment. The overall percent variance of actual net loan charge-offs on closed dealscompared to the specific allocations on such deals is considered in determining each quarter’s specific allocations.The evaluations for impairment are prepared by the responsible relationship managers in our Asset RecoveryGroup and are reviewed and approved by the Asset Recovery Group Executive. The Asset Recovery Group is partof the Risk Management Group and reports to our Chief Credit Officer. These evaluations are performed inconjunction with the quarterly ALLL process.Commercial loans held for sale. Through a quarterly analysis of our loan portfolios held for sale, which include both performing and nonperforming commercial loans, we determine any adjustments necessary to record the portfolios at the lower of cost or fair value in accordance with GAAP. Our analysis concluded that there were no commercial loans held for sale adjusted to fair value at March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017.Direct financing leases and operating lease assets held for sale. Our KEF Accounting and Capital Markets groups are responsible for the valuation policies and procedures related to these assets. The Managing Director of the KEF Capital Markets group reports to the President of the KEF line of business. A weekly report that lists all equipment finance deals booked in the warehouse portfolio is distributed to both groups. On a quarterly basis, the KEF Accounting group prepares a detailed held-for-sale roll-forward schedule that is reconciled to the general ledger and the above-mentioned weekly report. KEF management uses the held-for-sale roll-forward schedule to determine whether an impairment adjustment is necessary in accordance with lower of cost or fair value guidelines.Valuations of direct financing leases and operating lease assets held for sale are performed using an internal model that relies on market data, such as swap rates and bond ratings, as well as on our own assumptions about the exit market for the leases and details about the individual leases in the portfolio. The inputs based on our assumptions include changes in the value of leased items and internal credit ratings. These leases have been classified as Level 3 assets. KEF has master sale and assignment agreements with numerous institutional investors. Historically, multiple quotes are obtained, with the most reasonable formal quotes retained. These nonbinding quotes generally lead to a sale to one of the parties who provided the quote. Leases for which we receive a current nonbinding bid, and for which the sale is considered probable, may be classified as Level 2. The validity of these quotes is supported by historical and continued dealings with these institutions that have fulfilled the nonbinding quote in the past. In a distressed market where market data were not available, an estimate of the fair value of the leased asset may be used to value the lease, resulting in a Level 3 classification. In an inactive market, the market value of the assets held for sale is determined as the present value of the future cash flows discounted at the current buy rate. KEF Accounting calculates an estimated fair value buy rate based on the credit premium inherent in the relevant bond index and the appropriate swap rate on the measurement date. The amount of the adjustment is calculated as book value minus the present value of future cash flows discounted at the calculated buy rate.Other assets. OREO and other repossessed properties are valued based on inputs such as appraisals and third-party price opinions, less estimated selling costs. Generally, we classify these assets as Level 3, but OREO and other repossessed properties for which we receive binding purchase agreements are classified as Level 2. Returned lease inventory is valued based on market data for similar assets and is classified as Level 2. Assets that are acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosures are recorded initially as held for sale at fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of foreclosure. After foreclosure, valuations are updated periodically, and current market conditions may require the assets to be marked down further to a new cost basis.78Table of Contents •Commercial Real Estate Valuation Process: When a loan is reclassified from loan status to OREO because we took possession of the collateral, the Asset Recovery Group Loan Officer, in consultation with our OREO group, obtains a broker price opinion or a third-party appraisal, which is used to establish the fair value of the underlying collateral. The determined fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated selling costs becomes the carrying value of the OREO asset. In addition to valuations from independent third-party sources, our OREO group also writes down the carrying balance of OREO assets once a bona fide offer is contractually accepted, where the accepted price is lower than the current balance of the particular OREO asset. The fair value of OREO property is re-evaluated every 90 days, and the OREO asset is adjusted as necessary.•Residential Real Estate Valuation Process: The Asset Management team within our Risk Operations group is responsible for valuation policies and procedures of these loans. The current vendor partner provides monthly reporting of all broker price opinion evaluations, appraisals, and the monthly market plans. Market plans are reviewed monthly, and valuations are reviewed and tested monthly to ensure proper pricing has been established and guidelines are being met. Risk Operations Compliance validates and provides periodic testing of the valuation process. The Asset Management team reviews changes in fair value measurements. Third-party broker price opinions are reviewed every 180 days, and the fair value is written down based on changes to the valuation. External factors are documented and monitored as appropriate.LIHTC and Historic Tax Credit Investments. LIHTC and Historic Tax Credit (HTC) operating partnerships aresubject to quarterly impairment testing. This evaluation involves measuring the present value of future tax benefitsand comparing that value against the current carrying value of the investment. Expected future tax benefitschedules are provided by the partnerships’ general partners on a quarterly basis. These future benefits arediscounted to their present value using discounted cash flow modeling that incorporates an appropriate riskpremium. LIHTC and HTC investments are impaired when it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of theinvestment will not be realized. A primarily driver of impairment in the fourth quarter of 2017 was the enactment ofthe TCJ Act, which reduced future depreciation tax benefits expected to be realized by certain LIHTC and HTCinvestments.Other Equity Investments. We have other investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values and do not qualify for the practical expedient to measure the investment using a net asset value per share. We have elected to measure these securities at cost less impairment plus or minus adjustments due to observable orderly transactions. At each reporting period, we assess if these investments continue to qualify for this measurement alternative. At March 31, 2018, the carrying amount of equity investments recorded under this method was $95 million. No impairment was recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2018. Impairment is recorded when there is evidence that the expected fair value of the investment has declined to below the recorded cost.

The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity does not take into consideration the value ascribed to core deposit intangibles.(b)Information pertaining to our methodology for measuring the fair values of these assets and liabilities is included in the sections entitled “Qualitative Disclosures of Valuation Techniques” and “Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis” in this Note. Investments accounted for under the cost method (or cost less impairment adjusted for observable price changes for certain equity investments) are classified as Level 3 assets. These investments are not actively traded in an open market as sales for these types of investments are rare. The carrying amount of the investments carried at cost are adjusted for declines in value if they are considered to be other-than-temporary (or due to observable orderly transactions of the same issuer for equity investments eligible for the cost less impairment measurement alternative). These adjustments are included in “other income” on the income statement. (c)Fair values of held-to-maturity securities are determined by using models that are based on security-specific details, as well as relevant industry and economic factors. The most significant of these inputs are quoted market prices, interest rate spreads on relevant benchmark securities, and certain prepayment assumptions. We review the valuations derived from the models to ensure that they are reasonable and consistent with the values placed on similar securities traded in the secondary markets.(d)The fair value of loans is based on the present value of the expected cash flows. The projected cash flows are based on the contractual terms of the loans, adjusted for prepayments and use of a discount rate based on the relative risk of the cash flows, taking into account the loan type, maturity of the loan, liquidity risk, servicing costs, and a required return on debt and capital. In addition, an incremental liquidity discount is applied to certain loans, using historical sales of loans during periods of similar economic conditions as a benchmark. The fair value of loans includes lease financing receivables at their aggregate carrying amount, which is equivalent to their fair value.(e)Fair values of time deposits and long-term debt are based on discounted cash flows utilizing relevant market inputs.(f)Netting adjustments represent the amounts recorded to convert our derivative assets and liabilities from a gross basis to a net basis in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. The net basis takes into account the impact of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements that allow us to settle all derivative contracts with a single counterparty on a net basis and to offset the net derivative position with the related cash collateral. Total derivative assets and liabilities include these netting adjustments.We determine fair value based on assumptions pertaining to the factors that a market participant would consider invaluing the asset. A substantial portion of our fair value adjustments are related to liquidity. During 2017 and the first quarter of 2018, the fair values of our loan portfolios generally remained stable, primarily due to increasing liquidity in the loan markets. If we were to use different assumptions, the fair values shown in the preceding table could change. Also, because the applicable accounting guidance for financial instruments excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure requirements, the fair value amounts shown in the table above do not, by themselves, represent the underlying value of our company as a whole.Education lending business. The discontinued education lending business consists of loans in portfolio recorded at carrying value with appropriate valuation reserves, and loans in portfolio recorded at fair value. All of these loans were excluded from the table above as follows: •Loans at carrying value, net of allowance, of $1.2 billion ($1.1 billion at fair value) at March 31, 2018, and $1.3 billion ($1.1 billion at fair value) at December 31, 2017;•Portfolio loans at fair value of $2 million at March 31, 2018, and $2 million at December 31, 2017.These loans and securities are classified as Level 3 because we rely on unobservable inputs when determining fair value since observable market data is not available.Short-term financial instruments. For financial instruments with a remaining average life to maturity of less than six months, carrying amounts were used as an approximation of fair values.81Table of Contents6. Securities The amortized cost, unrealized gains and losses, and approximate fair value of our securities available for sale and held-to-maturity securities are presented in the following tables. Gross unrealized gains and losses represent the difference between the amortized cost and the fair value of securities on the balance sheet as of the dates indicated.

These securities had a weighted-average maturity of 4.54 years at March 31, 2018. At March 31, 2018, we also had $37 million of gross unrealized losses related to 262 agency residential mortgage-backed securities positions and $96 million of gross unrealized losses related to 14 agency commercial mortgage backed securities positions with weighted-average maturities of 3.92 years and 4.12 years, respectively. Because these securities have a fixed interest rate, their fair value is sensitive to movements in market interest rates. These unrealized losses are considered temporary since we expect to collect all contractually due amounts from these securities. Accordingly, these investments were reduced to their fair value through OCI, not through earnings.We regularly assess our securities portfolio for OTTI. The assessments are based on the nature of the securities, the underlying collateral, the financial condition of the issuer, the extent and duration of the loss, our intent related to the individual securities, and the likelihood that we will have to sell securities prior to expected recovery. As shown in the following table, we did not have any impairment losses recognized in earnings for the three months ended March 31, 2018, and March 31, 2017.Three months ended March 31, 2018 in millions Balance at December 31, 2017$4Impairment recognized in earnings—Balance at March 31, 2018$4  At March 31, 2018, securities available for sale and held-to-maturity securities totaling $9.0 billion were pledged to secure securities sold under repurchase agreements, to secure public and trust deposits, to facilitate access to secured funding, and for other purposes required or permitted by law.The following table shows our securities by remaining maturity.

Derivatives and Hedging Activities We are a party to various derivative instruments, mainly through our subsidiary, KeyBank. The primary derivatives that we use are interest rate swaps, caps, floors, and futures; foreign exchange contracts; commodity derivatives; and credit derivatives. Generally, these instruments help us manage exposure to interest rate risk, mitigate the credit risk inherent in our loan portfolio, hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and meet client financing and hedging needs. As further discussed in this note: •interest rate risk is the risk that the EVE or net interest income will be adversely affected by fluctuations in interest rates;•credit risk is the risk of loss arising from an obligor’s inability or failure to meet contractual payment or performance terms; and•foreign exchange risk is the risk that an exchange rate will adversely affect the fair value of a financial instrument.At March 31, 2018, after taking into account the effects of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements, we had $28 million of derivative assets and $4 million of derivative liabilities that relate to contracts entered into for hedging purposes. As of the same date, after taking into account the effects of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements and a reserve for potential future losses, we had derivative assets of $603 million and derivative liabilities of $371 million that were not designated as hedging instruments. These positions are primarily comprisedof derivative contracts entered into for client accommodation purposes.Additional information regarding our accounting policies for derivatives is provided in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Derivatives and Hedging” beginning on page 105 of our 2017 Form 10-KDerivatives Designated in Hedge RelationshipsNet interest income and the EVE change in response to changes in the mix of assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet instruments and the associated interest rates tied to each instrument. In addition, differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities cause net interest income and the EVE to fluctuate. We utilize derivatives that have been designated as part of a hedge relationship in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance to manage net interest income and EVE to within our stated risk tolerances. The primary derivative instruments used to manage interest rate risk are interest rate swaps.We designate certain “receive fixed/pay variable” interest rate swaps as fair value hedges. These contracts convert certain fixed-rate long-term debt into variable-rate obligations, thereby modifying our exposure to changes in interest rates. As a result, we receive fixed-rate interest payments in exchange for making variable-rate payments over the lives of the contracts without exchanging the notional amounts.Similarly, we designate certain “receive fixed/pay variable” interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. These contracts effectively convert certain floating-rate loans into fixed-rate loans to reduce the potential adverse effect of interest rate decreases on future interest income. Again, we receive fixed-rate interest payments in exchange for making variable-rate payments over the lives of the contracts without exchanging the notional amounts.We also designate certain “pay fixed/receive variable” interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. These swaps convert certain floating-rate debt into fixed-rate debt. We also use these swaps to manage the interest rate risk 84Table of Contentsassociated with anticipated sales of certain commercial real estate loans. The swaps protect against the possible short-term decline in the value of the loans that could result from changes in interest rates between the time they are originated and the time they are sold.We use foreign currency forward transactions to hedge the foreign currency exposure of our net investment in various foreign equipment finance entities. These entities are denominated in a non-U.S. currency. These forward transactions are designated as net investment hedges to mitigate the exposure of measuring the net investment at the spot foreign exchange rate.Derivatives Not Designated in Hedge RelationshipsWe may enter into interest rate swap contracts to manage economic risks, but do not designate the instruments in hedge relationships. Excluding contracts addressing customer exposures, the amount of derivatives hedging risks on an economic basis at March 31, 2018, was not significant. Like other financial services institutions, we originate loans and extend credit, both of which expose us to credit risk. We actively manage our overall loan portfolio and the associated credit risk in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives and concentration risk tolerances to mitigate portfolio credit risk. Purchasing credit protection through default swaps enables us to transfer to a third party a portion of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit, including situations where there is a forecast sale of loans. We purchase credit default swaps to reduce the credit risk associated with the debt securities held in our trading portfolio.We also enter into derivative contracts for other purposes, including: •interest rate swap, cap, and floor contracts generally entered into to accommodate the needs of commercial loan clients;•energy and base metal swap and option contracts entered into to accommodate the needs of clients;•foreign exchange forward and option contracts entered into primarily to accommodate the needs of clients; and•futures contracts and positions with third parties that are intended to offset or mitigate the interest rate or market risk related to client positions discussed above.These contracts are not designated as part of hedge relationships.Fair Values, Volume of Activity, and Gain/Loss Information Related to Derivative InstrumentsThe following table summarizes the fair values of our derivative instruments on a gross and net basis as of March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017. The change in the notional amounts of these derivatives by type from December 31, 2017, to March 31, 2018, indicates the volume of our derivative transaction activity during the first three months of 2018. The notional amounts are not affected by bilateral collateral and master netting agreements. The derivative asset and liability balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements, but after the variation margin payments with central clearing organizations have been applied as settlement, as applicable. Total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted to take into account the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow us to settle all derivative contracts with a single counterparty on a net basis and to offset the net derivative position with the related cash collateral. Where master netting agreements are not in effect or are not enforceable under bankruptcy laws, we do not adjust those derivative assets and liabilities with counterparties. Securities collateral related to legally enforceable master netting agreements is not offset on the balance sheet. Our derivative instruments are included in “accrued income and other assets” or “accrued expenses and other liabilities” on the balance sheet, as follows:85Table of Contents March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017  Fair Value  Fair Valuein millionsNotionalAmountDerivativeAssetsDerivativeLiabilities NotionalAmountDerivativeAssetsDerivativeLiabilitiesDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:       Interest rate$27,906$39$2 $26,176$81$46Foreign exchange28114 30214Total28,187406 26,4788250Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:       Interest rate64,935326386 61,390641474Foreign exchange8,458121111 8,317129120Commodity1,902345334 1,687255246Credit351—3 31514Other (a)1,944618 2,006413Total77,590798852 73,7151,030857Netting adjustments (b)—(207)(483) —(443)(616)Net derivatives in the balance sheet105,777631375 100,193669291Other collateral (c)—(2)(69) —(5)(84)Net derivative amounts$105,777$629$306 $100,193$664$207        (a)Other derivatives include interest rate lock commitments and forward sale commitments related to our residential mortgage banking activities, forward purchase and sales contracts consisting of contractual commitments associated with “to be announced” securities and when issued securities, and when-issued security transactions in connection with an “at-the-market” equity offering program.(b)Netting adjustments represent the amounts recorded to convert our derivative assets and liabilities from a gross basis to a net basis in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance.(c)Other collateral represents the amount that cannot be used to offset our derivative assets and liabilities from a gross basis to a net basis in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance.

During the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, we did not exclude any portion of these hedging instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.

Cash flow hedges. During the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, we did not exclude any portion of these hedging instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.Considering the interest rates, yield curves, and notional amounts as of March 31, 2018, we would expect to reclassify an estimated $55 million of after-tax net gains on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges from AOCI to income during the next 12 months. In addition, we expect to reclassify approximately $3 million of net losses related to terminated cash flow hedges from AOCI to income during the next 12 months. As of March 31, 2018, the maximum length of time over which we hedge forecast transactions is 10 years.The following table summarizes the effect of fair value and cash flow hedge accounting on the income statement for the three month periods ended March 31, 2018, and March 31, 2017.86Table of Contents Location and amount of net gains (losses) recognized in income on fair value and cash flow hedging relationships (a)in millionsInterest expense – long-term debtInterest income – loansOther incomeThree months ended March 31, 2018   Total amounts presented in the consolidated statement of income$(92)$940$21    Net gains (losses) on fair value hedging relationships   Interest contracts   Recognized on hedged items71——Recognized on derivatives designated as hedging instruments(69)——Net income (expense) recognized on fair value hedges2——Net gain (loss) on cash flow hedging relationships   Interest contracts   Realized gains (losses) (pre-tax) reclassified from AOCI into net income(1)(2)—Net income (expense) recognized on cash flow hedges$(1)$(2)—    Three months ended March 31, 2017   Total amounts presented in the consolidated statement of income$(68)$877$32    Net gains (losses) on fair value hedging relationships   Interest contracts   Recognized on hedged items——35Recognized on derivatives designated as hedging instruments18—(35)Net income (expense) recognized on fair value hedges18——Net gain (loss) on cash flow hedging relationships   Interest contracts   Realized gains (losses) (pre-tax) reclassified from AOCI into net income(1)15—Gains (losses) (before tax) recognized in income for hedge ineffectiveness———Net income (expense) recognized on cash flow hedges$(1)$15—    (a)Prior period gain or loss amounts were not restated to conform to the new hedge accounting guidance adopted in 2017.Net investment hedges. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure to changes in the carrying value of our investments as a result of changes in the related foreign exchange rates. At March 31, 2018, AOCI reflected unrecognized, after-tax gains totaling $37 million related to cumulative changes in the fair value of our net investment hedges, which offset the unrecognized, after-tax foreign currency losses on net investment balances. We did not exclude any portion of our hedging instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness during the three-month period ended March 31, 2018.The following table summarizes the pre-tax net gains (losses) on our cash flow and net investment hedges for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018, and March 31, 2017, and where they are recorded on the income statement.

This risk is measured as the expected positive replacement value of the contracts. We use several means to mitigate and manage exposure to credit risk on derivative contracts. We enter into bilateral collateral and master netting agreements that provide for the net settlement of all contracts with a single counterparty in the event of default. Additionally, we monitor counterparty credit risk exposure on each contract to determine appropriate limits on our total credit exposure across all product types. We review our collateral positions on a daily basis and exchange collateral with our counterparties in accordance with standard ISDA documentation, central clearing rules, and other related agreements. We hold collateral in the form of cash and highly rated securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, government-sponsored enterprises, or GNMA. Cash collateral of $105 million was included in derivative assets on the balance sheet at March 31, 2018, compared to $23 million of cash collateral netted against derivative assets at December 31, 2017. The cash collateral netted against derivative liabilities totaled $171 million at March 31, 2018, and $150 million at December 31, 2017. The following table summarizes the fair value of our derivative assets by type at the dates indicated. These assets represent our gross exposure to potential loss after taking into account the effects of bilateral collateral and master netting agreements and other means used to mitigate risk.in millionsMarch 31, 2018December 31, 2017Interest rate$241$401Foreign exchange7477Commodity205163Credit—1Other64Derivative assets before collateral526646Less: Related collateral(105)(23)Total derivative assets$631$669   We enter into derivative transactions with two primary groups: broker-dealers and banks, and clients. Given that these groups have different economic characteristics, we have different methods for managing counterparty credit exposure and credit risk.We enter into transactions with broker-dealers and banks for various risk management purposes. These types of transactions are generally high dollar volume. We generally enter into bilateral collateral and master netting agreements with these counterparties. We clear certain types of derivative transactions with these counterparties, whereby central clearing organizations become the counterparties to our derivative contracts. In addition, we enter into derivative contracts through swap execution facilities. Swap clearing and swap execution facilities reduce our exposure to counterparty credit risk. At March 31, 2018, we had gross exposure of $103 million to broker-dealers and banks. We had net exposure of $192 million after the application of master netting agreements and cash collateral, where such qualifying agreements exist. We had net exposure of $181 million after considering $11 million of additional collateral held in the form of securities.88Table of ContentsWe enter into transactions with clients to accommodate their business needs. These types of transactions are generally low dollar volume. We generally enter into master netting agreements with these counterparties. In addition, we mitigate our overall portfolio exposure and market risk by buying and selling U.S. Treasuries and Eurodollar futures and entering into offsetting positions and other derivative contracts, sometimes with entities other than broker-dealers and banks. Due to the smaller size and magnitude of the individual contracts with clients, we generally do not exchange collateral in connection with these derivative transactions. To address the risk of default associated with the uncollateralized contracts, we have established a credit valuation adjustment (included in “accrued income and other assets”) in the amount of $4 million at March 31, 2018, which we estimate to be the potential future losses on amounts due from client counterparties in the event of default. At March 31, 2018, we had gross exposure of $515 million to client counterparties and other entities that are not broker-dealers or banks for derivatives that have associated master netting agreements. We had net exposure of $439 million on our derivatives with these counterparties after the application of master netting agreements, collateral, and the related reserve. Credit DerivativesWe are a buyer and, under limited circumstances, may be a seller of credit protection through the credit derivative market. We purchase credit derivatives to manage the credit risk associated with swap obligations as well as exposures to debt securities.The following table summarizes the fair value of our credit derivatives purchased and sold by type as of March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017. The fair value of credit derivatives presented below does not take into account the effects of bilateral collateral or master netting agreements.

In risk participation agreements, the lead participant has a swap agreement with a customer. The lead participant (purchaser of protection) then enters into a risk participation agreement with a counterparty (seller of protection), under which the counterparty receives a fee to accept a portion of the lead participant’s credit risk. If the customer defaults on the swap contract, the counterparty to the risk participation agreement must reimburse the lead participant for the counterparty’s percentage of the positive fair value of the customer swap as of the default date. If the customer swap has a negative fair value, the counterparty has no reimbursement requirements. If the customer defaults on the swap contract and the seller fulfills its payment obligations under the risk participation agreement, the seller is entitled to a pro rata share of the lead participant’s claims against the customer under the terms of the swap agreement. In a credit default swap option we are given the right, but not the obligation, to purchase credit protection on a stated entity for a specified period of time.The following table provides information on the types of credit derivatives sold by us and held on the balance sheet at March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017. The notional amount represents the maximum amount that the seller could be required to pay. The payment/performance risk assessment is based on the default probabilities for the underlying reference entities’ debt obligations using a Moody’s credit ratings matrix known as Moody’s “Idealized” Cumulative Default Rates. The payment/performance risk shown in the table represents a weighted-average of the default probabilities for all reference entities in the respective portfolios. These default probabilities are directly correlated to the probability that we will have to make a payment under the credit derivative contracts.

The amount of collateral to be posted is based on the amount of the net liability and thresholds generally related to our long-term senior unsecured credit ratings with Moody’s and S&P. Collateral requirements also are based on minimum transfer amounts, which are specific to each Credit Support Annex (a component of the ISDA Master Agreement) that we have signed with the counterparties. In a limited number of instances, counterparties have the right to terminate their ISDA Master Agreements with us if our ratings fall below a certain level, usually investment-grade level (i.e., “Baa3” for Moody’s and “BBB-” for S&P). At March 31, 2018, KeyBank’s rating was “A3” with Moody’s and “A-” with S&P, and KeyCorp’s rating was “Baa1” with Moody’s and “BBB+” with S&P. As of March 31, 2018, the aggregate fair value of all derivative contracts with credit risk contingent features (i.e., those containing collateral posting or termination provisions based on our ratings) held by KeyBank that were in a net liability position totaled $235 million, which was comprised of $189 million in derivative assets and $424 million in derivative liabilities. We had $228 million in cash and securities collateral posted to cover those positions as of March 31, 2018. There were no derivative contracts with credit risk contingent features held by KeyCorp at March 31, 2018.The following table summarizes the additional cash and securities collateral that KeyBank would have been required to deliver under the ISDA Master Agreements had the credit risk contingent features been triggered for the derivative contracts in a net liability position as of March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017. The additional collateral amounts were calculated based on scenarios under which KeyBank’s ratings are downgraded one, two, or three ratings as of March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, and take into account all collateral already posted. A similar calculation was performed for KeyCorp, and no additional collateral would have been required as of December 31, 2017. For more information about the credit ratings for KeyBank and KeyCorp, see the discussion under the heading “Factors affecting liquidity” in the section entitled “Liquidity risk management” in Item 2 of this report.

If KeyCorp’s ratings had been downgraded below investment grade as of March 31, 2018, or December 31, 2017, no payments, respectively, would have been required to either terminate the contracts or post additional collateral for those contracts in a net liability position, taking into account all collateral already posted.8. Mortgage Servicing Assets We originate and periodically sell commercial and residential mortgage loans but continue to service those loans for the buyers. We also may purchase the right to service commercial mortgage loans for other lenders. We record a servicing asset if we purchase or retain the right to service loans in exchange for servicing fees that exceed the going market servicing rate and are considered more than adequate compensation for servicing. Additional information pertaining to the accounting for mortgage and other servicing assets is included in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Servicing Assets” beginning on page 106 of our 2017 Form 10-K. 90Table of ContentsCommercialChanges in the carrying amount of commercial mortgage servicing assets are summarized as follows: Three months ended March 31,in millions20182017Balance at beginning of period$412$356Servicing retained from loan sales2728Purchases217Amortization(25)(22)Balance at end of period$435$369Fair value at end of period$537$480   The fair value of commercial mortgage servicing assets is determined by calculating the present value of future cash flows associated with servicing the loans. This calculation uses a number of assumptions that are based on current market conditions. The range and weighted average of the significant unobservable inputs used to determine the fair value of our commercial mortgage servicing assets at March 31, 2018, and March 31, 2017, along with the valuation techniques, are shown in the following table: March 31, 2018Valuation TechniqueSignificantUnobservable InputRange(Weighted Average)dollars in millionsCommercial mortgage servicing assetsDiscounted cash flowExpected defaults1.00 - 3.00% (1.18%)  Residual cash flows discount rate7.00 - 15.00% (8.99%)  Escrow earn rate2.17 - 3.45% (2.84%)  Servicing cost$150 - $38,500 ($1,433)  Loan assumption rate0.00 - 2.84% (1.18%)  Percentage late0.00 - 2.00% (.23%)March 31, 2017Valuation TechniqueSignificantUnobservable InputRange(Weighted Average)dollars in millionsCommercial mortgage servicing assetsDiscounted cash flowExpected defaults1.00 - 3.00% (1.30%)  Residual cash flows discount rate7.00 - 15.00% (8.60%)  Escrow earn rate1.20 - 3.20% (2.60%)  Servicing cost$150 - $38,500 ($1,342)  Loan assumption rate0.00 - 3.00% (1.25%)  Percentage late0.00 - 2.00% (.31%)If these economic assumptions change or prove incorrect, the fair value of commercial mortgage servicing assets may also change. Expected credit losses, escrow earning rates, and discount rates are critical to the valuation of commercial mortgage servicing assets. Estimates of these assumptions are based on how a market participant would view the respective rates, and reflect historical data associated with the commercial mortgage loans, industry trends, and other considerations. Actual rates may differ from those estimated due to changes in a variety of economic factors. A decrease in the value assigned to the escrow earning rates would cause a decrease in the fair value of our commercial mortgage servicing assets. An increase in the assumed default rates of commercial mortgage loans or an increase in the assigned discount rates would cause a decrease in the fair value of our commercial mortgage servicing assets. Prepayment activity on commercial serviced loans does not significantly affect the valuation of our commercial mortgage servicing assets. Unlike residential mortgages, commercial mortgages experience significantly lower prepayments due to certain contractual restrictions affecting the borrower’s ability to prepay the mortgage. The amortization of commercial servicing assets is determined in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated net servicing income. The amortization of commercial servicing assets for each period, as shown in the table at the beginning of this note, is recorded as a reduction to contractual fee income. The contractual fee income from servicing commercial mortgage loans totaled $42 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, and $38 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017. This fee income was offset by $25 million of amortization for the three-month period ended March 31, 2018, and $22 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017. Both the contractual fee income and the amortization are recorded, net, in “mortgage servicing fees” on the income statement.91Table of ContentsResidentialChanges in the carrying amount of residential mortgage servicing assets are summarized as follows: Three months ended March 31,in millions20182017Balance at beginning of period$3128Servicing retained from loan sales2$2Purchases——Amortization(1)(1)Balance at end of period$32$29Fair value at end of period$42$35   The fair value of mortgage servicing assets is determined by calculating the present value of future cash flows associated with servicing the loans.

Prepayment speed, discount rates, and servicing cost are critical to the valuation of servicing assets. Estimates of these assumptions are based on how a market participant would view the respective rates, and reflect historical data associated with the loans, industry trends, and other considerations. Actual rates may differ from those estimated due to changes in a variety of economic factors. An increase in the prepayment speed, assigned discount rates, and servicing cost assumptions would also cause a negative impact on the fair value of our residential mortgage servicing assets.The amortization of residential servicing assets is determined in proportion to, and over the period of, the estimated net residential servicing income. The amortization of servicing assets for March 31, 2018, as shown in the table above, is recorded as a reduction to contractual fee income. The contractual fee income from servicing residential mortgage loans totaled $3 million for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017. This fee income was offset by $1 million of amortization for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018  and March 31, 2017. Both the contractual fee income and the amortization are recorded, net, in “mortgage servicing fees” on the income statement.9. Variable Interest Entities A VIE is a partnership, limited liability company, trust, or other legal entity that meets any one of the following criteria: •The entity does not have sufficient equity to conduct its activities without additional subordinated financial support from another party.•The entity’s investors lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the entity’s economic performance.•The entity’s equity at risk holders do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive residual returns.•The voting rights of some investors are not proportional to their economic interests in the entity, and substantially all of the entity’s activities involve, or are conducted on behalf of, investors with disproportionately few voting rights.92Table of ContentsOur significant VIEs are summarized below. We define a “significant interest” in a VIE as a subordinated interest that exposes us to a significant portion, but not the majority, of the VIE’s expected losses or residual returns, even though we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the entity’s economic performance. LIHTC investments. Through KCDC, we have made investments directly and indirectly in LIHTC operating partnerships formed by third parties. As a limited partner in these operating partnerships, we are allocated tax credits and deductions associated with the underlying properties. We have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these investments because the general partners have the power to direct the activities that most significantly influence the economic performance of their respective partnerships and have the obligation to absorb expected losses and the right to receive residual returns. As we are not the primary beneficiary of these investments, we do not consolidate them.Our maximum exposure to loss in connection with these partnerships consists of our unamortized investment balance plus any unfunded equity commitments and tax credits claimed but subject to recapture. We had $1.3 billion of investments in LIHTC operating partnerships at both March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017. These investments are recorded in “accrued income and other assets” on our balance sheet. We do not have any loss reserves recorded related to these investments because we believe the likelihood of any loss to be remote. For all legally binding, unfunded equity commitments, we increase our recognized investment and recognize a liability. As of March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, we had liabilities of $473 million and $476 million, respectively, related to investments in qualified affordable housing projects, which are recorded in “accrued expenses and other liabilities” on our balance sheet. We continue to invest in these LIHTC operating partnerships.The assets and liabilities presented in the table below convey the size of KCDC’s direct and indirect investments at March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017. As these investments represent unconsolidated VIEs, the assets and liabilities of the investments themselves are not recorded on our balance sheet.

During the first three months of 2018, we recognized $41 million of amortization and $40 million of tax credits associated with these investments within “income taxes” on our income statement. During the first three months of 2017, we recognized $40 million of amortization and $39 million of tax credits associated with these investments within “income taxes” on our income statement.Principal investments. Through our principal investing entities, we have made investments in private equity funds engaged in venture- and growth-oriented investing. As a limited partner to these funds, we record these investments at fair value and receive distributions from the funds in accordance with the funds’ partnership agreements. We are not the primary beneficiary of these investments as we do not hold the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the funds’ economic performance. Such power rests with the funds’ general partners. In addition, we have neither the obligation to absorb the funds’ expected losses nor the right to receive their residual returns. Our voting rights are also disproportionate to our economic interests, and substantially all of the funds’ activities are conducted on behalf of investors with disproportionately few voting rights. Because we are not the primary beneficiary of these investments, we do not consolidate them. Our maximum exposure to loss associated with indirect principal investments consists of the investments’ fair value plus any unfunded equity commitments. The fair value of our indirect principal investments totaled $114 million and $124 million at March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively. These investments are recorded in “other investments” on our balance sheet. Additional information on indirect principal investments is provided in Note 5 (“Fair Value Measurements”). The table below reflects the size of the private equity funds in which we were invested as well as our maximum exposure to loss in connection with these investments at March 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.93Table of Contents Unconsolidated VIEsin millionsTotalAssetsTotalLiabilitiesMaximumExposure to LossMarch 31, 2018   Indirect investments$21,778$242$143December 31, 2017   Indirect investments$26,817$292$153Through our principal investing entities, we have formed and funded operating entities that provide management and other related services to our investment company funds, which directly invest in portfolio companies. In return for providing services to our direct investment funds, these entities’ receive a minority equity interest in the funds. This minority equity ownership is recorded at fair value on the entities’ financial statements. Additional information on our direct principal investments is provided in Note 5 (“Fair Value Measurements”). While other equity investors manage the daily operations of these entities, we retain the power, through voting rights, to direct the activities of the entities that most significantly affect their economic performance. In addition, we have the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive residual returns that could potentially be significant to these entities. As a result, we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of these funds and have consolidated them since formation. The entities had no assets at March 31, 2018 that can only be used to settle the entities’ obligations, and $4 million of such assets at December 31, 2017. These assets are recorded in “cash and due from banks” and “accrued income and other assets” on our balance sheet. The entities had no liabilities at March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, and other equity investors have no recourse to our general credit.Other unconsolidated VIEs. We are involved with other various entities in the normal course of business which we have determined to be VIEs. We have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance. Our assets associated with these unconsolidated VIEs totaled $231 million at March 31, 2018, and $230 million at December 31, 2017. These assets are recorded in “accrued income and other assets,” “other investments,” “securities available for sale”, and “loans, net of unearned income” on our balance sheet. We had liabilities totaling $4 million associated with these unconsolidated VIEs at both March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017. These liabilities are recorded in “accrued expenses and other liabilities” on our balance sheet. We have excluded certain transactions with unconsolidated VIEs from the balances above where we determine our continuing involvement is not significant. In addition, where we only have a lending arrangement in the normal course of business with unconsolidated VIEs we present the balances related to the lending arrangements in Note 4 (“Asset Quality”).10. Income Taxes Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018On February 9, 2018, the Bipartisan Budget Act (BBA) of 2018 was signed into law. The BBA includes a retroactive one year tax extenders package back to January 1, 2017 that reinstated several energy investment tax credits that had expired on December 31, 2016. Due to these retroactive provisions, Key recognized additional net investment tax credits in the first quarter of $13.6 million, or a 2.8% reduction to our income tax provision, for energy tax credit transactions entered into during 2017. TCJ ActOn December 22, 2017, the TCJ Act was signed into law. This comprehensive tax legislation provides for significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, that impact corporate taxation requirements, such as the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The TCJ Act retains the low-income housing and research and development credits and repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax. Other relevant corporate changes include earlier recognition of certain revenue; accelerating expensing of investments in tangible property, including leasing assets; and limiting several deductions such as FDIC premiums, certain executive compensation, and meals and entertainment expenses. Key was required to re-value certain tax-related assets under the provisions of the TCJ Act at December 31, 2017. Under current U.S. GAAP, deferred tax assets and liabilities are to be adjusted for the effect of a change in tax laws or rates with the effect included in income from continuing operations in the reporting period that includes the enactment date. The tax-related assets consist primarily of deferred tax assets and liabilities and investments in low-income housing transactions. Due to the close proximity of our year end to the date the TCJ Act was signed into 94Table of Contentslaw, we estimated the impact of the income tax effects as of December 31, 2017, based upon currently available information which resulted in a reduction to our net income of $161 million. The significant components of this reduction included a $14 million reduction in our investments in certain low-income housing that is reflected in other expenses and a $147 million, or 7.6%, increase in our income tax provision for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, due to the reduction to our net deferred tax asset and related actions. This reduction is primarily the result of the lower federal corporate income tax rate, is based on information available at this time, and is subject to change due to a variety of factors, including among others: (i) completion of Key’s 2017 federal and state income tax returns, and (ii) management’s further assessment of the TCJ Act and related regulatory guidance. Adjustments may be made in future periods to these estimates as we continue to obtain, prepare and analyze information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the enactment date that, if known, would have affected the income tax effects reported as provisional amounts. Key expects to finalize this impact in the quarter ending September 30, 2018. The accounting for the changes in tax law resulted in stranded tax effects within accumulated other comprehensive income for items that were originally recognized in other comprehensive income rather than in net income. The FASB issued an accounting standard update allowing companies to reclassify stranded tax effects resulting from the TCJ Act from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. We early adopted this guidance during the quarter ended December 31, 2017, and utilizing the portfolio method reclassified $141 million from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings to eliminate the stranded tax effects.Income Tax ProvisionIn accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, the principal method established for computing the provision for income taxes in interim periods requires us to make our best estimate of the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full year. This estimated effective tax rate is then applied to interim consolidated pre-tax operating income to determine the interim provision for income taxes.The effective tax rate, which is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes, was 12.9% for the first quarter of 2018 and 22.4% for the first quarter of 2017. The effective tax rates are below our combined federal and state statutory tax rate of 23.7% for the first quarter of 2018 and 37.2% for the first quarter of 2017, primarily due to income from investments in tax-advantaged assets such as corporate-owned life insurance and credits associated with renewable energy and low-income housing investments. The effective tax rates for the three months ended March 31, 2018, and March 31, 2017, were affected by net discrete income tax benefits of 5.5% and 4.7%, respectively.Deferred Tax AssetAt March 31, 2018, from continuing operations we had a net deferred tax asset of $363 million, compared to a net deferred tax asset of $320 million at December 31, 2017, included in “accrued income and other assets” on the balance sheet. To determine the amount of deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized, and therefore recorded, we conduct a quarterly assessment of all available evidence. This evidence includes, but is not limited to, taxable income in prior periods, projected future taxable income, and projected future reversals of deferred tax items. These assessments involve a degree of subjectivity and may undergo change. Based on these criteria, we had a valuation allowance of $15 million at March 31, 2018, and $15 million at December 31, 2017. The valuation allowance is associated with certain state net operating loss carryforwards, state credit carryforwards, and federal and state capital loss carryforwards. Unrecognized Tax BenefitsAs permitted under the applicable accounting guidance for income taxes, it is our policy to recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in “income tax expense.” At March 31, 2018, Key’s unrecognized tax benefits were $39 million. Pre-1988 Bank Reserves Acquired in a Business Combination Retained earnings of KeyBank included approximately $92 million of allocated bad debt deductions for which no income taxes have been recorded. Under current federal law, these reserves are subject to recapture into taxable 95Table of Contentsincome if KeyBank, or any successor, fails to maintain its bank status under the Internal Revenue Code or makes non-dividend distributions or distributions greater than its accumulated earnings and profits. No deferred tax liability has been established as these events are not expected to occur in the foreseeable future.11. Acquisitions, Divestiture, and Discontinued Operations AcquisitionsCain Brothers & Company, LLC. On October 2, 2017, KBCM acquired all outstanding interests in Cain Brothers, a healthcare-focused investment banking and public finance firm. This acquisition expands KBCM’s investment banking group in the healthcare vertical by adding distinctive capabilities and broadening KBCM’s existing healthcare investment banking network. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. As a result of the acquisition, Key recognized identifiable intangible assets with a fair value of $30 million and goodwill of $53 million, which are deductible for tax purposes. The valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities of Cain Brothers was final at March 31, 2018.HelloWallet Holdings, Inc. On July 1, 2017, KeyBank acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of HelloWallet Holdings, Inc., the sole owner of HelloWallet, LLC, a digital financial wellness company. Key’s retail banking franchise is leveraging HelloWallet’s technology to provide data-driven insights to clients, allowing clients to better understand and improve their personal finances. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. As a result of the acquisition, Key recognized identifiable intangible assets with a fair value of $12 million, comprised primarily of propriety software, and goodwill of $17 million, which are not deductible for tax purposes. The valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities of HelloWallet was final at March 31, 2018.Key Merchant Services, LLC. On June 30, 2017, KeyBank (consolidated) acquired an additional 51% interest in Key Merchant Services, LLC (“KMS”), increasing our ownership interest from 49% to 100%. This acquisition enables us to grow our merchant services business and enhance our merchant product offerings. This transaction is accounted for as a business combination achieved in stages. Prior to the acquisition, KMS was operated as a merchant services joint venture and accounted for as an equity method investment in our consolidated financial statements.As of June 30, 2017, the provisional estimated fair value of our equity interest in KMS immediately before the acquisition was $74 million. The fair value of our previously held equity interest was measured using discounted cash flow modeling that incorporates an appropriate risk premium and forecast earnings information. On June 30, 2017, we recognized a provisional non-cash holding gain of $64 million for the difference between the fair value and the book value of our previously held equity interest. In the third quarter of 2017, we recognized a measurement-period adjustment of $5 million to reduce the provisional estimated fair value of our equity interest immediately before the acquisition to $69 million, which reduced the total non-cash holding gain to $59 million. The initial gain and subsequent adjustment were included in “other income” on the income statement for the three months ended September 30, 2017. Upon acquisition, we recorded estimated identifiable intangible assets of $95 million and goodwill of less than $1 million. In the third quarter of 2017, we recognized a measurement-period adjustment of $10 million to reduce the fair value of acquired intangible assets to $85 million. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized a measurement period adjustment increasing deferred tax assets and decreasing goodwill by $2 million. In aggregate, the measurement-period adjustments recognized as of December 31, 2017, increased goodwill recorded in connection with the KMS acquisition to $4 million. The fair value estimates related to this acquisition represent our best estimate of fair value and are expected to be finalized over a period of up to one year from the acquisition date.DivestitureKey Insurance & Benefits Services, Inc. On March 29, 2018, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to sell Key Insurance & Benefits Services, Inc. to USI Insurance Services. We acquired Key Insurance & Benefits Services, Inc. as a part of the 2016 merger with First Niagara. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018.96Table of ContentsDiscontinued operationsDiscontinued operations primarily includes our government-guaranteed education lending business. At March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, approximately $1.3 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, of education loans are included in discontinued assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Net interest income after provision for credit losses for this business is not material and is included in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes on the consolidated statements of income.12. Securities Financing Activities We enter into repurchase agreements to finance overnight customer sweep deposits. We also enter into repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements to settle other securities obligations. We account for these securities financing agreements as collateralized financing transactions. Repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements are recorded on the balance sheet at the amounts for which the securities will be subsequently sold or repurchased. Securities borrowed transactions are recorded on the balance sheet at the amounts of cash collateral advanced. While our securities financing agreements incorporate a right of set off, the assets and liabilities are reported on a gross basis. Reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions are included in “short-term investments” on the balance sheet; repurchase agreements are included in “federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements.”The following table summarizes our securities financing agreements at March 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017: March 31, 2018in millionsGross AmountPresented inBalance SheetNettingAdjustments (a)Collateral (b)NetAmountsOffsetting of financial assets:    Reverse repurchase agreements$3$(3)$——Total$3$(3)$——     Offsetting of financial liabilities:    Repurchase agreements (c)$614$(7)$(607)—Total$614$(7)$(607)—      December 31, 2017in millionsGross AmountPresented inBalance SheetNetting Adjustments (a)Collateral (b)NetAmountsOffsetting of financial assets:    Reverse repurchase agreements$3$(3)——Total$3$(3)——     Offsetting of financial liabilities:    Repurchase agreements (c)$374$(4)$(370)—Total$374$(4)$(370)—     (a)Netting adjustments take into account the impact of master netting agreements that allow us to settle with a single counterparty on a net basis.(b)These adjustments take into account the impact of bilateral collateral agreements that allow us to offset the net positions with the related collateral. The application of collateral cannot reduce the net position below zero. Therefore, excess collateral, if any, is not reflected above.(c)Repurchase agreements are collateralized by mortgaged-backed agency securities and are contracted on an overnight or continuous basis.As of March 31, 2018, the carrying amount of assets pledged as collateral against repurchase agreements totaled $520 million. Assets pledged as collateral are reported in “securities available for sale” and “held-to-maturity securities” on our balance sheet. At March 31, 2018, the liabilities associated with collateral pledged were solely comprised of customer sweep financing activity and had a carrying value of $379 million. The collateral pledged under customer sweep repurchase agreements is posted to a third-party custodian and cannot be sold or repledged by the secured party. The risk related to a decline in the market value of collateral pledged is minimal given the collateral's high credit quality and the overnight duration of the repurchase agreements. Like other financing transactions, securities financing agreements contain an element of credit risk. To mitigate and manage credit risk exposure, we generally enter into master netting agreements and other collateral arrangements that give us the right, in the event of default, to liquidate collateral held and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty. Additionally, we establish and monitor limits on our counterparty credit risk exposure by product type. For the reverse repurchase agreements, we monitor the value of the underlying securities we received from counterparties and either request additional collateral or return a portion of the collateral based on the 97Table of Contentsvalue of those securities. We generally hold collateral in the form of highly rated securities issued by the U.S. Treasury and fixed income securities. In addition, we may need to provide collateral to counterparties under our repurchase agreements. With the exception of collateral pledged against customer sweep repurchase agreements, the collateral we pledge and receive can generally be sold or repledged by the secured parties.13. Employee Benefits Pension PlansEffective December 31, 2009, we amended our cash balance pension plan and other defined benefit plans to freeze all benefit accruals and close the plans to new employees. We will continue to credit participants’ existing account balances for interest until they receive their plan benefits. We changed certain pension plan assumptions after freezing the plans. As part of the acquisition of First Niagara, Key also obtained two frozen defined benefit plans sponsored by First Niagara, both of which provide benefits based upon length of service and compensation levels. Effective September 30, 2016, the two First Niagara plans merged into another defined benefit plan maintained by Key to form the KeyCorp Consolidated Cash Balance Plan. Effective December 31, 2016, our original cash balance pension plan merged into the KeyCorp Consolidated Cash Balance Plan.The components of net pension cost (benefit) for all funded and unfunded plans are as follows: Three months ended March 31,in millions20182017Interest cost on PBO$10$12Expected return on plan assets(13)(17)Amortization of losses44Net pension cost$1$(1)   Other Postretirement Benefit PlansWe sponsor a retiree healthcare plan in which all employees age 55 with 5 years of service (or employees age 50 with 15 years of service who are terminated under conditions that entitle them to a severance benefit) are eligible to participate. Participant contributions are adjusted annually. Key may provide a subsidy toward the cost of coverage for certain employees hired before 2001 with a minimum of 15 years of service at the time of termination. We use a separate VEBA trust to fund the retiree healthcare plan. Effective November 29, 2016, an unfunded retiree welfare plan previously sponsored by First Niagara merged into our current retiree healthcare plan.   14. Trust Preferred Securities Issued by Unconsolidated Subsidiaries We own the outstanding common stock of business trusts formed by us that issued corporation-obligated, mandatorily redeemable, trust preferred securities. The trusts used the proceeds from the issuance of their trust preferred securities and common stock to buy debentures issued by KeyCorp. These debentures are the trusts’ only assets; the interest payments from the debentures finance the distributions paid on the mandatorily redeemable trust preferred securities. The outstanding common stock of these business trusts is recorded in “other investments” on our balance sheet.We unconditionally guarantee the following payments or distributions on behalf of the trusts: •required distributions on the trust preferred securities;•the redemption price when a capital security is redeemed; and•the amounts due if a trust is liquidated or terminated.The Regulatory Capital Rules, discussed in “Supervision and regulation” in Item 2 of this report, implement a phase-out of trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital, consistent with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. For “standardized approach” banking organizations such as Key, the phase-out period began on January 1, 2015, and starting in 2016 requires us to treat our mandatorily redeemable, trust preferred securities as Tier 2 capital.98Table of ContentsThe trust preferred securities, common stock, and related debentures are summarized as follows:dollars in millionsTrust Preferred Securities, Net of Discount (a)Common StockPrincipal Amount of Debentures, Net of Discount (b)Interest Rate of Trust Preferred Securities and Debentures (c)Maturity of Trust Preferred Securities and DebenturesMarch 31, 2018     KeyCorp Capital I$155$6$1612.435%2028KeyCorp Capital II10241066.8752029KeyCorp Capital III13241367.7502029HNC Statutory Trust III181193.3202035Willow Grove Statutory Trust I181193.4352036HNC Statutory Trust IV161173.0532037Westbank Capital Trust II7—74.3922034Westbank Capital Trust III7—74.3922034Total$455$17$4725.128%—      December 31, 2017$463$17$4804.977%—      (a)The trust preferred securities must be redeemed when the related debentures mature, or earlier if provided in the governing indenture. Each issue of trust preferred securities carries an interest rate identical to that of the related debenture. Certain trust preferred securities include basis adjustments related to fair value hedges totaling $47 million at March 31, 2018, and $55 million at December 31, 2017. See Note 7 (“Derivatives and Hedging Activities”) for an explanation of fair value hedges.(b)We have the right to redeem these debentures. If the debentures purchased by KeyCorp Capital I, HNC Statutory Trust III, Willow Grove Statutory Trust I, HNC Statutory Trust IV, Westbank Capital Trust II, or Westbank Capital Trust III are redeemed before they mature, the redemption price will be the principal amount, plus any accrued but unpaid interest. If the debentures purchased by KeyCorp Capital II or KeyCorp Capital III are redeemed before they mature, the redemption price will be the greater of: (i) the principal amount, plus any accrued but unpaid interest, or (ii) the sum of the present values of principal and interest payments discounted at the Treasury Rate (as defined in the applicable indenture), plus 20 basis points for KeyCorp Capital II or 25 basis points for KeyCorp Capital III, or 50 basis points in the case of redemption upon either a tax or a capital treatment event for either KeyCorp Capital II or KeyCorp Capital III, plus any accrued but unpaid interest. The principal amount of certain debentures includes basis adjustments related to fair value hedges totaling $47 million at March 31, 2018, and $55 million at December 31, 2017. See Note 7 for an explanation of fair value hedges. The principal amount of debentures, net of discounts, is included in “long-term debt” on the balance sheet.(c)The interest rates for the trust preferred securities issued by KeyCorp Capital II and KeyCorp Capital III are fixed. The trust preferred securities issued by KeyCorp Capital I have a floating interest rate, equal to three-month LIBOR plus 74 basis points, that reprices quarterly. The trust preferred securities issued by HNC Statutory Trust III have a floating interest rate, equal to three-month LIBOR plus 140 basis points, that reprices quarterly. The trust preferred securities issued by Willow Grove Statutory Trust I have a floating interest rate, equal to three-month LIBOR plus 131 basis points, that reprices quarterly. The trust preferred securities issued by HNC Statutory Trust IV have a floating interest rate, equal to three-month LIBOR plus 128 basis points, that reprices quarterly. The trust preferred securities issued by Westbank Capital Trust II and Westbank Capital Trust III each have a floating interest rate, equal to three-month LIBOR plus 219 basis points, that reprices quarterly. The total interest rates are weighted-average rates.15. Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees Legal ProceedingsLitigation. From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we and our subsidiaries are subject to various litigation, investigations, and administrative proceedings. Private, civil litigations may range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to putative class action lawsuits with potentially thousands of class members. Investigations may involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both government agencies and self-regulatory bodies. These matters may involve claims for substantial monetary relief. At times, these matters may present novel claims or legal theories. Due to the complex nature of these various other matters, it may be years before some matters are resolved. While it is impossible to ascertain the ultimate resolution or range of financial liability, based on information presently known to us, we do not believe there is any matter to which we are a party, or involving any of our properties that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. We continually monitor and reassess the potential materiality of these litigation matters. We note, however, that in light of the inherent uncertainty in legal proceedings there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution will not exceed established reserves. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter, or a combination of matters, may be material to our results of operations for a particular period, depending upon the size of the loss or our income for that particular period.GuaranteesWe are a guarantor in various agreements with third parties. The following table shows the types of guarantees that we had outstanding at March 31, 2018. Information pertaining to the basis for determining the liabilities recorded in connection with these guarantees is included in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Guarantees” beginning on page 108 of our 2017 Form 10-K.99Table of ContentsMarch 31, 2018Maximum Potential Undiscounted Future PaymentsLiability Recordedin millionsFinancial guarantees:  Standby letters of credit$2,996$70Recourse agreement with FNMA3,3656Residential mortgage reserve1,3626Return guarantee agreement with LIHTC investors33Written put options (a)2,35773Total$10,083$158    (a)The maximum potential undiscounted future payments represent notional amounts of derivatives qualifying as guarantees.We determine the payment/performance risk associated with each type of guarantee described below based on the probability that we could be required to make the maximum potential undiscounted future payments shown in the preceding table. We use a scale of low (0% to 30% probability of payment), moderate (greater than 30% to 70% probability of payment), or high (greater than 70% probability of payment) to assess the payment/performance risk, and have determined that the payment/performance risk associated with each type of guarantee outstanding at March 31, 2018, is low.Standby letters of credit. KeyBank issues standby letters of credit to address clients’ financing needs. These instruments obligate us to pay a specified third party when a client fails to repay an outstanding loan or debt instrument or fails to perform some contractual nonfinancial obligation. Any amounts drawn under standby letters of credit are treated as loans to the client; they bear interest (generally at variable rates) and pose the same credit risk to us as a loan. At March 31, 2018, our standby letters of credit had a remaining weighted-average life of two years, with remaining actual lives ranging from less than one year to as many as 17 years.Recourse agreement with FNMA. We participate as a lender in the FNMA Delegated Underwriting and Servicing program. FNMA delegates responsibility for originating, underwriting, and servicing mortgages, and we assume a limited portion of the risk of loss during the remaining term on each commercial mortgage loan that we sell to FNMA. We maintain a reserve for such potential losses in an amount that we believe approximates the fair value of our liability. At March 31, 2018, the outstanding commercial mortgage loans in this program had a weighted-average remaining term of 7.9 years, and the unpaid principal balance outstanding of loans sold by us as a participant was $11.9 billion. The maximum potential amount of undiscounted future payments that we could be required to make under this program, as shown in the preceding table, is equal to approximately 28% of the principal balance of loans outstanding at March 31, 2018. If we are required to make a payment, we would have an interest in the collateral underlying the related commercial mortgage loan; any loss we incur could be offset by the amount of any recovery from the collateral.Residential Mortgage Banking. We often originate and sell residential mortgage loans with servicing retained. Our loan sales activity is generally conducted through loan sales in a secondary market sponsored by FNMA and FHLMC. Subsequent to the sale of mortgage loans, we do not typically retain any interest in the underlying loans except through our relationship as the servicer of the loans.As is customary in the mortgage banking industry, we, or banks we have acquired, have made certain representations and warranties related to the sale of residential mortgage loans (including loans sold with servicing released) and to the performance of our obligations as servicer. The breach of any such representations or warranties could result in losses for us. Our maximum exposure to loss is equal to the outstanding principal balance of the sold loans; however, any loss would be reduced by any payments received on the loans or through the sale of collateral.At March 31, 2018, the outstanding residential mortgage loans in this program had a weighted-average LTV ratio of 72%, and the unpaid principal balance outstanding of loans sold by us was $4.5 billion. The risk assessment is low for the residential mortgage product. The maximum potential amount of undiscounted future payments that we could be required to make under this program, as shown in the preceding table, is equal to approximately 30% of the principal balance of loans outstanding at March 31, 2018. Our liability for estimated repurchase obligations on loans sold, which is included in other liabilities on our balance sheet, was $6 million at March 31, 2018.100Table of ContentsReturn guarantee agreement with LIHTC investors. KAHC, a subsidiary of KeyBank, offered limited partnership interests to qualified investors. Partnerships formed by KAHC invested in low-income residential rental properties that qualify for federal low-income housing tax credits under Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code. In certain partnerships, investors paid a fee to KAHC for a guaranteed return that is based on the financial performance of the property and the property’s confirmed LIHTC status throughout a 15-year compliance period. Typically, KAHC fulfills these guaranteed returns by distributing tax credits and deductions associated with the specific properties. If KAHC defaults on its obligation to provide the guaranteed return, KeyBank is obligated to make any necessary payments to investors. No recourse or collateral is available to offset our guarantee obligation other than the underlying income streams from the properties and the residual value of the operating partnership interests.As shown in the previous table, KAHC maintained a reserve in the amount of $3 million at March 31, 2018, which is sufficient to cover estimated future obligations under the guarantees. The maximum exposure to loss reflected in the table represents undiscounted future payments due to investors for the return on and of their investments.These guarantees have expiration dates that extend through 2018, but KAHC has not formed any new partnerships under this program since October 2003. Additional information regarding these partnerships is included in Note 9 (“Variable Interest Entities”).Written put options. In the ordinary course of business, we “write” put options for clients that wish to mitigate their exposure to changes in interest rates and commodity prices. At March 31, 2018, our written put options had an average life of three years. These instruments are considered to be guarantees, as we are required to make payments to the counterparty (the client) based on changes in an underlying variable that is related to an asset, a liability, or an equity security that the client holds. We are obligated to pay the client if the applicable benchmark interest rate or commodity price is above or below a specified level (known as the “strike rate”). These written put options are accounted for as derivatives at fair value, as further discussed in Note 7 (“Derivatives and Hedging Activities”). We mitigate our potential future payment obligations by entering into offsetting positions with third parties.Written put options where the counterparty is a broker-dealer or bank are accounted for as derivatives at fair value but are not considered guarantees since these counterparties typically do not hold the underlying instruments. In addition, we are a purchaser and seller of credit derivatives, which are further discussed in Note 7 (“Derivatives and Hedging Activities”).Default guarantees. Some lines of business participate in guarantees that obligate us to perform if the debtor (typically a client) fails to satisfy all of its payment obligations to third parties. We generally undertake these guarantees for one of two possible reasons: (i) either the risk profile of the debtor should provide an investment return, or (ii) we are supporting our underlying investment in the debtor. We do not hold collateral for the default guarantees. If we were required to make a payment under a guarantee, we would receive a pro rata share should the third party collect some or all of the amounts due from the debtor. At March 31, 2018, we had less than $1 million of default guarantees.Other Off-Balance Sheet RiskOther off-balance sheet risk stems from financial instruments that do not meet the definition of a guarantee as specified in the applicable accounting guidance, and from other relationships.Indemnifications provided in the ordinary course of business. We provide certain indemnifications, primarily through representations and warranties in contracts that we execute in the ordinary course of business in connection with loan and lease sales and other ongoing activities, as well as in connection with purchases and sales of businesses. We maintain reserves, when appropriate, with respect to liability that reasonably could arise as a result of these indemnities.Intercompany guarantees. KeyCorp, KeyBank, and certain of our affiliates are parties to various guarantees that facilitate the ongoing business activities of other affiliates. These business activities include issuing debt, assuming certain lease and insurance obligations, purchasing or issuing investments and securities, and engaging in certain leasing transactions involving clients.101Table of Contents16.

Line of Business Results The specific lines of business that constitute each of the major business segments (operating segments) are described below.Key Community BankKey Community Bank serves individuals and small to mid-sized businesses primarily through its 15-state branch network.Individuals are provided with branch-based deposit and investment products, personal finance services, and loans, including residential mortgages, home equity, credit card, and various types of installment loans. Key Community Bank offers personal property and casualty insurance, such as home, auto, renters, watercraft, and umbrella policies. Key Community Bank also purchases retail auto sales contracts via a network of auto dealerships. The auto dealerships finance the sale of automobiles as the initial lender and then assign the contracts to us pursuant to dealer agreements. In addition, financial, estate and retirement planning, asset management services, and Delaware Trust capabilities are offered to assist high net worth clients with their banking, trust, portfolio management, life insurance, charitable giving, and related needs. Small businesses are provided with deposit, investment and credit products, and business advisory services. Mid-sized businesses are provided with products and services, some of which are delivered by Key Corporate Bank, that include commercial lending, cash management, equipment leasing, investment, insurance including commercial property and casualty as well as captive insurance and employee benefit programs, succession planning, access to capital markets, derivatives, and foreign exchange.Key Corporate BankKey Corporate Bank is a full-service corporate and investment bank focused principally on serving the needs of middle market clients in seven industry sectors: consumer, energy, healthcare, industrial, public sector, real estate, and technology. Key Corporate Bank delivers a broad suite of banking and capital markets products to its clients, including syndicated finance, debt and equity capital markets, commercial payments, equipment finance, commercial mortgage banking, derivatives, foreign exchange, financial advisory, and public finance. Key Corporate Bank is also a significant servicer of commercial mortgage loans and a significant special servicer of CMBS. Key Corporate Bank delivers many of its product capabilities to clients of Key Community Bank.103Table of ContentsOther SegmentsOther Segments consists of corporate treasury, our principal investing unit, and various exit portfolios.Reconciling ItemsTotal assets included under “Reconciling Items” primarily represent the unallocated portion of nonearning assets of corporate support functions. Charges related to the funding of these assets are part of net interest income and are allocated to the business segments through noninterest expense. Reconciling Items also includes intercompany eliminations and certain items that are not allocated to the business segments because they do not reflect their normal operations, including merger-related charges.The information was derived from the internal financial reporting system that we use to monitor and manage our financial performance. GAAP guides financial accounting, but there is no authoritative guidance for “management accounting,” i.e., the way we apply judgment and experience to make reporting decisions. Consequently, the line of business results we report may not be comparable to line of business results presented by other companies.The selected financial data are based on internal accounting policies designed to compile results on a consistent basis and in a manner that reflects the underlying economics of the businesses. In accordance with our policies: •Net interest income is determined by assigning a standard cost for funds used or a standard credit for funds provided based on their assumed maturity, prepayment, and/or repricing characteristics;•Indirect expenses, such as computer servicing costs and corporate overhead, are allocated based on assumptions regarding the extent that each line of business actually uses the services;•The consolidated provision for credit losses is allocated among the lines of business primarily based on their actual net loan charge-offs, adjusted periodically for loan growth and changes in risk profile. The amount of the consolidated provision is based on the methodology that we use to estimate our consolidated ALLL. This methodology is described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses” beginning on page 102 of our 2017 Form 10-K.•Income taxes are allocated based on the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% for periods after December 31, 2017, and 35% for periods prior to December 31, 2017. Income taxes are allocated based on a blended state income tax rate (net of the federal income tax benefit) of 2.7% for periods after December 31, 2017, and 2.2% for periods prior to December 31, 2017; and•Capital is assigned to each line of business based on economic equity.The development and application of the methodologies that we use to allocate items among our lines of business is a dynamic process. Accordingly, financial results may be revised periodically to reflect enhanced alignment of expense base allocation drivers, changes in the risk profile of a particular business, or changes in our organizational structure.The table on the following pages shows selected financial data for our major business segments for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2018, and March 31, 2017.104Table of Contents            Three months ended March 31,Key Community Bank Key Corporate Bankdollars in millions20182017 20182017SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS     Net interest income (TE)$688$628 $272$304Noninterest income285277 287274Total revenue (TE) (a)973905 559578Provision for credit losses4846 1418Depreciation and amortization expense2928 3320Other noninterest expense639597 281284Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes (TE)257234 231256Allocated income taxes and TE adjustments6187 2476Income (loss) from continuing operations196147 207180Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes—— ——Net income (loss)196147 207180Less: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests—— ——Net income (loss) attributable to Key$196$147 $207$180      AVERAGE BALANCES (b)     Loans and leases$47,680$47,085 $38,260$37,688Total assets (a)51,68151,063 45,54944,124Deposits79,94579,148 20,81521,002OTHER FINANCIAL DATA     Net loan charge-offs (b)$42$43 $11$14Return on average allocated equity (b)16.48%12.56% 29.46%24.94%Return on average allocated equity16.4812.56 29.4624.94Average full-time equivalent employees (c)10,98810,804 2,5432,384(a)Substantially all revenue generated by our major business segments is derived from clients that reside in the United States.

Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of KeyCorp as of December 31, 2017, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 26, 2018, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.Basis for Review Results These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to KeyCorp in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial statements consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.  Cleveland, OhioErnst & Young LLPMay 3, 2018 107Table of ContentsItem 3.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market RiskThe information presented in the “Market risk management” section of the Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition & Results of Operations is incorporated herein by reference.Item 4. Controls and ProceduresAs of the end of the period covered by this report, KeyCorp carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of KeyCorp’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of KeyCorp’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), to ensure that information required to be disclosed by KeyCorp in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to KeyCorp’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, KeyCorp’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, as of the end of the period covered by this report.No changes were made to KeyCorp’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) underthe Exchange Act) during the last fiscal year that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,KeyCorp’s internal control over financial reporting. We implemented internal controls to ensure we adequately evaluated our contracts and properly assessed the impact of the new accounting standards related to revenue recognition on our financial statements to facilitate its adoption on January 1, 2018. There were no significant changes to our internal control over financial reporting due to the adoption of the new standard.PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal ProceedingsThe information presented in the Legal Proceedings section of Note 15 (“Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) is incorporated herein by reference.On at least a quarterly basis, we assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings utilizing the latest information available. Where it is probable that we will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements. These legal reserves may be increased or decreased to reflect any relevant developments on a quarterly basis. Where a loss is not probable or the amount of the loss is not estimable, we have not accrued legal reserves, consistent with applicable accounting guidance. Based on information currently available to us, advice of counsel, and available insurance coverage, we believe that our established reserves are adequate and the liabilities arising from the legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. We note, however, that in light of the inherent uncertainty in legal proceedings there can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution will not exceed established reserves. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter or a combination of matters may be material to our results of operations for a particular period, depending upon the size of the loss or our income for that particular period.Item 1A.
