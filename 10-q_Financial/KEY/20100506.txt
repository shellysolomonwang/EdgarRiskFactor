Item 1A: Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009.    Any forward-looking statements made by or on our behalf speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the impact of subsequent events or circumstances. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider all risks and uncertainties disclosed in our SEC filings, including our reports on Forms 8-K, 10-K and 10-Q and our registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, all of which are accessible on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.     Long-term goals  Our long-term financial goals are as follows:     ¨   Continue to achieve a loan to core deposit ratio range of 90% to 100%.      ¨   Return to a moderate risk profile by targeting a net charge-off ratio range of 40 to 50 basis points.      ¨   Grow high quality and diverse revenue streams by targeting a net interest margin in excess of 3.50% and maintain noninterest income to total revenue of greater than 40%.      ¨   Create positive operating leverage and complete Keyvolution run-rate savings goal of $300 million to $375 million by the end of 2012.      ¨   Achieve a return on average assets in the range of 1.00% to 1.25%.       Economic overview  During the first quarter of 2010, economic activity continued to strengthen and signs emerged that the labor market was stabilizing. While employers were slow to add workers, U.S. payrolls did increase by 162,000 during the first quarter of 2010. This marked the first quarter the economy added jobs in over two years and was an improvement from the fourth quarter of 2009 when the economy eliminated 269,000 jobs. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2009, U. S. employment had been reduced by over 8 million jobs since the recession began in December 2007. The average unemployment rate for the first quarter of 2010 also improved, falling to 9.7% average from a 10.0% average during the fourth quarter of 2009. This compares to a 9.3% average rate for all of 2009 and a 10 year average rate of 5.7%.  Spending by U.S. businesses and consumers continued to improve. The modest recovery in the labor market and increases in consumer confidence levels supported a moderate expansion in household spending. Consumer spending rose at an average monthly rate of 0.5% for the first quarter of 2010 compared to an average monthly increase of 0.5% in the fourth quarter of 2009 and an average monthly increase of 0.3% for all of 2009. Prices for consumer goods and services increased a modest 2.3% in March 2010 from March 2009, compared to an annual increase of 2.7% in December 2009. Business spending also supported economic growth in the first quarter of 2010 as companies continued to rebuild inventory levels to better align them with increasing demand from consumers. Businesses also made investments in capital goods, including equipment and software. Factory production continued to show improvement and resource utilization levels continued to increase from their lows in mid-2009.  The extension and expansion of the homebuyer tax credit, offered as part of The Worker, Homeownership and Business Assistance Act of 2009, gave support to the housing market at the close of the first quarter of 2010. Housing in the fourth quarter of 2009 was supported by historically low  58    Table of Contents  mortgage rates and the initial availability of the first-time home buyer tax credit. Home buying activity slowed early in the first quarter of 2010 but improved in March 2010 as home buyers rushed to beat the extended tax credit’s end of April 2010 expiration. New home sales in March 2010 rose by 24% and existing home sales rose by 16% from March 2009. The increased level of home sales spurred home building activity and supported home prices. In March 2010, residential housing starts increased by 20% from the same month in 2009. Median prices in March 2010 for new and existing homes rose 4.3% and 0.4% respectively from the same month the prior year. Existing home prices continue to be impacted by near record-level foreclosures as an estimated one in every 352 U.S. homes was in some stage of foreclosure in March 2010. However, the growth in the number of foreclosures has slowed, rising 8% in March 2010 from one year ago, compared to the 46% annual increase reported in March 2009.  Citing continued weakness in the housing and labor markets, the Federal Reserve held the federal funds target rate near zero during the first quarter of 2010. However, in response to the improved functioning of the financial markets, the Federal Reserve ceased its purchases of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities and closed most of its emergency liquidity facilities. Benchmark interest rates remained volatile during the quarter as the markets alternated between growing economic optimism and the concerns underlying the Federal Reserve’s stated intentions to keep interest rates low for an ‘extended period.’ At the end of the quarter, bond markets increasingly focused on the historically large volumes of U.S. Treasury debt issuance and Treasury yields rose from their lows of the quarter. The benchmark two-year Treasury yield declined to .77% in February 2010 from 1.14% at December 31, 2009, before ending the first quarter 2010 at 1.02%. The ten-year Treasury yield, which began the quarter at 3.84%, declined to 3.56% in February 2010, before closing the quarter at 3.83%. As credit concerns continued to ease, credit spreads for banks’ and financial firms’ debt obligations continued to narrow.     FDIC Rulemaking Developments  On April 13, 2010, the FDIC Board of Directors approved an interim rule under the TLGP that extends the TAG program, which currently offers unlimited deposit insurance on noninterest bearing accounts through June 30, 2010. The FDIC’s interim rule published in the Federal Register on April 19, 2010 extends the TAG program from July 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010. KeyBank is currently a participant in the TAG program, but as of April 29, 2010, KeyBank elected not to participate in the TAG program extension which would mean that on and after June 30, 2010, KeyBank would no longer offer unlimited deposit insurance on noninterest bearing accounts.  The FDIC also announced on April 13, 2010 its Board of Directors’ approval of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Assessments. The proposed revisions to the assessment system would be applicable to large institutions with assets of over $10 billion, such as KeyBank. According to the FDIC, the proposed revisions would better capture risk at the time an institution assumes the risk, better differentiate institutions during periods of good economic and banking conditions based on how they would fare during periods of stress or economic downturns, and would also take into account the losses that the FDIC may incur if an institution fails. The proposal was published in the Federal Register on May 3, 2010, and the comment period for the proposal expires on July 2, 2010. Further information on the TLGP-related developments is included in the “Capital” section under the heading “Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program.”     Regulation E pursuant to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of 1978  The Federal Reserve finalized rules regarding Regulation E, which is designed to protect consumers by prohibiting unfair practices and improving disclosures to consumers. Regulation E goes into effect July 1, 2010, and among other items, prohibits financial institutions from charging overdraft or insufficient funds fees to a customer without receiving consent from the customer to “opt-in” to the financial institutions overdraft services.  Once fully in effect, we anticipate these rules to reduce our deposit service charge income by approximately $50 million annually.  59    Table of Contents     Demographics  We have two major business groups: Community Banking and National Banking. The effect on our business of continued volatility and weakness in the housing market varies with the state of the economy in the regions in which these business groups operate.  The Community Banking group serves consumers and small to mid-sized businesses by offering a variety of deposit, investment, lending and wealth management products and services. These products and services are provided through a 14-state branch network organized into three internally defined geographic regions: Rocky Mountains and Northwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast. The National Banking group includes those corporate and consumer business units that operate nationally, within and beyond our 14-state branch network, as well as internationally. The specific products and services offered by the Community and National Banking groups are described in Note 3.  Figure 1 shows the geographic diversity of our Community Banking group’s average core deposits, commercial loans and home equity loans.  Figure 1.

(b)   Excludes certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more and deposits in the foreign office.    Figure 17, which appears later in this report in the “Loans and loans held for sale” section, shows the diversity of our commercial real estate lending business based on industry type and location. The homebuilder loan portfolio within the National Banking group has been adversely affected by the downturn in the U.S. housing market. Deteriorating market conditions in the residential properties segment of the commercial real estate construction portfolio, principally in Florida and southern California, caused nonperforming loans and net charge-offs to increase significantly since mid-2007. As previously reported we have ceased all new lending to homebuilders and we have reduced outstanding balances in the residential properties segment of the commercial real estate construction loan portfolio by $2.5 billion, or 72%, to $978 million. Additional information about loan sales is included in the “Credit risk management” section.  Deterioration in the commercial real estate portfolio continued into the first quarter of 2010 albeit at a slower pace than experienced in the fourth quarter of 2009. Deterioration was concentrated in the nonowner-occupied properties segment. Elevated vacancy rates, reduced cash flows and reduced real estate values that may have not yet bottomed continue to adversely affect commercial real estate on a national basis due to weak economic conditions. Delinquencies, nonperforming loans and charge-offs remain high but are declining from the fourth quarter of 2009 results.  Results for the National Banking group have also been affected adversely by increasing credit costs and volatility in the capital markets, which have led to declines in the market values of assets under management and the market values at which we record certain assets (primarily commercial real estate loans and securities held for sale or trading).  During the first quarter of 2009, we determined that the estimated fair value of the National Banking reporting unit was less than the carrying amount. As a result, we recorded an after-tax noncash accounting charge of $187 million. As a result of this charge and a similar after-tax charge of $420  60    Table of Contents  million recorded during the fourth quarter of 2008, we have written off all of the goodwill that had been assigned to our National Banking reporting unit.     Critical accounting policies and estimates  Our business is dynamic and complex. Consequently, we must exercise judgment in choosing and applying accounting policies and methodologies. These choices are critical: not only are they necessary to comply with GAAP, they also reflect our view of the appropriate way to record and report our overall financial performance. All accounting policies are important, and all policies described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) on page 79 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders should be reviewed for a greater understanding of how we record and report our financial performance.  In our opinion, some accounting policies are more likely than others to have a critical effect on our financial results and to expose those results to potentially greater volatility. These policies apply to areas of relatively greater business importance, or require us to exercise judgment and to make assumptions and estimates that affect amounts reported in the financial statements. Because these assumptions and estimates are based on current circumstances, they may prove to be inaccurate, or we may find it necessary to change them.  We rely heavily on the use of judgment, assumptions and estimates to make a number of core decisions, including accounting for the allowance for loan losses; contingent liabilities, guarantees and income taxes; derivatives and related hedging activities; and assets and liabilities that involve valuation methodologies. A brief discussion of each of these areas appears on pages 19 through 21 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders.  At March 31, 2010, $20.2 billion, or 22%, of our total assets were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Approximately 93% of these assets were classified as Level 1 or Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. At March 31, 2010, $2.0 billion, or 2%, of our total liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Substantially all of these liabilities were classified as Level 1 or Level 2.  At March 31, 2010, $818 million, or 1%, of our total assets were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Approximately 5% of these assets were classified as Level 1 or Level 2. At March 31, 2010, there were no liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.  In addition, with the consolidation of the education lending securitization trusts on January 1, 2010, we included fair value of assets and liabilities of $2.8 billion, respectively at March 31, 2010.  During the first three months of 2010, we did not significantly alter the manner in which we applied our critical accounting policies or developed related assumptions and estimates.     Highlights of Our Performance     Financial performance  For the first quarter of 2010, we announced a first quarter net loss from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $98 million, or $.11 per common share. These results compare to a net loss from continuing operations attributable to Key common shareholders of $507 million, or $1.03 per common share, for the first quarter of 2009. The first quarter of 2009 was negatively impacted by an $847 ($529 million after-tax) million loan loss provision and a $196 million ($164 million after-tax) intangible assets impairment charge.  A stronger net interest margin combined with a lower provision for loan losses and continued expense control resulted in a narrowing of our first-quarter loss when compared to both the fourth quarter of 2009 and the year ago quarter.  Net interest margin increased by 15 and 40 basis points from the fourth quarter 2009 and the year ago quarter, respectively, to 3.19% due to lower funding costs and improved yields on loans.  61    Table of Contents  Net charge-offs declined by $186 million, and nonperforming loans showed continued improvement, decreasing by $122 million from December 31, 2009, primarily attributable to continued stabilization in the commercial loan portfolio.  Our Tier 1 common equity and Tier 1 risk-based capital ratios remain strong at 7.51% and 12.92%, respectively, and have increased significantly from the first quarter of 2009.  We increased our allowance for loan losses by more than $409 million to $2.4 billion from the year ago quarter. At March 31, 2010, our allowance represented 4.34% of total loans compared to 2.88% at March 31, 2009 and 117% of nonperforming loans at the end of the first quarter of 2010 compared to 116% at the end of the year ago quarter. One of our primary areas of focus has been to reduce our exposure to the higher risk segments of our commercial real estate portfolio through loan restructuring, refinancing, discounted pay-offs and liquidations. Further information pertaining to our progress in reducing our commercial real estate exposure and our exit loan portfolio is presented in the section entitled “Credit risk management.”  Additionally, we made significant progress on strengthening our liquidity and funding positions. Our consolidated loan to deposit ratio was 93% for the first quarter 2010 compared to 115% for the first quarter of 2009. This improvement was accomplished by growing deposits, reducing our reliance on wholesale funding, exiting nonrelationship businesses and increasing the portion of our earning assets invested in highly liquid securities. During the first quarter of 2010, we originated approximately $5.3 billion in new or renewed lending commitments and our average domestic deposits grew by approximately $600 million, compared to the year ago quarter.  During the first quarter of 2010, we continued our investment in our Community Banking 14-state branch network by opening eight new branches, with an additional 32 branches slated to be opened during the remainder of 2010, and we have completed 160 branch renovations over the past two years. Further, during 2010, we increased our “business intensive” branches from 157 to 225. These branches are staffed to serve our small business clients. These investments enable our customers to utilize the full breadth of solutions, expertise, products and services we have to offer.  We continue to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our organization. Over the past two years, we have reduced our staff by more than 2,600 average full-time equivalent employees and implemented ongoing initiatives that will better align our cost structure with our relationship-focused business strategies. We want to ensure that we have effective business models that are sustainable and flexible.  Finally, we remain steadfast in our actions of reducing risk exposure, concentrating on core relationship businesses, and maintaining strong capital, liquidity and reserve levels as we emerge from this extraordinary credit cycle as a strong, competitive company.  Figure 2 shows our continuing and discontinued operating results for the current, past and year-ago quarters. Our financial performance for each of the past five quarters is summarized in Figure 4.  62    Table of Contents  Figure 2.

In April 2009, we decided to wind down the operations of Austin, a subsidiary that specialized in managing hedge fund investments for institutional customers. We have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations. Included in the loss from discontinued operations for the three-month period ended March 31, 2009, is a $23 million after- tax, or $.05 per common share, charge for intangible assets impairment related to Austin Capital Management.

business conducted through Key Education Resources, the education payment and financing unit of KeyBank. In April 2009, we decided to wind down the operations of Austin, a subsidiary that specialized in managing hedge fund investments for institutional customers.    64    Table of Contents  Figure 5 presents certain earnings data and performance ratios, excluding (credits) charges related to intangible assets impairment and the tax treatment of certain leveraged lease financing transactions disallowed by the IRS. We believe that eliminating the effects of significant items that are generally nonrecurring assists in analyzing our results by presenting them on a more comparable basis.  During the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded an after-tax credit of $80 million, or $.09 per common share, representing a final adjustment related to the resolution of certain lease financing tax issues. In the prior quarter, we recorded an after-tax charge of $28 million, or $.03 per common share, to write off intangible assets, other than goodwill, associated with actions taken to cease conducting business in certain equipment leasing markets. In the first quarter of 2009, we recorded an after-tax charge of $164 million, or $.33 per common share, for the impairment of intangible assets related to the National Banking reporting unit. We have now written off all of the goodwill that had been assigned to our National Banking reporting unit.  Figure 5 also shows certain financial measures related to “tangible common equity” and “Tier 1 common equity.” The tangible common equity ratio has been a focus of some investors. We believe this ratio may assist investors in analyzing our capital position without regard to the effects of intangible assets and preferred stock. Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and the composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. Since the SCAP in early 2009, the Federal Reserve has focused its assessment of capital adequacy on a component of Tier 1 capital known as Tier 1 common equity. Because the Federal Reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders’ equity (essentially Tier 1 capital less preferred stock, qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in Tier 1 capital, this focus on Tier 1 common equity is consistent with existing capital adequacy guidelines.  Tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by GAAP nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations; this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. Since analysts and banking regulators may assess our capital adequacy using tangible common equity and Tier 1 common equity, we believe it is useful to enable investors to assess our capital adequacy on these same bases. Figure 5 also reconciles the GAAP performance measures to the corresponding non-GAAP measures.  Non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited. Although these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by investors to evaluate a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.  65    Table of Contents  Figure 5.

As a result of this decision, we have accounted for the education lending business as a discontinued operation. Additionally, we ceased conducting business in both the commercial vehicle and office equipment leasing markets.           ¨    During the second quarter of 2009, we decided to wind down the operations of Austin, a subsidiary that specialized in managing hedge fund investments for institutional customers. As a result of this decision, we have accounted for this business as a discontinued operation.     67    Table of Contents     Line of Business Results  This section summarizes the financial performance and related strategic developments of our two major business groups, Community Banking and National Banking. During the first quarter of 2010, we re-aligned our reporting structure for our business groups. Previously, Consumer Finance consisted mainly of portfolios which were identified as exit or run-off portfolios and were included in our National Banking segment. Effective for all periods presented, we are reflecting the results of these exit portfolios in Other Segments. The automobile dealer floor plan business, previously included in Consumer Finance, has been re-aligned with the Commercial Banking line of business within the Community Banking segment. In addition, other previously identified exit portfolios included in the National Banking segment, including $309 million of homebuilder loans from the Real Estate Capital line of business and $2.685 billion of commercial leases from the Equipment Finance line of business, have been moved to Other Segments.

Decreases in net interest income and noninterest income caused the decline.  Taxable-equivalent net interest income declined by $11 million, or 3%, from the first quarter of 2009, due to a reduction in average earning assets which declined by $4 billion or 11%, from the year-ago quarter. Average deposits declined slightly from the first quarter of 2009. The mix of deposits has changed reflecting strong growth in noninterest-bearing deposits and negotiable order of withdrawal (“NOW”) accounts, as higher-costing certificates of deposit originated in prior years mature and reprice to current market rates.  Noninterest income decreased by $2 million, or 1%, from the year-ago quarter, due to lower service charges on deposits and an increase in the reserve for credit losses from client derivatives. These factors were partially offset by higher income from trust and investment services, letter of credit fees and electronic banking fees. Assets under management have increased 29% from the same period one year ago.  The provision for loan losses increased slightly compared to the first quarter of 2009. Community Banking’s provision for loan losses for the first quarter of 2010 exceeded its net loan charge-offs by $26 million as consumer and business clients continue to experience lingering effects from the economic downturn and elevated unemployment levels.  Noninterest expense remained flat from the year-ago quarter. Lower personnel costs, marketing, office supplies and printing, and a reduction in the provision for losses on lending-related commitments were offset by increases in FDIC deposit insurance, occupancy cost, and various other expense categories.

During the first quarter of 2009, results were adversely affected by an intangible assets impairment charge of $196 million ($164 million after tax). Also contributing to the improvement in the first quarter of 2010 was a substantial decrease in the provision for loan losses, partially offset by lower net interest income and noninterest income.  Taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $27 million, or 12%, from the first quarter of 2009, primarily due to lower earning assets, partially offset by improved earning asset spreads. Average earning assets decreased by $8 billion, or 24%, from the year-ago quarter, reflecting reductions in the commercial and held-for-sale portfolios.  Noninterest income declined by $20 million, or 10%, from the first quarter of 2009. Dealer trading and derivatives income decreased $26 million, primarily due to an increase in the reserve for credit losses from client derivatives of $21 million. Operating lease revenue was also $8 million lower than the first quarter of 2009.  The provision for loan losses in the first quarter of 2010 was $161 million compared to $511 million for the same period one year ago. For the second quarter in a row, National Banking experienced an improvement in nonperforming assets.  Excluding the intangible assets impairment charge in the first quarter of 2009, noninterest expense increased by $38 million, or 16%, from the first quarter of 2009, caused primarily by higher costs associated with OREO.  70    Table of Contents  Figure 8.

Other Segments  Other Segments consist of Corporate Treasury, our Principal Investing unit and various exit portfolios which were previously included within the National Banking segment. These exit portfolios were moved to Other Segments during the first quarter of 2010. Prior periods have been adjusted to conform with the current reporting of the financial information for each segment. Other Segments generated a net loss attributable to Key of $46 million for the first quarter of 2010, compared to a net loss attributable to Key of $162 million for the same period last year. These results reflect net gains from principal investing attributable to Key of $21 million during the current quarter, compared to net losses of $63 million in the year-ago quarter as well as a reduction in the loan loss provision for the exit portfolios.  71    Table of Contents     Results of Operations     Net interest income  One of our principal sources of revenue is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income received on earning assets (such as loans and securities) and loan-related fee income, and interest expense paid on deposits and borrowings. There are several factors that affect net interest income, including:                 ¨    the volume, pricing, mix and maturity of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities;           ¨    the volume and value of net free funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and equity capital;           ¨    the use of derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk;           ¨    interest rate fluctuations and competitive conditions within the marketplace; and           ¨    asset quality.     To make it easier to compare results among several periods and the yields on various types of earning assets (some taxable, some not), we present net interest income in this discussion on a “taxable-equivalent basis” (i.e., as if it were all taxable and at the same rate). For example, $100 of tax-exempt income would be presented as $154, an amount that — if taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% — would yield $100.  Figure 9 shows the various components of our balance sheet that affect interest income and expense, and their respective yields or rates over the past five quarters. This figure also presents a reconciliation of taxable-equivalent net interest income to net interest income reported in accordance with GAAP for each of those quarters. The net interest margin, which is an indicator of the profitability of the earning assets portfolio, is calculated by dividing net interest income by average earning assets.  Taxable-equivalent net interest income for the first quarter of 2010 was $632 million, and the net interest margin was 3.19%. These results compare to taxable-equivalent net interest income of $595 million and a net interest margin of 2.79% for the first quarter of 2009. During the past year we have experienced an improvement in the mix of deposits, resulting in a lower level of higher costing certificates of deposit and an increase in lower costing transaction accounts. We expect this change in funding mix to continue as maturing higher costing certificates of deposit are repriced to current market rates. Additionally, despite the decline in loan balances due to soft consumer demand for credit and continued deleveraging by businesses, we experienced improved spreads on loan renewals. This repricing and changing the mix of deposits should continue to benefit our net interest margin for the remaining quarters of 2010. Funding costs were also reduced by maturities of long-term debt and the 2009 exchanges of retail trust preferred securities for Key common shares.  Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, taxable-equivalent net interest income decreased by $5 million, and the net interest margin rose by 15 basis points. The increase in the net interest margin resulting from the improved funding mix was mostly offset by the lower day count and reduced average earning assets in the first quarter of 2010 compared to the fourth quarter of 2009.   Additionally, nonperforming assets continue to depress the net interest margin by approximately 7 to 11 basis points.  Average earning assets for the first quarter of 2010 totaled $79.8 billion, which was $5.9 billion, or 7%, lower than the first quarter of 2009. This reduction reflects a $14.3 billion decrease in loans caused by soft demand for both consumer and commercial credit due to the uncertain economic environment and the run-off in our exit portfolios and net charge-offs. The decline in loans was partially offset by increases of $8.2 billion in securities available for sale and $.4 billion in our short-term investments due to our emphasis on building liquidity. 72    Table of Contents  Since January 1, 2009, the size and composition of our loan portfolios have been affected by the following actions:                 ¨    During the first quarter of 2010, we sold $505 million in total loans, excluding $333 million of education loans that relate to our discontinued operations of the education lending business. The largest portion of loans sold, $328 million, were residential real estate loans.           ¨    In the fourth quarter of 2009, we transferred loans with a fair value of $82 million from held-for-sale status to the held-to-maturity portfolio as a result of current market conditions and our related plans to restructure the terms of these loans.           ¨    In late September 2009, we transferred $193 million of loans ($248 million, net of $55 million in net charge-offs) from the held-to-maturity loan portfolio to held-for-sale status in conjunction with additional actions taken to reduce our exposure in the commercial real estate and institutional portfolios through the sale of selected assets. Most of these loans were sold during October 2009.           ¨    We sold $1.3 billion of commercial real estate loans during 2009. Since some of these loans have been sold with limited recourse (i.e., there is a risk that we will be held accountable for certain events or representations made in the sales agreements), we established and have maintained a loss reserve in an amount that we believe is appropriate. More information about the related recourse agreement is provided in Note 13 (“Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) under the heading “Recourse agreement with FNMA.” In late March 2009, we transferred $1.5 billion of loans from the construction portfolio to the commercial mortgage portfolio in accordance with regulatory guidelines for the classification of loans that have reached a completed status. Additional information about the status of this process is included in the section entitled “Loans and loans held for sale” under the heading “Commercial real estate loans.”           ¨    In late September 2009, we decided to exit the government-guaranteed education lending business and have applied discontinued operations accounting to the education lending business for all periods presented in this report. We sold $474 million of education loans (included in “discontinued assets” on the balance sheet) during 2009.           ¨    In addition to the sales of commercial real estate loans discussed above, we sold other loans totaling $1.8 billion (including $1.5 billion of residential real estate loans) during 2009.     73    Table of Contents  Figure 9.

balances have not been adjusted to reflect our January 1, 2008, adoption of the applicable accounting guidance related to the offsetting of certain derivative contracts on the consolidated balance sheet.     (a)   Results are from continuing operations. Interest excludes the interest associated with the liabilities referred to in (e) below, calculated using a matched funds transfer pricing methodology.      (b)   Interest income on tax-exempt securities and loans has been adjusted to a taxable-equivalent basis using the statutory federal income tax rate of 35%.      (c)   For purposes of these computations, nonaccrual loans are included in average loan balances.      (d)   In March 2009, we transferred $1.5 billion of loans from the construction portfolio to the commercial mortgage portfolio in accordance with regulatory guidelines for the classification of loans that have reached a completed status.      (e)   Discontinued liabilities include the liabilities of the education lending business and the dollar amount of any additional liabilities assumed necessary to support the assets associated with this business.    74    Table of Contents  Figure 9.

Noninterest income  Our noninterest income was $450 million for the first quarter of 2010, compared to $478 million for the year-ago quarter. The decrease reflects a $105 million gain from the sale of Visa Inc. shares during the first quarter of 2009. In addition, operating lease income and gains on leased equipment decreased by $14 million and $18 million, respectively, compared to the first quarter of 2009 due to a lower level of leasing activity. Net gains of $37 million in the first quarter of 2010 from principal investing (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests), compared to net losses of $72 million for the same period last year, partially offset this decline in noninterest income.  76    Table of Contents  Figure 11.

Trust and investment services income. Trust and investment services are our largest source of noninterest income. The primary components of revenue generated by these services are shown in Figure 12. The first quarter of 2010 increase of $4 million, or 4%, is attributable to increases in both institutional and personal asset management income, offset by lower income from brokerage commissions and fees.  Figure 12.

At March 31, 2010, our bank, trust and registered investment advisory subsidiaries had assets under management of $66.2 billion, compared to $60.2 billion at March 31, 2009. As shown in Figure 13, most of the increase was attributable to market appreciation in the equity portfolio, offset in part by decreases in the money market and securities lending portfolios. The value of the money market portfolio declined because of general economic conditions. The decline in the securities lending portfolio was due in part to increased volatility in the fixed income markets and actions taken to maintain sufficient liquidity within the portfolio. When clients’ securities are lent out, the borrower must provide us with cash collateral, which is invested during the term of the loan. The difference between the revenue generated from the investment and the cost of the collateral is shared with the lending client. This business, although profitable, generates a significantly lower rate of return (commensurate with the lower level of risk) than other types of assets under management. The decrease in the value of our portfolio of hedge funds is attributable in part to our second quarter 2009 decision to wind down the operations of Austin.  77    Table of Contents  Figure 13.

Service charges on deposit accounts. The 2010 decrease in service charges on deposit accounts is due primarily to lower transaction volume, which generated fewer overdraft fees. Additionally, because of the prevailing low interest rates and unlimited FDIC insurance, our corporate clients have been maintaining larger amounts on deposit, which has the effect of reducing their transaction service charges on their noninterest-bearing deposit accounts.     Operating lease income. The $14 million decrease in our first quarter of 2010 operating lease income in the Equipment Finance line of business is attributable to reduced originations of operating leases due to the related economics. Accordingly, as shown in Figure 15, depreciation expense associated with operating leases also declined.     Net gains (losses) from loan sales. We sell loans to achieve desired interest rate and credit risk profiles, to improve the profitability of the overall loan portfolio, or to diversify funding sources. During the first quarter of 2010, we recorded $4 million of net gain from loan sales, compared to net gains of $7 million during the year-ago quarter.     Net gains (losses) from principal investing. Principal investments consist of direct and indirect investments in predominantly privately-held companies. Our principal investing income is susceptible to volatility since most of it is derived from mezzanine debt and equity investments in small to medium-sized businesses. These investments are carried on the balance sheet at fair value ($1.1 billion at March 31, 2010 compared to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2009, and $932 million at March 31, 2009). The net gains (losses) presented in Figure 11 derive from changes in fair values as well as sales of principal investments.     Investment banking and capital markets income (loss). As shown in Figure 14, income from investment banking and capital markets activities decreased from the year-ago quarter. Dealer trading and derivatives income declined by $17 million from the year-ago quarter due largely to a $27 million increase in the provision for losses related to customer derivatives. This decline was offset by a $9 million improvement in income from other investments due to changes in the fair values of certain commercial mortgage-backed securities recorded in the year-ago quarter.  78    Table of Contents  Figure 14.

Noninterest expense for the first quarter of 2009 was adversely affected by an intangible assets impairment charge of $196 million. Excluding this charge, noninterest expense for the current quarter was up $54 million, or 7%, from the year-ago quarter. As shown in Figure 15, personnel expense increased by $3 million while nonpersonnel expense rose by $51 million, reflecting increases of $26 million in costs associated with OREO, including write-downs and losses on sales, and various other expense categories.

The following discussion explains the composition of certain elements of our noninterest expense and the factors that caused those elements to change.    Personnel. As shown in Figure 16, personnel expense, the largest category of our noninterest expense, increased by $3 million, or .8%, from the first quarter of 2009. The increase was due primarily to a rise in stock-based compensation and higher accruals for incentive compensation. The increases were offset in part by lower costs associated with salaries, employee benefits and severance, resulting from a 10% reduction in the number of average full-time equivalent employees. As previously reported, we amended our pension plans to freeze all benefit accruals as of December 2009. For more information related to our pension plans, see Note 11 (“Employee Benefits”). 79    Table of Contents  Figure 16.

During the first quarter of 2009, we determined that the estimated fair value of our National Banking reporting unit was less than the carrying amount. As a result, we recorded a noncash accounting charge of $223 million, $27 million of which relates to the discontinued operations of Austin. With this charge, we have written off all of the goodwill that had been assigned to our National Banking reporting unit.     Operating lease expense. The decrease in operating lease expense compared to the year-ago quarter is attributable to a lower volume of activity in the Equipment Finance line of business. Income related to the rental of leased equipment is presented in Figure 11 as “operating lease income.”     Professional fees. The increase in professional fees compared to the first three months of 2009 is due to increased collection efforts on loans, business services and other corporate initiatives.     Corporate-wide efficiency initiative. In late 2008, we began a corporate-wide initiative designed to build a consistently superior experience for our clients, simplify processes, improve speed to market, and enhance our ability to seize growth and profit opportunities. As of March 31, 2010, we have implemented $191 million of the targeted run-rate savings toward our goal of achieving $300 million to $375 million by the end of 2012. Over the past two years, we have been exiting certain noncore businesses, such as retail marine and education lending, and in February 2009, we completed the implementation of new teller platform technology throughout our branches. As a result of these and other efforts, over the last two years, we have reduced our workforce by more than 2,600 average full-time equivalent employees.     Income taxes  We recorded a tax benefit from continuing operations of $82 million for the first quarter 2010, compared to $347 million for fourth quarter 2009 and $238 million for first quarter 2009.  The tax benefit recorded is largely attributable to the continuation of an uncertain economic environment. During the first quarter of 2009, our results from continuing operations included a $196 million charge for the impairment of intangible assets, of which $110 million is not deductible for tax purposes.  In the ordinary course of business, we enter into certain types of lease financing transactions that result in tax deductions. The IRS has completed audits of our income tax returns for a number of prior years and has disallowed the tax deductions taken in connection with these transactions. We have settled all leveraged lease financing tax issues with the IRS without incurring any additional tax or interest liability. During the fourth quarter of 2009, we recorded a $106 million credit to income taxes, due primarily to the settlement of IRS audits for the tax years 1997-2006. This credit included a final adjustment of $80 million related to the resolution of certain lease financing tax issues.  Our federal tax (benefit) expense differs from the amount that would be calculated using the federal statutory tax rate, primarily because we generate income from investments in tax-advantaged assets, such as corporate-owned life insurance, earn credits associated with investments in low-income housing projects, and make periodic adjustments to our tax reserves.  Additional information pertaining to the contested lease financing transactions, the related charges and the settlement, as well as how our tax (benefit) expense and the resulting effective tax rates were derived are included in Note 18 (“Income Taxes”) on page 117 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders.  80    Table of Contents     Financial Condition    Loans and loans held for sale At March 31, 2010, total loans outstanding from continuing operations were $55.9 billion, compared to $58.8 billion at December 31, 2009 and $70.0 billion at March 31, 2009. Loans related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business, which are excluded from total loans at March 31, 2010, December 31, 2009, and March 31, 2009, totaled $6.0 billion, $3.5 billion, and $3.7 billion, respectively. The decrease in our loans from continuing operations over the past twelve months reflects reductions in most of our portfolios, with the largest decline experienced in the commercial portfolio. For more information on balance sheet carrying value, see Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the headings “Loans” and “Loans Held for Sale” on page 81 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders.     Commercial loan portfolio  Commercial loans outstanding decreased by $12.8 billion, or 24%, since March 31, 2009, as a result of continued soft demand for credit due to the uncertain economic conditions, paydowns on our portfolios as commercial clients continue to de-leverage, net charge-offs and the run-off in our exit loan portfolio.     Commercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans for both our owner and nonowner-occupied properties constitute one of the largest segments of our commercial loan portfolio. At March 31, 2010, our commercial real estate portfolio included mortgage loans of $10.5 billion and construction loans of $4.0 billion. The average mortgage loan originated during the first quarter of 2010 was $3 million, and our largest mortgage loan at March 31, 2010, had a balance of $123 million. At March 31, 2010, our average construction loan commitment was $4 million. Our largest construction loan commitment was $65 million, $57 million of which was outstanding.  Our commercial real estate lending business is conducted through two primary sources: our 14-state banking franchise, and Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services, a national line of business that cultivates relationships both within and beyond the branch system. This line of business deals exclusively with nonowner-occupied properties (generally properties for which at least 50% of the debt service is provided by rental income from nonaffiliated third parties) and accounted for approximately 61% of our average commercial real estate loans during the first quarter of 2010. Our commercial real estate business generally focuses on larger real estate developers and, as shown in Figure 17, is diversified by both industry type and geographic location of the underlying collateral. Figure 17 includes commercial mortgage and construction loans in both the Community Banking and National Banking groups.  81    Table of Contents  Figure 17.

As previously reported, we undertook a process to reduce our exposure in the residential properties segment of our construction loan portfolio through the sale of certain loans by ceasing lending to homebuilders and the transfer of a net $384 million of commercial real estate loans from the held-to-maturity portfolio to the held-for-sale portfolio in June 2008. The balance of this portfolio has been reduced to $40 million at March 31, 2010, primarily as a result of cash proceeds from loan sales, transfers to OREO, and both realized and unrealized losses. We will continue to pursue the sale or foreclosure of the remaining loans, all of which are on nonperforming status.  The secondary market for income property loans has been severely constrained throughout 2009 and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. In prior years, we have not provided permanent financing for our clients upon the completion of their construction projects; permanent financing had been provided by the commercial mortgage-backed securities market or other lenders. With other sources of permanent commercial mortgage financing constrained, we are currently providing interim financing for certain of our relationship clients upon completion of their commercial real estate construction projects. During 2009 and the first quarter of 2010, we extended the maturities, for up to five years, of certain existing loans to commercial real estate relationship clients with projects at or near completion. We applied normal customary underwriting standards to these longer-term extensions and generally received market rates of interest and additional fees, offering permanent market proxy fixed rates where appropriate, to mitigate the potential impact of rising interest rates. In cases where the terms were at less than normal market rates for similar lending arrangements, we have transferred these loans to the Asset Recovery Group for resolution. In the first quarter of 2010, there were $23 million new restructured loans included in nonperforming loans.  As shown in Figure 17, at March 31, 2010, 71% of our commercial real estate loans were for nonowner-occupied properties. Approximately 35% of these loans are construction loans. Typically, these properties are not fully leased at the origination of the loan. The borrower relies upon additional leasing through the life of the loan to provide the cash flow necessary to support debt service payments. Uncertain economic conditions generally slow the execution of new leases and may also lead to the turnover of existing leases, driving rental rates down. As a result, we expect that vacancy rates for retail, office and industrial space will remain elevated and may continue to rise through 2010. According to the most recent Property &  82    Table of Contents  Portfolio Research, a third-party forecaster, vacancy rates for office and retail space were 19.7% and 19.2%, respectively, at December 31, 2009, up 300 basis points and 460 basis points, respectively, from December 31, 2008. This data suggests continued softening in commercial real estate, with vacancy rising and rents falling over the next few months, although the pace of decline is moderating. If the upward trend in vacancies continues, any resulting effect would likely be most noticeable in the nonowner-occupied properties segment of our commercial real estate loan portfolio, particularly in the retail properties and office buildings components, which comprise 26% of our commercial real estate loans.  Commercial real estate values have also fallen as a result of the above factors. Values peaked in the fall of 2007, having experienced increases of approximately 30% since 2005 and 90% since 2001. According to Moody’s Real Estate Analytics, LLC Commercial Property Price Index, at January 31, 2010, commercial real estate values were down 40% from their peak. The majority of economists, however, still believe the overall decline in values could reach approximately 50%. If the factors described above result in further weakening in the fundamentals underlying the commercial real estate market (i.e., vacancy rates, the stability of rental income and asset values), and lead to reduced cash flow to support debt service payments, our ability to collect such payments and the strength of our commercial real estate loan portfolio could be adversely affected.     Commercial lease financing. We conduct financing arrangements through our Equipment Finance line of business and have both the scale and array of products to compete in the equipment lease financing business. Commercial lease financing receivables represented 18% of commercial loans at March 31, 2010, and 16% at March 31, 2009. As previously reported, we ceased conducting business in both the commercial vehicle and office equipment leasing markets during the second half of 2009.     Consumer loan portfolio  Consumer loans outstanding decreased by $1.3 billion, or 7%, from one year ago. As shown in Figure 34 in the “Credit risk management” section, the majority of the reduction came from our exit loan portfolio. Most of the decrease is attributable to the marine segment. The home equity portfolio is the largest segment of our consumer loan portfolio. A significant amount of this portfolio (93% at March 31, 2010) is derived primarily from the Regional Banking line of business within our Community Banking group. The remainder of the portfolio, which has been in an exit mode since the fourth quarter of 2007, was originated from the Consumer Finance line of business and is now included in Other Segments. Home equity loans within the Community Banking group decreased by $389 million, or less than 4%, over the past twelve months. Figure 18 summarizes our home equity loan portfolio by source at the end of the last five quarters, as well as certain asset quality statistics and yields on the portfolio as a whole. Figure 18.

As previously reported, we expect the level of our consumer loan portfolio to decrease in the future as a result of our actions taken to exit low-return, indirect businesses of dealer-originated home improvement lending, and retail and floor-plan lending for marine and recreational vehicle products, and discontinuing the education lending business. We ceased originating new education loans effective December 5, 2009; however, we continue to service existing education loans as part of the exit portfolios in Other Segments. 83    Table of Contents     Loans held for sale  As shown in Note 5 (“Loans and Loans Held for Sale”), our loans held for sale increased to $556 million at March 31, 2010 from $443 million at December 31, 2009 and totaled $671 million at March 31, 2009. Loans held for sale related to the discontinued operations of the education lending business, which are excluded from total loans held for sale at March 31, 2010, December 31, 2009 and March 31, 2009, totaled $246 million, $434 million, and $453 million, respectively.  At March 31, 2010, loans held for sale included $265 million of commercial mortgage and $92 million of residential mortgage loans.  During the first quarter of 2010, we recorded net unrealized losses of $5 million and net realized gains of $6 million on our loans held for sale portfolio. These net gains and losses are reported in “net gains (losses) from loan sales” on the income statement.  The increase in total loans related to the education lending discontinued operations of $2.6 billion from December 31, 2009 to March 31, 2010 was due to our adoption of new consolidation accounting guidance that required us to consolidate our ten outstanding education loan securitization trusts as of January 1, 2010.     Loan sales  As market conditions allow, we continue to utilize alternative funding sources like loan sales to support our loan origination capabilities. In addition, certain acquisitions completed in past years have improved our ability to originate and sell new loans, and to service loans originated by others, especially in commercial real estate.  As shown in Figure 19, during the first quarter of 2010, we sold $158 million of commercial real estate loans, $328 million of residential real estate loans and $19 million of commercial loans. Most of these sales came from the held-for-sale portfolio. Additionally, we sold $333 million of education loans (included in “discontinued assets” on the balance sheet), which are excluded from Figure 19. See Note 16 (“Discontinued Operations”) for additional information related to education lending.  Among the factors that we consider in determining which loans to sell are:     ¨   whether particular lending businesses meet established performance standards or fit with our relationship banking strategy;      ¨   our A/LM needs;      ¨   the cost of alternative funding sources;      ¨   the level of credit risk;      ¨   capital requirements; and      ¨   market conditions and pricing.    84    Table of Contents  Figure 19 summarizes our loan sales for the first three months of 2010 and all of 2009.

(b)   We adopted new accounting guidance on January 1, 2010, which required us to consolidate our education loan securitization trusts and resulted in the addition of $2.6 billion of education loans at fair value which are included in “discontinued assets” on the balance sheet.   In the event of default by a borrower, we are subject to recourse with respect to approximately $723 million of the $123.4 billion of loans administered or serviced at March 31, 2010. Additional information about this recourse arrangement is included in Note 13 (“Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Guarantees”) under the heading “Recourse agreement with FNMA.”  We derive income from several sources when retaining the right to administer or service loans that are sold. We earn noninterest income (recorded as “other income”) from fees for servicing or administering loans. This fee income is reduced by the amortization of related servicing assets. In addition, we earn interest income from investing funds generated by escrow deposits collected in connection with the servicing of commercial real estate loans.     Securities Our securities portfolio totaled $16.6 billion at March 31, 2010, compared to $16.7 billion at December 31, 2009, and $8.4 billion at March 31, 2009. At each of these dates, most of our securities consisted of securities available for sale, with the remainder consisting of held-to-maturity securities of less than $30 million. 85    Table of Contents     Securities available for sale. The majority of our securities available-for-sale portfolio consists of CMOs, which are debt securities secured by a pool of mortgages or mortgage-backed securities. CMOs generate interest income and serve as collateral to support certain pledging agreements. At March 31, 2010, we had $16.3 billion invested in CMOs and other mortgage-backed securities in the available-for-sale portfolio, compared to $16.4 billion at December 31, 2009, and $8.2 billion at March 31, 2009. As shown in Figure 21, all of our mortgage-backed securities are issued by government-sponsored enterprises or GNMA, and are traded in highly liquid secondary markets and recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. See Note 21 (“Fair Value Measurements”) under the heading “Qualitative Disclosures of Valuation Techniques” on page 128 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders. Figure 21. Mortgage-Backed Securities by Issuer                                     March 31,     December 31,     March 31,     in millions   2010     2009     2009           FHLMC   $ 7,590     $ 7,485     $ 4,642     FNMA     4,322       4,433       3,205     GNMA     4,427       4,516       359         Total   $ 16,339     $ 16,434     $ 8,206                                                             During the first three months of 2010, we had net gains of $91 million from CMOs and other mortgage-backed securities, all of which were unrealized. The net unrealized gains resulted from a decrease in market interest rates and were recorded in the AOCI component of shareholders’ equity. We continue to maintain a moderate asset-sensitive exposure to near-term changes in interest rates. We periodically evaluate our securities available-for-sale portfolio in light of established A/LM objectives, changing market conditions that could affect the profitability of the portfolio, and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed. These evaluations may cause us to take steps to improve our overall balance sheet positioning. In addition, the size and composition of our securities available-for-sale portfolio could vary with our needs for liquidity and the extent to which we are required (or elect) to hold these assets as collateral to secure public funds and trust deposits. Although we generally use debt securities for this purpose, other assets, such as securities purchased under resale agreements or letters of credit, are used occasionally when they provide a lower cost of collateral or more favorable risk profiles. During the first quarter of 2010, our investing activities continue to complement other balance sheet developments and provide for our ongoing liquidity management needs. We purchased $601 million in CMOs, but had maturities and cash flows of $786 million. The purchases were in CMOs issued by government-sponsored entities. We are able to either pledge these securities to the Federal Reserve or Federal Home Loan Bank for secured borrowing arrangements, sell them or use them in connection with repurchase agreements should alternate sources of liquidity be required in the future. 86    Table of Contents  Figure 22 shows the composition, yields and remaining maturities of our securities available for sale.

(b)   Excludes $8 million of securities at March 31, 2010, that have no stated yield.      Other investments Principal investments ¾ investments in equity and mezzanine instruments made by our Principal Investing unit ¾ represented 69% of other investments at March 31, 2010. They include direct investments (investments made in a particular company) as well as indirect investments (investments made through funds that include other investors). Principal investments are predominantly made in privately held companies and are carried at fair value ($1.1 billion at March 31, 2010, $1.0 billion at December 31, 2009, and $932 million at March 31, 2009).  In addition to principal investments, “other investments” include other equity and mezzanine instruments, such as certain real estate-related investments that are carried at fair value, as well as other types of investments that generally are carried at cost.  Most of our other investments are not traded on an active market. We determine the fair value at which these investments should be recorded based on the nature of the specific investment and all available relevant information. Among other things, our review may encompass such factors as the issuer’s past financial performance and future potential, the values of public companies in comparable businesses, the risks associated with the particular business or investment type, current market conditions, the nature and duration of resale restrictions, the issuer’s payment history, our knowledge of the industry and third party data. During the first three months of 2010, net gains from our principal investing activities (including results attributable to noncontrolling interests) totaled $37 million, which includes $53 million of net unrealized gains. These net gains are recorded as “net gains (losses) from principal investing” on the income statement.  88    Table of Contents     Deposits and other sources of funds  Domestic deposits are our primary source of funding. During the first three months of 2010, these deposits averaged $64.6 billion and represented 81% of the funds we used to support loans and other earning assets, compared to $64.0 billion and 75% during the same quarter in 2009. The composition of our deposits is shown in Figure 9 in the section entitled “Net interest income.”  The increase in average domestic deposits compared to the first quarter of 2009 was due to growth in NOW and money market deposit accounts and noninterest-bearing deposits, offset in part by a decline in certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more and other time deposits. The mix of deposits has changed reflecting strong growth in noninterest-bearing deposits and NOW accounts, as higher-costing certificates of deposit originated in prior years mature and reprice to current market rates. In the first three months of 2010, we realized additional benefits from the repricing of maturing certificates of deposit.  Wholesale funds, consisting of deposits in our foreign office and short-term borrowings, averaged $3.0 billion during the first quarter of 2010, compared to $7.2 billion during the year-ago quarter. The reduction from the first quarter of 2009 resulted from a $566 million decrease in foreign office deposits, and a $3.9 billion decline in bank notes and other short-term borrowings, which was offset by a $245 million increase in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. During the first quarter of 2010 and 2009, we reduced our reliance on wholesale funding, which was facilitated by improved liquidity for borrowers in the commercial paper market and a reduction in the demand for commercial lines of credit.  Substantially all of our domestic deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. Accordingly, we are subject to deposit insurance premium assessments by the FDIC. On November 17, 2009, the FDIC published a final rule to announce an amended DIF restoration plan requiring depository institutions, such as KeyBank, to prepay, on December 30, 2009, their estimated quarterly risk-based assessments for the third and fourth quarters of 2009 and for all of 2010, 2011 and 2012. On that date, KeyBank paid the FDIC $539 million to cover the insurance assessments for those time periods. For the quarter ended March 31, 2010, our insurance assessment was $32 million and at the end of the quarter we had $471 million of prepaid insurance assessments recorded on our balance sheet.  The FDIC announced on April 13, 2010 its Board of Directors’ approval of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Assessments. The proposed revisions to the assessment system would be applicable to large institutions with assets of over $10 billion in assets, such as KeyBank. According to the FDIC, the proposed revisions would better capture risk at the time an institution assumes the risk, better differentiate institutions during periods of good economic and banking conditions based on how they would fare during periods of stress or economic downturns, and would also take into account the losses that the FDIC may incur if an institution fails. The proposal was published in the Federal Register on May 3, 2010, and the comment period for the proposal expires on July 2, 2010.  89    Table of Contents     Capital  At March 31, 2010, our shareholders’ equity was $10.6 billion, down $22 million from December 31, 2009. Following are certain factors that contributed to the change in our shareholders’ equity. For other factors that contributed to the change, see the statement of changes in equity.     Adoption of new accounting guidance  Effective January 1, 2010, we adopted new consolidation accounting guidance which required us to consolidate our education loan securitization trusts (classified as discontinued assets and liabilities), thereby adding $2.8 billion in assets and liabilities to our balance sheet. As a result of adopting this new guidance, we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment (after tax) of $45 million to beginning retained earnings on January 1, 2010.     Dividends  During the first quarter, we made a quarterly dividend payment of $31 million to the U.S. Treasury on our Series B Preferred Stock as a participant in the U.S. Treasury’s CPP.  On January 15, 2010, we made a quarterly dividend payment of $1.9375 per share or $6 million, on our Series A Preferred Stock to holders of record on January 14, 2010.  Additionally, on March 15, 2010, we made a quarterly dividend payment of $.01 per share, or $9 million, on our Common Shares to holders of record on March 2, 2010.     Common shares outstanding  Our common shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol KEY.

At March 31, 2010, we had 67.3 million treasury shares, compared to 67.8 million treasury shares at December 31, 2009 and 85.5 million at March 31, 2010. During the first quarter of 2010, we reissued  90    Table of Contents  treasury shares in conjunction with our employee benefit plans. Going forward we expect to reissue treasury shares as needed in connection with stock-based compensation awards and for other corporate purposes.  We repurchase common shares periodically in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions under a repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors. The program does not have an expiration date, and we have outstanding Board authority to repurchase 14.0 million shares. We did not repurchase any common shares during the first quarter of 2010 or 2009. Further, in accordance with the terms of our participation in the CPP, until the earlier of three years after the issuance of, or such time as the U.S. Treasury no longer holds, any Series B Preferred Stock issued by us under that program, we will not be able to repurchase any of our common shares without the approval of the U.S. Treasury, subject to certain limited exceptions (e.g., for purchases in connection with benefit plans).     Capital availability and management  As a result of market disruptions in previous periods, the availability of capital (principally to financial services companies) remains restricted. While we have been successful in raising additional capital, lower market prices per share have increased the dilution of our per common share results. We cannot predict when or if the markets will return to more favorable conditions.  We determine how capital is to be strategically allocated among our businesses to maximize returns and strengthen core relationship businesses. In that regard, we will continue to emphasize our relationship strategy.     Capital adequacy  Capital adequacy is an important indicator of financial stability and performance. All of our capital ratios remain strong at March 31, 2010. This, along with our improved liquidity, positions us well to weather the current credit cycle and to continue to serve our clients’ needs. Our Key shareholders’ equity to assets ratio was 11.17% at March 31, 2010, compared to 11.43% at December 31, 2009 and 10.19% at March 31, 2009. Our tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 7.37% at March 31, 2010, compared to 7.56% at December 31, 2009 and 6.06% at March 31, 2009.  Banking industry regulators prescribe minimum capital ratios for bank holding companies and their banking subsidiaries. See Note 15 (“Shareholders’ Equity”), which begins on page 107 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders.  Risk-based capital guidelines require a minimum level of capital as a percent of “risk-weighted assets.” Risk-weighted assets consist of total assets plus certain off-balance sheet items, subject to adjustment for predefined credit risk factors. Currently, banks and bank holding companies must maintain, at a minimum, Tier 1 capital as a percent of risk-weighted assets of 4.00% and total capital as a percent of risk-weighted assets of 8.00%. As of March 31, 2010, our Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio increased 17 basis points from the fourth quarter 2009 to 12.92%, and our total risk-based capital ratio increased 12 basis points from the fourth quarter 2009 to 17.07%.  Another indicator of capital adequacy, the leverage ratio, is defined as Tier 1 capital as a percentage of average quarterly tangible assets. Leverage ratio requirements vary with the condition of the financial institution. Bank holding companies that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the Federal Reserve’s risk-adjusted measure for market risk — as we have — must maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 3.00%. All other bank holding companies must maintain a minimum ratio of 4.00%. As of March 31, 2010, our leverage ratio declined by 12 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2009 to 11.60%.  Traditionally, the banking regulators have assessed bank and bank holding company capital adequacy based on both the amount and composition of capital, the calculation of which is prescribed in federal banking regulations. As a result of the SCAP, the Federal Reserve has intensified its assessment of capital  91    Table of Contents  adequacy on a component of Tier 1 capital, known as Tier 1 common equity. Because the Federal Reserve has long indicated that voting common shareholders’ equity (essentially Tier 1 capital less preferred stock, qualifying capital securities and noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries) generally should be the dominant element in Tier 1 capital, such a focus is consistent with existing capital adequacy guidelines and does not imply a new or ongoing capital standard. Because Tier 1 common equity is neither formally defined by GAAP nor prescribed in amount by federal banking regulations, this measure is considered to be a non-GAAP financial measure. Figure 5 in the “Highlights of Our Performance” section reconciles Key shareholders’ equity, the GAAP performance measure, to Tier 1 common equity, the corresponding non-GAAP measure. Our Tier 1 common equity ratio was 7.51% at March 31, 2010, compared to 7.50% at December 31, 2009 and 5.62% at March 31, 2009.  At March 31, 2010, we had a net deferred tax asset of $651 million compared to $577 million at December 31, 2009 and none at March 31, 2009. In recent years, we had been in a net deferred tax liability position. Generally, for risk-based capital purposes, deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income are limited to the lesser of: (i) the amount of deferred tax assets that a financial institution expects to realize within one year of the calendar quarter-end date, based on its projected future taxable income for the year, or (ii) 10% of the amount of an institution’s Tier 1 capital. Based on these restrictions, at March 31, 2010, $651 million compared to $514 million at December 31, 2009 and none at March 31, 2009 of our net deferred tax asset were deducted from Tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets. We anticipate that the amount of our net deferred tax asset disallowed for risk-based capital purposes will increase in coming quarters until we begin to generate taxable income. This will continue to adversely impact our risk-based capital ratios.

The FDIC’s interim rule published in the Federal Register on April 19, 2010 extends the TAG program from July 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010. KeyBank is currently a participant in the TAG program, but as of April 29, 2010, KeyBank elected not to participate in the TAG program extension. We anticipate a certain amount of deposit run-off upon the expiration of the Transaction Account Guarantee. We have established a liquidity buffer in anticipation of the expiration and, as a result, do not expect it to have a significant effect on liquidity.  94    Table of Contents     Risk Management     Overview  Like all financial services companies, we engage in business activities and assume the related risks. The most significant risks we face are credit, liquidity, market, compliance, operational, strategic and reputation risks. We must properly and effectively identify, assess, measure, monitor, control and report such risks across the entire enterprise to maintain safety and soundness and maximize profitability. Certain of these risks are defined and discussed in greater detail in the remainder of this section.  During 2009, our management team reevaluated our ERM capabilities, and enhanced our ERM Program. Our ERM Committee, which consists of the Chief Executive Officer and his direct reports, is responsible for managing risk and ensuring that the corporate risk profile is managed in a manner consistent with our risk appetite. The Program encompasses our risk philosophy, policy, framework and governance structure for the management of risks across the entire company. The ERM Committee reports to the Risk Management Committee of our Board of Directors. The Board of Directors approves the ERM Program, as well as the risk appetite and corporate risk tolerances for major risk categories. We continue to enhance our ERM Program and related practices and to use a risk-adjusted capital framework to manage risks. This framework is approved and managed by the ERM Committee.  Our Board of Directors serves in an oversight capacity with the objective of managing our enterprise-wide risks in a manner that is effective, balanced and adds value for the shareholders. The Board inquires about risk practices, reviews the portfolio of risks, compares actual risks to the risk appetite and tolerances, and receives regular reports about significant risks — both actual and emerging. To assist in these efforts, the Board has delegated primary oversight responsibility for risk to the Audit Committee and Risk Management Committee.  The Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for internal audit; financial reporting; compliance risk and legal matters; the implementation, management and evaluation of operational risk and controls; information security and fraud risk; and evaluating the qualifications and independence of the independent auditors. The Audit Committee discusses policies related to risk assessment and risk management and the processes related to risk review and compliance.  The Risk Management Committee has responsibility for overseeing the management of credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk (including the actions taken to mitigate these risks), as well as reputational and strategic risks relating to the foregoing. The Risk Management Committee also oversees the maintenance of appropriate regulatory and economic capital. The Risk Management Committee reviews the ERM reports and, in conjunction with the Audit Committee, annually reviews reports of material changes to the Operational Risk Committee and Compliance Risk Committee charters, and annually approves any material changes to the charter of the ERM Committee and other subordinate risk committees.  The Audit and Risk Management Committees meet jointly, as appropriate, to discuss matters that relate to each committee’s responsibilities. In addition to regularly scheduled bi-monthly meetings, the Audit Committee convenes to discuss the content of our financial disclosures and quarterly earnings releases. Committee chairpersons routinely meet with management during interim months to plan agendas for upcoming meetings and to discuss emerging trends and events that have transpired since the preceding meeting. All members of the Board receive formal reports designed to keep them abreast of significant developments during the interim months.  Federal banking regulators are reemphasizing with financial institutions the importance of relating capital management strategy to the level of risk at each institution. We believe our internal risk management processes help us achieve and maintain capital levels that are commensurate with our business activities and risks, and comport with regulatory expectations.  95    Table of Contents     Market risk management  The values of some financial instruments vary not only with changes in market interest rates but also with changes in foreign exchange rates. Financial instruments also are susceptible to factors influencing valuations in the equity securities markets and other market-driven rates or prices. For example, the value of a fixed-rate bond will decline if market interest rates increase. Similarly, the value of the U.S. dollar regularly fluctuates in relation to other currencies. The holder of a financial instrument faces “market risk” when the value of the instrument is tied to such external factors. Most of our market risk is derived from interest rate fluctuations.     Interest rate risk management  Interest rate risk, which is inherent in the banking industry, is measured by the potential for fluctuations in net interest income and the economic value of equity. Such fluctuations may result from changes in interest rates, and differences in the repricing and maturity characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. To minimize the volatility of net interest income and the economic value of equity, we manage exposure to interest rate risk in accordance with policy limits established by the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors.  Interest rate risk positions can be influenced by a number of factors other than changes in market interest rates, including economic conditions, the competitive environment within our markets, and balance sheet positioning that arises out of consumer preferences for specific loan and deposit products. The primary components of interest rate risk exposure consist of basis risk, gap risk, yield curve risk and option risk.     ¨    We face “basis risk” when floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities reprice at the same time, but in response to different market factors or indices. Under those circumstances, even if equal amounts of assets and liabilities are repricing, interest expense and interest income may not change by the same amount.      ¨    “Gap risk” occurs if interest-bearing liabilities and the interest-earning assets they fund (for example, deposits used to fund loans) do not mature or reprice at the same time.      ¨    “Yield curve risk” exists when short-term and long-term interest rates change by different amounts. For example, when U.S. Treasury and other term rates decline, the rates on automobile loans also will decline, but the cost of money market deposits and short-term borrowings may remain elevated.      ¨   A financial instrument presents “option risk” when one party to the instrument can take advantage of changes in interest rates without penalty. For example, when interest rates decline, borrowers may choose to prepay fixed-rate loans by refinancing at a lower rate. Such a prepayment gives us a return on our investment (the principal plus some interest), but unless there is a prepayment penalty, that return may not be as high as the return that would have been generated had payments been received over the original term of the loan. Deposits that can be withdrawn on demand also present option risk.       Net interest income simulation analysis. The primary tool we use to measure our interest rate risk is simulation analysis. For purposes of this analysis, we estimate our net interest income based on the composition of our on- and off-balance sheet positions, and the current interest rate environment. The simulation assumes that changes in our on- and off-balance sheet positions will reflect recent product trends, targets established by the ALCO Committee, and consensus economic forecasts.  Typically, the amount of net interest income at risk is measured by simulating the change in net interest income that would occur if the federal funds target rate were to gradually increase or decrease by 200 basis points over the next twelve months, and term rates were to move in a similar fashion. In light of the low interest rate environment, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008, we modified the standard rate scenario of a gradual decrease of 200 basis points over twelve months to a gradual decrease of 25 basis points over two months with no change over the following ten months. After calculating the amount of net interest income at  96    Table of Contents  risk, we compare that amount with the base case of an unchanged interest rate environment. The analysis also considers sensitivity to changes in a number of other variables, including other market interest rates and deposit mix. In addition, we assess the potential effect of different shapes in the yield curve (the yield curve depicts the relationship between the yield on a particular type of security and its term to maturity), including a sustained flat yield curve, an inverted slope yield curve and changes in credit spreads. We also perform stress tests to measure the effect on net interest income exposure to an immediate change in market interest rates, as well as changes in assumptions related to the pricing of deposits without contractual maturities, prepayments on loans and securities, other loan and deposit balance changes, changes in lending spreads and wholesale funding and capital management activities.  Simulation analysis produces only a sophisticated estimate of interest rate exposure based on assumptions and judgments related to balance sheet growth, customer behavior, new products, new business volume, product pricing, market interest rate behavior and anticipated hedging activities. We tailor the assumptions to the specific interest rate environment and yield curve shape being modeled, and validate those assumptions on a regular basis. Our simulations are performed with the assumption that interest rate risk positions will be actively managed through the use of on- and off balance sheet financial instruments to achieve the desired risk profile. Actual results may differ from those derived in simulation analysis due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes, actual hedging strategies employed, changes in balance sheet composition, and repercussions from unanticipated or unknown events.  Figure 26 presents the results of the simulation analysis at March 31, 2010 and 2009. At March 31, 2010, our simulated exposure to a change in short-term interest rates was moderately asset sensitive. ALCO policy limits for risk management call for corrective measures if simulation modeling demonstrates that a gradual increase or decrease in short-term interest rates over the next twelve months would adversely affect net interest income over the same period by more than 4%. As shown in Figure 26, we are operating within these limits.  Figure 26. Simulated Change in Net Interest Income                            March 31, 2010                           Basis point change assumption (short-term rates)     -25       +200       ALCO policy limits     -4.00  %     -4.00   %       Interest rate risk assessment     -1.09  %     +4.16   %                                   March 31, 2009                           Basis point change assumption (short-term rates)     -25       +200       ALCO policy limits     -2.00  %     -2.00   %       Interest rate risk assessment     -1.11  %     +2.55   %         As interest rates declined throughout 2008 and have remained at low levels since that time, we have gradually shifted from a liability-sensitive position to an asset-sensitive position as a result of increased client demand for fixed-rate certificates of deposit, balance growth in transaction deposits, declines in loan balances, a number of capital-raising transactions and the active management decision to delay the renewal of maturing derivative hedges until the economy improves further and until additional observations are gathered to support the evolution of assumptions for competitive and client behavior in the current environment. Our current interest rate risk position could fluctuate to higher or lower levels of risk depending on the actual volume, mix and maturity of loan and deposit flows, and the execution of hedges. Our strategies for using excess funds generated from the strong deposit growth and the recent decline in loan balances will also affect our interest rate risk positioning. We proactively evaluate additional hedging activities based on our decisions to adjust the interest rate risk profile as changes occur to the configuration of the balance sheet and the outlook for the economy. Management may execute hedges that will change the results of future reported simulation analysis.  The results of additional simulation analysis that either employ a 6- to 12-month delay in interest rate increases, the application of market implied forward interest rates, the use of a 100 basis point rate increase over twelve months or several other yield curve shapes indicate the most likely improvement in net interest  97    Table of Contents  income over the next twelve months could be significantly less than the policy simulation results in Figure 26. Net interest income improvements are highly dependent on the timing, magnitude and path of interest rate increases. Separately, the results of sensitivity tests of deposit re-pricing assumptions, lending spreads, transaction account balances and other behavioral assumptions and model inputs indicates that 1.00% to 2.00% of the improvement in net interest income in the policy simulation analysis results listed in Figure 26 could be diminished if actual behavior is different than modeled.  We also conduct simulations that measure the effect of changes in market interest rates in the second year of a two-year horizon. These simulations are conducted in a manner similar to those based on a twelve-month horizon. To capture longer-term exposures, we simulate changes to the EVE as discussed in the following section.     Economic value of equity modeling. EVE complements net interest income simulation analysis since it estimates risk exposure beyond twelve- and twenty-four month horizons. EVE measures the extent to which the economic values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates. EVE is calculated by subjecting the balance sheet to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates, and measuring the resulting change in the values of assets and liabilities. Under the current level of market interest rates, the calculation of EVE under an immediate 200 basis point decrease in interest rates results in certain interest rates declining to zero and a less than 200 basis point decrease in certain yield curve term points. This analysis is highly dependent upon assumptions applied to assets and liabilities with noncontractual maturities. Those assumptions are based on historical behaviors, as well as our expectations. We take corrective measures if this analysis indicates that our EVE will decrease by more than 15% in response to an immediate 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates. We are operating within these guidelines.     Management of interest rate exposure. We use the results of our various interest rate risk analyses to formulate A/LM strategies to achieve the desired risk profile within the parameters of our capital and liquidity guidelines. Specifically, we manage interest rate risk positions by purchasing securities, issuing term debt with floating or fixed interest rates, and using derivatives — predominantly in the form of interest rate swaps, which modify the interest rate characteristics of certain assets and liabilities.  Figure 27 shows all swap positions which we hold for A/LM purposes. These positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreed-upon amounts of assets and liabilities (i.e., notional amounts) to another interest rate index. For example, fixed-rate debt is converted to a floating rate through a “receive fixed/pay variable” interest rate swap. The volume, maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader A/LM objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged. For more information about how we use interest rate swaps to manage our balance sheet, see Note 14 (“Derivatives and Hedging Activities”).  Figure 27.

We use a VAR simulation model to measure the potential adverse effect of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices and credit spreads on the fair value of this portfolio. Using two years of historical information, the model estimates the maximum potential one-day loss with a 95% confidence level. Statistically, this means that losses will exceed VAR, on average, five out of 100 trading days, or three to four times each quarter.  We manage exposure to market risk in accordance with VAR limits for trading activity that have been approved by the Risk Capital Committee whose market risk management responsibilities are now performed by the Market Risk Committee established as part of Key’s ERM Program. At March 31, 2010, the aggregate one-day trading limit set by the committee was $6.9 million. We are operating within these constraints. During the first quarter of 2010, our aggregate daily average, minimum and maximum VAR amounts were $2.0 million, $1.6 million and $2.5 million, respectively. During the same period one year ago, our aggregate daily average, minimum and maximum VAR amounts were $3.0 million, $2.6 million and $3.6 million, respectively.  In addition to comparing VAR exposure against limits on a daily basis, we monitor loss limits, use sensitivity measures and conduct stress tests. We report our market risk exposure to the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors.     Liquidity risk management  We define “liquidity” as the ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals, meet contractual obligations, and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences. Liquidity management involves maintaining sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions.     Governance structure  We manage liquidity for all of our affiliates on an integrated basis. This approach considers the unique funding sources available to each entity, as well as each entity’s capacity to manage through adverse conditions. It also recognizes that adverse market conditions or other events that could negatively affect the availability or cost of liquidity will affect the access of all affiliates to money and capital market funding.  Oversight of the liquidity risk management process is governed by the Risk Management Committee of the KeyCorp Board of Directors, the KeyBank Board of Directors, the ERM Committee and the ALCO. These groups regularly review various liquidity reports, including liquidity and funding summaries, liquidity trends, peer comparisons, variance analyses, liquidity projections, hypothetical funding erosion stress tests and goal tracking reports. The reviews generate a discussion of positions, trends and directives on liquidity risk and shape a number of the decisions that we make. Whenever liquidity pressures are elevated, we monitor and manage our position more frequently. We meet with individuals within and outside of the company on a daily basis to discuss emerging issues. In addition, we use a variety of daily liquidity reports to monitor the flow of funds.     Sources of liquidity  Our primary sources of funding include customer deposits, wholesale funding and capital. If the cash flows needed to support operating and investing activities are not satisfied by deposit balances, we rely on wholesale funding or liquid assets. Conversely, excess cash generated by operating, investing and deposit-gathering activities may be used to repay outstanding debt or invest in liquid assets. We actively manage liquidity using a variety of nondeposit sources, including short- and long-term debt, and secured borrowings.  99    Table of Contents     Factors affecting liquidity  Our liquidity could be adversely affected by both direct and indirect events. Examples of a direct event would be a downgrade in our public credit ratings by a rating agency. Examples of indirect events (events unrelated to us) that could impact our access to liquidity would be terrorism or war, natural disasters, political events, or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation, mutual fund or hedge fund. Similarly, market speculation, or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources.     Managing liquidity risk  We regularly monitor our funding sources and measure our capacity to obtain funds in a variety of scenarios in an effort to maintain an appropriate mix of available and affordable funding. In the normal course of business, we perform a monthly hypothetical funding erosion stress test for both KeyCorp and KeyBank. As we are in a “heightened monitoring mode,” we are conducting the hypothetical funding erosion stress tests more frequently, and revise assumptions so the stress tests are more strenuous and reflect the changed market environment. Erosion stress tests analyze potential liquidity scenarios under various funding constraints and time periods. Ultimately, they determine the periodic effects that major interruptions would have on our access to funding markets and our ability to fund our normal operations. To compensate for the effect of these assumed liquidity pressures, we consider alternative sources of liquidity and maturities over different time periods to project how funding needs would be managed.  Most credit markets in which we participate and rely upon as sources of funding have been significantly disrupted and highly volatile since July 2007. During the third quarter of 2009, our secured borrowings matured and were not replaced, though we retain the capacity to utilize secured borrowings as a contingent funding source. We continue to reposition our balance sheet to reduce future reliance on wholesale funding and increase our liquid asset portfolio.  We maintain a Contingency Funding Plan that outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis. The Plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions. It also assigns specific roles and responsibilities for effectively managing liquidity through a problem period. As part of that plan, we continue to maintain a balance in our Federal Reserve account, which has reduced our need to obtain funds through various short-term unsecured money market products. This account and the unpledged securities in our investment portfolio provide a buffer to address unexpected short-term liquidity needs. At March 31, 2010, our liquid asset portfolio totaled $11.6 billion, consisting of a $3.6 billion balance at the Federal Reserve and $8.0 billion of high quality liquid securities, which include $7.0 billion unencumbered and $1.0 billion available for pledging at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati. Secured borrowing facilities are available at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland to facilitate short-term liquidity requirements. As of March 31, 2010, our unused secured borrowing capacity was $12.1 billion at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and $3.8 billion at the Federal Home Loan Bank.  During the third quarter of 2009 and continuing into the fourth quarter of 2009, we increased the portion of our earning assets invested in highly liquid, unpledged securities. These securities can be sold or utilized as collateral for secured borrowings at the Federal Home Loan Bank, the repurchase agreement market, or the Federal Reserve. In the first quarter of 2010, we continued to increase the size of our liquid asset portfolio relative to our earning asset position, although the amount of unpledged securities declined slightly.     Long-term liquidity strategy  Our long-term liquidity strategy is to reduce our reliance on wholesale funding. Our Community Banking group supports our client-driven relationship strategy, with the objective of achieving greater reliance on deposit-based funding to reduce our liquidity risk.     Our liquidity position and recent activity  100    Table of Contents  Over the past twelve months, we have increased our liquid asset portfolio, which includes overnight and short-term investments, as well as unencumbered, high quality liquid assets held as insurance against a range of potential liquidity stress scenarios. Liquidity stress scenarios include the loss of access to either unsecured or secured funding sources, as well as draws on unfunded commitments and significant deposit withdrawals.  From time to time, KeyCorp or its principal subsidiary, KeyBank, may seek to retire, repurchase or exchange outstanding debt, capital securities or preferred stock through cash purchase, privately negotiated transactions or other means. Such transactions depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity and capital requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.  We generate cash flows from operations, and from investing and financing activities. During the first quarter of 2010 and 2009, we used the proceeds from loan paydowns and maturities of short-term investments, along with deposit growth and the issuance of common shares, to fund the paydown of short-term borrowings and long-term debt and to grow our securities available-for-sale portfolio.  The consolidated statements of cash flows summarize our sources and uses of cash by type of activity for each of the three-month periods ended March 31, 2010 and 2009.     Liquidity for KeyCorp  The parent company has sufficient liquidity when it can service its debt; support customary corporate operations and activities (including acquisitions) and occasional guarantees of subsidiary’s obligations in transactions with third parties at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and without adverse consequences; and pay dividends to shareholders.  Our primary tool for assessing parent company liquidity is the net short-term cash position, which measures the ability to fund debt maturing in twenty four months or less with existing liquid assets. Another key measure of parent company liquidity is the “liquidity gap,” which represents the difference between projected liquid assets and anticipated financial obligations over specified time horizons. We generally rely upon the issuance of term debt to manage the liquidity gap within targeted ranges assigned to various time periods.  Typically, the parent company meets its liquidity requirements through regular dividends from KeyBank. Federal banking law limits the amount of capital distributions that a bank can make to its holding company without prior regulatory approval. A national bank’s dividend-paying capacity is affected by several factors, including net profits (as defined by statute) for the two previous calendar years and for the current year, up to the date of dividend declaration. During the first quarter of 2010, KeyBank did not pay any dividends to the parent, and nonbank subsidiaries did not pay the parent any dividends. As of the close of business on March 31, 2010, KeyBank would not have been permitted to pay dividends to the parent without prior regulatory approval. To compensate for the absence of dividends, the parent company has relied upon the issuance of long-term debt and stock. During the first quarter of 2010, the parent made capital infusions of $100 million to KeyBank, compared to the first quarter of 2009 when the parent did not make any capital infusions.  The parent company generally maintains excess funds in interest-bearing deposits in an amount sufficient to meet projected debt maturities over the next twenty-four months. At March 31, 2010, the parent company held $3.4 billion in short-term investments, which we projected to be sufficient to repay our maturing debt obligations.  During the first quarter of 2009, KeyCorp issued $438 million of FDIC-guaranteed floating-rate senior notes under the TLGP, which are due April 16, 2012.     Liquidity programs  We have several liquidity programs, which are described in Note 12 (“Short-Term Borrowings”) on page 104 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders that enable the parent company and KeyBank to raise funds  101    Table of Contents  in the public and private markets when the capital markets are functioning normally. The proceeds from most of these programs can be used for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. Each of the programs is replaced or renewed as needed. There are no restrictive financial covenants in any of these programs.     Credit ratings  Our credit ratings at March 31, 2010, are shown in Figure 28. We believe that these credit ratings, under normal conditions in the capital markets, will enable the parent company or KeyBank to effect future offerings of securities that would be marketable to investors. Conditions in the credit markets are improving relative to the disruption experienced between the third quarter of 2007 and the third quarter of 2009; however, the availability of credit and the cost of funds remain tight and more costly than is typical of an economy with a growing gross domestic product.  Figure 28 reflects the credit ratings of KeyCorp securities at March 31, 2010. If our credit ratings fall below investment-grade, that event could have a material adverse effect on us. Such downgrades could adversely affect access to liquidity and could significantly increase our cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us. Ultimately, credit ratings downgrades would curtail our business operations and reduce our ability to generate income.   On April 27, 2010, Moody’s, a credit rating agency that rates KeyCorp and KeyBank debt securities, indicated that, if enacted into law, the American Financial Stability Act of 2010 currently proposed by Senator Christopher Dodd could result in lower debt and deposit ratings for seventeen U.S. banks, including KeyBank, because legislation could weaken Moody’s current assumptions regarding the systemic support provided to the largest financial institutions. Moody’s has publicly reported that KeyCorp holding company ratings do not currently benefit from any uplift as a result of a systemic support assumption by Moody’s. KeyBank’s long-term deposit and senior debt ratings were identified as receiving a one notch uplift due to systemic support.  Figure 28.

Like other financial services institutions, we make loans, extend credit, purchase securities and enter into financial derivative contracts, all of which have related credit risk.     Credit policy, approval and evaluation. We manage credit risk exposure through a multifaceted program. Risk committees approve both retail and commercial credit policies. These policies are communicated throughout the organization to foster a consistent approach to granting credit. For more information about our credit policies, as well as related approval and evaluation processes, see the section entitled “Credit policy, approval and evaluation” on page 61 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders.  We actively manage the overall loan portfolio in a manner consistent with asset quality objectives, including the use of credit derivatives — primarily credit default swaps — to mitigate credit risk. Credit default swaps enable us to transfer a portion of the credit risk associated with a particular extension of credit to a  102    Table of Contents   third party. At March 31, 2010, we used credit default swaps with a notional amount of $1.0 billion to manage the credit risk associated with specific commercial lending obligations. We also sell credit derivatives — primarily index credit default swaps — to diversify and manage portfolio concentration and correlation risks. At March 31, 2010, the notional amount of credit default swaps sold by us for the purpose of diversifying our credit exposure was $431 million. Occasionally, we have provided credit protection to other lenders through the sale of credit default swaps. These transactions with other lenders generated fee income.   Credit default swaps are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Related gains or losses, as well as the premium paid or received for credit protection, are included in the trading income component of noninterest income. These swaps increased our operating results by $3 million during the first quarter of 2010. We also manage the loan portfolio using portfolio swaps and bulk purchases and sales. Our overarching goal is to manage the loan portfolio within a specified range of asset quality. Selected asset quality statistics for each of the past five years are presented in Figure 29. The factors that drive these statistics are discussed in the remainder of this section. Figure 29.

Watch and criticized assets. Watch assets are troubled commercial loans with the potential to deteriorate in quality due to the client’s current financial condition and possible inability to perform in accordance with the terms of the underlying contract. Criticized assets are troubled loans and other assets that show additional signs of weakness that may lead, or have led, to an interruption in scheduled repayments from primary sources, potentially requiring us to rely on repayment from secondary sources, such as collateral liquidation. During the first quarter of 2010, criticized assets began to stabilize while watch assets declined in most of our commercial lines of business due to continued strengthening in economic activity.     Allowance for loan losses. At March 31, 2010, the allowance for loan losses was $2.4 billion, or 4.34% of loans, compared to $2.0 billion, or 2.88%, at March 31, 2009. The allowance includes $307 million that was specifically allocated for impaired loans of $1.5 billion at March 31, 2010, compared to $233 million that was allocated for impaired loans of $1.3 billion one year ago. For more information about impaired loans, see Note 8 (“Nonperforming Assets and Past Due Loans from Continuing Operations”). At March 31, 2010, the allowance for loan losses was 117.43% of nonperforming loans, compared to 116.20% at March 31, 2009.  We estimate the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses on at least a quarterly basis. The methodology used is described in Note 1 (“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”) under the heading “Allowance for Loan Losses” on page 82 of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders. Briefly, we apply historical loss rates to existing loans with similar risk characteristics and exercise judgment to assess the  103    Table of Contents  impact of factors such as changes in economic conditions, changes in credit policies or underwriting standards, and changes in the level of credit risk associated with specific industries and markets. If an impaired loan has an outstanding balance greater than $2.5 million, we conduct further analysis to determine the probable loss content and assign a specific allowance to the loan if deemed appropriate. A specific allowance also may be assigned — even when sources of repayment appear sufficient — if we remain uncertain about whether the loan will be repaid in full. The allowance for loan losses at March 31, 2010, represents our best estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio at that date.  As shown in Figure 30, our allowance for loan losses increased by $409 million, or 20%, during the past twelve months. This increase was attributable primarily to deteriorating conditions in the commercial real estate portfolio, and in various components of the commercial and financial portfolio. In addition, our liability for credit losses on lending-related commitments increased by $65 million to $119 million at March 31, 2010. When combined with our allowance for loan losses, our total allowance for credit losses represented 4.55% of loans at the end of the first quarter of 2010. Figure 30.

Our provision for loan losses was $413 million for the first quarter of 2010, compared to $847 million for the year-ago quarter. Our net loan charge-offs for the first quarter of 2010 exceeded the provision for loan losses by $109 million. As previously reported, we have undertaken a process to reduce exposure in the residential properties segment of our construction loan portfolio through the sale of certain loans.     Net loan charge-offs. Net loan charge-offs for the first quarter of 2010 totaled $522 million, or 3.67% of average loans from continuing operations. These results compare to net charge-offs of $460 million, or 2.60%, for the same period last year. Figure 31 shows the trend in our net loan charge-offs by loan type, while the composition of loan charge-offs and recoveries by type of loan is presented in Figure 32.  Over the past twelve months, net charge-offs in the commercial loan portfolio rose by $35 million, due primarily to commercial real estate related credits within the Real Estate Capital and Corporate Banking Services line of business. Net charge-offs for this line of business rose by $34 million from the first quarter of 2009 while decreasing $183 million from the fourth quarter 2009. Net charge-offs for this line of business included $131 million of net charge-offs recorded on two specific customer relationships during the fourth quarter of 2009. Compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, net loan charge-offs in the commercial loan portfolio decreased by $193 million. The decrease was attributable to declines in both the commercial, financial and agricultural, and real estate commercial mortgage and construction categories. As shown in Figure 34, our exit loan portfolio accounted for $153 million, or 29%, of total net loan charge-offs for the first quarter of 2010. We expect net charge-offs to remain elevated in 2010; however, we do expect that they will trend downward as we progress throughout the year. 104    Table of Contents  Figure 31.

These concessions are made to improve the collectability of the loan and generally take the form of a reduction of the interest rate, extension of the maturity date or reduction in the principal balance.    As shown in Figure 33, nonperforming assets decreased during the first quarter of 2010 which represents the second consecutive quarterly decline. Most of the reduction came from nonperforming loans and OREO in the commercial real estate lines of business. These reductions were offset in part by an increase in nonperforming loans held for sale. The increase in nonperforming loans held for sale reflects the actions we are taking to reduce our exposure in the commercial real estate and institutional portfolios through the sale of selected assets. As shown in Figure 34, our exit loan portfolio accounted for $499 million, or 21%, of total nonperforming assets at March 31, 2010, compared to $599 million, or 30%, at March 31, 2009. At March 31, 2010, the carrying amount of our commercial nonperforming loans outstanding represented 71% of their original face value, and total nonperforming loans outstanding represented 73% of their face value. At the same date, OREO represented 54% of its original face value, while loans held for sale and other nonperforming assets in the aggregate represented 54% of their face value. In total, we have recorded 107    Table of Contents  approximately $1.1 billion in charge-offs and write-downs against our nonperforming assets since the beginning of 2009.  At March 31, 2010, our 20 largest nonperforming loans totaled $558 million, representing 26% of total loans on nonperforming status.  Figure 34 shows the composition of our exit loan portfolio at March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, the net charge-offs recorded on this portfolio for the first quarter of 2010 and the fourth quarter of 2009, and the nonperforming status of these loans at March 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009. At March 31, 2010, the exit loan portfolio represented 12% of total loans and loans held for sale.  Figure 34.

The types of activity that caused the change in our nonperforming loans during each of the last five quarters are summarized in Figure 36. As shown in this figure, nonperforming loans experienced a second quarterly decrease as loans placed on nonaccrual decreased and loans returned to accrual status increased from the fourth quarter of 2009.

Operational risk also encompasses compliance (legal) risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules and regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards. Resulting losses could take the form of explicit charges, increased operational costs, harm to our reputation or forgone opportunities. We seek to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls.  We continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with laws, rules and regulations, and to improve the oversight of our operational risk. For example, a loss-event database tracks the amounts and sources of operational losses. This tracking mechanism helps to identify weaknesses and to highlight the need to take corrective action. We also rely upon software programs designed to assist in monitoring our control processes. This technology has enhanced the reporting of the effectiveness of our controls to senior management and the Board of Directors. Primary responsibility for managing and monitoring internal control mechanisms lies with the managers of our various lines of business. Our Risk Review function periodically assesses the overall effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Risk Review reports the results of reviews on internal controls and systems to senior management and the Audit Committee, and independently supports the Audit Committee’s oversight of these controls. The Operational Risk Committee, a senior management committee, oversees our level of operational risk, and directs and supports our operational infrastructure and related activities. 110    Table of Contents     Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk The information presented in the “Market risk management” section of the Management’s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition & Results of Operations, is incorporated herein by reference.    Item 4. Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this report, KeyCorp carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of KeyCorp’s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of KeyCorp’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, KeyCorp’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in all material respects, as of the end of the period covered by this report, in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. No changes were made to KeyCorp’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, KeyCorp’s internal control over financial reporting.     PART II. OTHER INFORMATION     Item 1A. Risk Factors  An investment in our Common Shares or debt, or other securities is subject to risks inherent to our business and our industry. Before making an investment decision, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below relating to recent developments and the risk factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report. Although we have significant risk management policies, procedures and practices aimed at mitigating uncertainties, these risks may nevertheless impair our business operations. These risks are not the only ones that we face. This report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.  IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS (OR THOSE INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE AS INDICATED ABOVE) ACTUALLY OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND/OR ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY AND/OR CREDIT COULD BE MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTED (“MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US”). IF THIS WERE TO HAPPEN, THE VALUE OF OUR SECURITIES — COMMON SHARES, SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK, SERIES B AND OUR TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES — COULD DECLINE, PERHAPS SIGNIFICANTLY, AND YOU COULD LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT.  RISKS RELATED TO RECENT DEVELOPMENTS  Our credit ratings could be adversely affected by the enactment of financial regulatory reforms, which could alter assumptions about systemic support of financial institutions during crises.  On April 27, 2010, Moody’s, a credit rating agency that rates KeyCorp and KeyBank debt securities, indicated that, if enacted into law, the American Financial Stability Act of 2010 currently proposed by Senator Christopher Dodd could result in lower debt and deposit ratings for seventeen U.S. banks, including KeyBank, because the legislation could weaken Moody’s current assumptions regarding the probability that the U.S. government would support the largest, most systemically important financial institutions, and it could possibly enhance the ability of regulators to unwind large, interconnected financial institutions. In addition, current regulatory reforms proposed by Senator Dodd would also propose certain limitations on bank activities that may weaken the earnings power of some banks. Moody’s has publicly reported that KeyCorp holding company (parent) ratings do not currently benefit from any “uplift” as a result of a systemic support assumption by Moody’s. However, KeyBank’s long-term deposit and senior debt ratings were identified as receiving a one notch “uplift” due to Moody’s assumption about systemic support; the average uplift for long-term deposits and senior debt among the seventeen banks identified by Moody’s was 1.88. Accordingly, should financial regulatory reform affect Moody’s assumptions, KeyBank’s credit ratings could be negatively affected and, in turn, KeyBank’s liquidity, which could have a Material Adverse Affect on Us.  111    Table of Contents  Financial regulatory reform proposals have continued to focus on reducing the risks posed by large financial institutions to the financial system. Should regulatory reform succeed, as one of the top nineteen banking organizations in the country, we could be competitively disadvantaged.  Currently, Congress and federal regulatory agencies are debating various regulatory proposals, which aim to reduce the risk to the financial system by increasing regulation and certain limits on larger financial institutions. Various regulatory reform proposals seek (i) to limit the scope of financial institutions and ensure that a bank will not own, invest in or sponsor a hedge fund or a private equity fund, or have proprietary trading operations unrelated to its service of its customers for its own profit; and (ii) limit further consolidation of the financial sector. More recently, Senator Dodd has proposed to create a new independent consumer protection agency, housed at the Federal Reserve, with authority to ensure that American consumers get clear, accurate information concerning financial products and a mandate to protect consumers from hidden fees, abusive terms, and deceptive practices. As described above, the proposed reforms also would revise the Federal Reserve’s authority to allow it to provide system-wide support in crises but to restrict it from supporting individual firms in certain ways. Furthermore, regulatory reform could place additional costs on larger institutions, and place large financial institutions, like us, at a competitive disadvantage in the market place. Additionally, reform could affect the behaviors of third parties that we deal with in the course of our business, such as rating agencies and investors. While it is difficult to predict if regulatory reform will occur and the extent or nature of regulatory reform, heightened regulatory practices, requirements or expectations resulting from the financial crisis, could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, and could have a Material Adverse Effect on Us.
