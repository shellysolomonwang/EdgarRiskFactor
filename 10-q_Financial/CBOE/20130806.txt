Item 1A. Risk FactorsOther than the risk factor listed below, there have been no material updates to the Risk Factors as set forth in Item 1A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012. If we are unable to execute the undertakings in the Consent Order, it may have a significant adverse impact on our business.On June 11, 2013, CBOE and C2 entered into the Consent Order under which the Company was censured, ordered to cease and desist from violating certain sections of the Securities Exchange Act, paid a fine of $6 million and agreed to complete certain undertakings. These undertakings include conducting a review of our regulatory programs, enterprise risk management and business influences on regulation, reviewing business practices to ensure compliance with the rules of the exchanges and implement training programs for employees. The Consent Order also requires on-going certifications by the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Regulatory Officer for five years. We may be subject to additional investigations or proceedings by the SEC if the SEC were to find that we did not fulfill our obligations under the Consent Order. Any investigations or proceedings, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs, the diversion of resources, including management time, and potential harm to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition. With respect to certain of the undertakings, if the SEC staff thinks that a review completed is inadequate, it may require us to engage an independent consultant to conduct an additional review, which would cause us to incur additional expense.Item 2.
