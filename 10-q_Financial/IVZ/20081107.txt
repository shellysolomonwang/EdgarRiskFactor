Item 1A. Risk Factors   The company has had no significant changes in its risk factors from those previously disclosed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, other than as noted below.   Recent volatility and disruption in world capital and credit markets, as well as adverse changes in the global economy, have negatively affected Invesco’s revenues.   The capital and credit markets have been experiencing substantial volatility and disruption for over a year. In recent weeks, the volatility and disruption have reached extreme levels. These market events have materially impacted our results of operations, and may continue to do so, and could materially impact our financial condition and liquidity. In this regard:       •   The overall decline in global market conditions around the world has resulted, and may continue to result, in significant decreases in our assets under management and revenues.          •   In addition to the impact on the market value of client portfolios, the illiquidity and volatility of both the global fixed-income and equity markets could negatively affect our ability to manage client inflows and outflows from pooled investment vehicles or to timely meet client redemption requests.         •   Our money market funds have always maintained a $1.00 NAV; however, we cannot guarantee that we can continue to achieve such results. Market conditions could lead to severe liquidity issues in money market products which could affect their NAVs. If the NAV of one of our money market funds were to decline below $1.00 per share, such funds would likely experience significant redemptions in assets under management, loss of shareholder confidence and reputational harm, all of which could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and liquidity.                 48             •   Even if legislative or regulatory initiatives or other efforts successfully stabilize and add liquidity to the financial markets, we may need to modify our strategies, businesses or operations, and we may incur increased capital requirements and constraints or additional costs in order to satisfy new regulatory requirements or to compete in a changed business environment.         •   In the event of extreme circumstances, including economic, political, or business crises, such as a widespread systemic failure in the global financial system or additional failures of firms that have significant obligations as counterparties on financial instruments, we may suffer further significant declines in assets under management and severe liquidity or valuation issues in the short-term sponsored investment products in which client and company assets are invested, all of which would adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, liquidity, credit ratings, ability to access capital markets, and retention and ability to attract key employees. Additionally, these factors could impact our ability to realize the carrying value of our goodwill.       Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
