Item 1A. Risk Factors   The company has had no significant changes in its risk factors from those previously disclosed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, other than the risk factor noted below.  We operate in an industry that is highly regulated in many countries, and any adverse changes in the laws or regulations governing our business could decrease our revenues and profitability.   As with all investment management companies, our activities are highly regulated in almost all countries in which we conduct business. Laws and regulations applied at the national, state or provincial and local level generally grant governmental agencies and industry self-regulatory authorities broad administrative discretion over our activities, including the power to limit or restrict business activities. Subsidiaries operating in the European Union (EU) also are subject to various EU Directives, which are implemented by member state national legislation. Possible sanctions include the revocation of licenses to operate certain businesses, the suspension or expulsion from a particular jurisdiction or market of any of our business organizations or their key personnel, the imposition of fines and censures on us or our employees and the imposition of additional capital requirements. It is also possible that laws and regulations governing our operations or particular investment products could be amended or interpreted in a manner that is adverse to us.   Certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital. These and other similar provisions of applicable law may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital, repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities. A sub-group of Invesco subsidiaries, including all of our regulated EU subsidiaries, is subject to consolidated capital requirements under EU Directives, and capital is maintained within this sub-group to satisfy these regulations. At September 30, 2010, the European sub-group had cash and cash equivalent balances of $459.3 million, much of which is used to satisfy these regulatory requirements. Complying with our regulatory commitments may result in an increase in the capital requirements applicable to the European sub-group. As a result of corporate restructuring and the regulatory undertakings that we have given, certain of these EU subsidiaries may be required to limit their dividends to the parent company, Invesco Ltd. We cannot guarantee that further corporate restructuring will not be required to comply with applicable legislation.   The regulatory environment in which we operate frequently changes and has seen significant increased regulation in recent years. We may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations. To the extent that existing regulations are amended or future regulations are adopted that reduce the sale, or increase the redemptions, of our products and services, or that negatively affect the investment performance of our products, our aggregate assets under management and our revenues could be adversely affected. In addition, regulatory changes could impose additional costs, which could negatively impact our profitability.   Various changes in law and regulation have been enacted or adopted and are beginning to be implemented or otherwise developed in multiple jurisdictions globally in response to the crisis in the financial markets that began in 2007. Various other proposals remain under consideration by various legislators, regulators, other government officials and other public policy commentators. Certain enacted provisions and certain other proposals are potentially far reaching and, depending upon their implementation, could have a material impact on Invesco’s business. While many of these provisions appear designed to address perceived problems in the banking sector, certain of the provisions will or may be applied to other financial services companies, including investment managers.   In the United States, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) was signed into law on July 21, 2010. While Invesco does not at this time believe that the Dodd-Frank Act will fundamentally change the investment management industry or cause Invesco to reconsider its fundamental strategy, it does appear that certain provisions will, and other provisions may, increase regulatory burdens and related compliance costs. In addition, the scope of many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will be determined by implementing regulations, some of which will require lengthy proposal and promulgation periods. Moreover, the Dodd-Frank Act mandates many regulatory studies, some of which pertain directly to the investment management industry, which could lead to additional legislation or regulation. As a result of these uncertainties regarding implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and such other future potential legislative or regulatory changes, the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on the investment management industry and Invesco cannot be predicted at this time.   Potential developments under enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes, and related matters, include:       •   Expanded prudential regulation over investment management firms.    98    Table of Contents      •   New or increased capital requirements and related regulation (including new capital requirements pertaining to money market funds).        •   Additional change to the regulation of money market funds in the U.S. The SEC has adopted changes to Rule 2a-7, the primary securities regulation governing U.S. registered money market funds. These new rules are designed to significantly strengthen the regulatory requirements governing money market funds, increase the resilience of such funds to economic stresses, and reduce the risk of runs on these funds. Regulators in the U.S. continue to evaluate whether to propose mandating a variable (“floating”) NAV for money market funds. Invesco believes such a change would have significant adverse consequences on the money market funds industry and the short-term credit markets, and is encouraged by the recognition of these concerns in the Report of the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets on Money Market Fund Reform Options issued October 21, 2010.        •   Changes to the distribution of investment funds and other investment products. In the U.S., the SEC has proposed significant changes to Rule 12b-1. Invesco believes these proposals would increase operational and compliance costs. The U.K. Financial Services Authority continues to develop its Retail Distribution Review, which is expected to reshape the manner in which retail investment funds are sold in the U.K. The EU continues to develop the Alternative Investment Fund Manager Directive which, among other elements, could impose restrictions on the marketing and sale within the EU of private equity and other alternative investment funds sponsored by non-EU managers. Various regulators have promulgated or are considering other new disclosure and suitability requirements pertaining to the distribution of investment funds and other investment products.        •   Guidelines regarding the structure and components of compensation, including under the Dodd-Frank Act and various EU Directives.        •   Additional resourcing for regulatory examinations and inspections, including enforcement reviews, and a more aggressive posture regarding commencing enforcement proceedings.        •   Changes impacting certain other products or markets (e.g., retirement savings).        •   Enhanced licensing and qualification requirements for key personnel.        •   Other additional rules and regulations and disclosure requirements. Certain provisions impose additional disclosure burdens on public companies, including Invesco. Certain proposals could impose requirements for more widespread disclosures of compensation to highly-paid individuals. Depending upon the scope of any such requirements, Invesco could be disadvantaged in retaining key employees vis-à-vis private companies, including hedge fund sponsors.        •   Other changes impacting the identity or the organizational structure of regulators with supervisory authority over Invesco.     Invesco cannot at this time predict the full impact of potential legal and regulatory changes on its business. It is possible such changes could impose new compliance costs or capital requirements or impact Invesco in other ways that could have a material adverse impact on Invesco’s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Moreover, certain legal or regulatory changes could require us to modify our strategies, businesses or operations, and we may incur other new constraints or costs in order to satisfy new regulatory requirements or to compete in a changed business environment.   To the extent that existing or future regulations affecting the sale of our products and services or our investment strategies cause or contribute to reduced sales or increased redemptions of our products or impair the investment performance of our products, our aggregate assets under management and revenues might be adversely affected.  99    Table of Contents     Item 2.
