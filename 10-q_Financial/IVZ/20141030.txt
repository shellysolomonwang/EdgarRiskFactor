Invesco Ltd.Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements(Unaudited)1. ACCOUNTING POLICIESCorporate InformationInvesco Ltd. (Parent) and all of its consolidated entities (collectively, the company or Invesco) provide retail and institutional clients with an array of global investment management capabilities. The company operates globally and its sole business is investment management.Certain disclosures included in the company's annual report are not required to be included on an interim basis in the company's quarterly reports on Forms 10-Q. The company has condensed or omitted the disclosures. Therefore, this Form 10-Q (Report) should be read in conjunction with the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.Basis of Accounting and ConsolidationIn the opinion of management, the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, which are necessary for the fair presentation of the financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented. All significant intercompany transactions, balances, revenues and expenses are eliminated upon consolidation.The company provides investment management services to, and has transactions with, various private equity funds, real estate funds, fund-of-funds, collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), and other investment products sponsored by the company in the normal course of business for the investment of client assets. The company serves as the investment manager, making day-to-day investment decisions concerning the assets of these products. Certain of these entities, typically CLOs and funds that are structured as partnership entities (such as private equity funds, real estate funds, and fund-of-funds), are considered to be variable interest entities (VIEs) if the VIE criteria are met, otherwise, they are considered to be voting interest entities (VOEs). A VIE, in the context of the company and its managed funds, is a fund that does not have sufficient equity to finance its operations without additional subordinated financial support, or in certain cases a fund for which the risks and rewards of ownership are not directly linked to voting interests.The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and consolidate the financial statements of the Parent and all of its controlled subsidiaries. Additionally, the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the consolidation of certain managed funds that meet the definition of a VIE if the company has been deemed to be the primary beneficiary of those funds, any non-VIE general partnership or similar investments where the company is deemed to have control, and other managed investment products in which the company has a controlling financial interest. Control is deemed to be present when the Parent holds a majority voting interest or otherwise has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the subsidiary managed fund so as to obtain the majority of the benefits from its activities. The company is generally considered to have a controlling financial interest in a managed fund when it owns a majority of the fund's outstanding shares, which may arise as a result of a seed money investment in a newly launched investment product from the time of initial launch to the time that the fund becomes majority-held by third-party investors, or in certain cases until the time that the company's investment becomes non-substantive.Investment products that are consolidated are referred to in this Report as Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products (CSIP), which generally include consolidated sponsored investment products in which Invesco holds the majority of the voting rights or partnerships in which the company has substantive equity at risk but in which the other investors lack removal or liquidation rights, or Consolidated Investment Products (CIP), which includes consolidated nominally-held investment products. The distinction is important, as it differentiates the company's economic risk associated with each type of consolidated managed fund. The company's economic risk with respect to each investment in a CSIP and a CIP is limited to its equity ownership and any uncollected management and performance fees. Gains and losses arising from nominally-held CIP do not have a significant impact on the company's results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources. Gains and losses arising from majority-held CSIP could have a significant impact on the company's results of operations, as the company has greater economic risk associated with its investment. See Note 12, "Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products," and Note 13, "Consolidated Investment Products," for additional information regarding the impact of consolidation of investment products.Noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities and retained earnings appropriated for investors in CIP represent the interests in certain entities consolidated by the company either because the company has control over the entity or has determined that it is the primary beneficiary, but of which the company does not own all of the entity's equity. To the extent that noncontrolling interests represent equity which is redeemable or convertible for cash or other assets at the option of the equity 9Table of Contents   holder, as is the case with the CSIP noncontrolling interests, these are deemed to represent temporary equity, and are classified as equity attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests in CSIPs in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Nonredeemable noncontrolling interests are classified as a component of permanent equity.Use of EstimatesIn preparing the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities, and disclosure of contingent liabilities. The primary estimates and assumptions made relate to goodwill and intangible impairment, certain investments which are carried at fair value, and taxes. Additionally, estimation is involved when determining investment and debt valuation for certain CIP; however, changes in the fair values of these amounts are largely offset by noncontrolling interests. Use of available information and application of judgment are inherent in the formation of estimates. Actual results in the future could differ from such estimates and the differences may be material to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted and Pending Accounting PronouncementsIn February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2013-02, “Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (ASU 2013-02)." ASU 2013-02 amends Topic 220 to require an entity to present current period reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income and other amounts of current-period other comprehensive income, separately, for each component of other comprehensive income. ASU 2013-02 also requires an entity to provide information about the effects on net income of significant amounts reclassified out of each component of accumulated other comprehensive income, if those amounts are required under other Topics to be reclassified to net income in their entirety in the same reporting period. The amendments to Topic 220 made by ASU 2013-02 are effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2012 and are reflected in these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09," which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2016, and requires either a retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adoption. Early adoption is not permitted. The company is currently evaluating the potential impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the available transition methods. In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2014-13, "Measuring the Financial Assets and the Financial Liabilities of a Consolidated Collateralized Financing Entity (ASU 2014-13)." ASU 2014-13 provides a measurement alternative for an entity that consolidates a collateralized financing entity (CFE) and has elected the fair value option for the financial assets and financial liabilities of such CFE. If elected, the reporting entity would measure both the financial assets and the financial liabilities of the CFE by using the more observable of the fair value of the financial assets and the fair value of the financial liabilities. The measurement alternative would remove any measurement difference previously recorded as net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities and as an adjustment to retained earnings appropriated for investors in CIP. ASU 2014-13 is effective for the company on January 1, 2016, and requires either a retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adoption. The company is currently evaluating the potential impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the available transition methods. 10Table of Contents   2. FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES The carrying value and fair value of financial instruments are presented in the below summary table. The fair value of financial instruments held by CSIP and CIP is presented in Note 12, "Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products" and Note 13, "Consolidated Investment Products," respectively.

See the indicated footnotes or most recently filed Form 10-K for additional information about the carrying and fair values of these financial instruments. Foreign time deposits are measured at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value, and are accordingly classified as Level 2 securities.A three-level valuation hierarchy exists for disclosure of fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows:•Level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. •Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. •Level 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. An asset or liability's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.There are three types of valuation approaches: a market approach, which uses observable prices and other relevant information that is generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities; an income approach, which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single, discounted present value amount; and a cost approach, which is based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset.The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such assets and liabilities pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.Cash equivalentsCash investments in money market funds are valued under the market approach through the use of quoted market prices in an active market, which is the net asset value of the underlying funds, and are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. Available-for-sale investmentsAvailable-for-sale investments include seed money, co-investments in affiliated collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), and investments in other debt securities. Available-for-sale investments are measured at fair value. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-for-sale investments are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, until the investment is sold or otherwise disposed of, or if the investment is determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in equity is included in income. The specific identification method is used to determine the realized gain or loss on securities sold or otherwise disposed.11Table of Contents   Seed money is valued under the market approach through the use of quoted market prices available in an active market and is classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy; there is no modeling or additional information needed to arrive at the fair values of these investments. CLO assets are valued based on price quotations provided by an independent third-party pricing source or using an income approach through the use of certain observable and unobservable inputs. At September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, investments in CLOs were valued using third-party pricing information. Due to liquidity constraints within the market for CLO products that require the use of unobservable inputs, these investments are classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. Other debt securities are valued using a cost valuation technique due to the lack of available cash flow and market data and are accordingly also classified within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.Trading investmentsTrading investments include investments held to settle the company’s deferred compensation plan liabilities, certain seed money, as well as trading and investing activities in equity and debt securities entered into in its capacity as sponsor of UITs, and other equity securities. Trading securities are securities bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term. Trading investments are measured at fair value. Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of trading investments are included in income.•Investments related to deferred compensation plansInvestments related to deferred compensation plans are valued under the market approach through the use of quoted prices in an active market and are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.•Seed moneySeed money is valued under the market approach through the use of quoted market prices available in an active market and is classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy; there is no modeling or additional information needed to arrive at the fair values of these investments.•Other equity securitiesOther equity securities consist of investments in publicly-traded equity securities. These securities are valued under the market approach through the use of quoted prices on an exchange. To the extent these securities are actively traded, valuation adjustments are not applied and they are categorized within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy; otherwise, they are categorized in level 2.•UIT-related equity and debt securities The company invests in UIT-related equity and debt securities consisting of investments in corporate stock, UITs, and U.S. state and political subdivision securities. Each is discussed more fully below. Corporate equitiesThe company temporarily holds investments in corporate equities for purposes of creating a UIT. Corporate equities are valued under the market approach through use of quoted prices on an exchange. To the extent these securities are actively traded, valuation adjustments are not applied and they are categorized within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy; otherwise, they are categorized in level 2.UITsThe company may hold units of its sponsored UITs at period-end for sale in the primary market or secondary market. Equity UITs are valued under the market approach through use of quoted prices on an exchange. Fixed income UITs are valued using recently executed transaction prices, market price quotations (where observable), bond spreads, or credit default swap spreads. The spread data used is for the same maturities as the underlying bonds. If the spread data does not reference the issuers, then data that references comparable issuers is used. When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is determined based on cash flow models with yield curves, bond or single name credit default spreads, and recovery rates based on collateral value as key inputs. Depending on the nature of the inputs, these investments are categorized as level 1, 2, or 3.Municipal securitiesMunicipal securities are valued using recently executed transaction prices, market price quotations (where observable), bond spreads, or credit default swap spreads. The spread data used is for the same maturities as the underlying bonds. If the spread data does not reference the issuers, then data that references comparable issuers is used. When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is determined based on cash flow models with 12Table of Contents   yield curves, bond or single name credit default spreads, and recovery rates based on collateral value as key inputs. Depending on the nature of the inputs, these investments are categorized as level 1, 2, or 3.Assets held for policyholdersAssets held for policyholders represent investments held by one of the company’s subsidiaries, which is an insurance entity that was established to facilitate retirement savings plans in the U.K. The assets held for policyholders are accounted for at fair value pursuant to ASC Topic 944, “Financial Services — Insurance,” and are comprised primarily of affiliated unitized funds. The assets are measured at fair value under the market approach based on the quoted prices of the underlying funds in an active market and are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. The policyholder payables are indexed to the value of the assets held for policyholders and are therefore not included in the tables below.UIT-related financial instruments sold, not yet purchased, and derivative instrumentsThe company uses U.S. Treasury futures, which are types of derivative financial instruments, to hedge economically fixed income UIT inventory and securities in order to mitigate market risk. Open futures contracts are marked-to-market daily through earnings, which are recorded in the company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income in other revenue, along with the mark-to-market on the underlying trading securities held. Fair values of derivative contracts in an asset position are included in other assets in the company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Fair values of derivative contracts in a liability position are included in other liabilities in the company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. These derivative contracts are valued under the market approach through use of quoted prices in an active market and are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. At September 30, 2014 there were 8 futures contracts with a notional value of $1.0 million (December 31, 2013: 2 open futures contracts with a notional value of $0.3 million). Additionally, to hedge economically the market risk associated with equity and debt securities and UITs temporarily held as trading investments, the company will hold short corporate equities, exchange-traded funds, or U.S. treasury security positions. These transactions are recorded as financial instruments sold, not yet purchased and are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. To the extent these securities are actively traded, valuation adjustments are not applied and they are categorized within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy; otherwise, they are categorized in level 2.13Table of Contents   The following table presents, for each of the hierarchy levels described above, the carrying value of the company's assets and liabilities, including major security type for equity and debt securities, which are measured at fair value on the company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2014: As of September 30, 2014$ in millionsFair Value Measurements Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)Assets:       Cash equivalents:       Money market funds582.4 582.4 — —Investments:*       Available-for-sale:       Seed money250.6 250.6 — —CLOs4.1 — — 4.1Other debt securities6.3 — — 6.3Trading investments:       Investments related to deferred compensation plans234.1 234.1 — —Seed money10.1 10.1 — —Other equity securities 26.8 26.8 — —UIT-related equity and debt securities:       Corporate equities1.4 1.4 — —UITs1.9 1.9 — —Municipal securities0.2 — 0.2 —Assets held for policyholders1,509.2 1,509.2 — —Total2,627.1 2,616.5 0.2 10.4Liabilities:       UIT-related financial instruments sold, not yet purchased:       Corporate equities(1.5) (1.5) — —Total(1.5) (1.5) — —____________*Foreign time deposits of $29.6 million are excluded from this table.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION The company recognized total expenses of $104.3 million and $103.0 million related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and September 30, 2013, respectively. Cash received from exercise of share options granted under share-based compensation arrangements was $8.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $13.0 million). Share AwardsShare awards are broadly classified into two categories: time-vested and performance-vested. Share awards are measured at fair value at the date of grant and are expensed, based on the company's estimate of shares that will eventually vest, on a straight-line or accelerated basis over the vesting period. Time-vested awards vest ratably over a period of continued employee service. Performance-vested awards cliff-vest at the end of or vest ratably over a defined vesting period of continued employee service upon the company's attainment of certain performance criteria. Time-vested and performance-vested share awards are granted in the form of restricted share awards (RSAs) or restricted share units (RSUs). Performance-vested awards are tied to the achievement of specified levels of adjusted diluted earnings per share and adjusted operating margin. In the event that either targeted financial measure is achieved at or above a vesting threshold for a particular performance measurement period, the portion of the performance-vested award subject to targeted financial measures will vest proportionately between 0% and 100% based upon the higher achieved level for that year.With respect to time-vested awards, dividends accrue directly to the employee holder of RSAs, and cash payments in lieu of dividends are made to employee holders of certain RSUs. With respect to performance-vested awards, dividends and cash payments in lieu of dividends are deferred and are paid at the same rate as on our shares if and to the extent the award vests. In May 2011, the company's shareholders approved the 2011 Global Equity Incentive Plan, which authorized the issuance of up to 28 million shares under this plan. In May 2010, the board approved the 2010 Global Equity Incentive Plan (ST), which authorized the issuance of up to 3 million shares under this plan. Under the terms of the 2010 Global Equity Incentive Plan (ST), shares are issued only as employment inducement awards in connection with a strategic transaction and, as a result, do not require shareholder approval under the rules of the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise.Movements on share awards priced in U.S. dollars during the periods ended September 30, are detailed below: For the nine months ended September 30, 2014 For the nine months ended September 30, 2013Millions of shares, except fair valuesTime- Vested Performance- Vested Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value ($) Time- Vested Performance- VestedUnvested at the beginning of period13.9 0.4 25.00 16.5 0.3Granted during the period4.3 0.2 34.33 5.2 0.2Forfeited during the period(1.1) — 23.83 (0.4) —Vested and distributed during the period(5.4) (0.1) 24.16 (6.6) (0.1)Unvested at the end of the period11.7 0.5 28.88 14.7 0.4In December 2007, in connection with the redomicile of the company from the U.K. to Bermuda, the company’s primary share listing moved from the London Stock Exchange to the New York Stock Exchange.

The total fair value of shares that vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 was $191.5 million (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $185.0 million). The weighted average grant date fair value of the U.S. dollar share awards that were granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 was $34.33  (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $26.86).At September 30, 2014, there was $271.5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share awards; that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.71 years.Share OptionsThe company has not granted share option awards since 2005. All share options awards, therefore, were granted prior to the December 2007 redomicile from the United Kingdom to Bermuda and re-listing from the London Stock Exchange (where the predecessor company's ordinary shares traded in Pounds Sterling) to the New York Stock Exchange (where the company's common shares now trade in U.S. Dollars). At the time of their grants, the exercise prices of the share options were denominated in the company's trading currency, which was the Pound Sterling. The company did not change the accounting for share options at the redomicile/re-listing date, because the share options were not modified at that date. The exercise price remains in Pounds Sterling and was not changed to U.S. Dollars. Therefore, upon exercise of the share options, the Pound Sterling exercise price will be converted into U.S. Dollars using the spot foreign exchange rate in effect on the exercise date. Upon the exercise of share options, the company either issues new shares or can utilize shares held in treasury (see Note 5, “Share Capital”) to satisfy the exercise.Changes in outstanding share option awards are as follows: For the nine months ended September 30, 2014 For the nine months ended September 30, 2013Millions of shares, except pricesOptions Weighted Average Exercise Price(£ Sterling) Options Weighted Average Exercise Price(£ Sterling)Outstanding at the beginning of period1.1 7.32 2.6 7.31Exercised during the period(0.7) 6.84 (1.0) 7.38Outstanding at the end of the period0.4 8.02 1.6 7.26Exercisable at the end of the period0.4 8.02 1.6 7.26Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP)For the nine months ended September 30, 2014, the company recognized $0.6 million in compensation expense related to the ESPP (September 30, 2013: $0.7 million).25Table of Contents   8. RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS Defined Contribution PlansThe company operates defined contribution retirement benefit plans for all qualifying employees. The assets of the plans are held separately from those of the company in funds under the control of trustees. When employees leave the plans prior to vesting fully in the contributions, the contributions payable by the company are reduced by the amount of forfeited contributions.The total amounts charged to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 of $13.3 million and $43.0 million, respectively (three and nine months ended September 30, 2013: $11.3 million and $39.4 million, respectively) represent contributions paid or payable to these plans by the company at rates specified in the rules of the plans. As of September 30, 2014, accrued contributions of $18.4 million (December 31, 2013: $21.8 million) for the current year will be paid to the plans.Defined Benefit PlansThe company maintains legacy defined benefit pension plans for qualifying employees of its subsidiaries in the U.K., Ireland, Germany and Taiwan. All defined benefit plans are closed to new participants. The company also maintains a postretirement medical plan in the U.S., which was closed to new participants in 2005. In 2006, the plan was amended to eliminate benefits for all participants who did not meet retirement eligibility by 2008. The assets of all defined benefit schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds. Under the plans, the employees are generally entitled to retirement benefits based on final salary at retirement.The components of net periodic benefit cost in respect of these defined benefit plans are as follows: Retirement Plans Medical Plan For the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30, For the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30,$ in millions2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013Service cost(1.1) (1.2) (3.3) (3.4) (0.1) — (0.2) (0.2)Interest cost(4.8) (4.9) (14.3) (14.7) (0.4) (0.6) (1.4) (1.6)Expected return on plan assets4.6 4.3 13.9 13.1 0.2 0.2 0.5 0.4Amortization of prior service cost/(credit)— — (0.1) — 0.5 0.5 1.5 1.5Amortization of net actuarial gain/(loss)(0.5) (0.5) (1.5) (1.7) — — (0.2) (0.2)Net periodic benefit cost(1.8) (2.3) (5.3) (6.7) 0.2 0.1 0.2 (0.1)The estimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid to the plans during 2014 are $15.9 million for retirement plans and $2.2 million for the medical plan. Payments made to the plans during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 were $11.9 million to the retirement plan and $1.7 million to the medical plan.9. TAXATION At September 30, 2014, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $5.6 million as compared to the December 31, 2013 total of $16.8 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, gross unrecognized tax benefits of $11.4 million were recognized as a result of favorable tax settlements and expiration of statue of limitations. Including interest and penalties, income tax expense decreased by $6.9 million, net of federal tax effects.The company and its subsidiaries file annual income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state and local jurisdictions, and in numerous foreign jurisdictions. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position, for which the company has unrecognized tax benefits, is finally resolved. To the extent that the company has favorable tax settlements, or determines that accrued amounts are no longer needed due to a lapse in the applicable statute of limitations or other reasons, such liabilities, as well as the related interest and penalty, would be reversed as a reduction of income tax expense (net of federal tax effects, if applicable) in the period such determination is made.26Table of Contents   10.

These programs could result in the issuance of common shares that would affect the measurement of basic and diluted earnings per share.There were no antidilutive options excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 (nine months ended September 30, 2013: none). Antidilutive options are those where the options' exercise prices are greater than the average market price of the shares.There were no time-vested share awards that were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, due to their inclusion being anti-dilutive. There were 0.3 million contingently issuable shares excluded from the diluted earnings per share computation during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 (nine months ended September 30, 2013: 0.3 million), because the necessary performance conditions for the shares to be issuable had not yet been satisfied at the end of the respective period.11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments and contingencies may arise in the ordinary course of business.Off Balance Sheet CommitmentsThe company has transactions with various private equity, real estate and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business. Many of the company's investment products are structured as limited partnerships. The company's investment may take the form of the general partner or a limited partner. The entities are structured such that each partner makes capital commitments that are to be drawn down over the life of the partnership as investment opportunities are identified. At September 30, 2014, the company's undrawn capital commitments were $99.9 million (December 31, 2013: $152.5 million).The Parent and various company subsidiaries have entered into agreements with financial institutions to guarantee certain obligations of other company subsidiaries. The company would be required to perform under these guarantees in the event of 27Table of Contents   certain defaults. The company has not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expects the risk of loss to be remote.Legal Contingencies In July 2010, various closed-end funds formerly advised by Van Kampen Investments or Morgan Stanley Investment Management had complaints filed against them in New York State Court commencing derivative lawsuits purportedly brought on behalf of the common shareholders of those funds. The funds are nominal defendants in these derivative lawsuits and the defendants also include Van Kampen Investments (acquired by Invesco on June 1, 2010), Morgan Stanley Investment Management and certain officers and trustees of the funds who are or were employees of those firms. Invesco has certain obligations under the applicable acquisition agreement regarding the defense costs and any damages associated with this litigation. The plaintiffs allege breaches of fiduciary duties owed by the non-fund defendants to the funds’ common shareholders related to the funds’ redemption in prior periods of Auction Rate Preferred Securities (ARPS) theretofore issued by the funds. The complaints are similar to other complaints filed against investment advisers, officers and trustees of closed-end funds in other fund complexes which issued and redeemed ARPS. The complaints allege that the advisers, distributors and certain officers and trustees of those funds breached their fiduciary duty by redeeming ARPS at their liquidation value when there was no obligation to do so and when the value of ARPS in the secondary marketplace were significantly below their liquidation value. The complaints also allege that the ARPS redemptions were principally motivated by the fund sponsors’ interests to preserve distribution relationships with brokers and other financial intermediaries who held ARPS after having repurchased them from their own clients. The complaints do not specify alleged damages. Certain other funds included in the acquired business have received demand letters expressing similar allegations. Such demand letters could be precursors to additional similar lawsuits being commenced against those other funds. The Boards of Trustees of the funds established special committees of independent trustees to conduct an inquiry regarding the allegations set forth in the complaints and demand letters. The Boards of Trustees of the funds accepted the recommendation of their special litigation committees to (i) reject the demands contained in the demand letters and (ii) to seek dismissal of the related lawsuits. Motions to dismiss were filed on October 4, 2011. The court granted the motions to dismiss, with prejudice, on October 22, 2014. The plaintiffs have 30 days in which they may file an appeal. Invesco believes the cases and other claims identified above should be dismissed or otherwise will terminate, although there can be no assurance of that result. Invesco intends to defend vigorously any cases which may survive beyond initial motions to dismiss. The company cannot predict with certainty, however, the eventual outcome of such cases and other claims, nor whether they will have a material negative impact on the company. The nature and progression of litigation can make it difficult to predict the impact a particular lawsuit will have on the company. There are many reasons that the company cannot make these assessments, including, among others, one or more of the following: the proceeding is in its early stages; the damages sought are unspecified, unsupportable, unexplained or uncertain; the claimant is seeking relief other than compensatory damages; the matter presents novel legal claims or other meaningful legal uncertainties; discovery has not started or is not complete; there are significant facts in dispute; and there are other parties who may share in any ultimate liability.The company is from time to time involved in litigation relating to other claims arising in the ordinary course of its business. In management’s opinion, adequate accrual has been made as of September 30, 2014 to provide for any such losses that may arise from matters for which the company could reasonably estimate an amount. Management is of the opinion that the ultimate resolution of such claims will not materially affect the company’s business, financial position, results of operation or liquidity. Furthermore, in management’s opinion, it is not possible to estimate a range of reasonably possible losses with respect to other litigation contingencies.The investment management industry also is subject to extensive levels of ongoing regulatory oversight and examination. In the United States, United Kingdom, and other jurisdictions in which the company operates, governmental authorities regularly make inquiries, hold investigations and administer market conduct examinations with respect to compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Additional lawsuits or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of these inquiries may in the future be filed against the company and related entities and individuals in the United States, United Kingdom, and other jurisdictions in which the company and its affiliates operate. Any material loss of investor and/or client confidence as a result of such inquiries and/or litigation could result in a significant decline in assets under management, which would have an adverse effect on the company’s future financial results and its ability to grow its business.In a separate matter, a Canadian subsidiary of the company has received assessments related to various prior taxation periods for goods and services tax on revenue to which management fee rebates had been applied in those periods. The assessments, related interest, and penalty amounts are approximately $21.1 million. The trial between Invesco Canada Ltd. and the Canada Revenue Agency, argued in the Tax Court of Canada, concluded in May 2014, and the company is waiting for the Tax Court decision. Management believes Canada Revenue Agency's claims are unfounded and that these assessments are unlikely to stand, and accordingly no provision has been recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.28Table of Contents   12.

Equity securities are valued under the market approach through use of quoted prices on an exchange. To the extent these securities are actively traded, valuation adjustments are not applied and they are categorized within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy; otherwise, they are categorized in level 2.Fixed income securities are fair valued using an evaluated quote provided by an independent pricing service. Evaluated quotes provided by the pricing service may be determined without exclusive reliance on quoted prices, and may reflect appropriate factors such as institution-size trading in similar groups of securities, developments related to specific securities, yield, quality, type of issue, coupon rate, maturity, individual trading characteristics and other market data. Depending on the nature of the inputs, these investments are categorized as level 1, 2, or 3.The following tables show a reconciliation of the beginning and ending fair value measurements for level 3 assets using significant unobservable inputs: Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, $ in millions2014 2013 2014 2013Beginning balance24.1 — 16.2 —Consolidation of CSIP— 13.2 — 13.2Purchases3.0 — 7.0 —Sales(0.2) — (0.5) —Gains and losses included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income*0.3 — 4.5 —Ending balance27.2 13.2 27.2 13.2__________________*Included in other income/(loss) of CSIP, net, in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 are $0.3 million and $4.5 million in net unrealized gains attributable to investments still held at September 30, 2014 (three and nine months ended September 30, 2013: none).30Table of Contents   13.

Therefore, the gains or losses of CIP have not had a significant impact on the company's net income attributable to common shareholders, liquidity or capital resources. The company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, these investments, beyond the company's minimal direct investments in, and management and performance fees generated from, the investment products. If the company were to liquidate, these investments would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider investments held by CIP to be company assets. Additionally, the collateral assets of consolidated collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the CLOs, and the investors in the consolidated CLOs have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the CLOs.At September 30, 2014, the company's maximum risk of loss in significant VIEs in which the company is not the primary beneficiary is presented in the table below.$ in millionsFootnote Reference Carrying Value Company's Maximum Risk of LossCLO investments3 4.1 4.1Partnership and trust investments 16.7 16.7Investments in Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc. 30.1 30.1Total    50.9During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, the company invested in and consolidated five new VIEs and one VOE.

For transfers to public offerings, the company's policy is to use the fair value of the transferred security on the offering date. Unforeseen events might occur that would subsequently change the fair values of the investments and debt of CIP, but such changes would be inconsequential to the company due to its minimal investments in these products. Any gains or losses resulting from valuation changes in the investments and debt of CIP are substantially offset by resulting changes in gains and losses attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities and therefore do not have a material effect on the financial condition, operating results (including earnings per share), liquidity or capital resources of the company's common shareholders. Fair value of consolidated CLOsThe company elected the fair value option for collateral assets held and notes issued by its consolidated CLOs to eliminate the measurement and recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise from measuring assets and liabilities and recognizing the related gains and losses on different accounting bases.37Table of Contents   The collateral assets held by consolidated CLOs are primarily invested in senior secured bank loans, bonds, and equity securities. Bank loan investments, which comprise the majority of consolidated CLO portfolio collateral, are senior secured corporate loans from a variety of industries, including but not limited to the aerospace and defense, broadcasting, technology, utilities, household products, healthcare, oil and gas, and finance industries. Bank loan investments mature at various dates between 2015 and 2022, pay interest at Libor plus a spread of up to 15.0%, and typically range in S&P credit rating categories from BBB down to unrated. Interest income on bank loans and bonds is recognized based on the unpaid principal balance and stated interest rate of these investments on an accrual basis. At September 30, 2014, the unpaid principal balance exceeds the fair value of the senior secured bank loans and bonds by approximately $15.0 million (December 31, 2013: the unpaid principal balance exceeded the fair value of the senior secured bank loans and bonds by approximately $6.3 million). Approximately 0.1% of the collateral assets are in default as of September 30, 2014 (December 31, 2013: 0.8% of the collateral assets were in default). CLO investments are valued based on price quotations provided by third party pricing sources. These third party sources aggregate indicative price quotations daily to provide the company with a price for the CLO investments. The company has developed internal controls to review the reasonableness and completeness of these price quotations on a daily basis. If necessary, price quotations are challenged through the third-party pricing source price challenge process. For the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and the year ended December 31, 2013, there were no price quotation challenges by the company. In addition, the company's internal valuation committee conducts an annual due diligence review of all independent third-party pricing sources to review the provider's valuation methodology as well as ensure internal controls exist over the valuation of the CLO investments. In the event that the third-party pricing source is unable to price an investment, other relevant factors, data and information are considered, including: i) information relating to the market for the investment, including price quotations for and trading in the investment and interests in similar investments, the market environment, and investor attitudes towards the investment and interests in similar investments; ii) the characteristics of and fundamental analytical data relating to the investment, including, for senior secured corporate loans, the cost, size, current interest rate, period until next interest rate reset, maturity and base lending rate, the terms and conditions of the senior secured corporate loan and any related agreements, and the position of the senior secured corporate loan in the borrower's debt structure; iii) the nature, adequacy and value of the senior secured corporate loan's collateral, including the CLO's rights, remedies and interests with respect to the collateral; iv) for senior secured corporate loans, the creditworthiness of the borrower, based on an evaluation of its financial condition, financial statements and information about the business, cash flows, capital structure and future prospects; v) the reputation and financial condition of the agent and any intermediate participants in the senior secured corporate loan; and vi) general economic and market conditions affecting the fair value of the senior secured corporate loan.Notes issued by consolidated CLOs mature at various dates between 2020 and 2026 and have a weighted average maturity of 9.6 years. The notes are issued in various tranches with different risk profiles. The interest rates are generally variable rates based on Libor plus a pre-defined spread, which varies from 0.21% for the more senior tranches to 6.10% for the more subordinated tranches. At September 30, 2014, the outstanding balance on the notes issued by consolidated CLOs exceeds their fair value by approximately $0.2 billion (December 31, 2013: $0.2 billion excess). The investors in this debt are not affiliated with the company and have no recourse to the general credit of the company for this debt. Notes issued by CLOs are recorded at fair value using an income approach, driven by cash flows expected to be received from the portfolio collateral assets. Fair value is determined using current information, notably market yields and projected cash flows of collateral assets based on forecasted default and recovery rates that a market participant would use in determining the current fair value of the notes, taking into account the overall credit quality of the issuers and the company's past experience in managing similar securities. Market yields, default rates and recovery rates used in the company's estimate of fair value vary based on the nature of the investments in the underlying collateral pools. In periods of rising market yields, default rates and lower debt recovery rates, the fair value, and therefore the carrying value, of the notes may be adversely affected. The current liquidity constraints within the market for CLO products require the use of certain unobservable inputs for CLO valuation. Once the undiscounted cash flows of the collateral assets have been determined, the company applies appropriate discount rates that a market participant would use to determine the discounted cash flow valuation of the notes. Fair value of consolidated private equity fundsConsolidated private equity funds are generally structured as partnerships. Generally, the investment strategy of underlying holdings in these partnerships is to seek capital appreciation through direct investments in public or private companies with compelling business models or ideas or through investments in partnership investments that also invest in similar private or public companies. Various strategies may be used. Companies targeted could be distressed organizations, targets of leveraged buyouts or fledgling companies in need of venture capital. Investors generally may not redeem their investment until the partnership liquidates. Generally, the partnerships have a life that ranges from seven to twelve years unless dissolved earlier. The general partner may extend the partnership term up to a specified period of time as stated in the Partnership Agreement. Some partnerships allow the limited partners to cause an earlier termination upon the occurrence of certain events as specified in the Partnership Agreement.38Table of Contents   For private equity partnerships, fair value is determined by reviewing each investment for the sale of additional securities of an issuer to sophisticated investors or for investee financial conditions and fundamentals. Publicly traded portfolio investments are carried at market value as determined by their most recent quoted sale, or if there is no recent sale, at their most recent bid price. For these investments held by CIP, level 1 classification indicates that fair values have been determined using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets that the partnership has the ability to access. Level 2 classification may indicate that fair values have been determined using quoted prices in active markets but give effect to certain lock-up restrictions surrounding the holding period of the underlying investments.The fair value of level 3 investments held are derived from inputs that are unobservable and which reflect the limited partnerships' own determinations about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the investments, including assumptions about risk. These inputs are developed based on the partnership's own data, which is adjusted if information indicates that market participants would use different assumptions. The partnerships which invest directly into private equity portfolio companies (direct private equity funds) take into account various market conditions, subsequent rounds of financing, liquidity, financial condition, purchase multiples paid in other comparable third-party transactions, the price of securities of other companies comparable to the portfolio company, and operating results and other financial data of the portfolio company, as applicable. The partnerships which invest into other private equity funds take into account information received from those underlying funds, including their reported net asset values and evidence as to their fair value approach, including consistency of their fair value application. These investments do not trade in active markets and represent illiquid long-term investments that generally require future capital commitments. The partnerships' reported share of the underlying net asset values of the underlying funds is used as a practical expedient, as allowed by ASC Topic 820, in arriving at fair value. 39Table of Contents   Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value MeasurementsThe following tables show significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of level 3 assets and liabilities at September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013:Assets and Liabilities * Fair Value at September 30, 2014($ in millions) Valuation Technique Unobservable Inputs Range Weighted Average (by fair value)Private Equity Funds --Equity Securities 38.6 Market Comparable Revenue Multiple 1 - 5x 3.0x      Discount 25% - 36% 30.9%           CLO Debt (4,710.3) Discounted Cash Flow- USD Assumed Default Rate*** 0.8% - 2% <1yr: 0.8% >1yr: 2.0%      Spread over Libor ** 93 - 754bps 206 bpsAssets and Liabilities * Fair Value at December 31, 2013($ in millions) Valuation Technique Unobservable Inputs Range Weighted Average (by fair value)Private Equity Funds --Equity Securities 58.7 Market Comparable Revenue Multiple 1 - 5x 3.0x      Discount n/a 24.0%CLO Debt (4,181.7) Discounted Cash Flow- USD Assumed Default Rate*** 1% - 2% <1yr: 1.4% >1yr: 2.0%      Spread over Libor ** 123 - 864bps 208 bps____________*Excluded from the table above are certain equity securities held by consolidated private equity funds valued using recent private market transactions (September 30, 2014: $54.3 million; December 31, 2013: $5.8 million) and third party appraisals (September 30, 2014: $5.8 million; December 31, 2013: none). At September 30, 2014, certain tranches of the consolidated CLOs are valued using third party pricing information. Quantitative unobservable inputs for such valuations were not developed or adjusted by the company. Investments in equity securities and other private equity funds as of September 30, 2014 of $603.9 million  (as of December 31, 2013: $442.2 million ) are also excluded from the table above as they are valued using the NAV practical expedient. The NAVs that have been provided are derived from the fair values of the underlying investments as of the consolidation date. **Lower spreads relate to the more senior tranches in the CLO note structure; higher spreads relate to the less senior tranches.***Assumed default rates listed in the table above apply to CLOs established prior to 2012. A default rate of 1.4% was assumed for CLOs established after January 1, 2012.The table below summarizes as of September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the nature of investments that are valued using the NAV as a practical expedient and any related liquidation restrictions or other factors which may impact the ultimate value realized:  September 30, 2014 December 31, 2013in millions, except term data Fair Value Total Unfunded Commitments Weighted Average Remaining Term (2) Fair Value Total Unfunded Commitments Weighted Average Remaining Term (2)Private equity fund of funds (1) $425.2 $191.2 2.4 years $426.3 $71.6 2.6 yearsPrivate equity funds (1) $178.7 $707.8 9.0 years $15.9 $80.6 8.5 years(1)These investments are not subject to redemption; however, for certain funds, the investors may sell or transfer their interest, which may require approval by the general partner of the underlying funds. (2)These investments are expected to be returned through distributions as a result of liquidations of the funds' underlying assets over the weighted average periods indicated.40Table of Contents   The following narrative will indicate the sensitivity of inputs illustrating the impact of significant increases to the inputs. An opposite impact would result for significant decreases in these inputs:•For investments held by consolidated private equity funds, significant increases in discounts in isolation would result in significantly lower fair value measurements, while significant increases in revenue multiple assumptions in isolation would result in significantly higher fair value measurements. An increase in discount assumptions would result in a directionally opposite change in the assumptions for revenue multiple resulting in lower fair value measurements. •For CLO notes, a change in the assumption used for spreads is generally accompanied by a directionally similar change in default rate. Significant increases in any of these inputs in isolation would result in significantly lower fair value measurements.14.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS On December 31, 2013, the company completed the sale of Atlantic Trust Private Wealth Management business ("Atlantic Trust") to the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ("CIBC") for a base purchase price of $210 million less certain working capital and cash funding requirements. The results of Atlantic Trust, together with expenses and the gain associated with the sale, are reflected as discontinued operations in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and are therefore excluded from the continuing operations of Invesco. Comparative periods shown in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income have been adjusted to conform with this presentation.41Table of Contents   The components of income from discontinued operations, net of tax, were as follows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTSOn October 30, 2014, the company declared a second quarter 2014 dividend of 25.0 cents per share, payable on December 5, 2014, to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 18, 2014 with an ex-dividend date of November 14, 2014.42Table of Contents   Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking StatementsThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, which appear elsewhere in this Report.

This overview and the remainder of this management's discussion and analysis supplements and should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Invesco Ltd. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “company” or “Invesco”) and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Report.During the three months ended September 30, 2014, returns from global equity markets were mixed as volatility returned to global financial markets. The U.S. and Japanese equity markets increased during the quarter as evidenced by gains in the S&P 500 index, which was up 0.6%, and the Nikkei 225 index up 6.7%. The U.K. markets and wider emerging markets experienced declines of 1.8% and 4.3%, respectively. After hitting all-time highs intra-quarter, the combination of geopolitical worries and softer economic data in certain developed markets resulted in global equity markets selling off in the last month of the quarter. The sell-off in risk assets in September supported bonds as investors sought U.S. Treasuries for their relative safety and value, pushing the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index up 0.2% for the period.The table below summarizes returns based on price appreciation/(depreciation) of several major market indices in local currencies for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and 2013: Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,Equity Index2014 2013 2014 2013S&P 5000.6 % 4.7% 6.7 % 17.9 %FTSE 100(1.8)% 4.0% (1.9)% 9.6 %Nikkei 2256.7 % 5.7% (0.7)% 39.1 %MSCI Emerging Markets(4.3)% 5.0% 0.3 % (6.4)%Bond Index       Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond0.2 % 0.6% 4.1 % (1.9)%A significant portion of our business and assets under management (AUM) is based outside of the U.S. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. Dollar against other currencies, primarily the Pound Sterling, Canadian dollar, Yen and Euro, will impact our reported revenues and expenses from period to period. Additionally, our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our AUM. Therefore, movements in global capital market levels, net new business inflows (or 43Table of Contents   outflows) and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period.Invesco benefits from the long-term efforts to ensure a diversified base of AUM. One of Invesco's core strengths, and a key differentiator for the company within the industry, is our broad diversification across client domiciles, asset classes and distribution channels. Our geographical diversification recognizes growth opportunities in different parts of the world. This broad diversification mitigates the impact on Invesco of different market cycles and enables the company to take advantage of growth opportunities in various markets and channels.During the third quarter of 2014, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services upgraded the company's senior unsecured debt rating to A/Stable from A-/Positive. On October 14, 2014, Moody's Investors Service upgraded their rating of the company's debt to A2/Stable from A3/Stable. The upgrade reflected Moody's view that Invesco has broken into the top tier of scale-enabled asset managers. The Moody's announcement commented that the company's growing market presence, broad investment capabilities, multi-faceted distribution channels, and financial flexibility all support this conclusion.On July 23, 2014, the SEC voted to approve new rules to require institutional prime money market funds and institutional municipal money market funds to maintain a floating net asset value (FNAV) for sales and redemptions based on the current market value of the securities in their portfolio. The requirement will result in the daily share price of these money market funds fluctuating along with changes in the market-based value of the funds' investments. Our initial evaluation of these new rules suggests that they will apply to approximately $30 billion of our AUM. The changes will need to be implemented by October 2016. Retaining highly skilled technical and management personnel is important to our ability to attract and retain clients and retail shareholder accounts. Our policy has been to provide our investment management professionals with a supportive professional working environment and compensation and benefits that we believe are competitive with other leading investment management firms. However, we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel, and the loss of key individuals or significant investment management personnel can reduce the attractiveness of our products to potential and current clients. On April 29, 2014, the former head of U.K. Equities, Neil Woodford, left the company. The company executed its succession planning strategy, and effective March 6, 2014, Mark Barnett became the named lead manager for the Invesco Perpetual High Income Fund and the Invesco Perpetual Income Fund, previously managed by Mr. Woodford.  Between the announcement of Mr. Woodford's departure on October 15, 2013 and April 29, 2014, U.K. equity income AUM experienced net outflows of $15.5 billion. U.K. equity income AUM net outflows reduced to $1.9 billion during the third quarter of 2014, a significant improvement when compared to the first half of the year.Invesco introduced a single Fund Management Fee (FMF) during the second quarter of 2014 for U.K. retail funds, replacing the separate annual management fee and registration fee. This simplified fee structure is a proactive response to the regulatory promotion of providing clients with a clear disclosure of product charges. Invesco's U.K. business has taken the lead in the industry in moving to this single FMF. The U.K. business' move to the single FMF and the change to distribution fees are not expected to have a significant impact on net revenues as investors move into these offerings. In the U.S., the SEC has previously proposed and may repropose significant changes to Rule 12b-1. Other countries have announced similar distribution fee reviews.Presentation of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsThe company provides investment management services to, and has transactions with, various private equity, real estate, fund-of-funds, collateralized loan obligation products (CLOs), and other investment entities sponsored by the company for the investment of client assets in the normal course of business. The company serves as the investment manager, making day-to-day investment decisions concerning the assets of the products.Investment products that are consolidated are referred to in this Report as either Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products (CSIP), which generally includes consolidated sponsored investment products in which Invesco holds the majority of the voting rights or partnerships in which the company has substantive equity at risk but in which the other investors lack removal or liquidation rights, or Consolidated Investment Products (CIP), which includes consolidated nominally-held investment products. This distinction is important, as it differentiates the company's economic risk associated with each type of consolidated managed fund. The company's economic risk with respect to each investment in a CSIP and a CIP is limited to its equity ownership and any uncollected management and performance fees. Gains and losses arising from nominally-held CIP do not have a significant impact on the company's results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources. Gains and losses arising from majority-held CSIP could have a significant impact on the company's results of operations, as the company has greater economic risk associated with its investment. See Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, - Note 1 "Accounting Policies," Note 12, 44Table of Contents   "Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products," and Note 13, "Consolidated Investment Products," for additional information regarding the impact of the consolidation of managed funds.The majority of the company's CIP balances are CLO-related. The collateral assets of the CLOs are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the CLOs. The company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the CLOs, beyond the company's minimal direct investments in, and management and performance fees generated from, the CLOs. If the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. Likewise, the investors in the CLOs have no recourse to the general credit of the company for the notes issued by the CLOs. The company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability. The impact of CIP is so significant to the presentation of the company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (but not to the underlying financial condition or results of operations of the company) that the company has elected to deconsolidate these products in its non-GAAP disclosures. The following discussion therefore combines the results presented under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) with the company’s non-GAAP presentation. This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains four distinct sections, which follow after the Assets Under Management discussion:•Results of Operations (three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to three and nine months ended September 30, 2013); •Schedule of Non-GAAP Information; •Balance Sheet Discussion; and •Liquidity and Capital Resources. Each of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statement summary sections (Results of Operations, Balance Sheet Discussion, and Liquidity and Capital Resources) begins with a table illustrating the impact of CIP relative to the company's consolidated totals. The impact is illustrated by a column which shows the dollar-value change in the consolidated figures, as caused by the consolidation of CIP. For example, the impact of CIP on operating revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 was a reduction of $8.6 million and a reduction of $25.6 million, respectively. This indicates that their consolidation reduced consolidated revenues by this amount, reflecting the elimination upon their consolidation of the operating revenues earned by Invesco for managing these investment products.The narrative in each of these sections separately provides discussion of the underlying financial statement activity for the company, before consolidation of CIP, as well as of the financial statement activity of CIP. Additionally, wherever a non-GAAP measure is referenced, a disclosure will follow in the narrative or in the note referring the reader to the Schedule of Non-GAAP Information, where additional details regarding the use of the non-GAAP measure by the company are disclosed, along with reconciliations of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures to the non-GAAP measures. To further enhance the readability of the Results of Operations section, separate tables for each of the revenue, expense, and other income and expenses (non-operating income/expense) sections of the income statement introduce the narrative that follows, providing a section-by-section review of the company’s income statements for the periods presented.45Table of Contents   Summary Operating InformationSummary operating information is presented in the table below:$ in millions, other than per share amounts, operating margins, ratios and AUMThree months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,U.S. GAAP Financial Measures Summary (1)2014 2013 2014 2013Operating revenues1,311.0 1,171.8 3,870.4 3,419.5Operating income329.6 286.0 928.7 826.9Operating margin25.1% 24.4% 24.0% 24.2%Net income attributable to common shareholders256.0 228.1 718.3 652.9Diluted EPS0.59 0.51 1.65 1.45Debt/equity ratio including CIP (%)68.9% 59.1% 68.9% 59.1%        Non-GAAP Financial Measures Summary       Net revenues (2)913.7 816.4 2,702.5 2,394.7Adjusted operating income (3)381.9 328.1 1,121.9 944.9Adjusted operating margin (3)41.8% 40.2% 41.5% 39.5%Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders (4)278.2 246.0 822.2 695.2Adjusted diluted EPS (4)0.64 0.55 1.88 1.55Debt/equity ratio excluding CIP (%) (5)18.9% 16.5% 18.9% 16.5%        Assets Under Management (1)       Ending AUM (billions)789.6 745.5 789.6 745.5Average AUM (billions)801.7 729.4 790.5 713.6_________(1)On December 31, 2013, the company completed the sale of Atlantic Trust. The company has adopted a discontinued operations presentation for the disposed business. Amounts presented represent continuing operations and exclude Atlantic Trust, with the exception of net income attributable to common shareholders and diluted earnings per share. (2)Net revenues is a non-GAAP financial measure. Net revenues are operating revenues plus our proportional share of the net revenues of our joint venture investments, less third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, plus management and performance fees earned from CIP, less other revenue recorded by CIP, plus other reconciling items. See "Schedule of Non-GAAP Information," for the reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues.(3)Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted operating margin is adjusted operating income divided by net revenues. Adjusted operating income includes operating income plus our proportional share of the net operating income of our joint venture investments, the operating income impact of the consolidation of investment products, acquisition/disposition-related adjustments, compensation expense related to market valuation changes in deferred compensation plans, and other reconciling items. See "Schedule of Non-GAAP Information," for the reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income.(4)Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders and adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders is net income attributable to common shareholders adjusted to exclude the net income of CIP, add back acquisition/disposition related adjustments, the net income impact of deferred compensation plans and other reconciling items. Adjustments made to net income attributable to common shareholders are tax-effected in arriving at adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders. By calculation, adjusted diluted EPS is adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (for diluted EPS). See "Schedule of Non-GAAP Information," for the reconciliation of net income attributable to common shareholders to adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders.(5)The debt-to-equity ratio excluding CIP is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section for a recalculation of this ratio and other important disclosures.46Table of Contents   Investment Capabilities Performance OverviewInvesco's first strategic priority is to achieve strong investment performance over the long-term for our clients.

Peer group rankings are sourced from a widely-used third party ranking agency in each fund's market (Lipper, Morningstar, IMA, Russell, Mercer, eVestment Alliance, SITCA, Value Research) and are asset-weighted in USD. Rankings are as of prior quarter-end for most institutional products and preceding month-end for Australian retail funds due to their late release by third parties. Rankings for the most representative fund in each Global Investment Performance Standard (GIPS) composite are applied to all products within each GIPS composite. Excludes passive products, closed-end funds, private equity limited partnerships, non-discretionary direct real estate, unit investment trusts, fund-of-funds with component funds managed by Invesco, stable value building block funds, and CDOs. Certain funds and products were excluded from the analysis because of limited benchmark or peer group data. Had these been available, results may have been different. These results are preliminary and subject to revision. Performance assumes the reinvestment of dividends. Past performance is not indicative of future results and may not reflect an investor's experience.As of September 30, 2014, 76%, 81% and 81% of ranked actively managed assets performed in the top half of peer groups on a one-year, three-year and five-year basis respectively. The U.K., Canadian, Asian, European and Global Ex U.S. and Emerging Markets equities have had strong relative performance, with 85% or more of assets beating their benchmark over three- and five-year periods. Additionally, the U.K., Canadian, European and Global Ex U.S. and Emerging Markets reflect strong performance with 98% or more of assets beating peers on a five-year basis. Within our fixed income asset class, Stable Value products have achieved excellent long-term performance with 100% of AUM ahead of benchmark and in the top half on a one-, three- and five-year basis.47Table of Contents   Assets Under Management movements for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared with the three months ended September 30, 2013The following presentation and discussion of AUM includes Passive and Active AUM. Passive AUM include ETFs, UITs, leveraged fund balances upon which we do not earn a fee, and other passive mandates. Active AUM are total AUM less Passive AUM.The AUM tables and the discussion below refer to AUM as long-term and short-term. Short-term AUM include institutional money market and Invesco PowerShares QQQ AUM.

Our share of the average AUM in the three months ended September 30, 2014 for our JVs in China was $5.1 billion (three months ended September 30, 2013: $4.0 billion). It is appropriate to exclude the average AUM of our JVs for purposes of computing gross revenue yield on AUM because the revenues resulting from these AUM are not presented in our operating revenues. Under U.S. GAAP, our share of the net income of the JVs is recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Additionally, the numerator of the gross revenue yield measure, operating revenues, excludes the management fees earned from CIP; however, the denominator of the measure includes the AUM of these investment products. Therefore, the gross revenue yield measure is not considered representative of the company's true effective fee rate from AUM. (2)Net revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized net revenues divided by average AUM. See “Schedule of Non-GAAP Information” for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues.FlowsAUM at September 30, 2014 were $789.6 billion (September 30, 2013: $745.5 billion). During the three months ended September 30, 2014, we experienced long-term net inflows of $6.0 billion. We also experienced net outflows in Invesco PowerShares QQQ fund of $3.2 billion, along with net outflows in institutional money market funds of $0.8 billion during the three months ended September 30, 2014. Net inflows during the three months ended September 30, 2014 of $6.0 billion were all in active AUM. Net inflows were split between our retail distribution channel of $4.8 billion and our institutional channel of 48Table of Contents   $1.2 billion. On a client domicile basis, long-term net inflows of $4.3 billion and $2.3 billion were experienced in Continental Europe and Asia respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2014.During the three months ended September 30, 2013, we experienced total net inflows of $9.1 billion and long-term net inflows of $5.0 billion. Invesco PowerShares QQQ fund and institutional money market funds also reflected net inflows of $0.8 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2013. Long-term net inflows during the three months ended September 30, 2013 were primarily active AUM, with inflows of $4.8 billion, while passive AUM had $0.2 billion inflows. Long-term net flows in the three months ended September 30, 2013 were driven by net inflows of $6.5 billion into our retail distribution channel, offset by net outflows from our institutional channel of $1.5 billion. We experienced net long-term inflows in our equity, alternatives and balanced asset classes, partially offset by net outflows in our fixed income and money market AUM. Average AUM during the three months ended September 30, 2014 were $801.7 billion, compared to $729.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2013.Market ReturnsDuring the three months ended September 30, 2014, negative market movement decreased AUM by $5.1 billion, with the losses spread across the alternatives asset class of $2.1 billion, balanced asset class of $1.4 billion, equity asset class of $1.2 billion and fixed income asset class of $0.5 billion. During the three months ended September 30, 2013, market gains increased AUM by $22.4 billion and included increases in the market value of our equity assets of $20.7 billion, balanced fund assets of $2.3 billion and money market assets of $0.2 billion. These market valuation gains were partly offset by a decrease of $0.7 billion in the value of our fixed income asset class, with the alternative asset classes also experiencing market losses of $0.1 billion. Foreign Exchange RatesThe table below illustrates the spot foreign exchange rates used for translation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated AUM into U.S. Dollars:Foreign Exchange RatesSeptember 30, 2014 June 30, 2014 September 30, 2013 June 30, 2013Pound Sterling ($ per £)1.622 1.710 1.619 1.518Canadian Dollar (CAD per $)1.118 1.066 1.029 1.054Japan (¥ per $)109.680 101.310 98.120 99.320Euro ($ per Euro)1.262 1.369 1.353 1.300During the three months ended September 30, 2014, we experienced decreases in AUM of $9.7 billion due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Changes in foreign exchange rates in the three months ended September 30, 2014 were driven primarily by the weakening of the Pound Sterling relative to the U.S. Dollar, which was reflected in the translation of our Pound Sterling-based AUM into U.S. Dollars. The Canadian Dollar, Japanese Yen and Euro also weakened relative to the U.S. Dollar, which was reflected in the translation of our Canadian Dollar-based, Japanese Yen-based and Euro-based AUM into U.S. Dollars, respectively. The impact of the change in foreign exchange rates in the three months ended September 30, 2013 was driven primarily by the strengthening of the Pound Sterling relative to the U.S. Dollar, which was reflected in the translation of our Sterling-based AUM into U.S. Dollars. Revenue YieldNet revenue yield on AUM increased 0.8 basis points to 45.6 basis points in the three months ended September 30, 2014  when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2013 yield of 44.8 basis points. Excluding performance fees, the net revenue yield increased 0.8 basis points to 45.1 basis points in the three months ended September 30, 2014 (three months ended September 30, 2013: 44.3 basis points).Changes in our AUM mix significantly impact our net revenue yield. For example, on an asset class basis, our equity and balanced AUM generally earn a higher net revenue rate than money market and fixed income AUM. The combination of average equity and average balanced AUM increased to 55.8% in the three months ended September 30, 2014 from 54.0% of total average AUM in the three months ended September 30, 2013. This resulted in a lower proportion of average assets in money market and fixed income AUM in the three months ended September 30, 2014 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2013. This change in asset class mix correlates with the increase in net revenue yield on AUM before 49Table of Contents   performance fees in the three months ended September 30, 2014 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2013.Changes in the geographic mix of our AUM have also factored into the improved revenue yield. Sales have been strong in our Continental European business during recent quarters. As of September 30, 2014, the AUM attributable to clients domiciled in Continental Europe accounts for 9.0% of total AUM compared to 6.9% as of September 30, 2013. On average, the AUM in Continental Europe earn a higher fee rate than the company's average fee rate for existing total AUM.The tables that follow analyze AUM into active and passive style. Passive AUM generally earn a lower effective fee rate than active asset classes. At September 30, 2014, passive AUM were $142.1 billion, representing 18.0% of total AUM at that date; whereas at September 30, 2013, passive AUM were $129.6 billion, representing 17.4% of our total AUM at that date. In the three months ended September 30, 2014, the net revenue yield on passive AUM was 13.0 basis points compared to 11.8 basis points in the three months ended September 30, 2013, an increase of 1.2 basis points, due to changes in mix of passive AUM.The increase in passive AUM includes the movements in the Powershares QQQ Nasdaq-100 index tracking fund. The Powershares QQQ fund AUM increased to $42.9 billion at September 30, 2014 compared to $38.5 billion at September 30, 2013. The revenue yield for Invesco on this product is less than 1 basis point, reimbursing Invesco for the portfolio trading services provided to the fund, and flows into and out of this product therefore have a significant impact on the overall net revenue yield and are a significant factor in the year-over-year yield changes.Gross revenue yield on AUM increased 1.2 basis points to 65.8 basis points in the three months ended September 30, 2014 from the three months ended September 30, 2013 level of 64.6 basis points. Management does not consider gross revenue yield, the most comparable U.S. GAAP-based measure to net revenue yield, to be a meaningful effective fee rate measure for the reasons outlined in footnote 1 to the Changes in AUM table above. See “Schedule of Non-GAAP Information” for a reconciliation of operating revenues (gross revenues) to net revenues.Changes in our AUM by channel, asset class, and client domicile, and average AUM by

The impact is illustrated in the tables immediately below by a column which shows the dollar-value change in the consolidated figures, as caused by the consolidation of CIP. For example, the impact of CIP on total operating revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2014 was a reduction of $8.6 million. This indicates that the consolidation of CIP reduced consolidated revenues by $8.6 million, primarily reflecting the elimination upon consolidation of the revenues earned by Invesco for managing these investment products. The discussion below includes the use of non-GAAP financial measures. See “Schedule of Non-GAAP Information” for additional details and reconciliations of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures to the non-GAAP measures.55Table of Contents   Summary of Income Statement Impact of CIP Three months ended September 30, 2014 2013$ in millionsImpact of CIP Invesco Ltd.

Net revenues increased by 11.9% in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $913.7 million (three months ended September 30, 2013: $816.4 million). Net revenues are operating revenues less third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, plus our proportional share of net revenues from joint venture arrangements, plus management and performance fees earned from, less other revenues recorded by, CIP, plus other reconciling items. See “Schedule of Non-GAAP Information” for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. A significant portion of our business and AUM is based outside of the U.S. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. Dollar against other currencies, primarily the Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen will impact our reported 56Table of Contents   revenues and expenses from period to period. The income statements of foreign currency subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars, the reporting currency of the company, using average foreign exchange rates. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased operating revenues by $10.7 million, equivalent to 0.8% of total operating revenues, during the three months ended September 30, 2014 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2013. Additionally, our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our AUM. Therefore, movements in global capital market levels, net new business inflows (or outflows) and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period. As discussed in the Executive Overview, returns from capital markets were mixed in the three months ended September 30, 2014. Investment Management FeesInvestment management fees increased by $132.9 million (14.5%) in the three months ended September 30, 2014, to $1,047.3 million (three months ended September 30, 2013: $914.4 million). In April 2014, our UK Invesco Perpetual business introduced a single Fund Management Fee (FMF) for their retail funds to replace the separate annual management fee and registration fee. This resulted in an increase in investment management fees of $29.9 million and a corresponding reduction in service and distribution fees during the three months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to the same period in 2013. After adjusting for the introduction of the single FMF, the increase is equivalent to 11.5%. This compares to a 9.9% increase in average AUM and a 10.9% increase in average long-term AUM. As discussed above, the net revenue yield is higher in the three months ended September 30, 2014 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2013, reflecting the change in AUM weighting to higher fee-earning asset classes. See the company's disclosures regarding the changes in AUM and revenue yields during the three months ended September 30, 2014 in the “Assets Under Management” section above for additional information regarding the movements in AUM. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased investment management fees by $11.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2013. Service and Distribution FeesIn the three months ended September 30, 2014, service and distribution fees increased by $1.4 million (0.6%) to $222.1 million (three months ended September 30, 2013: $220.7 million). The increase is driven by the increases in average AUM and revenue yields, as well as a new recurring asset-based service fee that began in 2014. The increase is offset by the introduction of a single FMF for several UK funds as noted above, which reduced service and distribution fees by $29.9 million in 2014 as compared to 2013. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased service and distribution fees by $0.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2013. Performance FeesOf our $789.6 billion in AUM at September 30, 2014, approximately $47.3 billion or 6.0%, could potentially earn performance fees, including carried interests and performance fees related to partnership investments and separate accounts. Cash receipt of performance fees generally occurs after the contractual measurement date; however, the company may receive, from time-to-time, cash distributions of carried interest before the measurement date. The company does not recognize performance fee revenues if there are any future performance contingencies associated with them. As such, these fees are generally not recorded as revenue until the likelihood of claw-back is mathematically improbable. At such point, the associated revenues are considered earned. In the three months ended September 30, 2014, performance fees increased by $3.1 million (60.8%) to $8.2 million when compared to the performance fees in three months ended September 30, 2013 of $5.1 million. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased performance fees by $0.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2013. Other RevenuesIn the three months ended September 30, 2014, other revenues increased by $1.8 million (5.7%) to $33.4 million (three months ended September 30, 2013: $31.6 million). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements decreased other revenues $0.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2013. After allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the increase in other revenues was $2.0 million. The increase in other revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2013 includes increases in UIT revenues of $2.8 million, mutual fund front end fees of $1.7 million and other revenues of $1.7 million. These increases were partially offset by decreases in real estate acquisition and disposition fees of $3.7 million, and transaction commissions of $0.4 million. 57Table of Contents   Third-Party Distribution, Service and Advisory Expenses Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses increased by $39.3 million (10.3%) in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $420.2 million (three months ended September 30, 2013: $380.9 million). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses by $3.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2013. After allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the increase in third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses was $35.9 million, which includes increases in distribution fees of $21.5 million, renewal commissions of $6.8 million, transfer agent fees of $3.9 million, external commissions of $3.3 million and administration fees of $0.3 million. The overall increase is reflective of the higher related retail management fees.Proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investmentsManagement believes that the addition of our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture arrangements should be added to operating revenues to arrive at net revenues, as it is important to evaluate the contribution to the business that our joint venture arrangements are making. See “Schedule of Non-GAAP Information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. The company's most significant joint venture arrangement is our 49% investment in Invesco Great Wall Fund Management Company Limited (the “Invesco Great Wall” joint venture). Our proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments increased by $0.8 million (5.9%) to $14.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2014 (three months ended September 30, 2013: $13.5 million). Our share of the Invesco Great Wall joint venture's average AUM for the three months ended September 30, 2014 was $5.1 billion compared to $4.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2013. The increase in our share of net revenue is proportionately smaller than the increase in AUM due to the mix of AUM, and also due to higher third-party fees in 2014 as compared to 2013.Management, performance and other fees earned from CIPManagement believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a reader's analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company. Accordingly, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues for the impact of CIP in calculating net revenues. As management and performance fees earned by Invesco from the consolidated products are eliminated upon consolidation of the investment products, management believes that it is appropriate to add these operating revenues back in the calculation of net revenues. See “Schedule of Non-GAAP Information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. The elimination of management and performance fees earned from CIP was $8.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 (three months ended September 30, 2013: $12.0 million), while other revenues from CIP were $0.1 million (three months ended September 30, 2013: none). The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in performance fees related to consolidated CLO notes, as well as the impact of funds deconsolidated after September 30, 2013, partially offset by the impact of newly consolidated funds.Operating ExpensesThe main categories of operating expenses, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods, are as follows:     Variance Three months ended September 30, 2014 vs 2013$ in millions2014 2013 $ Change % ChangeEmployee compensation343.8 330.3 13.5 4.1%Third-party distribution, service and advisory420.2 380.9 39.3 10.3%Marketing26.6 22.6 4.0 17.7%Property, office and technology76.4 71.9 4.5 6.3%General and administrative114.4 80.1 34.3 42.8%Total operating expenses981.4 885.8 95.6 10.8%58Table of Contents   The table below sets forth these expense categories as a percentage of total operating expenses and operating revenues, which we believe provides useful information as to the relative significance of each type of expense.$ in millionsThree months ended September 30, 2014 % of Total Operating Expenses % of Operating Revenues Three months ended September 30, 2013 % of Total Operating Expenses % of Operating RevenuesEmployee compensation343.8 35.0% 26.2% 330.3 37.3% 28.2%Third-party distribution, service and advisory420.2 42.8% 32.1% 380.9 43.0% 32.5%Marketing26.6 2.7% 2.0% 22.6 2.6% 1.9%Property, office and technology76.4 7.8% 5.8% 71.9 8.1% 6.1%General and administrative114.4 11.7% 8.7% 80.1 9.0% 6.8%Total operating expenses981.4 100.0% 74.9% 885.8 100.0% 75.5%During the three months ended September 30, 2014, operating expenses increased by $95.6 million (10.8%) to $981.4 million (three months ended September 30, 2013: $885.8 million). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased operating expenses by $5.8 million, or 0.6% of total operating expenses, during the three months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2013. Employee CompensationEmployee compensation increased $13.5 million (4.1%) to $343.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 (three months ended September 30, 2013: $330.3 million). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased employee compensation by $1.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2013. After allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the increase in employee compensation was $12.3 million.Direct compensation increased $6.8 million, primarily due to improved company performance and increased headcount. The increase includes higher base salaries and incentive compensation expenses of $13.4 million. The increases were partially offset by decreases in deferred and share based compensation of $4.0 million and commissions and other compensation costs of $2.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2014 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2013.Headcount at September 30, 2014 was 6,155 (at September 30, 2013, on a continuing operations basis: 5,864). Third-Party Distribution, Service and Advisory ExpensesThird-party distribution, service and advisory expenses are discussed above in the operating and net revenues section.MarketingMarketing expenses increased by $4.0 million (17.7%) in the three months ended September 30, 2014 to $26.6 million (three months ended September 30, 2013: $22.6 million). There was no impact of foreign exchange rate movements in marketing expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2013. The increase during the three months ended September 30, 2014 includes increases in client event expenses of $2.0 million, advertising expenses of $1.0 million and travel expenses of $1.0 million primarily in the U.S. and EMEA.Property, Office and TechnologyProperty, office and technology costs increased by $4.5 million (6.3%) to $76.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 (three months ended September 30, 2013: $71.9 million). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased property, office and technology expenses by $0.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2013. After allowing for foreign exchange rate movements, the increase was $4.0 million.Property and office costs are generally trending upwards, due to market conditions. However, the business optimization initiative undertaken in the first quarter of 2014 has partially mitigated the increases in the current period such that property and office costs increased $1.0 million (3.3%) compared to the same period in 2013. The decrease in rent and property tax expense of $0.7 million was offset by increases in property management fees of $0.6 million and other property costs of $1.0 million.59Table of Contents   Technology and communications expenses increased $3.5 million over the comparable 2013 period primarily due to increases in depreciation and maintenance of $1.8 million and increased outsourced administration and other costs of $1.4 million driven by activity in EMEA.  General and Administrative General and administrative expenses increased by $34.3 million (42.8%) to $114.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 (three months ended September 30, 2013: $80.1 million). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased general and administrative expenses by $0.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2013. After allowing for foreign exchange rate movements, general and administrative costs decreased $33.6 million compared to the same period in 2013.General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2014 include an expense of $24.2 million in respect of a multi-year fund reimbursement expense associated with historical private equity management fees. The charge resulted primarily from using a more appropriate methodology regarding the calculation of offsets to management fees. General and administrative expenses also increased $4.2 million related to higher fund launch costs of our consolidated investment products, $2.4 million of higher contractor expenses associated with the ongoing development of global technology platforms, $1.7 million of higher irrecoverable indirect taxes, $1.6 million of higher information services expenses and $1.5 million of higher travel expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the prior year. These increases were partially offset by decreases in amortization of intangible assets of $1.1 million, professional insurance expenses of $0.6 million and legal expenses of $0.4 million compared to the same period in 2013.Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income, Operating Margin and Adjusted Operating MarginOperating income increased by $43.6 million (15.2%) to $329.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 (three months ended September 30, 2013: $286.0 million). Operating margin (operating income divided by operating revenues), increased to 25.1% in the three months ended September 30, 2014 from 24.4% in the three months ended September 30, 2013. The increase in operating income and margin resulted from a higher relative increase in operating revenues (11.9%) than in operating expenses (10.8%) during the period. Adjusted operating income increased by $53.8 million (16.4%) to $381.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 from $328.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2013. Adjusted operating margin increased to 41.8% in the three months ended September 30, 2014 from 40.2% in the three months ended September 30, 2013. See “Schedule of Non-GAAP Information” for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues, a reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income and additional important disclosures regarding net revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin.Other Income and ExpensesThe main categories of other income and expenses, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods are as follows:     Variance Three months ended September 30, 2014 vs 2013$ in millions2014 2013 $ Change % ChangeEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates10.9 10.3 0.6 5.8 %Interest and dividend income2.6 2.5 0.1 4.0 %Interest expense(18.1) (9.7) (8.4) 86.6 %Other gains and losses, net(1.3) 2.7 (4.0) N/AOther income/(loss) of CSIP, net7.4 — 7.4 N/AOther income and expenses of CIP:     Interest and dividend income of CIP53.4 46.5 6.9 14.8 %Interest expense of CIP(37.5) (33.5) (4.0) 11.9 %Other gains/(losses) of CIP, net0.1 38.2 (38.1) (99.7)%Total other income and expenses17.5 57.0 (39.5) (69.3)%60Table of Contents   Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliatesEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased by $0.6 million (5.8%) to $10.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 (three months ended September 30, 2013: $10.3 million). The increase is comprised of a $2.1 million increase in earnings from our real estate partnership investments and certain other partnership investments along with an increase of $1.2 million in earnings from certain joint ventures and affiliates. The increase is partially offset by a $0.6 million reduction in earnings from our investment in Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc., a $1.6 million net decrease in earnings from our private equity partnership investments and a $0.5 million decrease in earnings from our joint venture investments in China. Interest and dividend income and interest expense Interest and dividend income decreased by $0.1 million (4.0%) to $2.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 (three months ended September 30, 2013: $2.5 million).Interest expense increased by $8.4 million (86.6%) to $18.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 (three months ended September 30, 2013: $9.7 million) primarily due to the changes in long-term financing arrangements made during the fourth quarter of 2013 which increased the overall borrowing costs versus the comparative period. Other gains and losses, net Other gains and losses, net were a loss of $1.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to a net gain of $2.7 million in the three months ended September 30, 2013. Included within other gains and losses, net in the three months ended September 30, 2014 is a net realized gain from available-for-sale and other investments of $1.8 million (three months ended September 30, 2013: $1.0 million net gain), a net loss of $3.2 million resulting from the depreciation of investments held for our deferred compensation plans (three months ended September 30, 2013: $9.2 million net gain), and $0.1 million of unrealized gains from other trading investments (three months ended September 30, 2013: none). The three months ended September 30, 2013 also included a net loss of $6.6 million on the liquidation of a co-investment and sale of other securities and a net loss of $1.1 million related to the mark-to-market of foreign exchange put option contracts intended to provide protection against the impact of a significant decline in the Pound Sterling/U.S Dollar foreign exchange rate. Other income/(loss) of CSIPIn the three months ended September 30, 2014, other income/(loss) of CSIP, net totaled income of $7.4 million (three months ended September 30, 2013: none) and consists of $3.1 million of interest and dividend income and other gains of $4.3 million on investment holdings. See Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements - Notes 1, "Accounting Policies" and 12, “Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products,” for additional details.Non-operating income and expense of CIPIn the three months ended September 30, 2014, interest and dividend income of CIP increased by $6.9 million (14.8%) to $53.4 million (three months ended September 30, 2013: $46.5 million). Interest expense of CIP increased by $4.0 million (11.9%) to $37.5 million (three months ended September 30, 2013: $33.5 million). The increase in interest income and interest expense of CIP in the 2014 period is primarily due to the impact of consolidation of CLO notes issued after September 30, 2013, exceeding the impact of deconsolidation and paydowns of CLO notes.Included in other gains/(losses) of CIP, net, are realized and unrealized gains and losses on the underlying investments and debt of CIP. In the three months ended September 30, 2014, other gains and losses of CIP were a net gain of $0.1 million, as compared to a net gain of $38.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2013. The net gain in the 2013 period is primarily due to gains associated with the decrease in market value of the long-term debt of CLOs and gains associated with the increase in market value of private equity investments exceeding losses associated with CLO investments.Net impact of CIP and related noncontrolling interests in consolidated entitiesAs illustrated in the Summary of Income Statement Impact of CIP table at the beginning of this Results of Operations section, the consolidation of investment products during the three months ended September 30, 2014 resulted in a decrease to net income of $5.3 million before attribution to noncontrolling interests. Invesco invests in only a portion of these products, and as a result this net gain is offset by noncontrolling interests of $7.7 million, resulting in a net increase in net income of the company of $2.4 million. The consolidation of investment products during the three months ended September 30, 2013 resulted in an increase to net income of $11.2 million before attribution to noncontrolling interests. The addition of noncontrolling interest losses of $20.6 million, resulted in a total net decrease in net income of the company of $9.4 million. 61Table of Contents   Noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities represent the profit or loss amounts attributed to third party investors in CIP. Movements in amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on the company's Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income generally offset the gains and losses, interest income and interest expense of CIP.Additionally, CIP represent less than 1% of the company's AUM. Therefore, the net gains or losses of CIP are not indicative of the performance of the company's aggregate assets under management.CIP are taxed at the investor level and not at the product level; therefore, there is no tax provision reflected in the net impact of CIP.Income Tax Expense The company's subsidiaries operate in several taxing jurisdictions around the world, each with its own statutory income tax rate. As a result, the blended average statutory tax rate will vary from year to year depending on the mix of the profits and losses of the company's subsidiaries. Our effective tax rate increased to 27.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2014 (three months ended September 30, 2013: 27.1%). The inclusion of income from non-controlling interests in consolidated entities increased our effective tax rate by 0.3% in 2014 and decreased our rate by 1.7% in 2013. 2014 included a 1.1% rate decrease as a result of the fund reimbursement expense (referenced above). 2014 included the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits which decreased our rate by 0.6%. See Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements - Note 9 "Taxation" for additional information. The remainder of the rate movement was primarily due to changes in the mix of pre-tax income.62Table of Contents   Assets Under Management movements for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2013The following presentation and discussion of AUM includes Passive and Active AUM. Passive AUM include ETFs, UITs, leveraged fund balances upon which we do not earn a fee, and other passive mandates. Active AUM are total AUM less Passive AUM.The AUM tables and the discussion below refer to AUM as long-term and short-term. Short-term AUM include institutional money market and Invesco PowerShares QQQ AUM. Long-term AUM are total AUM less short-term AUM.Changes in AUM were as follows: For the nine months ended September 30, 2014 2013$ in billionsTotal AUM Active Passive Total AUM Active PassiveJanuary 1778.7 639.0 139.7 667.4 553.4 114.0Long-term inflows137.1 113.9 23.2 133.8 99.8 34.0Long-term outflows(131.5) (112.7) (18.8) (113.1) (87.0) (26.1)Long-term net flows5.6 1.2 4.4 20.7 12.8 7.9Net flows in Invesco Powershares QQQ fund(7.5) — (7.5) 1.1 — 1.1Net flows in institutional money market funds(5.8) (5.8) — 7.4 7.4 —Total net flows(7.7) (4.6) (3.1) 29.2 20.2 9.0Market gains and losses/reinvestment24.2 18.5 5.7 51.6 44.3 7.3Foreign currency translation(5.6) (5.4) (0.2) (2.7) (2.0) (0.7)September 30789.6 647.5 142.1 745.5 615.9 129.6Average AUM           Average long-term AUM672.6 574.0 98.6 603.7 514.0 89.7Average short-term AUM117.9 73.4 44.5 109.9 75.4 34.5Average AUM790.5 647.4 143.1 713.6 589.4 124.2Revenue yield           Gross revenue yield on AUM (1)65.7 77.4 13.0 64.2 75.4 11.4Gross revenue yield on AUM before performance fees (1)64.9 76.5 13.0 63.3 74.4 11.4Net revenue yield on AUM (2)45.6 52.8 13.0 44.7 51.8 11.4Net revenue yield on AUM before performance fees (2)44.7 51.7 13.0 43.7 50.5 11.4(1)Gross revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized total operating revenues divided by average AUM, excluding joint venture (JV) AUM. Our share of the average AUM in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 for our JVs in China was $5.0 billion (September 30, 2013: $3.7 billion). It is appropriate to exclude the average AUM of our JVs for purposes of computing gross revenue yield on AUM, because the revenues resulting from these AUM are not presented in our operating revenues. Under U.S. GAAP, our share of the net income of the JVs is recorded as equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. Additionally, the numerator of the gross revenue yield measure, operating revenues, excludes the management fees earned from CIP; however, the denominator of the measure includes the AUM of these investment products. Therefore, the gross revenue yield measure is not considered representative of the company's true effective fee rate from AUM. (2)Net revenue yield on AUM is equal to annualized net revenues divided by average AUM. See “Schedule of Non-GAAP Information” for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues.FlowsAUM at September 30, 2014 were $789.6 billion (September 30, 2013: $745.5 billion). During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, long-term net inflows increased AUM by $5.6 billion, which was offset by net outflows in institutional money market funds of $5.8 billion and net outflows in the Invesco PowerShares QQQ fund of $7.5 billion. During the nine months ended September 30, 2013, net long-term inflows increased AUM by $20.7 billion. We also experienced net inflows in institutional money market funds of $7.4 billion and net inflows of the Invesco PowerShares QQQ fund of $1.1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2013.Net inflows during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 included active net long-term inflows of $1.2 billion, along with net long-term inflows of passive AUM of $4.4 billion. Net inflows were comprised of net inflows from our retail 63Table of Contents   distribution channel of $4.2 billion, along with net inflows into our institutional channel of $1.4 billion. Long-term net inflows included $14.2 billion and $4.1 billion from clients domicile in Continental Europe and Asia respectively. These long-term inflows were largely offset by long-term net outflows of $16.7 billion from clients domiciled in the U.K. The U.K. outflows were closely associated with the departure of the former head of U.K. Equities, as described in the Executive Overview above.Long-term net inflows during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 were $20.7 billion, and included net long-term active inflows of $12.8 billion and passive inflows of $7.9 billion. Long-term net flows in 2013 were driven by net inflows of $21.7 billion into our retail distribution channel, primarily in the fixed income and balanced asset classes.Average AUM during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 were $790.5 billion, compared to $713.6 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2013.Market ReturnsDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2014, positive market movement increased AUM by $24.2 billion, with $18.2 billion attributed to our equity asset class. Our fixed income, alternatives and balanced asset classes were also positively impacted by the change in market valuations during the period, with market returns of 3.9 billion, 1.4 billion and 0.9 billion, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2013, market gains increased AUM by $51.6 billion and included $52.3 billion in positive market movement of our equity asset class, which was partially offset by losses of $3.1 billion in our fixed income asset class.Foreign Exchange RatesThe table below illustrates the spot foreign exchange rates used for translation of non-U.S. Dollar denominated AUM into U.S. Dollars:Foreign Exchange RatesSeptember 30, 2014 December 31, 2013 September 30, 2013 December 31, 2012Pound Sterling ($ per £)1.622 1.655 1.619 1.625Canadian Dollar (CAD per $)1.118 1.063 1.029 0.996Japan (¥ per $)109.680 105.080 98.120 86.520Euro ($ per Euro)1.262 1.378 1.353 1.319During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, we experienced decreases in AUM of $5.6 billion due to changes in foreign exchange rates. Changes in foreign exchange rates in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 were driven primarily by the weakening of the Pound Sterling relative to the U.S. Dollar, which was reflected in the translation of our Pound Sterling-based AUM into U.S. Dollars. The Canadian Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen also weakened relative to the U.S. Dollar, which was reflected in the translation of our Canadian Dollar-based, Euro-based and Yen-based AUM into U.S. Dollars, respectively. In the nine months ended September 30, 2013, AUM decreased by $2.7 billion due to foreign exchange rate changes primarily impacted by the weakening of the Japanese Yen and Canadian Dollar relative to the U.S. Dollar, which was reflected in the translation of our Japanese Yen-based and Canadian Dollar-based AUM into U.S. Dollars. This was offset by the strengthening of the Euro and the Pound Sterling, which was reflected in the translation of our Euro-based and Pound Sterling-based AUM into U.S. Dollars.Revenue YieldNet revenue yield on AUM increased 0.9 basis points to 45.6 basis points in the nine months ended September 30, 2014  as compared to the same period in 2013 (nine months ended September 30, 2013: 44.7 basis points). Excluding performance fees, the net revenue yield increased 1.0 basis points to 44.7 basis points in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 from the nine months ended September 30, 2013 level of 43.7 basis points.Changes in our AUM mix significantly impact our net revenue yield. For example, on an asset class basis, our equity and balanced AUM generally earn a higher net revenue rate than money market and fixed income AUM. The combination of average equity and average balanced AUM increased from 52.6% in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 to 55.8% of total average AUM in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. This resulted in a lower proportion of average assets in money market and fixed income AUM in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2013. This change in asset class mix correlates with the increase in net revenue yield on AUM before performance fees in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2013.Changes in the geographic mix of our AUM have also factored into the improved revenue yield. Sales have been strong in our Continental European business during recent quarters. As of September 30, 2014, the AUM attributable to clients 64Table of Contents   domiciled in Continental Europe accounts for 9.0% of total AUM compared to 6.9% as of September 30, 2013. On average, the AUM in Continental Europe earn a higher fee rate than the company's average fee rate for existing total AUM.The tables that follow analyze AUM into active and passive style. Passive AUM generally earn a lower effective fee rate than active asset classes. At September 30, 2014, passive AUM were $142.1 billion, representing 18.0% of total AUM at that date; whereas at September 30, 2013, passive AUM were $129.6 billion, representing 17.4% of our total AUM at that date. In the nine months ended September 30, 2014, the net revenue yield on passive AUM was 13.0 basis points compared to 11.4 basis points in the nine months ended September 30, 2013, an increase of 1.6 basis points, due to changes in mix of passive AUM. The increase in passive AUM includes the movements in the Powershares QQQ Nasdaq-100 index tracking fund. The Powershares QQQ fund AUM increased to $42.9 billion at September 30, 2014 compared to $38.5 billion at September 30, 2013. The revenue yield for Invesco on this product is less than 1 basis point, reimbursing Invesco for the portfolio trading services provided to the fund, and flows into and out of this product therefore have a significant impact on the overall net revenue yield and are a significant factor in the year-over-year yield changes.Gross revenue yield on AUM increased 1.5 basis points to 65.7 basis points in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 from the nine months ended September 30, 2013 level of 64.2 basis points. Management does not consider gross revenue yield, the most comparable U.S. GAAP-based measure to net revenue yield, to be a meaningful effective fee rate measure for the reasons outlined in footnote 1 to the Changes in AUM table above. See “Schedule of Non-GAAP Information” for a reconciliation of operating revenues (gross revenues) to net revenues.Changes in our AUM by channel, asset class, and client domicile, and average AUM by

The impact is illustrated in the tables immediately below by a column which shows the dollar-value change in the consolidated figures, as caused by the consolidation of CIP. For example, the impact of CIP on total operating revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 was a reduction of $25.6 million. This indicates that the consolidation of CIP reduced consolidated revenues by $25.6 million, primarily reflecting the elimination upon consolidation of the revenues earned by Invesco for managing these investment products. The discussion below includes the use of non-GAAP financial measures. See “Schedule of Non-GAAP Information” for additional details and reconciliations of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures to the non-GAAP measures.70Table of Contents   Summary of Income Statement Impact of CIP Nine months ended September 30, 2014 2013$ in millionsImpact of CIP Invesco Ltd.

Net revenues increased by 12.9% in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $2,702.5 million (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $2,394.7 million). Net revenues are operating revenues less third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses, plus our proportional share of net revenues from joint venture arrangements, plus management and performance fees earned from, less other revenues recorded by, CIP, plus other reconciling items. See “Schedule of Non-GAAP Information” for additional important disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. 71Table of Contents   A significant portion of our business and AUM is based outside of the U.S. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. Dollar against other currencies, primarily the Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Euro and Japanese Yen will impact our reported revenues and expenses from period to period. The income statements of foreign currency subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars, the reporting currency of the company, using average foreign exchange rates. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased operating revenues by $51.9 million, equivalent to 1.3% of total operating revenues, during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2013. Additionally, our revenues are directly influenced by the level and composition of our AUM. Therefore, movements in global capital market levels, net new business inflows (or outflows) and changes in the mix of investment products between asset classes and geographies may materially affect our revenues from period to period. As illustrated in the Executive Overview, returns from capital markets were mixed in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. Investment Management FeesInvestment management fees increased by $400.1 million (15.1%) in the nine months ended September 30, 2014, to $3,044.6 million (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $2,644.5 million). In April 2014, our U.K. Invesco Perpetual business introduced a single Fund Management Fee (FMF) for their retail funds to replace the separate annual management fee and registration fee. This results in an increase in investment management fees of $59.5 million and a corresponding a reduction in service and distribution fees during the nine months ended September 30, 2014. After adjusting for the introduction of the single FMF, the increase is equivalent to 12.9%. This compares to an 10.8% increase in average AUM and an 11.4% increase in average long-term AUM. As discussed above, the net revenue yield is higher in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2013 due to changes in the composition of our AUM. See the company's disclosures regarding the changes in AUM and revenue yields during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 in the “Assets Under Management” section above for additional information regarding the movements in AUM. The impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased investment management fees by $49.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2013. Service and Distribution FeesIn the nine months ended September 30, 2014, service and distribution fees increased by $32.7 million (5.1%) to $675.4 million (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $642.7 million). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased service and distribution fees by $0.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2014. Service and distribution fees increases in 2014 in line with increases in average AUM and revenue yields, as well as a new recurring asset-based service fee that began in 2014. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $59.5 million driven by the introduction of a single FMF for several U.K. funds as noted above.Performance FeesIn the nine months ended September 30, 2014, performance fees decreased by $2.9 million (6.1%) to $44.3 million when compared to the performance fees in nine months ended September 30, 2013 of $47.2 million. The performance fees generated in 2014 arose primarily due to products managed by the U.K. investment teams ($34.4 million), Global Quantitative Equity team ($6.9 million) and Asia Pacific teams ($1.8 million). During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, U.K. performance fees included $8.0 million from Edinburgh Investment Trust PLC (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $17.5 million). Future management fees receivable from the Trust will not include a performance fee component. In the nine months ended September 30, 2013, performance fees were generated by a variety of products and were sourced from the U.K. and Continental Europe ($37.7 million), Asia Pacific ($5.1 million) and the U.S. ($4.0 million).Other RevenuesIn the nine months ended September 30, 2014, other revenues increased by $21.0 million (24.7%) to $106.1 million (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $85.1 million). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased other revenues $0.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2013. After allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the increase in other revenues was $20.7 million. The increase in other revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2013 includes increases in mutual funds front end fees of $8.7 million, real estate acquisition and disposition fees of $4.6 million, UIT revenues of $3.4 million, and other revenues of $4.3 million. The increase in front end fees relates to increased sales activity in Continental Europe. Third-Party Distribution, Service and Advisory Expenses Third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses increased by $143.2 million (13.1%) in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $1,236.2 million (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $1,093.0 million). The impact of foreign 72Table of Contents   exchange rate movements increased third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses by $16.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2013. After allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the increase in third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses was $126.5 million. The increase includes increases in distribution fees of $52.4 million, renewal commissions of $48.7 million, transfer agent fees of $13.2 million, and external commissions of $11.6 million. The overall increase is reflective of the higher related retail management fees, service and distribution fees and front-end load fees (recorded in other revenues).Proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investmentsOur proportional share of revenues, net of third-party distribution expenses, from joint venture investments increased by $7.0 million (19.6%) to $42.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $35.7 million). Our share of the Invesco Great Wall joint venture's average AUM for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 increased 35% to $5.0 billion compared to $3.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2013. The increase in our share of net revenue is proportionately smaller than the increase in AUM due to the mix of AUM, and also due to higher third-party fees in 2014 as compared to 2013.Management, performance and other fees earned from CIPManagement believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a reader's analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company. Accordingly, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues for the impact of CIP in calculating net revenues. As management and performance fees earned by Invesco from the consolidated products are eliminated upon consolidation of the investment products, management believes that it is appropriate to add these operating revenues back in the calculation of net revenues. See “Schedule of Non-GAAP Information” for additional disclosures regarding the use of net revenues. The elimination of management and performance fees earned from CIP decreased by $4.0 million to $25.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $30.2 million) while other revenues of $0.2 million (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $0.4 million) were recorded by CIP in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in performance fees related to consolidated CLO notes, as well as the impact of funds deconsolidated after September 30, 2013, partially offset by the impact of newly consolidated funds. Once the funds are deconsolidated, the management and performance fees are no longer eliminated and are reflected in the respective revenue line items in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.Operating ExpensesThe main categories of operating expenses, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods, are as follows: Nine months ended September 30, Variance$ in millions2014 2013 $ Change % ChangeEmployee compensation1,048.8 995.9 52.9 5.3 %Third-party distribution, service and advisory1,236.2 1,093.0 143.2 13.1 %Marketing80.2 68.6 11.6 16.9 %Property, office and technology264.4 207.0 57.4 27.7 %General and administrative312.1 224.9 87.2 38.8 %Transaction and integration— 3.2 (3.2) (100.0)%Total operating expenses2,941.7 2,592.6 349.1 13.5 %73Table of Contents   The table below sets forth these expense categories as a percentage of total operating expenses and operating revenues, which we believe provides useful information as to the relative significance of each type of expense.$ in millionsNine months ended September 30, 2014 % of Total Operating Expenses % of Operating Revenues Nine months ended September 30, 2013 % of Total Operating Expenses % of Operating RevenuesEmployee compensation1,048.8 35.7% 27.1% 995.9 38.4% 29.1%Third-party distribution, service and advisory1,236.2 42.0% 31.9% 1,093.0 42.2% 32.0%Marketing80.2 2.7% 2.1% 68.6 2.6% 2.0%Property, office and technology264.4 9.0% 6.8% 207.0 8.0% 6.1%General and administrative312.1 10.6% 8.1% 224.9 8.7% 6.6%Transaction and integration— —% —% 3.2 0.1% 0.1%Total operating expenses2,941.7 100.0% 76.0% 2,592.6 100.0% 75.9%During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, operating expenses increased by $349.1 million (13.5%) to $2,941.7 million (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $2,592.6 million). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased operating expenses by $36.8 million, or 1.3% of total operating expenses, during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2013. Employee CompensationEmployee compensation increased $52.9 million (5.3%) to $1,048.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $995.9 million). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased employee compensation by $8.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2013. After allowing for foreign exchange rate changes, the increase in employee compensation was $44.6 million.Direct compensation increased $42.4 million, primarily due to higher incentive compensation and increased headcount. The increase includes higher base salaries and incentive compensation of $52.9 million. Other employee compensation decreased $8.9 million and includes a decrease in sales commissions during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2013. Both direct and other compensation include costs associated with staff severance, including the acceleration of share-based costs. The nine months ended September 30, 2014 includes total severance costs of $7.2 million associated with a business optimization initiative undertaken during the first quarter.Headcount at September 30, 2014 was 6,155 (at September 30, 2013, on a continuing operations basis: 5,864). Third-Party Distribution, Service and Advisory ExpensesThird-party distribution, service and advisory expenses are discussed above in the operating and net revenues section.MarketingMarketing expenses increased by $11.6 million (16.9%) in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 to $80.2 million (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $68.6 million). Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate movements that increased marketing expenses $1.0 million, the increase in marketing expenses was $10.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2013. The increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 includes increases in advertising expenses of $4.8 million, primarily in EMEA, client event expenses of $3.9 million, marketing travel expenses of $1.6 million and other marketing costs of $0.3 million.  Property, Office and TechnologyProperty, office and technology costs increased by $57.4 million (27.7%) to $264.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $207.0 million). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased property, office and technology expenses by $4.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2013. After allowing for foreign exchange rate movements, the increase was $52.9 million.74Table of Contents   Property and office costs increased $37.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013, due primarily to charges of $35.8 million associated with vacating leased properties in connection with a business optimization initiative undertaken during the first quarter. Property and office costs are generally trending upwards, due to market conditions. However, the business optimization initiative undertaken in the first quarter of 2014 has partially mitigated the increases in the current period, and therefore property and office costs (excluding the business optimization charge) have remained comparable to the same period in 2013. Other increases in property and office costs in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to 2013 include $3.0 million in operating service and property management fees.Technology and communications expenses increased $15.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 over the comparable 2013 period primarily due to increase in depreciation and maintenance of $7.0 million and increased outsourced administration costs of $9.0 million driven by increased EMEA activity.  General and Administrative General and administrative expenses increased by $87.2 million (38.8%) to $312.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $224.9 million). The impact of foreign exchange rate movements increased general and administrative expenses by $6.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2013. After allowing for foreign exchange rate movements, the increase was $80.9 million.The increase in general and administrative expense is due in part to the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority penalty of £18.6 million ($31.1 million) and related legal costs of $0.5 million that were incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The increase is also driven by an expense of $24.2 million in respect of a multi-year fund reimbursement expense associated with historical private equity management fees. The charge resulted primarily from using a more appropriate methodology regarding the calculation of offsets to management fees. The increase also includes a $13.7 million increase in mutual fund expenses, a $5.3m fund reimbursement expense that incurred in the first quarter of 2014, as well as increases of $6.0 million in product launch costs and other general and administrative costs.Transaction and integration There were no transaction and integration charges in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $3.2 million). Transaction and integration expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 relate to fund mergers and include professional services and shareholder communications costs. These costs ceased in the first half of 2013.Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Income, Operating Margin and Adjusted Operating MarginOperating income increased by $101.8 million (12.3%) to $928.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $826.9 million). Operating margin (operating income divided by operating revenues), decreased to 24.0% in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 from 24.2% in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. The decrease in operating margin resulted from a lower relative increase in operating revenues (13.2%) than in operating expenses (13.5%) during the period. Adjusted operating income increased by $177.0 million (18.7%) to $1,121.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 from $944.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. Adjusted operating margin increased to 41.5% in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 from 39.5% in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. See “Schedule of Non-GAAP Information” for a reconciliation of operating revenues to net revenues, a reconciliation of operating income to adjusted operating income and additional important disclosures regarding net revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin.75Table of Contents   Other Income and ExpensesThe main categories of other income and expenses, and the dollar and percentage changes between periods are as follows:     Variance Nine months ended September 30, 2014 vs 2013$ in millions2014 2013 $ Change % ChangeEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates26.4 25.3 1.1 4.3%Interest and dividend income8.6 6.8 1.8 26.5%Interest expense(55.0) (29.4) (25.6) 87.1%Other gains and losses, net21.5 20.8 0.7 3.4%Other income/(loss) of CSIP, net23.3 — 23.3 N/AOther income and expenses of CIP:     Interest and dividend income of CIP149.7 147.5 2.2 1.5%Interest expense of CIP(98.1) (96.8) (1.3) 1.3%Other gains/(losses) of CIP, net63.4 15.5 47.9 N/ATotal other income and expenses139.8 89.7 50.1 55.9%Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliatesEquity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased by $1.1 million (4.3%) to $26.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $25.3 million). The increase in equity in earnings is comprised of increases of $2.0 million in our share of earnings of our joint venture investments in China, $5.4 million in earnings from our real estate partnership investments and $0.4 million from certain other equity method investments, partially offset by decreases of $6.2 million in our investment in Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc. and $0.5 million in net decreases in our share of the market-driven valuation change in the underlying holdings of our private equity partnership investments.Interest and dividend income and interest expense Interest and dividend income increased by $1.8 million (26.5%) to $8.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 (three months ended September 30, 2013: $6.8 million).Interest expense increased by $25.6 million (87.1%) to $55.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $29.4 million) primarily due to the changes in long-term financing arrangements made during the fourth quarter of 2013 which increased the overall borrowing costs versus the comparative period. Other gains and losses, net Other gains and losses, net were a gain of $21.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 as compared to a net gain of $20.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. Included within other gains and losses, net in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 is a net gain of $7.8 million resulting from the appreciation of investments held for our deferred compensation plans (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $27.8 million net gain) and net realized gains from available-for-sale and other investments of $12.6 million (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $4.3 million net loss). The nine months ended September 30, 2013 also included a net loss of $1.7 million related to the mark-to-market of foreign exchange put option contracts intended to provide protection against the impact of a significant decline in the Pound Sterling/U.S Dollar foreign exchange rate and $1.0 million in net foreign exchange losses on the revaluation of intercompany foreign currency denominated loans into the various functional currencies of our subsidiaries.Other income/(loss) of CSIPIn the nine months ended September 30, 2014, other income/(loss) of CSIP, net totaled $23.3 million in income (nine months ended September 30, 2013: none) and consists of $7.5 million of interest and dividend income and other gains/(losses) of $15.8 million on investment holdings. CSIP products were initially consolidated in the third quarter of 2013. See Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements - Notes 1, "Accounting Policies" and 12, “Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products,” for additional details.76Table of Contents   Non-operating income and expense of CIPIn the nine months ended September 30, 2014, interest and dividend income of CIP increased by $2.2 million (1.5%) to $149.7 million (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $147.5 million). Interest expense of CIP increased by $1.3 million (1.3%) to $98.1 million (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $96.8 million). The increase in interest income and interest expense of CIP in the 2014 period is primarily due to the impact of consolidation of CLO notes issued after September 30, 2013, exceeding the impact of deconsolidation and paydowns of CLO notes. Included in other gains/(losses) of CIP, net, are realized and unrealized gains and losses on the underlying investments and debt of CIP. In the nine months ended September 30, 2014, other gains and losses of CIP were a net gain of $63.4 million, as compared to a net gain of $15.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013. The net gain in the 2014 period is primarily associated with an increase in market value of private equity investments exceeding losses associated with a decrease in the market value of CLO investments and an increase in the market value of the long-term debt of CLOs. The net gain in the 2013 period is primarily due to gains associated with an increase in market value of private equity and CLO investments exceeding losses associated with the increase in market value of the long-term debt of CLOs.Net impact of CIP and related noncontrolling interests in consolidated entitiesAs illustrated in the Summary of Income Statement Impact of CIP table at the beginning of this Results of Operations section, the consolidation of investment products during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 resulted in an increase to net income of $52.8 million before attribution to noncontrolling interests. Invesco invests in only a portion of these products, and as a result this net gain is offset by noncontrolling interests of $47.1 million, resulting in a net increase in net income of the company of $5.7 million. The consolidation of investment products during the nine months ended September 30, 2013 resulted in a decrease to net income of $8.3 million before attribution to noncontrolling interests. The income attributed to noncontrolling interest was $1.5 million, resulting in a net decrease in net income of the company of $9.8 million. Income Tax Expense Our effective tax rate decreased to 27.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 (nine months ended September 30, 2013: 28.7%). The inclusion of activity from non-controlling interests in consolidated entities decreased our effective tax rate by 1.5% in 2014 and increased our rate by 0.1% in 2013. 2014 included a 0.7% rate increase as result of tax legislation changes in New York, a 0.8% rate increase as a result of the FCA settlement, and a 0.4% rate decrease as a result of the fund reimbursement expense (referenced above). 2014 included the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits which decreased our rate by 0.6%. See Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements - Note 9 "Taxation" for additional information. The remainder of the rate movement was primarily due to changes in the mix of pre-tax income. Income from Discontinued OperationsOn December 31, 2013, the company completed the sale of Atlantic Trust. The operating results and the gain associated with the sale are reflected as discontinued operations in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and are therefore excluded from the continuing operations of Invesco. See Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements, Note 15, "Discontinued Operations."Schedule of Non-GAAP InformationWe are presenting the following non-GAAP performance measures: net revenues (and by calculation, net revenue yield on AUM), adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin), adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders (and by calculation, adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS)). We believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency into our business on an ongoing operations basis and allow more appropriate comparisons with industry peers. Management uses these performance measures to evaluate the business, and they are consistent with internal management reporting. The most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are operating revenues (and by calculation, gross revenue yield on AUM), operating income (and by calculation, operating margin), and net income attributable to common shareholders (and by calculation, diluted EPS). Each of these measures is discussed more fully below.These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as substitutes for any measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Additional reconciling items may be added in the future to these non-GAAP measures if deemed appropriate. The tax effect related to reconciling items that are presented net of tax have been calculated based on the tax rate attributable to the jurisdiction to which the transaction relates. 77Table of Contents   The following are reconciliations of operating revenues, operating income (and by calculation, operating margin), and net income attributable to common shareholders (and by calculation, diluted EPS) on a U.S. GAAP basis to net revenues, adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin), and adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders (and by calculation, adjusted diluted EPS).

Enhancing our operations in China is one effort that we believe could improve our competitive position over time. Accordingly, we believe that it is appropriate to evaluate the contribution of our joint venture investments to the operations of the business.(2)Third-party distribution, service and advisory expensesThird-party distribution, service and advisory expenses include renewal commissions, management fee rebates and distribution costs (12b-1 and marketing support) paid to brokers and independent financial advisors, and other service and administrative fees paid to third parties. While the terms used for these types of expenses vary by geography, they are all expense items that are closely linked to the value of AUM and the revenue earned by Invesco from AUM. Since the company has been deemed to be the principal in the third-party arrangements, the company must reflect these expenses gross of operating revenues under U.S. GAAP.Management believes that the deduction of third-party distribution, service and advisory expenses from operating revenues in the computation of net revenues (and by calculation, net revenue yield on AUM) and the related computation of adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin) appropriately reflects the nature of these expenses as revenue-sharing activities, as these costs are passed through to external parties who perform functions on behalf of, and distribute, the company’s managed funds. Further, these expenses vary extensively by geography due to the differences in distribution channels. The net presentation assists in identifying the revenue contribution generated by the business, removing distortions caused by the differing distribution channel fees and allowing for a fair comparison with U.S. peer investment managers and within Invesco’s own investment units. Additionally, management evaluates net revenue yield on AUM, which is equal to net revenues divided by average AUM during the reporting period. This financial measure is an indicator of the basis point net revenues we receive for each dollar of AUM we manage and is useful when evaluating the company’s performance relative to industry competitors and within the company for capital allocation purposes.79Table of Contents   (3)CIPSee Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, Note 13 - “Consolidated Investment Products” for a detailed analysis of the impact to the company’s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements from the consolidation of CIP. The reconciling items add back the management and performance fees earned by Invesco from the consolidated products and remove the revenues and expenses recorded by the consolidated products that have been included in the U.S. GAAP Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.Management believes that the consolidation of investment products may impact a reader's analysis of our underlying results of operations and could result in investor confusion or the production of information about the company by analysts or external credit rating agencies that is not reflective of the underlying results of operations and financial condition of the company. Accordingly, management believes that it is appropriate to adjust operating revenues, operating income and net income for the impact of CIP in calculating the respective net revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted net income. CIP Revenue: Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,$ in millions, except per share data2014 2013 2014 2013Management fees earned from CIP, eliminated upon consolidation6.6 8.6 18.9 21.3Performance fees earned from CIP, eliminated upon consolidation2.1 3.4 6.9 8.9Other revenues recorded by CIP(0.1) — (0.2) (0.4)CIP related adjustments in arriving at net revenues8.6 12.0 25.6 29.8(4)Acquisition/disposition related adjustmentsAcquisition/disposition related adjustments include transaction and integration expenses, intangible asset amortization, employee severance expenses associated with the cessation of activities related to a previous acquisition, tax cash flow benefits resulting from tax amortization of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, and all related tax effects.While finite-lived intangible assets are amortized under U.S. GAAP, there is no amortization charge on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. In certain qualifying situations, these can be amortized for tax purposes, generally over a 15-year period, as is the case in the U.S. These cash flows (in the form of reduced taxes payable) represent tax benefits that are not included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income absent an impairment charge or the disposal of the related business. The company receives these cash flow benefits but does not anticipate a sale or impairment of these assets in the foreseeable future, and therefore the deferred tax liability recognized under U.S. GAAP is not expected to be used either through a credit in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income or through settlement of tax obligations.In addition, the results of the discontinued operations of Atlantic Trust have been excluded in arriving at adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders, which is the basis of calculating adjusted diluted EPS. Accordingly, the company's non-GAAP financial measures reflect only the continuing business of Invesco. Management believes this presentation assists in evaluating the ongoing business performance and aids comparability with peer companies that may not have similar discontinued operations.Transaction and integration expenses reflect the legal, regulatory, advisory, valuation, integration-related employee incentive awards and other professional or consulting fees, general and administrative costs, including travel costs related to transactions and the costs of temporary staff involved in executing the transaction, and the post-closing costs of integrating the acquired business into the company’s existing operations, including incremental costs associated with achieving synergy savings. Additionally, transaction and integration expenses include legal costs related to the defense of legal challenges to auction rate preferred securities redemptions with respect to various closed-end funds included in a prior acquisition. See Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, Note 11 - “Commitments and Contingencies” for additional information related to this matter. Management believes it is useful to investors and other users of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements to adjust for these acquisition/disposition related adjustments in arriving at adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted EPS, as this will aid comparability of our results period to period, and aid comparability with peer companies that may not have similar acquisition and disposition related charges.80Table of Contents   See table below for a reconciliation of acquisition/disposition related items: Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,$ in millions2014 2013 2014 2013Acquisition/disposition related:       Intangible amortization expense2.7 3.8 9.9 11.6Employee compensation expense— — — 2.4Transaction and integration expense— — — 3.2Adjustments to operating income2.7 3.8 9.9 17.2Taxation:       Taxation on amortization(0.4) (0.4) (1.2) (1.2)Deferred taxation5.4 5.4 16.3 16.1Taxation on transaction and integration— — — (1.2)(Income)/loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes0.6 1.4 2.4 1.9Adjustments to net income attributable to common shareholders8.3 10.2 27.4 32.8(5)Market movement on deferred compensation plan liabilitiesCertain deferred compensation plan awards involve a return to the employee linked to the appreciation (depreciation) of specified investments, typically the funds managed by the employee. Invesco hedges economically the exposure to market movements by holding these investments on its balance sheet. U.S. GAAP requires the appreciation (depreciation) in the compensation liability to be expensed over the award vesting period in proportion to the vested amount of the award as part of compensation expense. The full value of the investment appreciation (depreciation) is immediately recorded below operating income in other gains and losses. This creates a timing difference between the recognition of the compensation expense and the investment gain or loss impacting net income attributable to common shareholders and diluted EPS which will reverse over the life of the award and net to zero at the end of the multi-year vesting period. During periods of high market volatility these timing differences impact compensation expense, operating income and operating margin in a manner which, over the life of the award, will ultimately be offset by gains and losses recorded below operating income on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The non-GAAP measures exclude the mismatch created by differing U.S. GAAP treatments of the market movement on the liability and the investments.Since these plans are hedged economically, management believes it is useful to reflect the offset ultimately achieved from hedging the investment market exposure in the calculation of adjusted operating income (and by calculation, adjusted operating margin) and adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders (and by calculation, adjusted diluted EPS), to produce results that will be more comparable period to period. The related fund shares will have been purchased on or around the date of grant, eliminating any ultimate cash impact from market movements that occur over the vesting period. Additionally, dividend income from investments held to hedge economically deferred compensation plans is recorded as dividend income and as compensation expense on the company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income on the record dates. This dividend income is passed through to the employee participants in the plan and is not retained by the company. The non-GAAP measures exclude this dividend income and related compensation expense.81Table of Contents   (6)Other reconciling itemsEach of these other reconciling items has been adjusted from U.S. GAAP to arrive at the company's non-GAAP financial measures for the reasons either outlined in the paragraphs above, due to the unique character and magnitude of the reconciling item, or because the item represents a continuation of a reconciling item adjusted from U.S. GAAP in a prior period.

This initiative was completed in 2013.b.General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2014 include a $24.2 million (nine months ended September 30, 2014: $29.5 million) multi-year fund reimbursement expense associated with historical private equity management fees. The charge resulted primarily from using a more appropriate methodology regarding the calculation of offsets to management fees. c.Business optimization: Operating expenses for nine months ended September 30, 2014 include property related charges of $35.8 million associated with vacating leased properties as part of a business optimization initiative undertaken during the first quarter of 2014. Employee compensation expenses also includes severance costs of $7.2 million related to the initiative. d.Operating expenses for nine months ended September 30, 2014 include a charge of £18.6 million ($31.1 million) in the first quarter 2014 in respect of the penalty under the settlement of an enforcement proceeding reached with the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) pertaining to the company's compliance with certain FCA rules and regulations for the period from May 2008 to November 2012. This charge, together with settlement-related legal costs of $0.5 million, has been recorded in general and administrative expenses.e.Included within general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2013 was a charge relating to a prior year levy from the U.K. Financial Services Compensation Scheme.f.Included within other gains and losses, net is the mark-to-market of foreign exchange put option contracts intended to provide protection against the impact of a significant decline in the Pound Sterling/U.S. Dollar foreign exchange rate. These contracts provided coverage through March 25, 2014. The adjustment from U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP earnings removes the impact of market volatility; therefore, the company's non-GAAP results include only the amortization of the cost of the contracts during the contract period.82Table of Contents   Balance Sheet DiscussionA summary of the balance sheet impact of CIP is presented below. The impact is illustrated in the tables immediately below by a column which shows the dollar-value change in the consolidated figures, as caused by the consolidation of CIP. For example, the impacts of CIP on accounts receivable and investments at September 30, 2014 were reductions of $2.9 million and $99.9 million, respectively. This indicates that the consolidation of CIP reduced accounts receivable and investments by these amounts, reflecting the elimination upon consolidation of the underlying net interests in CIP held by the company.The majority of the company’s CIP are CLO-related. The collateral assets of the CLOs are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the CLOs. The company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the CLOs, beyond the company’s minimal direct investments in, and management fees generated from, CLOs. If the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. Likewise, if the CLOs were to liquidate, their investors would have no recourse to the general credit of the company. The company therefore does not consider this debt to be a company liability. As demonstrated by the balance sheet data that follows in this section and in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section, inclusion of the long-term debt of consolidated investment products within liquidity measures, such as debt-to-equity measures, causes the company to appear far more indebted than is the case.83Table of Contents   Summary of Balance Sheet Impact of CIP  September 30, 2014 December 31, 2013 September 30, 2013$ in millions Impact of CIP Consolidated Total Impact of CIP Consolidated Total Impact of CIP Consolidated TotalASSETS            Cash and cash equivalents — 1,352.6 — 1,331.2 — 1,174.5Unsettled fund receivables — 999.1 — 932.4 — 1,003.1Accounts receivable (2.9) 532.6 (3.4) 500.8 (4.7) 475.6Investments (99.9) 886.5 (55.3) 839.7 (77.8) 705.0Assets of CSIP — 334.5 — 108.5 — 94.3Assets of CIP:            Cash and cash equivalents of CIP 238.6 238.6 583.6 583.6 445.0 445.0Accounts receivable of CIP 118.1 118.1 58.3 58.3 62.2 62.2Investments of CIP 5,555.9 5,555.9 4,734.7 4,734.7 4,514.6 4,514.6Assets held for policyholders — 1,509.2 — 1,416.0 — 1,449.0Prepaid assets — 103.6 — 101.4 — 111.4Assets held for sale — — — — — 106.7Other assets — 110.7 — 182.1 — 107.6Deferred tax asset, net —  —  — 10.9Property and equipment, net — 367.3 — 350.8 — 336.4Intangible assets, net — 1,252.2 — 1,263.7 — 1,268.6Goodwill — 6,720.1 — 6,867.3 — 6,898.6Total assets 5,809.8 20,081.0 5,317.9 19,270.5 4,939.3 18,763.5LIABILITIES             Accrued compensation and benefits — 540.1 — 676.4 — 565.5Accounts payable and accrued expenses — 766.4 — 763.1 — 660.3Liabilities of CIP:            Debt of CIP 4,710.3 4,710.3 4,181.7 4,181.7 4,003.1 4,003.1Other liabilities of CIP 349.2 349.2 461.8 461.8 251.0 251.0Policyholder payables — 1,509.2 — 1,416.0 — 1,449.0Unsettled fund payables — 994.8 — 882.0 — 993.8Long-term debt — 1,589.1 — 1,588.6 — 1,387.6Deferred tax liabilities, net — 325.3 — 323.6 — 333.8Total liabilities 5,059.5 10,784.4 4,643.5 10,293.2 4,254.1 9,644.1TEMPORARY EQUITY            Redeemable noncontrolling interests in CSIP — 157.5 — — — —PERMANENT EQUITY            Equity attributable to common shareholders:            Common shares — 98.1 — 98.1 — 98.1Additional paid-in-capital — 6,103.9 — 6,100.8 — 6,080.1Treasury shares — (1,851.7) — (1,700.4) — (1,363.5)Retained earnings 18.1 3,764.5 12.5 3,361.9 11.3 3,175.0Retained earnings appropriated for investors in CIP 56.4 56.4 104.3 104.3 106.3 106.3Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax (18.0) 252.9 (12.7) 427.9 (11.2) 434.8Total equity attributable to common shareholders 56.5 8,424.1 104.1 8,392.6 106.4 8,530.8Equity attributable to nonredeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities 693.8 715.0 570.3 584.7 578.8 588.6Total permanent equity 750.3 9,139.1 674.4 8,977.3 685.2 9,119.4Total liabilities, temporary and permanent equity 5,809.8 20,081.0 5,317.9 19,270.5 4,939.3 18,763.5Cash and cash equivalentsCash and cash equivalents increased by $21.4 million from $1,331.2 million at December 31, 2013 to $1,352.6 million at September 30, 2014. See “Cash Flows” in the following section within this Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional discussion regarding the movements in cash flows during the period. 84Table of Contents   Unsettled fund receivables and payablesUnsettled fund receivables increased by $66.7 million from $932.4 million at December 31, 2013 to $999.1 million at September 30, 2014, due primarily to higher transaction activity between funds and investors in late September 2014 when compared to late December 2013 in our UITs, together with U.K. and cross-border funds. In the company's capacity as sponsor of UITs, the company records receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations for unsettled sell trades of securities and UITs in addition to receivables from customers for unsettled sell trades of UITs. In our U.K. and cross-border operations, unsettled fund receivables are created by the normal settlement periods on transactions initiated by certain clients. The presentation of the unsettled fund receivables and substantially offsetting payables ($994.8 million at September 30, 2014 up from $882.0 million at December 31, 2013) at trade date reflects the legal relationship between the underlying investor and the company.InvestmentsAs of September 30, 2014 we had $886.5 million in total investments (December 31, 2013: $839.7 million). Included in investments are $260.7 million of seed money investments in affiliated funds used to seed funds as we launch new products, and $234.1 million of investments related to assets held for deferred compensation plans, which are also held primarily in affiliated funds. Seed investments increased by $26.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2014, primarily due to seed money funding and positive market activity, partially offset by the redemption of seed money. Investments related to deferred compensation awards decreased by $15.6 million during the period, primarily due to redemptions of investments in affiliated funds to hedge economically employee plan awards, partially offset by new purchases of investments. Included in investments are $315.8 million in equity method investments in our Chinese and Indian joint ventures and in certain of the company’s private equity partnerships, real estate partnerships and other co-investments (December 31, 2013: $308.2 million). The increase of $7.6 million in equity method investments was primarily driven by an increase of $8.9 million in our partnership investments due to capital calls in co-investments of $26.7 million, including $23.8 million into real estate funds, $16.2 million due to earnings and valuation adjustments and $0.3 million due to positive foreign exchange movement. The increases in partnership investments were offset by distributions and capital returns of $34.3 million during the period. The remaining change in equity method investments is due to a $1.3 million decrease in our joint venture investments resulting from $18.3 million of dividends earned and $1.3 million due to foreign exchange rate movement, partially offset by an increase in funding of $2.0 million and current period earning of $16.3 million.Assets of CSIPAssets of Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products (CSIP) consist of cash, investments and other assets of consolidated sponsored investment products in which Invesco holds the majority of the voting rights or partnerships in which the company has substantive equity at risk but in which the other investors lack removal or liquidation rights. At September 30, 2014, CSIP assets include $305.8 million in investments (December 31, 2013: $93.2 million), $18.1 million in cash and cash equivalents (December 31, 2013: $12.7 million), and $10.6 million in accounts receivable and other assets (December 31, 2013: $2.6 million). The increase in CSIP investments is primarily driven by new invested cash in the underlying funds and reflects the deployment of invested cash into fund investments. See Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements, Note 1, "Accounting Policies," and Note 12, "Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products," for additional information.Assets held for policyholders and policyholder payablesOne of our subsidiaries, Invesco Perpetual Life Limited, is an insurance company that was established to facilitate retirement savings plans in the U.K. The entity holds assets that are managed for its clients on its balance sheet with an equal and offsetting liability. The increase in the balance of these accounts from $1,416.0 million at December 31, 2013 to $1,509.2 million at September 30, 2014 was the result of new business, an increase in the market values of these assets and liabilities and foreign exchange movements.Intangible assets, netIntangible assets reflect a net decrease of $11.5 million from $1,263.7 million at December 31, 2013, to $1,252.2 million at September 30, 2014. The decrease in intangible assets, net is due to amortization of $9.9 million and foreign exchange movements of $1.6 million.GoodwillGoodwill decreased from $6,867.3 million at December 31, 2013, to $6,720.1 million at September 30, 2014. The decrease is due to foreign exchange movements of $147.2 million. The company's annual goodwill impairment review is performed as of October 1 of each year. 85Table of Contents   Long-term debtLong-term debt increased from $1,588.6 million at December 31, 2013, to $1,589.1 million at September 30, 2014, an increase of $0.5 million related to the amortization of the difference between public offering price and the par value that will be paid on maturity. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our capital structure, together with available cash balances, cash flows generated from operations, existing capacity under our credit facility and further capital market activities, if necessary, should provide us with sufficient resources to meet present and future cash needs, including operating, debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements.Our capital management priorities have evolved with the growth and success of our business and include:•reinvestment in the business;•moderate annual growth of dividends (as further discussed in the "Dividends" section below);•share repurchase; and•establishment of an approximate $1 billion cash buffer in excess of regulatory requirements.During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014  we repurchased 1.3 million and 6.2 million common shares in the open market at a cost of $50.0 million and $219.6 million, respectively.These priorities are executed in a manner consistent with our desire to maintain a strong, investment-grade credit rating. As of the filing of this Report, Invesco held credit ratings of A/Stable and A2/Stable from Standard & Poor's Ratings Services ("S&P") and Moody's Investors Service respectively. Furthermore, S&P considers our risk management to be strong. S&P rates companies' enterprise risk management capabilities on a scale of Fair, Adequate, Strong, and Excellent. Our ability to continue to access the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors, including our credit ratings, the condition of the global economy, investors’ willingness to purchase our securities, interest rates, credit spreads and the valuation levels of equity markets. If we are unable to access capital markets in a timely manner, our business could be adversely impacted. Certain of our subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum levels of capital. These and other similar provisions of applicable law may have the effect of limiting withdrawals of capital, repayment of intercompany loans and payment of dividends by such entities. A sub-group of Invesco subsidiaries, including all of our regulated EU subsidiaries, is subject to consolidated capital requirements under applicable European Union (EU) directives, and capital is maintained within this sub-group to satisfy these regulations. These requirements mandate the retention of liquid resources in those jurisdictions, which we meet in part by holding cash and cash equivalents. This retained cash can be used for general business purposes in the European sub-group or in the countries where it is located. Due to the capital restrictions, the ability to transfer cash between certain jurisdictions may be limited. In addition, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences. At September 30, 2014, the European sub-group had cash and cash equivalent balances of $782.7 million (December 31, 2013: $632.3 million). We are in compliance with all regulatory minimum net capital requirements. As of September 30, 2014, the company's minimum regulatory capital requirement was $275.0 million. The total amount of non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents was $919.1 million at September 30, 2014 (December 31, 2013: $740.5 million).In addition, the company is required to hold cash deposits with clearing organizations or to otherwise segregate cash to maintain compliance with federal and other regulations in connection with its UIT broker dealer entity. At September 30, 2014, these cash deposits totaled $11.4 million (December 31, 2013: $11.3 million).The consolidation of $5.2 billion and $4.8 billion of total assets and long-term debt of certain CLO products as of September 30, 2014, respectively, did not impact the company’s liquidity and capital resources. The collateral assets of the CLOs are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the CLOs. The company has no right to the benefits from, nor does it bear the risks associated with, the collateral assets held by the CLOs, beyond the company’s minimal direct investments in, and management fees generated from, these products, which are eliminated upon consolidation. If the company were to liquidate, the collateral assets would not be available to the general creditors of the company, and as a result, the company does not consider them to be company assets. Likewise, if the CLOs were to liquidate, their investors would have no recourse to the general credit of the company. The company therefore does not consider this debt to be an obligation of the company.

To calculate total assets excluding CIP at September 30, 2014, use U.S. GAAP total assets of $20,081.0 million (December 31, 2013: $19,270.5 million; September 30, 2013: $18,763.5 million) and subtract total assets of CIP of $5,809.8 million (December 31, 2013: $5,317.9 million; September 30, 2013: $4,939.3 million). To calculate total liabilities excluding CIP at September 30, 2014, use U.S. GAAP total liabilities of $10,784.4 million (December 31, 2013: $10,293.2 million; September 30, 2013: $9,644.1 million) and subtract total liabilities of CIP of $5,059.5 million (December 31, 2013: $4,643.5 million, September 30, 2013: $4,254.1 million). To calculate total permanent equity excluding CIP at September 30, 2014, use U.S. GAAP total permanent equity of $9,139.1 million (December 31, 2013: $8,977.3 million; September 30, 2013: $9,119.4 million) and subtract total permanent equity of CIP of $750.3 million (December 31, 2013: $674.4 million; September 30, 2013: $685.2 million). See the "Balance Sheet Discussion" section for a fully expanded balance sheet illustrating the impact of consolidation of investment products for September 30, 2014, December 31, 2013 and September 30, 2013.(2)The debt-to-equity ratio excluding CIP is a non-GAAP financial measure. The debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as long-term debt divided by total permanent equity for the balance sheet excluding CIP and long-term debt plus long-term debt of CIP divided by total permanent equity for the balance sheet including CIP. Management believes that it is important to illustrate for users of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements that calculating a balance sheet measure, such as the debt-to-equity ratio, including the impact of CIP causes the company to appear far more indebted than is the case. As disclosed above, the debt of CIP is not the company's debt, nor do the noteholders of the CIP debt have any recourse to the company.Cash Flows DiscussionThe ability to consistently generate free cash flow from operations in excess of dividend payments, share repurchases, capital expenditures, and ongoing operating expenses is one of our company's fundamental financial strengths. Operations continue to be financed from current earnings and borrowings. Our principal uses of cash, other than for operating expenses, include dividend payments, capital expenditures, acquisitions, purchase of our shares in the open market and investments in certain new investment products.Cash flows of CIP (discussed in Item 1, Financial Statements - Note 13, “Consolidated Investment Products”) are reflected in Invesco's cash provided by or used in operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. Cash held by CIP is not available for general use by Invesco, nor is Invesco cash available for general use by its CIP. Accordingly, the table below presents the consolidated total cash flows of the company and separately presents the impact to the cash flows from CIP. The impact is illustrated in the tables immediately below by a column which shows the dollar-value change in the consolidated figures, as caused by the consolidation of CIP. For example, the impact of CIP on net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 reflects cash provided of $320.6 million; however, this was not provided as part of the company's corporate cash balances. Excluding the impact of CIP, cash provided by operations was 87Table of Contents   $696.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2014. Also as illustrated in the table below, the sum of the operating, investing and financing cash flows of CIP offsets to a zero impact to the company's change in cash and cash equivalent balances from period to period. The cash flows of CIP do not form part of the company’s cash flow management processes, nor do they form part of the company’s significant liquidity evaluations and decisions for the reasons noted. The discussion that follows the table focuses on the company’s cash flows.Summary of Cash Flow Statement Impact of CIP Nine months ended September 30, 2014 Nine months ended September 30, 2013$ in millions Impact of CIP Invesco Ltd.

Although some receipts and payments are seasonal, particularly bonus payments, in general, after allowing for the change in cash held by CIP, our operating cash flows move in the same direction as our operating income. During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, cash provided by operating activities increased $427.5 million to $1,017.4 million from $589.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2013. As shown in the tables above, the impact of CIP to cash provided by operating activities was $320.6 million of cash provided during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $153.2 million of cash used during the nine months ended September 30, 2013. Excluding the impact of CIP, cash provided by operations was $696.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $743.1 million of cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2013.Net income during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 includes $15.8 million of gains from CSIP investments that are adjusted out in arriving at cash provided by operations. The changes in operating assets and liabilities also impact the link between cash provided by operations and net income. Excluding the impact of CIP, the changes in operating assets and liabilities utilized $143.6 million of cash in the nine months ended September 30, 2014, as compared to utilizing $41.0 million in the same period in 2013, reducing cash provided by operating activities by a net $102.6 million. This includes $18.2 million increases in net purchases of trading investments, $5.4 million of increased cash held by CSIP investments, and $64.9 million of additional payroll payments related to annual staff bonus, related payroll taxes, payroll taxes on annual share award vestings, and annual retirement plan contributions. There were no significant non-cash items that impacted the comparison between the periods of operating income to net cash provided by operations.Investing ActivitiesNet cash used in investing activities totaled $1,449.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2014 (nine months ended September 30, 2013: net cash used in $18.9 million). As shown in the tables above, the impact of CIP on investing activities, including investment purchases, sales and returns of capital, was $1,183.8 million used (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $222.9 million contributed). Excluding the impact of CIP cash flows, net cash used in investing activities was $265.8 million (nine months ended September 30, 2013: net cash used of $241.8 million). For the nine months ended September 30, 2014, excluding the impact of CIP, cash outflows include purchases of investments by CSIP of $565.9 million (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $51.4 million) and available-for-sale and other investments of $268.3 million (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $297.2 million). These outflows were partially offset by collected proceeds of $366.4 million from sales of investments by CSIP (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $3.5 million), $227.9 million from sales and returns of capital of available-for-sale and other investments (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $171.5 million), and $60.8 million received during the second quarter 2014 as part of the final consideration for the sale of the Atlantic Trust business on December 31, 2013.During the nine months ended September 30, 2014 the company had capital expenditures of $86.7 million (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $67.0 million). Our capital expenditures related principally in each period to technology initiatives, including enhancements to platforms from which we maintain our portfolio management systems and fund accounting systems, improvements in computer hardware and software desktop products for employees, new telecommunications products to enhance our internal information flow, and back-up disaster recovery systems. Also, in each period, a portion of these costs related to leasehold improvements made to the various buildings and workspaces used in our offices.

The company's $1.25 billion unsecured credit facility expires on December 17, 2018. Financial covenants under the credit agreement include: (i) the quarterly maintenance of a debt/EBITDA leverage ratio, as defined in the credit agreement, of not greater than 3.00:1.00, (ii) a coverage ratio (EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement/interest payable for the four consecutive fiscal quarters ended before the date of determination) of not less than 4.00:1.00. As of September 30, 2014, we were in compliance with our financial covenants. At September 30, 2014, our leverage ratio was 0.96:1.00 (December 31, 2013: 1.05:1.00), and our interest coverage ratio was 24.21:1.00 (December 31, 2013: 35.49:1.00).90Table of Contents   The September 30, 2014, coverage ratio calculations are as follows:$ millionsTotal Q3 2014 Q2 2014 Q1 2014 Q4 2013Net income attributable to common shareholders1,005.7 256.0 274.5 187.8 287.4Net (income)/loss attributable to common shareholders arising from CIP(6.8) (2.4) 2.0 (5.3) (1.1)Tax expense401.1 94.5 107.1 87.8 111.7Amortization/depreciation/impairment101.5 21.6 22.4 23.4 34.1Interest expense70.2 18.1 18.2 18.7 15.2Share-based compensation expense134.4 34.3 33.5 36.5 30.1Unrealized gains and losses from investments, net*(6.9) 1.9 (4.8) (0.3) (3.7)EBITDA**1,699.2 424.0 452.9 348.6 473.7Adjusted debt**$1,628.4        Leverage ratio (Debt/EBITDA - maximum 3.00:1.00)0.96        Interest coverage (EBITDA/Interest Expense - minimum 4.00:1.00)24.21        ____________*Adjustments for unrealized gains and losses from investments, as defined in our credit facility, may also include non-cash gains and losses on investments to the extent that they do not represent anticipated future cash receipts or expenditures.**EBITDA and Adjusted debt are non-GAAP financial measures; however management does not use these measures for anything other than these debt covenant calculations.

The calculation of Adjusted debt is defined in our credit facility and equals total debt of $1,589.1 million plus $39.3 million in letters of credit. The discussion that follows identifies risks associated with the company's liquidity and capital resources. The Executive Overview of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section contains a broader discussion of the company's overall approach to risk management. Credit and Liquidity Risk Capital management involves the management of the company's liquidity and cash flows. The company manages its capital by reviewing annual and projected cash flow forecasts and by monitoring credit, liquidity and market risks, such as interest rate and foreign currency risks (as discussed in Part I, Item 3, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk”), through measurement and analysis. The company is primarily exposed to credit risk through its cash and cash equivalent deposits, which are held by external firms. The company invests its cash balances in its own institutional money market products, as well as with external high credit-quality financial institutions. These arrangements create exposure to concentrations of credit risk.Credit RiskCredit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation. The company is subject to credit risk in the following areas of its business:•All cash and cash equivalent balances are subject to credit risk, as they represent deposits made by the company with external banks and other institutions. As of September 30, 2014, our maximum exposure to credit risk related to our cash and cash equivalent balances is $1,352.6 million. See Item 1, Financial Statements - Note 14, “Related Parties,” for information regarding cash and cash equivalents invested in affiliated money market funds.•Certain subsidiaries of the company accept deposits and place deposits with other institutions on behalf of our customers. As of September 30, 2014, our exposure to credit risk related to these transactions is $2.8 million.The company does not utilize credit derivatives or similar instruments to mitigate the maximum exposure to credit risk. The company does not expect any counterparties to its financial instruments to fail to meet their obligations.91Table of Contents   Liquidity RiskLiquidity risk is the risk that the company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with its financial liabilities. The company is exposed to liquidity risk through its $1,589.1 million in total debt. The company actively manages liquidity risk by preparing cash flow forecasts for future periods, reviewing them regularly with senior management, maintaining a committed credit facility, scheduling significant gaps between major debt maturities and engaging external financing sources in regular dialog.Effects of InflationInflation can impact our organization primarily in two ways. First, inflationary pressures can result in increases in our cost structure, especially to the extent that large expense components such as compensation are impacted. To the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through pricing increases due to the competitive environment, our profitability could be negatively impacted. Secondly, the value of the assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment. Declines in the values of these AUM could lead to reduced revenues as management fees are generally calculated based upon the size of AUM.Off Balance Sheet CommitmentsSee Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements - Note 11, “Commitments and Contingencies - Off Balance Sheet Commitments,” for more information regarding undrawn capital commitments and support agreements. Contractual ObligationsWe have future obligations under various contracts relating to debt and interest payments, financing and operating leases, long-term defined benefit pension and post-retirement medical plans, and acquisition contracts. During the nine months ended September 30, 2014, there were no material changes to the company's contractual obligations.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesThere have been no significant changes to the accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition, which are disclosed in our most recent Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013.Recent Accounting StandardsSee Part I, Item 1, Financial Statements - Note 1, “Accounting Policies - Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted and Pending Accounting Pronouncements.”Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskIn the normal course of its business, the company is primarily exposed to market risk in the form of AUM market price risk, securities market risk, interest rate risk, and foreign exchange rate risk. There have not been any material changes to the company's exposures to market risks during the period ended September 30, 2014 that would require an update to the disclosures provided in the most recent Form 10-K. AUM Market Price RiskThe company's investment management revenues are comprised of fees based on the value of AUM. Declines in the market prices of equity and fixed income securities, commodities and derivatives, or other similar financial instruments held in client portfolios could cause revenues to decline because of lower investment management fees by:•Causing the value of AUM to decrease. •Causing the returns realized on AUM to decrease (impacting performance fees). •Causing clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments in markets that they perceive to offer greater opportunity and that the company does not serve.•Causing clients to rebalance assets away from investments that the company manages into investments that the company does not manage.•Causing clients to reallocate assets away from products that earn higher revenues into products that earn lower revenues.Underperformance of client accounts relative to competing products could exacerbate these factors.92Table of Contents   Securities Market RiskThe company has investments in managed investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes. Investments are generally made to establish a track record for a new fund or investment vehicle or to hedge economically exposure to certain deferred compensation plans. The company's exposure to market risk from financial instruments measured at fair value arises from its investments. Interest Rate RiskInterest rate risk relates to the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its external debt and cash and cash equivalent investments. On September 30, 2014, the interest rates on 100.0% of the company's borrowings were fixed for a weighted average period of 13.8 years, and the company had a zero balance on its floating rate credit facility. Foreign Exchange Rate RiskThe company has transactional currency exposures that occur when any of the company’s subsidiaries receive or pay cash in a currency different from its functional currency. Such exposure arises from sales or purchases by operating subsidiaries in currencies other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. These exposures are not actively managed.The company also has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets and results of operations are exposed to foreign currency translation risk when translated into U.S. dollars upon consolidation into Invesco Ltd. The company generally does not hedge these exposures.The company is exposed to foreign exchange revaluation into the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income on monetary assets and liabilities that are held by subsidiaries in different functional currencies than the subsidiaries' functional currencies. Net foreign exchange revaluation gains were $0.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2014 (nine months ended September 30, 2013: $0.5 million of losses), and are included in general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses, net on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. We continue to monitor our exposure to foreign exchange revaluation.Item 4. Controls and Procedures Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information the company is required to disclose in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the company files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.We have evaluated, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2014. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon our evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.We have evaluated any change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2014 and have concluded that there was no change that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.93Table of Contents   PART II.
