Item 1A. Risk Factors  The second half of 2008 has witnessed unprecedented disruptions in global financial markets, including volatility in asset values and constraints on the availability of credit. In response to these developments, the U.S. and other governments have taken, and may take further, steps designed to stabilize markets generally and strengthen financial institutions in particular. The impact, if any, that these global financial market events or these governmental actions might have on Northern Trust, its business, and its business plan is uncertain and cannot be estimated at this time. Item 1A (“Risk Factors”) of the Corporation’s 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K discusses some of the principal risks inherent in Northern Trust’s business, including economic, market, and monetary policy risks, credit risks and liquidity risks. The current upheaval in global financial markets has accentuated each of these risks and magnified their potential effect on Northern Trust. To the extent legislation or regulatory action adversely affects the U.S. or global economies, Northern Trust’s access to capital or the credit quality of its loan and investment portfolios, or imposes additional limitations or costs on its business, these developments could have an adverse impact on Northern Trust’s costs, credit losses, access to capital, or liquidity.    49      Item 2.
