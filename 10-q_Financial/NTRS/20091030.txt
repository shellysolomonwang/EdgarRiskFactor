Item 1A. Risk Factors  As previously reported, we repurchased all of the preferred stock we issued and sold to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP on June 17, 2009, and on August 26, 2009 we repurchased the warrant to purchase shares of our common stock that we issued and sold to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP.  In light of these actions, as previously reported, risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 arising specifically from our participation in the CPP no longer apply to the Corporation. In addition, the risk factor relating to compliance with evolving regulations is revised to read as follows:  Compliance with evolving regulations applicable to banks and other financial services companies may impact us in ways that are difficult to predict. Although our repurchase of the preferred stock and warrant we issued and sold to the U.S. Treasury under the CPP eliminated restrictions placed upon us under the agreements relating to our participation in that program, in light of current economic conditions, banks and other financial services companies such as us will continue to be subject to enhanced regulatory and enforcement scrutiny and evolving legislation and regulations in the U.S. and other countries. The full scope and impact of existing regulations and of new legislation and implementing regulations that may be issued in the future is uncertain and difficult to predict.    62      Item 1A. Risk Factors (continued)    These new and evolving legal and regulatory requirements may have unforeseen or unintended adverse effects on the financial services industry and its participants. They may require significant time, effort, and resources on our part to ensure compliance, and may impose limitations on us that affect our ability to compete successfully and impact our financial results.    63      Item 2.
