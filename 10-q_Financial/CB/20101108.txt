Item 1A. Risk Factors  The following supplements the risk factors that could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition as described under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A. of Part I of our 2009 Form 10-K and under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A. of Part II of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2010, and should be read in conjunction with those disclosures. The Risk Factor listed in our 2009 Form 10-K under the subheading, “The integration of acquired companies may not be as successful as we anticipate.” is amended and restated to read in its entirety as set forth below.  The integration of acquired companies may not be as successful as we anticipate.  Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including operational, strategic, and financial risks such as potential liabilities associated with the acquired business. Difficulties in integrating an acquired company may result in the acquired company performing differently than we currently expect or in our failure to realize anticipated expense-related efficiencies. Our existing businesses could also be negatively impacted by acquisitions.  There is also the potential that proposed acquisitions that have been publicly announced will not be consummated, even if a definitive agreement has been signed by the parties. If an agreement is terminated before closing, the result would be that our proposed acquisition would not occur, which could among other things adversely impact our stock price and future operations. For example, in the third quarter of 2010, we executed a definitive agreement to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of United States-based Rain and Hail Insurance Service, Inc. not currently owned by ACE. While we expect this acquisition to ultimately be completed, there is risk that this transaction will not close, for example if agreed-upon conditions to the closing are not satisfied.  Item 2.
