Item 1A. Risk Factors  The following supplements the factors that could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition as described under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A. of Part I of our 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K and under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A. of Part II of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2008. The Risk Factors under the headings “Regulatory and Other Governmental Developments”, “Company Structure”, “Charter Documents and Applicable Law” and “Taxation” in our 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K are amended and restated to read in their entirety as set forth below.  Regulatory and Other Governmental Developments  The regulatory regimes under which we operate, and potential changes thereto, could have an adverse effect on our business.  Our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries conduct business globally, including in all 50 states of the United States and the District of Columbia. Our businesses in each of these jurisdictions are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision. The laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled require, among other things, that these subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of statutory capital, surplus, and liquidity, meet solvency standards, and submit to periodic examinations of their financial condition. In some jurisdictions, laws and regulations also restrict payments of dividends and reductions of capital. Applicable statutes, regulations, and policies may also restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to write insurance and reinsurance policies, to make certain investments, and to distribute funds. The purpose of insurance laws and regulations generally is to protect insureds and ceding insurance companies, not our shareholders. We may not be able to comply fully with, or obtain appropriate exemptions from, applicable statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with or to obtain appropriate authorizations and/or exemptions under any applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to do business or undertake activities that are regulated in one or more of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business and could subject us to fines and other sanctions. In addition, changes in the laws or regulations to which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject could have an adverse effect on our business.  Current legal and regulatory activities relating to insurance brokers and agents, contingent commissions, and certain finite-risk insurance products could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. As described in greater detail in Note 8 b) to the Consolidated Financial Statements ACE has received numerous regulatory inquiries, subpoenas, interrogatories, and civil investigative demands from regulatory authorities in     76     connection with pending investigations of insurance industry practices. ACE is cooperating and will continue to cooperate with such inquiries. We cannot assure you that we will not receive any additional requests for information or subpoenas or what actions, if any, any of these governmental agencies will take as a result of these investigations. Additionally, at this time, we are unable to predict the potential effects, if any, that these actions may have upon the insurance and reinsurance markets and industry business practices or what, if any, changes may be made to laws and regulations regarding the industry and financial reporting. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.  Events may result in political, regulatory, and industry initiatives which could adversely affect our business.  Government intervention has occurred in the insurance and reinsurance markets in relation to terrorism coverage both in the U.S. and through industry initiatives in other countries. TRIA, which was enacted in 2002 to ensure the availability of insurance coverage for certain types of terrorist acts in the U.S., was extended in 2007 for seven years, through 2014. Refer to “Regulation – U.S. Operations” for more information in our 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Government intervention and the possibility of future interventions has created uncertainty in the insurance and reinsurance markets about the definition of terrorist acts and the extent to which future coverages will extend to terrorist acts. Government regulators are generally concerned with the protection of policyholders to the exclusion of other constituencies, including shareholders of insurers and reinsurers. While we cannot predict the exact nature, timing, or scope of possible governmental initiatives, such proposals could adversely affect our business by:        •    providing insurance and reinsurance capacity in markets and to consumers that we target;        •    requiring our participation in industry pools and guaranty associations;        •    expanding the scope of coverage under existing policies;        •    regulating the terms of insurance and reinsurance policies; or        •    disproportionately benefiting the companies of one country over those of another.  The insurance industry is also affected by political, judicial, and legal developments that may create new and expanded theories of liability. Such changes may result in delays or cancellations of products and services by insurers and reinsurers, which could adversely affect our business.  Our operations in developing nations expose us to political developments that could have an adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition.  Our international operations include operations in various developing nations. Both current and future foreign operations could be adversely affected by unfavorable political developments including law changes, tax changes, regulatory restrictions, and nationalization of ACE operations without compensation. Adverse actions from any one country could have an adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition depending on the magnitude of the event and ACE’s net financial exposure at that time in that country.  We may become subject to additional Swiss regulation.  The Swiss Federal Office of Private Insurance, which we refer to as “FOPI,” has the discretion to supervise our group activities. Under so-called “group supervision,” FOPI has the right to supervise the Company on a group-wide basis. The regulatory power of FOPI covers in particular the following areas:        •    reporting on organization;        •    reporting on structure;        •    reporting on internal transactions;    77        •    solvency;        •    group/conglomerate report; and        •    corporate governance/risk management/internal control system  In March 2008, we received written confirmation from FOPI that it will not subject us to group supervision so long as certain business parameters within Switzerland are not exceeded. While we currently intend to operate within these parameters, we cannot assure you that our future business needs may not require that we exceed these parameters or that FOPI will not change these parameters or otherwise determine to exercise group supervision over us. The costs and administrative burdens of such group supervision could be substantial.  Company Structure  Our ability to pay dividends and to make payments on indebtedness may be constrained by our holding company structure.  ACE Limited is a holding company and does not have any significant operations or assets other than its ownership of the shares of its operating insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries. Dividends and other permitted distributions from our insurance subsidiaries are our primary source of funds to meet ongoing cash requirements, including any future debt service payments and other expenses, and to pay dividends to our shareholders. Some of our insurance subsidiaries are subject to significant regulatory restrictions limiting their ability to declare and pay dividends. The inability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our cash requirements at the holding company level could have an adverse effect on our operations and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders and/or meet our debt service obligations.  ACE Limited is a Swiss company; it may be difficult for you to enforce judgments against it or its directors and executive officers.  ACE Limited is incorporated pursuant to the laws of Switzerland. In addition, certain of our directors and officers reside outside the United States and all or a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of such persons are located in jurisdictions outside the United States. As such, it may be difficult or impossible to effect service of process within the United States upon those persons or to recover against us or them on judgments of U.S. courts, including judgments predicated upon civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws.  ACE has been advised by Niederer Kraft & Frey AG, its Swiss counsel, that there is doubt as to whether the courts in Switzerland would enforce:        •    judgments of U.S. courts based upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. Federal securities laws obtained in actions against it or its directors and officers, who reside outside the United States; or        •    original actions brought in Switzerland against these persons or ACE predicated solely upon U.S. Federal securities laws.  ACE has also been advised by Niederer Kraft & Frey AG that there is no treaty in effect between the United States and Switzerland providing for this enforcement, and there are grounds upon which Swiss courts may not enforce judgments of United States courts. Some remedies available under the laws of United States jurisdictions, including some remedies available under the U.S. Federal securities laws, would not be allowed in Swiss courts as contrary to that nation’s public policy.  As a result of the increase in par value of our shares that occurred in connection with our Continuation to Switzerland, we will have less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management than previously.  In connection with our Continuation to Switzerland, we increased the par value of our shares from $0.041666667 to CHF 33.74. Under Swiss law, we may not generally issue registered shares below their par value. In the event     78     there is a need to raise common equity capital at a time when the trading price of our registered shares is below our par value, we will need to obtain approval of our shareholders to decrease the par value of our registered shares. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such shareholder approval. Furthermore, obtaining shareholder approval would require filing a preliminary proxy statement with the SEC and convening a meeting of shareholders which would delay any capital raising plans. Furthermore, any reduction in par value would decrease our ability to pay dividends as a repayment of share capital, which is not subject to Swiss withholding tax. See “Taxation – Shareholders may be subject to Swiss withholding taxes on the payment of dividends.”  Charter Documents and Applicable Law  There are provisions in our charter documents that may reduce the voting rights of our Common Shares.  Our Articles of Association generally provide that shareholders have one vote for each Common Share held by them and are entitled to vote at all meetings of shareholders. However, the voting rights exercisable by a shareholder may be limited so that certain persons or groups are not deemed to hold 10 percent or more of the voting power conferred by our Common Shares. Under these provisions, some shareholders may have the ability to exercise their voting rights limited to less than one vote per share. Moreover, these provisions could have the effect of reducing the voting power of some shareholders who would not otherwise be subject to the limitation by virtue of their direct share ownership. Our Board of Directors may refuse to register holders of shares as shareholders with voting rights based on certain grounds, including if the holder would, directly or indirectly, formally, constructively or beneficially own (as defined in Article 15 of our Articles of Association) or otherwise control voting rights with respect to 10 percent or more of the registered share capital recorded in the commercial register. In addition, the Board of Directors shall reject entry of holders of registered shares as shareholders with voting rights in the share register or shall decide on their deregistration when the acquirer or shareholder upon request does not expressly state that she/he has acquired or holds the shares in her/his own name and for her/his account.  Applicable laws may make it difficult to effect a change of control of our company.  Before a person can acquire control of a U.S. insurance company, prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where the domestic insurer is domiciled. Prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer, the state insurance commissioner will consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant, the integrity and management of the applicant’s Board of Directors and executive officers, the acquirer’s plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer, and any anti-competitive results that may arise from the consummation of the acquisition of control. Generally, state statutes provide that control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing 10 percent or more of the voting securities of the domestic insurer. Because a person acquiring 10 percent or more of our Common Shares would indirectly control the same percentage of the stock of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries, the insurance change of control laws of various U.S. jurisdictions would likely apply to such a transaction. Laws of other jurisdictions in which one or more of our existing subsidiaries are, or a future subsidiary may be, organized or domiciled may contain similar restrictions on the acquisition of control of ACE.  While our Articles of Association limit the voting power of any shareholder to less than 10 percent, there can be no assurance that the applicable regulatory body would agree that a shareholder who owned 10 percent or more of our Common Shares did not, because of the limitation on the voting power of such shares, control the applicable insurance subsidiary.  These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter, or prevent a change of control of the Company, including transactions that some or all of our shareholders might consider to be desirable.    79    U.S. persons who own our Common Shares may have more difficulty in protecting their interests than U.S. persons who are shareholders of a U.S. corporation.  Swiss corporate law, which applies to us, differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and their shareholders. These differences include the manner in which directors must disclose transactions in which they have an interest, the rights of shareholders to bring class action and derivative lawsuits, and the scope of indemnification available to directors and officers.  Anti-takeover provisions in our charter and corporate documents could impede an attempt to replace our directors or to effect a change of control, which could diminish the value of our Common Shares.  Our Articles of Association contain provisions that may make it more difficult for shareholders to replace directors and could delay or prevent a change of control that a shareholder might consider favorable. These provisions include a staggered Board of Directors and voting restrictions. These provisions may prevent a shareholder from receiving the benefit from any premium over the market price of our Common Shares offered by a bidder in a potential takeover. Even in the absence of an attempt to effect a change in management or a takeover attempt, these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Common Shares if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.  Registered holders must exchange their Cayman share certificates in order to exercise certain rights.  Holders of our Ordinary Shares prior to our Continuation to Switzerland continue to own one Registered Share of ACE Limited, a Swiss company for each Ordinary Share of ACE Limited, a Cayman Islands company held before our Continuation to Switzerland. However, until they exchange their certificates for new certificates, registered holders will not be able to exercise any voting rights, prove their ownership interest in the Company, transfer their shares or exercise certain other shareholder rights, though they will be entitled to dividends, preemptive rights and liquidation proceeds. In addition, registered holders must apply to us for enrollment in our share register (Aktienbuch) as shareholders with voting rights, in order to be able to exercise voting rights.  Registered holders of our Common Shares must apply for enrollment in our share register as shareholders with voting rights in order to have voting rights; we may deny such registration under certain circumstances.  To be able to exercise voting rights, registered holders of the shares must apply to us for enrollment in our share register (Aktienbuch) as shareholders with voting rights. Our Board of Directors may refuse to register holders of shares as shareholder with voting rights based on certain grounds, including if the holder would, directly or indirectly, formally, constructively or beneficially own (as defined in Article 15 of our Articles of Association) or otherwise control voting rights with respect to 10 percent or more of the registered share capital recorded in the commercial register.  We are required to declare and pay dividends in Swiss francs and any currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and Swiss francs will affect the dollar value of the dividends we pay.  Under Swiss corporate law, we are required to declare and pay dividends, including distributions through a reduction in par value, in Swiss francs. Dividend payments will be made by our transfer agent in USD converted at the USD/CHF exchange rate shortly before the payment date. As a result, shareholders will be exposed to fluctuations in the USD/CHF exchange rate between the date used for purposes of calculating the CHF amount of any proposed dividend or par value reduction and the relevant payment date, which will not be shorter than two months and could be as long as a year.  Shareholder voting requirements under Swiss law may provide the Company with less flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management than it had as a Cayman Islands company.  Swiss law allows our shareholders to authorize share capital which can be issued by our Board of Directors without shareholder approval but this authorization must be renewed by the shareholder every two years. Swiss     80     law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of stock as the Company had as a Cayman Islands company. Swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders many corporate actions over which our Board of Directors previously had authority when the Company was incorporated in the Cayman Islands. For example, dividends must be approved by shareholders. While we do not believe that the differences between Swiss law and Cayman Island law relating to our capital management will have an adverse effect on the Company, we cannot assure you that situations will not arise where such flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders.  Taxation  Shareholders may be subject to Swiss withholding taxes on the payment of dividends.  Our dividends will generally be subject to a Swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 35 percent. The withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution, and be paid to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration. A U.S. holder that qualifies for benefits under the Convention between the United States of America and the Swiss Confederation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income, which we refer to as the “US-Swiss Treaty,” may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the 15 percent treaty rate (or for a full refund in the case of qualifying retirement arrangements). Payment of a dividend in the form of a par value reduction or qualifying paid-in capital reduction is not subject to Swiss withholding tax. In connection with and prior to the Company’s Continuation to Switzerland, we increased the par value of each share to CHF 33.74. We currently intend, subject to the requirements of our business and applicable law, to recommend to shareholders that dividends be paid in the form of a reduction of our par value or qualifying paid-in capital. We estimate we would be able to pay dividends in the form of a reduction of par value or qualifying paid-in capital, and thus exempt from Swiss withholding tax, for approximately 15-20 years. This range may vary depending upon changes in annual dividends, special dividends, fluctuations in USD/CHF exchange rates, increases/decreases in par value or qualifying paid-in capital, or changes or new interpretations to Swiss tax law or regulations. However, there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value or qualifying paid-in capital each year that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value, or that Swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future.  We may become subject to taxes in Bermuda after March 28, 2016, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and your investment.  The Bermuda Minister of Finance, under the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966 of Bermuda, as amended, has given each of ACE Limited and its Bermuda insurance subsidiaries a written assurance that if any legislation is enacted in Bermuda that would impose tax computed on profits or income, or computed on any capital asset, gain, or appreciation, or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax, then the imposition of any such tax would not be applicable to those companies or any of their respective operations, shares, debentures, or other obligations until March 28, 2016, except insofar as such tax would apply to persons ordinarily resident in Bermuda or is payable by us in respect of real property owned or leased by us in Bermuda. Given the limited duration of the Minister of Finance’s assurance, we cannot be certain that we will not be subject to any Bermuda tax after March 28, 2016.  ACE Limited and our Bermuda-based subsidiaries may become subject to U.S. tax, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and your investment.  ACE Limited, ACE Bermuda Insurance Ltd., ACE Tempest Life Reinsurance Ltd., and our other Bermuda-based insurance subsidiaries operate in a manner so that none of these companies should be subject to U.S. tax (other than U.S. excise tax on insurance and reinsurance premium income attributable to insuring or reinsuring U.S. risks and U.S. withholding tax on some types of U.S. source investment income), because none of these companies should be treated as engaged in a trade or business within the United States. However, because there is considerable uncertainty as to the activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business within the United States, we cannot be certain that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will not contend successfully that any     81     of ACE Limited or its Bermuda-based subsidiaries is/are engaged in a trade or business in the United States. If ACE Limited or any of its Bermuda-based subsidiaries were considered to be engaged in a trade or business in the United States, such entity could be subject to U.S. corporate income and additional branch profits taxes on the portion of its earnings effectively connected to such U.S. business, in which case its results of operations and your investment could be adversely affected.  If you acquire 10 percent or more of ACE Limited’s shares, you may be subject to taxation under the “controlled foreign corporation” (the CFC) rules.  Under certain circumstances, a U.S. person who owns 10 percent or more of the voting power of a foreign corporation that is a CFC (a foreign corporation in which 10 percent U.S. shareholders own more than 50 percent of the voting power or value of the stock of a foreign corporation or more than 25 percent of a foreign insurance corporation) for an uninterrupted period of 30 days or more during a taxable year must include in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes such “10 percent U.S. Shareholder’s” pro rata share of the CFC’s “subpart F income”, even if the subpart F income is not distributed to such 10 percent U.S. Shareholder if such 10 percent U.S. Shareholder owns (directly or indirectly through foreign entities) any of our shares on the last day of our fiscal year. Subpart F income of a foreign insurance corporation typically includes foreign personal holding company income (such as interest, dividends, and other types of passive income), as well as insurance and reinsurance income (including underwriting and investment income) attributable to the insurance of risks situated outside the CFC’s country of incorporation.  We believe that because of the dispersion of our share ownership, provisions in our organizational documents that limit voting power, and other factors, no U.S. person or U.S. Partnership who acquires shares of ACE Limited directly or indirectly through one or more foreign entities should be required to include our subpart F income in income under the CFC rules of the IRS Code. It is possible, however, that the IRS could challenge the effectiveness of these provisions and that a court could sustain such a challenge, in which case your investment could be adversely affected if you own 10 percent or more of ACE Limited’s stock.  U.S. persons who hold shares may be subject to U.S. federal income taxation at ordinary income rates on their proportionate share of our Related Person Insurance Income (RPII).  If the RPII of any of our non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries (each a “Non-U.S. Insurance Subsidiary”) were to equal or exceed 20 percent of that company’s gross insurance income in any taxable year and direct or indirect insureds (and persons related to those insureds) own directly or indirectly through foreign entities 20 percent or more of the voting power or value of ACE Limited, then a U.S. person who owns any shares of ACE Limited (directly or indirectly through foreign entities) on the last day of the taxable year would be required to include in its income for U.S. federal income tax purposes such person’s pro rata share of such company’s RPII for the entire taxable year, determined as if such RPII were distributed proportionately only to U.S. persons at that date regardless of whether such income is distributed. In addition, any RPII that is includible in the income of a U.S. tax-exempt organization may be treated as unrelated business taxable income. We believe that the gross RPII of each Non-U.S. Insurance Subsidiary did not in prior years of operation and is not expected in the foreseeable future to equal or exceed 20 percent of each such company’s gross insurance income, and we do not expect the direct or indirect insureds of each Non-U.S. Insurance Subsidiary (and persons related to such insureds) to directly or indirectly own 20 percent or more of either the voting power or value of our shares, but we cannot be certain that this will be the case because some of the factors which determine the extent of RPII may be beyond our control. If these thresholds are met or exceeded, and if you are an affected U.S. person, your investment could be adversely affected.  U.S. persons who hold shares will be subject to adverse tax consequences if we are considered to be a Passive Foreign Investment Company (PFIC) for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  If ACE Limited is considered a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes, a U.S. person who owns any shares of ACE Limited will be subject to adverse tax consequences, including subjecting the investor to a greater tax     82     liability than might otherwise apply and subjecting the investor to tax on amounts in advance of when tax would otherwise be imposed, in which case your investment could be adversely affected. In addition, if ACE Limited were considered a PFIC, upon the death of any U.S. individual owning shares, such individual’s heirs or estate would not be entitled to a “step-up” in the basis of the shares which might otherwise be available under U.S. federal income tax laws. We believe that we are not, have not been, and currently do not expect to become, a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We cannot assure you, however, that we will not be deemed a PFIC by the IRS. If we were considered a PFIC, it could have adverse tax consequences for an investor that is subject to U.S. federal income taxation. There are currently no regulations regarding the application of the PFIC provisions to an insurance company. New regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying these rules may be forthcoming. We cannot predict what impact, if any, such guidance would have on an investor that is subject to U.S. federal income taxation.  U.S. tax-exempt organizations who own our shares may recognize unrelated business taxable income.  A U.S. tax-exempt organization may recognize unrelated business taxable income if a portion of our insurance income is allocated to the organization, which generally would be the case if either we are a CFC and the tax-exempt shareholder is a 10 percent U.S. shareholder or there is RPII, certain exceptions do not apply, and the tax-exempt organization, directly or indirectly through foreign entities, owns any shares of ACE Limited. Although we do not believe that any U.S. persons or U.S. Partnerships should be allocated such insurance income, we cannot be certain that this will be the case. Potential U.S. tax-exempt investors are advised to consult their tax advisors.  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the European Union are considering measures that might encourage countries to increase our taxes.  A number of multilateral organizations, including the European Union, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the Financial Action Task Force, and the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) have, in recent years, identified some countries as not participating in adequate information exchange, engaging in harmful tax practices, or not maintaining adequate controls to prevent corruption, such as money laundering activities. Recommendations to limit such harmful practices are under consideration by these organizations, and a report published on November 27, 2001 by the OECD at the behest of the FSF titled “Behind the Corporate Veil: Using Corporate Entities for Illicit Purposes”, contains an extensive discussion of specific recommendations. The OECD has threatened non-member jurisdictions that do not agree to cooperate with the OECD with punitive sanctions by OECD member countries, though specific sanctions have yet to be adopted by OECD member countries. It is as yet unclear what these sanctions will be, who will adopt them, and when or if they will be imposed. In an April 18, 2002 report, updated as of June 2004, Bermuda was not listed as an uncooperative tax haven jurisdiction by the OECD because it previously committed to eliminate harmful tax practices and to embrace international tax standards for transparency, exchange of information, and the elimination of regimes for financial and other services that attract businesses with no substantial domestic activity. We cannot assure you, however, that the action taken by Bermuda would be sufficient to preclude all effects of the measures or sanctions described above, which, if ultimately adopted, could adversely affect our Bermuda subsidiaries. However, it should be noted that in respect of exchange of information, Bermuda has entered into Tax information Exchange Agreements (“TIEAs”) with Australia and the United Kingdom and that other TIEA negotiations are currently underway.  Changes in U.S. federal income tax law could adversely affect an investment in our shares.  Legislation is periodically introduced in the U.S. Congress intended to eliminate some perceived tax advantages of companies (including insurance companies) that have legal domiciles outside the United States but have certain U.S. connections. It is possible that legislative proposals could emerge in the future that could have an adverse impact on us or our shareholders.    83    Item 2.
