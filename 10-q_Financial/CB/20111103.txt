Item 1A. Risk Factors  Refer to “Risk Factors” under Item 1A. of Part I of our 2010 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our 2010 Form 10-K. The Risk Factor listed in our 2010 Form 10-K under the subheading, “Changes in U.S. federal income tax law could adversely affect an investment in our shares” is amended and restated to read in its entirety as set forth below.  Changes in U.S. federal income tax law could adversely affect an investment in our shares.  Legislation is periodically introduced in the U.S. Congress intended to eliminate some perceived tax advantages of companies (including insurance companies) that have legal domiciles outside the United States but have certain U.S. connections. For example, HR 3157 and S 1693 (which appear to mirror a tax proposal contained in the President’s Fiscal Year 2012 Budget) were introduced during the current (i.e. 112th) Congress and, if enacted, would effectively render cross border affiliate reinsurance by foreign-owned U.S. insurance/reinsurance companies uneconomical regardless of whether or not it is properly priced under the Internationally accepted arms-length standard. Such a law could have an adverse impact on us or our shareholders. It is possible that other legislative proposals could emerge in the future that could have an adverse impact on us or our shareholders.  Item 2.
