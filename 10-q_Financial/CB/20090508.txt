Item 1A. Risk Factors  Item 1A. of Part I of our 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K, includes a discussion of material risk factors facing us. The information presented below describes material updates and/or additions to such risk factors and should be read in conjunction with the risk factors and information disclosed in our Form 10-K.  The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the European Union are considering measures that might encourage countries to increase our taxes.  A number of multilateral organizations, including the European Union and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have, in recent years, expressed concern about some countries not participating in adequate tax information exchange arrangements and have threatened those that do not agree to cooperate with punitive sanctions by member countries. It is as yet unclear what these sanctions might be, which countries might adopt them, and when or if they might be imposed. We cannot assure you, however, that the Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs) that have been or will be entered into by Switzerland and Bermuda will be sufficient to preclude all of the sanctions described above, which, if ultimately adopted, could adversely affect us or our shareholders.    77    Table of Contents Item 2.
