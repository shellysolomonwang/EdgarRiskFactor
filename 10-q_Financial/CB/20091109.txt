Item 1A. Risk Factors  The following supplements the risk factors that could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition as described under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A. of Part I of our 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K and under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A. of Part II of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2009, and June 30, 2009, should be read in conjunction with those disclosures. The Risk Factor listed in our 2008 Annual Report on Form 10-K under the subheading, “We may be required to post additional collateral because of changes in our reinsurance liabilities to U.S.-regulated insurance companies.” is amended and restated to read in its entirety as set forth below.  We may be required to post additional collateral because of changes in our reinsurance liabilities to regulated insurance companies.  If our reinsurance liabilities increase, we may be required to post additional collateral for insurance company clients. In addition, regulatory changes sometimes affect our obligations to post collateral. Several such regulatory changes are currently under consideration, including changes related to variable annuity contracts. The need to post this additional collateral, if significant enough, may require us to sell investments at a loss in order to provide securities of suitable credit quality, or otherwise secure adequate capital at an unattractive cost. This could adversely impact our net income, and liquidity and capital resources.    103    Table of Contents Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
