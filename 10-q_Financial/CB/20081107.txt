Item 1A. Risk Factors  The following supplements the factors that could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition as described under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A. of Part I of our 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K and under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A. of Part II of our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended June 30, 2008, and March 31, 2008.  A recession and other adverse consequences of the recent U.S. and global economic and financial industry downturns could harm our business, our liquidity and financial condition, and our stock price.  Global market and economic conditions have been severely disrupted. These conditions, including the possibility of a recession, may potentially affect (among other aspects of our business) the demand for and claims made under our products, the ability of customers, counterparties and others to establish or maintain their relationships with us, our ability to access and efficiently use internal and external capital resources, the risks we assume under reinsurance programs covering variable annuity guarantees, and our investment performance. Continued volatility in the U.S. and other securities markets may adversely affect our stock price.  The effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain.  As industry practices and legislative, regulatory, judicial, social, financial and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge. These issues may adversely affect our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the frequency and severity of claims. In some instances, these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued insurance or reinsurance contracts that are affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance or reinsurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued.  We may require additional capital or financing sources in the future, which may not be available or may be available only on unfavorable terms.  Our future capital and financing requirements depend on many factors, including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses, as well as our investment performance. We may need to raise additional funds through financings or access funds through     87    Table of Contents  existing or new credit facilities. Any equity or debt financing, if available at all, may be on terms that are not favorable to us. In the case of equity financings, dilution to our shareholders could result, and in any case such securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges that are senior to those of our Common Shares. Our access to funds under existing credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facilities to meet their funding commitments. Those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time, and we might be forced to replace credit sources in a difficult market. There has also been recent consolidation in the industry, which could lead to increased reliance on and exposure to particular institutions. If we cannot obtain adequate capital or sources of credit on favorable terms, or at all, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. It is possible that, in the future, one or more of the rating agencies may reduce our existing ratings. If one or more of our ratings were downgraded, we could incur higher borrowing costs and our ability to access the capital markets could be impacted.  Our investment performance may affect our financial results and ability to conduct business.  Our funds are invested by professional investment management firms under the direction of our management team in accordance with investment guidelines approved by the Finance and Investment Committee of the Board of Directors. Although our investment guidelines stress diversification of risks and conservation of principal and liquidity, our investments are subject to market risks, as well as risks inherent in individual securities. The volatility of our loss claims may force us to liquidate securities, which may cause us to incur capital losses. Investment losses could significantly decrease our book value, thereby affecting our ability to conduct business. The recent unprecedented investment market volatility, precipitous stock market decline and increased credit spreads have resulted in significant realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio. Refer to “Fair Value Measurements”, “Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses)”, and “Investments”, under Item 2 of Part 1 of this Form 10-Q.  Our investment portfolio has exposure to below investment-grade securities that have a higher degree of credit or default risk which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Our fixed income portfolio is primarily invested in high quality, investment-grade securities. However, we invest a smaller portion of the portfolio in below investment-grade securities. These securities, which pay a higher rate of interest, also have a higher degree of credit or default risk. These securities may also be less liquid in times of economic weakness or market disruptions. While we have put in place procedures to monitor the credit risk and liquidity of our invested assets, it is possible that, in periods of economic weakness (such as recession), we may experience default losses in our portfolio. This may result in a reduction of net income and capital. Refer to “Fair Value Measurements”, “Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses)”, and “Investments”, under Item 2 of Part 1 of this Form 10-Q.  Our net income may be volatile because certain products offered by our Life business expose us to reserve and fair value liability changes that are directly affected by market factors.  Under reinsurance programs covering variable annuity guarantees, we assume the risk of guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB) and GMIBs associated with variable annuity contracts. Our net income is directly impacted by changes in the reserves calculated in connection with the reinsurance of GMDB and GMIB liabilities. In addition, our net income is directly impacted by the change in the fair value of the GMIB liability. The reserve and fair value liability calculations are directly affected by market factors, the most significant of which are equity levels, interest rate levels, interest rate swap volatilities, and implied equity volatilities. ACE views our variable annuity reinsurance business as having a similar risk profile to that of catastrophe reinsurance, with the probability of a cumulative long-term economic net loss relatively small, even taking into account current market conditions. However, in the short-run, adverse changes in market factors will have an adverse impact on both life underwriting income and our net income, which may be material. Refer to “Fair Value Measurements”, “Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses)”, and “Investments”, under Item 2 of Part 1 of this Form 10-Q.    88    Table of Contents Events may result in political, regulatory, and industry initiatives which could adversely affect our business.   Government intervention has occurred in the insurance and reinsurance markets in relation to terrorism coverage both in the U.S. and through industry initiatives in other countries. The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA), which was enacted in 2002 to ensure the availability of insurance coverage for certain types of terrorist acts in the U.S., was extended in 2007 for seven years, through 2014. Refer to “Regulation – U.S. Operations” for more information in our 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Government intervention and the possibility of future interventions has created uncertainty in the insurance and reinsurance markets about the definition of terrorist acts and the extent to which future coverages will extend to terrorist acts. Government regulators are generally concerned with the protection of policyholders to the exclusion of other constituencies, including shareholders of insurers and reinsurers. While we cannot predict the exact nature, timing, or scope of possible governmental initiatives, such proposals could adversely affect our business by:        •    providing insurance and reinsurance capacity in markets and to consumers that we target;        •    requiring our participation in industry pools and guaranty associations;        •    expanding the scope of coverage under existing policies;        •    regulating the terms of insurance and reinsurance policies; or        •    disproportionately benefiting the companies of one country over those of another.  The insurance industry is also affected by political, judicial, and legal developments that may create new and expanded theories of liability. Such changes may result in delays or cancellations of products and services by insurers and reinsurers, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, the recent economic climate presents additional uncertainties and risks relating to increased regulation and the potential for increased involvement of the U.S. and other governments in the financial services industry.  Changes in U.S. federal income tax law could adversely affect an investment in our shares.  Legislation is periodically introduced in the U.S. Congress intended to eliminate some perceived tax advantages of companies (including insurance companies) that have legal domiciles outside the United States but have certain U.S. connections. For example, in the current Congress a bill was introduced in the House of Representatives that would effectively render cross border affiliate reinsurance by foreign-owned U.S. insurance/reinsurance companies impossible regardless of whether or not it is properly priced under the internationally accepted arms-length standard. Companion legislation has not yet been introduced in the Senate. If enacted, such a law could have an adverse impact on us or our shareholders. It is possible that other legislative proposals could emerge in the future that could have an adverse impact on us or our shareholders.    89    Table of Contents Item 2.
