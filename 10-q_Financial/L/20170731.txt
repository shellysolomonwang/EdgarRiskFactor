Item 1A. Risk Factors.  Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes a detailed discussion of certain risk factors facing the company. The information presented below describes additions to such risk factors and should be read in conjunction with the Risk Factors included under Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.  Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Consolidated Container Company (“Consolidated Container”)  Consolidated Container’s substantial indebtedness could affect its ability to meet its obligations and may otherwise restrict its activities.  Consolidated Container has a significant amount of indebtedness, which requires significant interest payments. Its inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations, or to refinance its obligations on commercially reasonable terms, would have a material adverse effect on its business. Consolidated Container’s substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:        •    limit its ability to borrow money for its working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other corporate purposes;    58    Table of Contents     •    increase its vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and        •    limit its ability to respond to business opportunities, including growing its business through acquisitions.  In addition, the credit agreements governing its current indebtedness contain, and any future debt instruments would likely contain, financial and other restrictive covenants, which impose significant operating and financial restrictions on it. As a result of these covenants, Consolidated Container could be limited in the manner in which it conducts its business and may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. Furthermore, a failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on its business.  Fluctuations in raw material prices and raw material availability may affect Consolidated Container’s results.  To produce its products, Consolidated Container uses large quantities of plastic resins and recycled plastic materials. It faces the risk that its access to these raw materials may be interrupted or that it may not be able to purchase these raw materials at prices that are acceptable to it. In general, Consolidated Container does not have long-term supply contracts with its suppliers, and its purchases of raw materials are subject to market prices. Although Consolidated Container generally is able to pass changes in the prices of raw materials through to its customers over a period of time, it may not always be able to do so or there may be a lag between when its costs increase and when it passes those costs through to its customers. It may not be able to pass through all future raw material price increases in a timely manner or at all due to competitive pressures. In addition, a sustained increase in resin and recycled plastic prices, relative to alternative packaging materials, would make plastic containers less economical for its customers and could result in a slower pace of conversions to, or reductions in the use of, plastic containers. Any limitation on its ability to procure its primary raw materials or to pass through price increases in such materials on a timely basis could negatively affect its results of operations.  Consolidated Container depends on several large customers, the loss of which could have a material adverse effect on its business. In addition, because many of its customers’ contracts are requirements-based contracts, it faces the risk that they will purchase less than anticipated volumes.  The termination of any of Consolidated Container’s top customer relationships or significant declines in demand for its products could have a material adverse effect on Consolidated Container’s business. Furthermore, in Consolidated Container’s rigid packaging business, many of its contracts with large customers are requirements-based contracts that do not obligate the customer to purchase fixed amounts of product from it and are subject to termination by its customers under certain circumstances. As a result, despite the existence of contracts with most of its key customers, Consolidated Container generally faces the risk that the customers will not purchase expected amounts of the products covered under contracts. Additionally, customer contracts come up for renewal on a regular basis in the ordinary course of business, and Consolidated Container cannot guarantee that it will be able to successfully renew these contracts on favorable terms or at all as they expire.  Consolidated Container’s customers may increase their self-manufacturing.  Increased self-manufacturing by Consolidated Container’s customers may have a material adverse impact on its sales volume and financial results. Consolidated Container believes that its customers may engage in self-manufacturing over time at locations where transportation costs are high, and where low complexity and available space to install blow molding equipment exists. If one or more of Consolidated Container’s customers increase their self-manufacturing, it may materially adversely affect its business.    59    Table of Contents Item 2.
