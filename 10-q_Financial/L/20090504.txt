Item 1A. Risk Factors.  Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 includes a detailed discussion of certain material risk factors facing our company. The information presented below describes updates and additions to such risk factors and should be read in conjunction with the risk factors and information disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008.  The risk factor in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 captioned “Diamond Offshore is self-insured for a portion of physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.” is no longer applicable and is deleted in its entirety.  The following new risk factor is added:  Diamond Offshore has elected to self-insure for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.  Because the amount of insurance coverage available to Diamond Offshore has been significantly limited and the cost for such coverage has increased substantially, Diamond Offshore has elected to self-insure for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. This change results in a higher risk of losses, which could be material, that are not covered by third party insurance contracts. If one or more named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico cause significant damage to Diamond Offshore’s rigs or equipment, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
