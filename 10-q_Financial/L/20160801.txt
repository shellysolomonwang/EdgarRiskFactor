Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for further discussion of factors that may affect the forward-looking statements. The following information describes an addition to the Forward-Looking Statements and should be read in conjunction with the Forward-Looking Statements disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  On June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the E.U., commonly referred to as “Brexit.” As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the British government will formally commence the process to leave the E.U. and begin negotiating the terms of treaties that will govern the U.K.’s future relationship with the E.U. Although it is unknown what those terms will be, it is possible that a U.K. insurance entity’s ability to transact insurance business in E.U. countries will be subject to increased regulatory complexities or may not be possible at all. Brexit related changes may adversely affect CNA’s operations and financial results.  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.  There were no material changes in our market risk components for the six months ended June 30, 2016. See the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk included in Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for further information.

Controls and Procedures.  The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits to the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), including this report, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis. These disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management on a timely basis to allow decisions regarding required disclosure.
