Item 1A. Risk Factors.  Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes a detailed discussion of certain material risk factors facing our company. The information presented below describes updates and additions to such risk factors and should be read in conjunction with the risk factors and information disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007.  We could have a liability in the future for tobacco-related lawsuits.  As a result of our ownership of Lorillard prior to the Separation, which was consummated in June 2008, from time to time we have been named as a defendant in tobacco-related lawsuits. We are currently a defendant in four such lawsuits and could be named as a defendant in additional tobacco-related suits, notwithstanding the completion of the Separation. In the Separation Agreement entered into between us and Lorillard and its subsidiaries in connection with the Separation, Lorillard and each of its subsidiaries has agreed to indemnify us for liabilities related to Lorillardâ€™s tobacco business, including liabilities that we may incur for current and future tobacco-related litigation against us. An adverse decision in a tobacco-related lawsuit against us could, if the indemnification is deemed for any reason to be unenforceable or any amounts owed to us thereunder are not collectible, in whole or in part, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and equity. We do not expect that the Separation will alter the legal exposure of either entity with respect to tobacco-related claims. We do not believe that we had or have any liability for tobacco-related claims, and we have never been held liable for any such claims.  Item 2.
