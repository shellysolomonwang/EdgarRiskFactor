Item 1A. Risk Factors.  Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes a detailed discussion of certain material risk factors facing our company. The information presented below describes updates and additions to such risk factors and should be read in conjunction with the risk factors and information disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007.  We could have a liability in the future for tobacco-related lawsuits.  As a result of our ownership of Lorillard prior to the Separation, which was consummated in June 2008, from time to time we have been named as a defendant in tobacco-related lawsuits. We are currently a defendant in four such lawsuits and could be named as a defendant in additional tobacco-related suits, notwithstanding the completion of the Separation. In the Separation Agreement entered into between us and Lorillard and its subsidiaries in connection with the Separation, Lorillard and each of its subsidiaries has agreed to indemnify us for liabilities related to Lorillard’s tobacco business, including liabilities that we may incur for current and future tobacco-related litigation against us. An adverse decision in a tobacco-related lawsuit against us could, if the indemnification is deemed for any reason to be unenforceable or any amounts owed to us thereunder are not collectible, in whole or in part, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and equity. We do not expect that the Separation will alter the legal exposure of either entity with respect to tobacco-related claims. We do not believe that we had or have any liability for tobacco-related claims, and we have never been held liable for any such claims.  The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 may impact the fair value determinations of CNA’s invested assets and may lead to regulatory limitations, impositions and restrictions upon CNA.  One of the main features of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (“the Act”), which took effect October 3, 2008, is the establishment of the Troubled Assets Relief Program (“TARP”). Although CNA is eligible to participate in TARP, CNA has not yet decided whether to tender its eligible securities. Regardless of CNA’s participation decision, several provisions of the Act could affect CNA. Purchase prices under TARP could impact marketplace fair values of similar securities, thereby impacting CNA’s fair value determinations. Also, the mandatory plan adopted to recoup the net losses of TARP within the next five years may target financial institutions such as CNA and may lead to regulatory limitations, impositions and future assessments. All of these factors may have an adverse material impact on CNA’s business, insurer financial strength and debt ratings, and our results of operations and equity.  We provide capital to our subsidiaries from time to time, which reduces cash balances at the parent company.  We are a holding company and get substantially all of our income and cash flow from our operating subsidiaries. Certain of our operating subsidiaries require substantial amounts of capital from time to time to fund expansions, enhance capital or to satisfy rating agency or regulatory requirements or for other reasons. Sufficient capital to satisfy these needs may not be available to our subsidiaries when needed on acceptable terms from the capital markets or other third parties. In such cases, we have in the past, and may in the future, provide substantial amounts of debt or equity capital to our subsidiaries, which may not be on market terms. Any such investments reduce the amount of cash available at the parent company which might otherwise be used to fund acquisitions, share buybacks, dividends or other investments or to fund other capital requirements of our subsidiaries. Significantly reduced levels of cash at the parent company could also result in a downgrade of our ratings by the major credit rating agencies which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and equity.  Continued deterioration in the public debt and equity markets could lead to additional investment losses.  The prolonged and severe disruptions in the public debt and equity markets, including among other things, widening of credit spreads, bankruptcies and government intervention in a number of large financial institutions, have resulted in significant realized and unrealized losses in the investment portfolios of CNA and the parent company. For the nine months ended September 30, 2008 we incurred substantial realized and unrealized investment losses, as described in MD&A under Item 2 of this report. Subsequent to September 30, 2008, through the date of this report, conditions in the public debt and equity markets have continued to deteriorate and pricing levels have continued to decline. As a result,         87            depending on market conditions, we could incur substantial additional realized and unrealized losses in future periods, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and equity.
