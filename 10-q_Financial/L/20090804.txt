Item 1A. Risk Factors.  Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008 includes a detailed discussion of certain material risk factors facing our company. The information presented below reflects updates and additions to such risk factors and should be read in conjunction with the risk factors and information disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2008. The following risk factors are restated in their entirety:  Diamond Offshore has elected to self-insure for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.  Because the amount of insurance coverage available to Diamond Offshore has been significantly limited and the cost for such coverage has increased substantially, Diamond Offshore has elected to self-insure for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. This change results in a higher risk of losses, which could be material, that are not covered by third party insurance contracts. If one or more named windstorms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico cause significant damage to Diamond Offshore’s rigs or equipment, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow.  A portion of the expected maximum daily capacity of Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipeline expansion projects is contingent on receiving and maintaining authority from PHMSA to operate at higher operating pressures.  Boardwalk Pipeline is seeking authority from PHMSA to operate its new expansion pipeline projects under special permits that would allow each pipeline to operate at higher than normal operating pressures (80.0% of the pipe’s Specified Minimum Yield Strength, or SMYS, as opposed to the normal operating pressure of 72.0% SMYS). The ability to operate at higher operating pressures increases the transportation capacity of the pipelines, thereby increasing its maximum peak-day transmission capacity. For each expansion pipeline, Boardwalk Pipeline has entered into firm transportation contracts with shippers which would utilize the maximum capacity available from operating at higher operating pressures. Therefore, absent such authority, Boardwalk Pipeline will not be able to transport all of the contracted quantities of natural gas on these pipelines.  During the permitting process Boardwalk Pipeline discovered anomalies in certain pipeline segments on each of its expansion projects. Accordingly, operating pressures on each pipeline were reduced below normal operating pressures as Boardwalk Pipeline proceeds to perform additional testing procedures, remediate the anomalies and seek authority from PHMSA to increase operating pressures, first to normal operating pressures and subsequently to higher operating pressures under the special permit. Boardwalk Pipeline has also shut down pipeline segments for periods of time to remediate anomalies. During the second quarter of 2009, Boardwalk Pipeline entered into an agreement with PHMSA, modifying each of its special permits, that define the testing protocol and remediation efforts, including replacement of certain pipe joints, performing investigative digs to physically inspect the pipe sections and conducting metallurgical testing and analysis on a variety of pipe samples, that Boardwalk Pipeline needs to complete in order to return to normal operating pressures and to operate at higher operating pressures. PHMSA retains discretion as to whether to grant, or to maintain in force, authority to operate a pipeline at higher operating pressures.  The pressure reductions and shutdowns that have been undertaken to remediate anomalies on Boardwalk Pipeline’s expansion pipeline projects have reduced throughput and adversely impacted Boardwalk Pipeline’s transportation revenues, net income and cash flow. With respect to each of the expansion pipelines, until Boardwalk Pipeline has remediated the pipe anomalies, performed additional testing required by PHMSA and obtained PHMSA’s consent to increase operating pressures to normal levels, as well as higher levels under the special permits, Boardwalk Pipeline will not be able to operate that pipeline at its anticipated peak-day transmission capacity, which could continue to have a material adverse affect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow, including the ability to make distributions to unitholders. In addition, Boardwalk Pipeline has incurred and will continue to incur costs, which may be significant, to inspect, test and replace defective pipe segments on each of its expansion pipelines.  Boardwalk Pipeline is undertaking large, complex expansion projects which involve significant risks that may adversely affect its business.  Boardwalk Pipeline is currently undertaking several large, complex pipeline and storage expansion projects and may also undertake additional expansion projects in the future. In pursuing these and previous projects, Boardwalk Pipeline          85             experienced significant cost overruns and may experience cost increases in the future. Boardwalk Pipeline also experienced delays in constructing and commissioning these pipelines and may experience additional delays in the future. Delays in construction and commissioning of new pipelines could result from a variety of factors and have resulted in penalties under customer contracts such as liquidated damage payments and could in the future result in similar losses. In some cases, certain customers could have the right to terminate their transportation agreements if the related expansion project is not completed by a date specified in their precedent agreements and the exercise of such rights could have a material adverse effect on Boardwalk Pipeline’s results of operations and cash flow, including the ability to make distributions to unitholders.   The cost overruns and construction and commissioning delays experienced by Boardwalk Pipeline have resulted from a variety of factors, including the following:          §   delays in obtaining regulatory approvals, including delays in receiving authorization from PHMSA to operate the expansion pipelines at higher operating pressures under special permits following the discovery of anomalies in portions of its expansion pipelines;              §   difficult construction conditions, including adverse weather conditions, difficult river crossings and higher density rock formations than anticipated;              §   delays in obtaining key materials; and              §   shortages of qualified labor and escalating costs of labor and materials resulting from the high level of construction activity in the pipeline industry.      In pursuing current or future expansion projects, Boardwalk Pipeline could experience additional delays or cost increases for the reasons described above or as a result of other factors. Boardwalk Pipeline may not be able to complete its current or future expansion projects on the expected terms, cost or schedule, or at all. In addition, Boardwalk Pipeline cannot be certain that, if completed, it will be able to operate these projects, or that they will perform, in accordance with expectations. Other areas of Boardwalk Pipeline’s business may suffer as a result of the diversion of management’s attention and other resources from other business concerns to its expansion projects. Any of these factors could impair Boardwalk Pipeline’s ability to realize revenues from its expansion projects sufficient to cover the costs associated with owning and operating these pipelines and to provide the anticipated benefits from the projects, which could have a material adverse effect on Boardwalk Pipeline’s business, results of operations and cash flow, including the ability to make distributions to unitholders.
