Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Regulation—We are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock; the Bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us, which could limit our ability to pay dividends or make payments on our indebtedness” and “Regulation—Savings Association Regulation—Dividends and Stock Repurchases” in our 2015 Form 10-K. Capital____________________________________________________________________________________________Our primary sources of capital have been earnings generated by our businesses and existing equity capital. We seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support the risks of our businesses, meet regulatory requirements, adhere to rating agency targets and support future business growth. The level, composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment, strategic initiatives and legislative and regulatory developments. Within these constraints, we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that will provide attractive returns to our stockholders. Our capital adequacy assessment also includes tax and accounting considerations in accordance with regulatory guidance. We maintain a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet, and we include this asset when calculating our regulatory capital levels. However, for regulatory capital purposes, deferred tax assets are (i) limited to the amount of taxes previously paid that a company could recover through loss carrybacks; and (ii) 10% of the amount of our Tier 1 capital. At June 30, 2016, no portion of our deferred tax asset was disallowed for regulatory capital purposes. The Bank is required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis, and beginning on January 1, 2017, the Company will be required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis under the OCC's and the Federal Reserve Board's stress test regulations. The Bank is, and the Company will be, required to use stress-testing methodologies providing for results under at least three different sets of conditions, including baseline, adverse and severely adverse conditions. In addition, while as a savings and loan holding company we currently are not subject to the Federal Reserve Board's capital planning rule, we prepared and submitted a capital plan to the Federal Reserve Board in April 2016.Dividend and Share RepurchasesOn July 7, 2016, the Company announced that its Board approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per share of common stock and a share repurchase program of up to $952 million for the four quarters ending June 30, 2017. The Company expects to make share repurchases subject to market conditions and other factors, including legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals.The Board also declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per share of common stock, payable on August 25, 2016 to holders of record at the close of business on August 12, 2016. The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend on many factors, including the financial condition, earnings, capital and liquidity requirements of us and the Bank, regulatory restrictions, corporate law and contractual restrictions and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant. In addition, banking laws and regulations and our banking regulators may limit our ability to pay dividends and make repurchases of our stock. For a discussion of regulatory restrictions on our and the Bank’s ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Regulation—We are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock; the Bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us, which could limit our ability to pay dividends or make payments on our indebtedness” in our 2015 Form 10-K.Regulatory Capital Requirements - Synchrony FinancialAs a savings and loan holding company, we are required to maintain minimum capital ratios, under the applicable U.S. Basel III capital rules. For more information, see “Regulation—Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation” in our 2015 Form 10-K.28For Synchrony Financial to be a well-capitalized savings and loan holding company, Synchrony Bank must be well-capitalized and Synchrony Financial must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Federal Reserve Board to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. As of June 30, 2016, Synchrony Financial met all the requirements to be deemed well-capitalized.The following table sets forth at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the composition of our capital ratios for the Company calculated under the Basel III regulatory capital standards. Basel III Transition(unless otherwise stated) At June 30, 2016 At December 31, 2015($ in millions)Amount Ratio(1) Amount Ratio(1)Total risk-based capital$13,500 19.8% $12,531 18.1%Tier 1 risk-based capital$12,610 18.5% $11,633 16.8%Tier 1 leverage$12,610 15.6% $11,633 14.4%Common equity Tier 1 capital$12,610 18.5% $11,633 16.8%Common equity Tier 1 capital - fully phased-in (estimated)$12,344 18.0% $11,234 15.9%______________________(1)Tier 1 leverage ratio represents total tier 1 capital as a percentage of total average assets, after certain adjustments. All other ratios presented above represent the applicable capital measure as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. The increase in our Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was primarily due to the retention of the Company's net earnings for the six months ended June 30, 2016.Non-GAAP MeasuresThe capital ratios presented above include common equity Tier 1 capital ("CET1") as calculated under the U.S. Basel III capital rules on a fully phased-in basis, which is not currently required by our regulators to be disclosed and, as such, is considered to be a non-GAAP measure. We believe that this capital ratio is a useful measure to investors because it is widely used by analysts and regulators to assess the capital position of financial services companies, although this ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the components of our CET1 capital ratio as calculated on a fully phased-in basis set forth above, to the comparable GAAP component at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.($ in millions)At June 30, 2016 At December 31, 2015Basel III - Common equity Tier 1 (transition)$12,610 $11,633Adjustments related to capital components during transition(1)(266) (399)    Basel III - Common equity Tier 1 (fully phased-in)$12,344 $11,234    Risk-weighted assets - Basel III (transition)$68,188 $69,224Adjustments related to risk weighted assets during transition(2)274 1,269    Risk-weighted assets - Basel III (fully phased-in)$68,462 $70,493    ______________________ (1)Adjustments related to capital components to determine CET1 (fully phased-in) include the phase-in of the intangible asset exclusion.(2)Key differences between Basel III transition rules and fully phased-in Basel III rules relate to the calculation of risk-weighted assets including, but not limited to, risk weighting of deferred tax assets and adjustments to capital for certain intangible assets.29Regulatory Capital Requirements - Synchrony BankAt June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Bank met all applicable requirements to be deemed well-capitalized pursuant to OCC regulations and for purposes of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Effective January 1, 2015, the Bank became subject to the U.S. Basel III regulatory capital standards, subject to transition provisions. The following table sets forth the composition of the Bank’s capital ratios calculated under the Basel III rules at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  At June 30, 2016 At December 31, 2015 Minimum to be Well-Capitalized under Prompt Corrective Action Provisions - Basel III($ in millions)Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount RatioTotal risk-based capital$9,064 17.4% $8,442 16.6% $5,197 10.0%Tier 1 risk-based capital$8,383 16.1% $7,781 15.3% $4,158 8.0%Tier 1 leverage$8,383 13.6% $7,781 13.1% $3,090 5.0%Common equity Tier 1 capital$8,383 16.1% $7,781 15.3% $3,378 6.5%Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could limit our business activities and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Regulation—Failure by Synchrony and the Bank to meet applicable capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on us” in our 2015 Form 10-K.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Unfunded Lending Commitments____________________________________________________________________________________________We do not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantees of third-party obligations. Guarantees are contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make a guaranteed payment or perform an obligation to a third-party based on certain trigger events. At June 30, 2016, we had not recorded any contingent liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position related to any guarantees.We extend credit, primarily arising from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on our credit cards, in the ordinary course of business. See Note 4 - Loan Receivables and Allowance for Loan Losses to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on our unfunded lending commitments.Critical Accounting Estimates____________________________________________________________________________________________In preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements, we have identified certain accounting estimates and assumptions that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. The critical accounting estimates we have identified relate to allowance for loan losses, asset impairment, income taxes and fair value measurements. All of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates future, economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. If these conditions change from those expected, it is reasonably possible that these judgments and estimates could change, which may result in incremental losses on loan receivables, future impairments of investment securities, goodwill and intangible assets, and the establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increases in our tax liabilities, among other effects. See “Management's Discussion and Analysis—Critical Accounting Estimates” in our 2015 Form 10-K, for a detailed discussion of these critical accounting estimates.30New Accounting Standards____________________________________________________________________________________________In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of this standard, with a revised effective date for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or modified retrospective (cumulative effect) transition method. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.In January 2016, we adopted ASU 2015-03, Interest–Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires the presentation of deferred issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability. Accordingly, we have reclassified issuance costs associated with our borrowings and certain brokered deposits, from other assets, and reflected as a reduction of borrowings and interest-bearing deposit accounts, as applicable, for each period presented to conform to the current period presentation. Related selected financial metrics have also been updated where applicable to reflect this reclassification. See “Management's Discussion and Analysis—Results of Operations—Other Financial and Statistical Data” and Note 8. Deposits and Note 9. Borrowings to our condensed consolidated financial statements.In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires an entity to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date. Financial assets measured at amortized cost are to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for loan losses is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. This standard is effective for annual and interim reporting periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for annual and interim periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The amendments in this standard will be recognized through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-13 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.Regulation and Supervision____________________________________________________________________________________________Our business, including our relationships with our customers, is subject to regulation, supervision and examination under U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business, including lending practices, treatment of our customers, safeguarding deposits, customer privacy and information security, capital structure, liquidity, dividends and other capital distributions, transactions with affiliates, and conduct and qualifications of personnel.As a savings and loan holding company, Synchrony is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. As a large provider of consumer financial services, we are also subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the CFPB. The Bank is a federally chartered savings association. As such, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC, which is its primary regulator, and by the CFPB. In addition, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is supervised by the FDIC. See “Regulation” in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional information. See also “—Capital” above, for discussion of the impact of regulations and supervision on our capital and liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock. 31ITEM 1.

BUSINESS DESCRIPTIONSynchrony Financial (the “Company”) provides a range of credit products through programs it has established with a diverse group of national and regional retailers, local merchants, manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations and healthcare service providers. We offer private label and co-branded Dual Card credit cards, promotional financing and installment lending, loyalty programs and FDIC-insured savings products through Synchrony Bank (the “Bank”). In November 2015, Synchrony Financial became a stand-alone savings and loan holding company following the completion of General Electric Company’s (“GE”) exchange offer, in which GE exchanged shares of GE common stock for all of the shares of our common stock it owned (the “Separation”).References to the “Company”, “we”, “us” and “our” are to Synchrony Financial and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires.NOTE 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of PresentationThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).Preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates based on assumptions about current, and for some estimates future, economic and market conditions (for example, unemployment, housing, interest rates and market liquidity) which affect reported amounts and related disclosures in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Although our current estimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect them to change in the future, as appropriate, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could be different than anticipated in those estimates, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial position. Among other effects, such changes could result in incremental losses on loan receivables, future impairments of investment securities, goodwill and intangible assets, increases in reserves for contingencies, establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increases in our tax liabilities.We conduct our operations within the United States and Canada. Substantially all of our revenues are from U.S. customers. The operating activities conducted by our non-U.S. affiliates use the local currency as their functional currency. The effects of translating the financial statements of these non-U.S. affiliates to U.S. dollars are included in equity. Asset and liability accounts are translated at year-end exchange rates, while revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the respective periods.Consolidated Basis of PresentationThe Company’s financial statements have been prepared on a consolidated basis. Under this basis of presentation, our financial statements consolidate all of our subsidiaries – i.e., entities in which we have a controlling financial interest, most often because we hold a majority voting interest.To determine if we hold a controlling financial interest in an entity, we first evaluate if we are required to apply the variable interest entity (“VIE”) model to the entity, otherwise the entity is evaluated under the voting interest model. Where we hold current or potential rights that give us the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance (“power”) combined with a variable interest that gives us the right to receive potentially significant benefits or the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses (“significant economics”), we have a controlling financial interest in that VIE. Rights held by others to remove the party with power over the VIE are not considered unless one party can exercise those rights unilaterally. We consolidate certain securitization entities under the VIE model because we have both power and significant economics. See Note 5. Variable Interest Entities.37Interim Period PresentationThe condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto are unaudited. These statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) that we considered necessary to present a fair statement of our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The results reported in these condensed consolidated financial statements should not be considered as necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the entire year. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our 2015 annual consolidated and combined financial statements and the related notes in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (our "2015 Form 10-K"). Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesIn January 2016, we adopted ASU 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires the presentation of deferred issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability. Accordingly, for issuance costs associated with our borrowings and certain brokered deposits, we have revised our presentation of other assets, borrowings and interest-bearing deposit accounts for each period presented to conform to the current period presentation.See Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our 2015 annual consolidated and combined financial statements in our 2015 Form 10-K, for additional information on our significant accounting policies.NOTE 3. INVESTMENT SECURITIES All of our investment securities are classified as available-for-sale and are held to meet our liquidity objectives and to comply with the Community Reinvestment Act.

We presently do not intend to sell our debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position and believe that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of our amortized cost.

Accordingly, impaired loans represent restructured smaller balance homogeneous loans meeting the definition of a Troubled Debt Restructuring (“TDR”). We use certain loan modification programs for borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. These loan modification programs include interest rate reductions and payment deferrals in excess of three months, which were not part of the terms of the original contract. We have both internal and external loan modification programs. The internal loan modification programs include both temporary and permanent programs. For our credit card customers, the temporary hardship program primarily consists of a reduced minimum payment and an interest rate reduction, both lasting for a period no longer than 12 months. The permanent workout program involves changing the structure of the loan to a fixed payment loan with a maturity no longer than 60 months and reducing the interest rate on the loan. The permanent program does not normally provide for the forgiveness of unpaid principal but may allow for the reversal of certain unpaid interest or fee assessments. We also make loan modifications for customers who request financial assistance through external sources, such as consumer credit counseling agency programs. These loans typically receive a reduced interest rate but continue to be subject to the original minimum payment terms and do not normally include waiver of unpaid principal, interest or fees. The following table provides information on loans that entered a loan modification program during the periods presented: Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30,($ in millions)2016 2015 2016 2015Credit cards$119 $109 $251 $227Consumer installment loans— — — —Commercial credit products— 1 1 3Total$119 $110 $252 $230Our allowance for loan losses on TDRs is generally measured based on the difference between the recorded loan receivable and the present value of the expected future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate of the loan. Interest income from loans accounted for as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. 41The following table provides information about loans classified as TDRs and specific reserves. We do not evaluate credit card loans for impairment on an individual basis but instead estimate an allowance for loan losses on a collective basis. As a result, there are no impaired loans for which there is no allowance.At June 30, 2016 ($ in millions)Total recordedinvestment Related allowance Net recorded investment Unpaid principal balanceCredit cards$775 $(261) $514 $682Consumer installment loans— — — —Commercial credit products6 (3) 3 6Total$781 $(264) $517 $688At December 31, 2015 ($ in millions)Total recordedinvestment Related allowance Net recorded investment Unpaid principal balanceCredit cards$756 $(256) $500 $659Consumer installment loans— — — —Commercial credit products7 (3) 4 6Total$763 $(259) $504 $665Financial Effects of TDRsAs part of our loan modifications for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, we may provide multiple concessions to minimize our economic loss and improve long-term loan performance and collectability.

Secured loan receivables are largely comprised of consumer installment loans secured by equipment. Unsecured loan receivables are largely comprised of our open-ended consumer and commercial revolving credit card loans. As part of our credit risk management activities, on an ongoing basis, we assess overall credit quality by reviewing information related to the performance of a customer’s account with us, as well as information from credit bureaus, such as a Fair Isaac Corporation (“FICO”) or other credit scores, relating to the customer’s broader credit performance. FICO scores are generally obtained at origination of the account and are refreshed, at a minimum quarterly, but could be as often as weekly, to assist in predicting customer behavior. We categorize these credit scores into the following three credit score categories: (i) 661 or higher, which are considered the strongest credits; (ii) 601 to 660, considered moderate credit risk; and (iii) 600 or less, which are considered weaker credits. There are certain customer accounts for which a FICO score is not available where we use alternative sources to assess their credit and predict behavior. The following table provides the most recent FICO scores available for our customers at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, as a percentage of each class of loan receivable. The table below excludes 0.9% of our total loan receivables balances at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, which represents those customer accounts for which a FICO score is not available.

Unused credit card lines available to our customers totaled approximately $335 billion and $322 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. While these amounts represented the total available unused credit card lines, we have not experienced and do not anticipate that all of our customers will access their entire available line at any given point in time.Interest Income by ProductThe following table provides additional information about our interest and fees on loans from our loan receivables, including held for sale: Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30,($ in millions)2016 2015 2016 2015Credit cards$3,432 $3,106 $6,868 $6,185Consumer installment loans28 26 55 51Commercial credit products33 34 68 70Other1 — 1 —Total$3,494 $3,166 $6,992 $6,306NOTE 5. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIESWe use VIEs to securitize loans and arrange asset-backed financing in the ordinary course of business. Investors in these entities only have recourse to the assets owned by the entity and not to our general credit. We do not have implicit support arrangements with any VIE and we did not provide non-contractual support for previously transferred loan receivables to any VIE in the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. Our VIEs are able to accept new loan receivables and arrange new asset-backed financings, consistent with the requirements and limitations on such activities placed on the VIE by existing investors. Once an account has been designated to a VIE, the contractual arrangements we have require all existing and future loans originated under such account to be transferred to the VIE. The amount of loan receivables held by our VIEs in excess of the minimum amount required under the asset-backed financing arrangements with investors may be removed by us under random removal of accounts provisions. All loan receivables held by a VIE are subject to claims of third-party investors.In evaluating whether we have the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance, we consider the purpose for which the VIE was created, the importance of each of the activities in which it is engaged and our decision-making role, if any, in those activities that significantly determine the entity’s economic performance as compared to other economic interest holders. This evaluation requires consideration of all facts and circumstances relevant to decision-making that affects the entity’s future performance and the exercise of professional judgment in deciding which decision-making rights are most important.In determining whether we have the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to a VIE, we evaluate all of our economic interests in the entity, regardless of form (debt, equity, management and servicing fees, and other contractual arrangements). This evaluation considers all relevant factors of the entity’s design, including: the entity’s capital structure, contractual rights to earnings or losses, subordination of our interests relative to those of other investors, as well as any other contractual arrangements that might exist that could have the potential to be economically significant. The evaluation of each of these factors in reaching a conclusion about the potential significance of our economic interests is a matter that requires the exercise of professional judgment.We consolidate our VIEs because we have the power to direct the activities that significantly affect the VIEs' economic performance, typically because of our role as either servicer or administrator for the VIEs. The power to direct exists because of our role in the design and conduct of the servicing of the VIEs’ assets as well as directing certain affairs of the VIEs, including determining whether and on what terms debt of the VIEs will be issued.44The loan receivables in these entities have risks and characteristics similar to our other financing receivables and were underwritten to the same standard. Accordingly, the performance of these assets has been similar to our other comparable loan receivables; however, the blended performance of the pools of receivables in these entities reflects the eligibility criteria that we apply to determine which receivables are selected for transfer. Contractually, the cash flows from these financing receivables must first be used to pay third-party debt holders, as well as other expenses of the entity. Excess cash flows, if any, are available to us. The creditors of these entities have no claim on our other assets.The table below summarizes the assets and liabilities of our consolidated securitization VIEs described above.($ in millions)June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015Assets   Loan receivables, net(a)$22,323 $24,338Other assets(b)126 127Total$22,449 $24,465    Liabilities   Borrowings$12,236 $13,589Other liabilities22 30Total$12,258 $13,619_______________________(a)Includes $1.1 billion of related allowance for loan losses resulting in gross restricted loans of $23.4 billion and $25.5 billion at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.(b)Includes $117 million and $118 million of segregated funds held by the VIEs at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which are classified as restricted cash and equivalents and included as a component of other assets in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.The balances presented above are net of intercompany balances and transactions that are eliminated in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We provide servicing for all of our consolidated VIEs. Collections are required to be placed into segregated accounts owned by each VIE in amounts that meet contractually specified minimum levels. These segregated funds are invested in cash and cash equivalents and are restricted as to their use, principally to pay maturing principal and interest on debt and the related servicing fees. Collections above these minimum levels are remitted to us on a daily basis. Income (principally, interest and fees on loans) earned by our consolidated VIEs was $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Related expenses consisted primarily of provision for loan losses of $275 million and $310 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and interest expense of $59 million and $53 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Income (principally, interest and fees on loans) earned by our consolidated VIEs was $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Related expenses consisted primarily of provision for loan losses of $517 million and $522 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and interest expense of $117 million and $105 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

REGULATORY AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY As a savings and loan holding company, we are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. The Bank is a federally chartered savings association. As such, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC, which is its primary regulator, and by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). In addition, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is supervised by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.Following the approval from the Federal Reserve Board to become a stand-alone savings and loan holding company, the Company is now subject to the capital requirements as prescribed by Basel III capital rules and the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and, possibly, additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could limit our business activities and have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines, we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require us and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the following table) of Total, Tier 1 and common equity Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1 capital to average assets (as defined).For Synchrony Financial to be a well-capitalized savings and loan holding company, the Bank must be well-capitalized and Synchrony Financial must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Federal Reserve Board to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. At June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Synchrony Financial met all applicable requirements to be deemed well-capitalized pursuant to Federal Reserve Board regulations, and the Bank also met all applicable requirements to be deemed well-capitalized pursuant to OCC regulations and for purposes of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. There are no conditions or events subsequent to June 30, 2016 that management believes have changed the Company's or the Bank’s capital category.The actual capital amounts, ratios and the applicable required minimums of the Company and the Bank are as follows:Synchrony FinancialAt June 30, 2016 ($ in millions)Actual Minimum for capital adequacy purposes Amount Ratio(a) Amount Ratio(b)        Total risk-based capital$13,500 19.8% $5,455 8.0%Tier 1 risk-based capital$12,610 18.5% $4,091 6.0%Tier 1 leverage$12,610 15.6% $3,223 4.0%Common equity Tier 1 Capital$12,610 18.5% $3,068 4.5%At December 31, 2015 ($ in millions)Actual Minimum for capital adequacy purposes Amount Ratio(a) Amount Ratio        Total risk-based capital$12,531 18.1% $5,538 8.0%Tier 1 risk-based capital$11,633 16.8% $4,153 6.0%Tier 1 leverage$11,633 14.4% $3,236 4.0%Common equity Tier 1 Capital$11,633 16.8% $3,115 4.5%51Synchrony BankAt June 30, 2016 ($ in millions)Actual Minimum for capital adequacy purposes Minimum to be well-capitalized under prompt corrective action provisions Amount Ratio(a) Amount Ratio(c) Amount Ratio            Total risk-based capital$9,064 17.4% $4,158 8.0% $5,197 10.0%Tier 1 risk-based capital$8,383 16.1% $3,118 6.0% $4,158 8.0%Tier 1 leverage$8,383 13.6% $2,472 4.0% $3,090 5.0%Common equity Tier I capital$8,383 16.1% $2,339 4.5% $3,378 6.5%At December 31, 2015 ($ in millions)Actual Minimum for capital adequacy purposes Minimum to be well-capitalized under prompt corrective action provisions Amount Ratio(a) Amount Ratio Amount Ratio            Total risk-based capital$8,442 16.6% $4,064 8.0% $5,080 10.0%Tier 1 risk-based capital$7,781 15.3% $3,048 6.0% $4,064 8.0%Tier 1 leverage$7,781 13.1% $2,384 4.0% $2,980 5.0%Common equity Tier I capital$7,781 15.3% $2,286 4.5% $3,302 6.5%_______________________(a)Capital ratios are calculated based on the Basel III Standardized Approach rules, subject to applicable transition provisions, at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.(b)For calendar year 2016, Synchrony Financial also must maintain a capital conservation buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital in excess of minimum risk-based capital ratios by at least 0.625 percentage points to avoid limits on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers and similar employees.(c)For calendar year 2016, Synchrony Bank also must maintain a capital conservation buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital in excess of minimum risk-based capital ratios by at least 0.625 percentage points to avoid limits on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers and similar employees.The Bank may pay dividends on its stock, with consent or non-objection from the OCC and the Federal Reserve Board, among other things, if its regulatory capital would not thereby be reduced below the applicable regulatory capital requirements. NOTE 11. EARNINGS PER SHAREBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the assumed conversion of all dilutive securities.The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share: Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30,(in millions, except per share data)2016 2015 2016 2015Net earnings$489 $541 $1,071 $1,093        Weighted average common shares outstanding, basic834 834 834 834Effect of dilutive securities2 1 2 1Weighted average common shares outstanding, dilutive836 835 836 835       Earnings per basic common share$0.59 $0.65 $1.28 $1.31Earnings per diluted common share$0.58 $0.65 $1.28 $1.3152We have issued certain stock based awards under the Synchrony Financial 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan. A total of approximately 3 million and 1 million shares related to these awards were considered anti-dilutive and therefore were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.NOTE 12. INCOME TAXESFor periods up to and including the date of Separation, we are included in the consolidated U.S. federal and state income tax returns of GE, where applicable, but also file certain separate state and foreign income tax returns. For periods after the date of Separation, we will file separate consolidated U.S. federal and state income tax returns. The tax provision is presented on a separate company basis as if we were a separate filer for tax purposes for all periods presented. The effects of tax adjustments and settlements from taxing authorities are presented in our condensed consolidated financial statements in the period in which they occur. Our current obligations for taxes are settled with GE, or the relevant tax authority, as applicable, on an estimated basis and adjusted in later periods as appropriate and are reflected in our consolidated financial statements in the periods in which those settlements occur. We recognize the current and deferred tax consequences of all transactions that have been recognized in the financial statements using the provisions of the enacted tax laws. In calculating the provision for interim income taxes, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes, we apply an estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date ordinary income. At the end of each interim period, we estimate the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year. See “Management's Discussion and Analysis—Critical Accounting Estimates” in our 2015 Form 10-K, for a discussion of the significant judgments and estimates related to income taxes.We are under continuous examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and the tax authorities of various states as part of their audit of GE’s tax returns. The IRS is currently auditing GE's consolidated U.S. income tax returns for 2010 and 2011, as well as 2012 and 2013. We are under examination in various states going back to 2008 as part of their audit of GE’s tax returns. We believe that there are no issues or claims that are likely to significantly impact our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We further believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties that could result from such examinations.Tax Sharing and Separation AgreementIn connection with our initial public offering in August 2014 (“IPO”), we entered into a Tax Sharing and Separation Agreement (“TSSA”), which governs certain separation-related tax matters between the Company and GE following the IPO. The TSSA governs the allocation of the responsibilities for the taxes of the GE group between GE and the Company. The TSSA also allocates rights, obligations and responsibilities in connection with certain administrative matters relating to the preparation of tax returns and control of tax audits and other proceedings relating to taxes. See Note 14. Income Taxes to our 2015 annual consolidated and combined financial statements in our 2015 Form 10-K for additional information on the TSSA.Unrecognized Tax Benefits($ in millions)June 30, 2016 December 31, 2015Unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest expense and penalties$185 $327Portion that, if recognized, would reduce tax expense and effective tax rate(a)85 79Accrued interest on unrecognized tax benefits7 3Accrued penalties on unrecognized tax benefits— —____________________(a)Includes gross state and local unrecognized tax benefits net of the effects of associated U.S. federal income taxes. Excludes amounts attributable to any related valuation allowances resulting from associated increases in deferred tax assets.53As a separate public company, we will continue to compute our unrecognized tax benefits on a separate return basis and we will settle our liabilities, as required, in accordance with the TSSA. We expect approximately $54 million (net of federal benefit) of unrecognized tax benefits related to temporary differences to reverse within the next twelve months. Excluding that item, the amount of uncertain tax liabilities that may be resolved in the next twelve months is not expected to be material to our results of operations. NOTE 13. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND REGULATORY MATTERSIn the normal course of business, from time to time, we have been named as a defendant in various legal proceedings, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with our business activities. Certain of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages, or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. We are also involved, from time to time, in reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental agencies regarding our business (collectively, “regulatory matters”), which could subject us to significant fines, penalties, obligations to change our business practices or other requirements resulting in increased expenses, diminished income and damage to our reputation. We contest liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we establish an accrued liability for legal and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies which are both probable and reasonably estimable.Legal proceedings and regulatory matters are subject to many uncertain factors that generally cannot be predicted with assurance, and we may be exposed to losses in excess of any amounts accrued.For some matters, we are able to determine that an estimated loss, while not probable, is reasonably possible. For other matters, including those that have not yet progressed through discovery and/or where important factual information and legal issues are unresolved, we are unable to make such an estimate. We currently estimate that the reasonably possible losses for legal proceedings and regulatory matters, whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, and for which we are able to estimate a possible loss, are immaterial. This represents management’s estimate of possible loss with respect to these matters and is based on currently available information. This estimate of possible loss does not represent our maximum loss exposure. The legal proceedings and regulatory matters underlying the estimate will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly from current estimates.Our estimate of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given the varying stages of the proceedings, the existence of numerous yet to be resolved issues, the breadth of the claims (often spanning multiple years), unspecified damages and/or the novelty of the legal issues presented. Based on our current knowledge, we do not believe that we are a party to any pending legal proceeding or regulatory matters that would have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial condition or liquidity. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters, the ultimate outcome of a particular matter could be material to our operating results for a particular period depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our earnings for that period, and could adversely affect our business and reputation.Below is a description of certain of our regulatory matters and legal proceedings.Regulatory MattersOn December 10, 2013, we entered into a Consent Order with the CFPB relating to our CareCredit platform, which required us to pay up to $34.1 million to qualifying customers and change certain business practices. Some of the business practice changes required by the Consent Order are similar to requirements in an Assurance of Discontinuance that we entered into with the Attorney General for the State of New York on June 3, 2013. The payments required by the Consent Order were completed in 2015.Our settlements with the CFPB and the New York State Attorney General do not preclude other regulators or state attorneys general from seeking additional monetary or injunctive relief with respect to CareCredit.54On June 19, 2014, we entered into a Consent Order with the CFPB (the “2014 CFPB Consent Order”) related to the CFPB’s review of the Bank’s debt cancellation products and its marketing practices in its telesales channel related to those products. The 2014 CFPB Consent Order required us to refund $56 million to cardholders who enrolled in a debt cancellation product over the telephone from January 2010 to October 2012 ($11 million of which was refunded prior to the 2014 CFPB Consent Order), pay civil money penalties of $3.5 million and change certain business practices. In 2015, we completed the consumer refunds.The 2014 CFPB Consent Order also resolved a separate CFPB investigation related to potential violations of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act as a result of the Bank’s omission of certain Spanish-speaking customers and customers residing in Puerto Rico from certain statement credit and settlement offers that were made to certain delinquent customers. The Bank identified this issue through an audit of its collection operations, reported it to the CFPB and initiated a remediation program. In 2015, we completed our consumer remediation program, which consisted of approximately $185 million of balance credits and waivers to previously charged-off accounts and approximately $15 million of other credits or payments. This remediation program included $132 million of voluntary remediation completed prior to the 2014 CFPB Consent Order. In addition to the consumer remediation, the 2014 CFPB Consent Order required us to implement a fair lending compliance plan (including fair lending reviews, audits and training).Although we do not believe that the 2014 CFPB Consent Order itself will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations going forward, we cannot be sure whether the 2014 CFPB Consent Order will have an adverse impact on our reputation or whether any similar actions will be brought by state attorneys general or others, all of which could have a material adverse effect on us.On October 30, 2014, the United States Trustee, which is part of the DOJ, filed an application in In re Nyree Belton, a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case pending in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York for orders authorizing discovery of the Bank pursuant to Rule 2004 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, related to an investigation of the Bank’s credit reporting. The discovery, which is ongoing, concerns allegations made in Belton et al. v. GE Capital Consumer Lending, a putative class action adversary proceeding pending in the same Bankruptcy Court. In the Belton adversary proceeding, which was filed on April 30, 2014, plaintiff alleges that the Bank violates the discharge injunction under Section 524(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code by attempting to collect discharged debts and by failing to update and correct credit information to credit reporting agencies to show that such debts are no longer due and owing because they have been discharged in bankruptcy. Plaintiff seeks declaratory judgment, injunctive relief and an unspecified amount of damages. On December 15, 2014, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order staying the adversary proceeding pending an appeal to the District Court of the Bankruptcy Court’s order denying the Bank’s motion to compel arbitration. On October 14, 2015, the District Court reversed the Bankruptcy Court and on November 4, 2015, the Bankruptcy Court granted the Bank's motion to compel arbitration.On October 15, 2015, the Bank received a Civil Investigative Demand from the CFPB seeking information related to the Bank’s credit bureau reporting with respect to sold accounts. The information sought by the CFPB generally relates to the allegations made in Belton et al. v. GE Capital Consumer Lending. On May 9, 2016, the Bank received a NORA (Notice of Opportunity to Respond and Advise) letter from the CFPB indicating that the CFPB Office of Enforcement is considering whether to recommend that the CFPB take legal action relating to this matter.55Other MattersThe Bank or the Company is a defendant in three putative class actions alleging claims under the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) as a result of phone calls made by the Bank. In each case, the complaints allege that the Bank or the Company placed calls to consumers by an automated telephone dialing system or using a pre-recorded message or automated voice without their consent and seek up to $1,500 for each violation. The amount of damages sought in the aggregate is unspecified. In each case, the plaintiffs assert that they received calls on their cellular telephones relating to accounts not belonging to them. Abdeljalil et al. v. GE Capital Retail Bank was filed on August 22, 2012 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. On March 26, 2015, the Court entered an order granting class certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3) (for damages) and denying class certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) (for injunctive relief). In the first quarter of 2016, the Bank entered an agreement to resolve the Abdeljalil action on a class basis. Pursuant to the agreement, a related case (Hofer et al. v. Synchrony Bank, which was filed on November 4, 2014 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri), was dismissed on February 11, 2016. On June 16, 2016, the Court entered an order preliminarily approving the settlement. Johnson et al. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and Synchrony Financial was filed on April 22, 2016 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California. The Johnson complaint also asserts a claim under the California Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Anand v. Synchrony Bank and Synchrony Financial was filed on June 22, 2016 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The Anand complaint also asserts claims under the Illinois Automatic Telephone Dialers Act and the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act. In addition to the Abdeljalil, Hofer, Johnson and Anand developments discussed above, the Bank has resolved eight other putative class actions that made similar claims under the TCPA on an individual basis with the class representative. Travaglio et al. v. GE Capital Retail Bank and Allied Interstate LLC was filed on January 17, 2014 in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida and dismissed on October 9, 2014. Fitzhenry v. Lowe’s Companies Inc. and GE Capital Retail Bank was filed on May 29, 2014 in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina and dismissed on October 20, 2014. Cowan v. GE Capital Retail Bank was filed on May 14, 2014 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut and dismissed on July 8, 2015. Pittman et al. v. GE Capital d/b/a GE Capital Retail Bank was filed on July 29, 2014 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama and dismissed on August 20, 2015. Dubanoski et al. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., for which the Bank indemnified the defendant, was filed on February 27, 2015 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and dismissed on September 1, 2015. Mintz et al v. Synchrony Bank was filed on December 28, 2015 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York and dismissed on May 11, 2016. Deutsche et al. v. Synchrony Bank et al. was filed on March 27, 2016 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey and dismissed on June 27, 2016. Ciotti et al. v. Synchrony Financial et al. was filed on April 27, 2016 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California and dismissed on June 2, 2016.In addition to the TCPA class action lawsuits related to phone calls, the Company is a defendant in a putative class action lawsuit alleging claims under the TCPA relating to facsimiles. In Michael W. Kincaid, DDS et al. v. Synchrony Financial, plaintiff alleges that the Company violated the TCPA by sending fax advertisements without consent and without required notices, and seeks up to $1,500 for each violation. The amount of damages sought in the aggregate is unspecified. The complaint was filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on January 20, 2016.NOTE 14. SUBSEQUENT EVENTSOn July 7, 2016, the Company announced that its Board of Directors (the "Board") approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per share of common stock and a share repurchase program of up to $952 million for the four quarters ending June 30, 2017. The Company expects to make share repurchases subject to market conditions and other factors, including legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals.The Board also declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per share of common stock, payable on August 25, 2016 to holders of record at the close of business on August 12, 2016.56ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMarket risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio. We are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates.We borrow money from a variety of depositors and institutions in order to provide loans to our customers. Changes in market rates cause our net interest income to increase or decrease, as certain of our assets and liabilities carry interest rates that fluctuate with market benchmarks. The interest rate benchmark for our floating rate assets is generally the prime rate, and interest rate benchmark for our floating rate liabilities is generally either LIBOR or the federal funds rate. The prime rate and the LIBOR or federal funds rate could reset at different times or could diverge, leading to mismatches in the interest rates on our floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities. Assuming an immediate 100 basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at June 30, 2016, we estimate that net interest income over the following 12-month period would increase by approximately $158 million. For a more detailed discussion of our exposure to market risk, refer to “Management's Discussion and Analysis—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in our 2015 Form 10-K.ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESUnder the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures, and our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2016. No change in internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 57PART II.
