Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Regulation—We are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock; the Bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us, which could limit our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our common stock or make payments on our indebtedness” and “Item 1A. Business—Regulation—Savings Association Regulation—Dividends and Stock Repurchases” in our 2017 Form 10-K. 28Capital____________________________________________________________________________________________Our primary sources of capital have been earnings generated by our business and existing equity capital. We seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support the risks of our business, meet regulatory requirements, adhere to rating agency targets and support future business growth. The level, composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment, strategic initiatives and legislative and regulatory developments. Within these constraints, we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that will provide attractive returns to our stockholders. Synchrony and the Bank are required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis. Under the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the U.S. Treasury's (the “OCC”) and the Federal Reserve Board's stress test regulations, the Bank and Synchrony are required to use stress-testing methodologies providing for results under various scenarios of economic and financial market stress. In addition, while as a savings and loan holding company and a financial holding company, we currently are not subject to the Federal Reserve Board's capital planning rule, we submitted a capital plan to the Federal Reserve Board in 2018.In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act was enacted, which among other things, includes changes to stress testing reporting thresholds based on an institution’s total consolidated assets. The Act will likely decrease the overall regulatory burden on savings and loan holding companies, though the ultimate impact will not be known until the regulators have finalized the law's implementation.Dividend and Share RepurchasesCash Dividends Declared Month of Payment Amount per Common Share Amount($ in millions, except per share data)      Three months ended March 31, 2018 February, 2018 $0.15 $114Three months ended June 30, 2018 May, 2018 0.15 113Three months ended September 30, 2018 August, 2018 0.21 156Total dividends declared   $0.51 $383       On May 17, 2018, the Board announced plans to increase our quarterly dividend to $0.21 per share commencing in the third quarter of 2018. The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend on many factors. For a discussion of regulatory and other restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Regulation—We are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock; the Bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us, which could limit our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our common stock or make payments on our indebtedness” in our 2017 Form 10-K.

On May 17, 2018, the Company approved a share repurchase program of up to $2.2 billion through June 30, 2019 (the "2018 Share Repurchase Program"). Through the end of the third quarter of 2018, we have repurchased approximately $1.2 billion of common stock as part of the 2018 Share Repurchase Program and expect to complete the share repurchase program by the end of the second quarter of 2019. We made, and expect to continue to make, share repurchases subject to market conditions and other factors, including legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals.Regulatory Capital Requirements - Synchrony FinancialAs a savings and loan holding company, we are required to maintain minimum capital ratios, under the applicable U.S. Basel III capital rules. For more information, see “Regulation—Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation” in our 2017 Form 10-K.For Synchrony Financial to be a well-capitalized savings and loan holding company, Synchrony Bank must be well-capitalized and Synchrony Financial must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Federal Reserve Board to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. As of September 30, 2018, Synchrony Financial met all the requirements to be deemed well-capitalized.The following table sets forth the composition of our capital ratios for the Company calculated under the Basel III regulatory capital standards at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Basel III At September 30, 2018(1) At December 31, 2017(2)($ in millions)Amount Ratio(3) Amount Ratio(3)Total risk-based capital$13,315 15.5% $13,954 17.3%Tier 1 risk-based capital$12,178 14.2% $12,890 16.0%Tier 1 leverage$12,178 12.3% $12,890 13.8%Common equity Tier 1 capital$12,178 14.2% $12,890 16.0%Risk-weighted assets$85,941   $80,669  ______________________(1)Amounts presented do not reflect certain modifications to the regulatory capital rules proposed by the federal banking agencies in September 2017, which among other things, may increase the risk weighting of certain deferred tax assets from 100% to 250% if the proposed rule becomes effective.(2)Amounts at December 31, 2017 are presented in accordance with applicable transition guidelines.(3)Tier 1 leverage ratio represents total tier 1 capital as a percentage of total average assets, after certain adjustments. All other ratios presented above represent the applicable capital measure as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. The decrease in our Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was primarily due to the increase in loan receivables as a result of the PayPal Credit acquisition and a corresponding increase in risk-weighted assets in the nine months ended September 30, 2018. Regulatory Capital Requirements - Synchrony BankAt September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Bank met all applicable requirements to be deemed well-capitalized pursuant to OCC regulations and for purposes of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The following table sets forth the composition of the Bank’s capital ratios calculated under the Basel III rules at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017. 30 At September 30, 2018 At December 31, 2017 Minimum to be Well-Capitalizedunder Prompt Corrective Action Provisions($ in millions)Amount Ratio Amount Ratio RatioTotal risk-based capital$11,588 15.7% $10,842 16.2% 10.0%Tier 1 risk-based capital$10,607 14.4% $9,958 14.9% 8.0%Tier 1 leverage$10,607 12.5% $9,958 12.9% 5.0%Common equity Tier 1 capital$10,607 14.4% $9,958 14.9% 6.5%Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could limit our business activities and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Regulation—Failure by Synchrony and the Bank to meet applicable capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on us” in our 2017 Form 10-K.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Unfunded Lending Commitments____________________________________________________________________________________________We do not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantees of third-party obligations. Guarantees are contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make a guaranteed payment or perform an obligation to a third-party based on certain trigger events. At September 30, 2018, we had not recorded any contingent liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position related to any guarantees. See Note 9 - Fair Value Measurements to our condensed consolidated financial statements for information on contingent consideration liabilities related to business acquisitions.We extend credit, primarily arising from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on our credit cards, in the ordinary course of business. See Note 4 - Loan Receivables and Allowance for Loan Losses to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on our unfunded lending commitments.Critical Accounting Estimates____________________________________________________________________________________________In preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements, we have identified certain accounting estimates and assumptions that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. The critical accounting estimates we have identified relate to allowance for loan losses, income taxes and fair value measurements. All of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates future, economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. If these conditions change from those expected, it is reasonably possible that these judgments and estimates could change, which may result in incremental losses on loan receivables and the establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increases in our tax liabilities, among other effects. See “Management's Discussion and Analysis—Critical Accounting Estimates” in our 2017 Form 10-K, for a detailed discussion of these critical accounting estimates.New Accounting Standards____________________________________________________________________________________________See Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — New Accounting Standards, for additional information related to recent accounting pronouncements.Regulation and Supervision____________________________________________________________________________________________Our business, including our relationships with our customers, is subject to regulation, supervision and examination under U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business, including lending practices, treatment of our customers, safeguarding deposits, customer privacy and information security, capital structure, liquidity, dividends and other capital distributions, transactions with affiliates, and conduct and qualifications of personnel.As a savings and loan holding company and a financial holding company, Synchrony is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. As a large provider of consumer financial services, we are also subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the CFPB. The Bank is a federally chartered savings association. As such, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC, which is its primary regulator, and by the CFPB. In addition, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is supervised by the FDIC. 31See “Regulation” in our 2017 Form 10-K for additional information. See also “—Capital” above, for discussion of the impact of regulations and supervision on our capital and liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock. 32ITEM 1.

BUSINESS DESCRIPTIONSynchrony Financial (the “Company”) provides a range of credit products through programs it has established with a diverse group of national and regional retailers, local merchants, manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations and healthcare service providers. We primarily offer private label, Dual Card and general purpose co-branded credit cards, promotional financing and installment lending, loyalty programs and FDIC-insured savings products through Synchrony Bank (the “Bank”). References to the “Company”, “we”, “us” and “our” are to Synchrony Financial and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires.NOTE 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of PresentationThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).Preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates based on assumptions about current, and for some estimates, future, economic and market conditions (for example, unemployment, housing, interest rates and market liquidity) which affect reported amounts and related disclosures in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Although our current estimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect them to change in the future, as appropriate, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could be different than anticipated in those estimates, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial position. Among other effects, such changes could result in incremental losses on loan receivables, future impairments of debt securities, goodwill and intangible assets, increases in reserves for contingencies, establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increases in our tax liabilities.We primarily conduct our operations within the United States and Canada. Substantially all of our revenues are from U.S. customers. The operating activities conducted by our non-U.S. affiliates use the local currency as their functional currency. The effects of translating the financial statements of these non-U.S. affiliates to U.S. dollars are included in equity. Asset and liability accounts are translated at period-end exchange rates, while revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the respective periods.Consolidated Basis of PresentationThe Company’s financial statements have been prepared on a consolidated basis. Under this basis of presentation, our financial statements consolidate all of our subsidiaries – i.e., entities in which we have a controlling financial interest, most often because we hold a majority voting interest.To determine if we hold a controlling financial interest in an entity, we first evaluate if we are required to apply the variable interest entity (“VIE”) model to the entity, otherwise the entity is evaluated under the voting interest model. Where we hold current or potential rights that give us the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance (“power”) combined with a variable interest that gives us the right to receive potentially significant benefits or the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses (“significant economics”), we have a controlling financial interest in that VIE. Rights held by others to remove the party with power over the VIE are not considered unless one party can exercise those rights unilaterally. We consolidate certain securitization entities under the VIE model because we have both power and significant economics. See Note 5. Variable Interest Entities.We have reclassified certain prior-period amounts to conform to current-period presentation.38Interim Period PresentationThe condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto are unaudited. These statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) that we considered necessary to present a fair statement of our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The results reported in these condensed consolidated financial statements should not be considered as necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the entire year. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our 2017 annual consolidated financial statements and the related notes in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017 (our "2017 Form 10-K"). New Accounting StandardsNewly Adopted Accounting StandardsIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The new revenue recognition guidance became effective January 1, 2018 for the Company. The scope of ASU 2014-09 excludes interest and fee income on loans and as a result, the majority of the Company's revenue is not in the scope of the standard. The new guidance did not impact the timing or measurement of the Company's revenues, and as a result, the Company did not present any restated prior period results as a result of the standard becoming effective.In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash, which requires restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents to be included within beginning and ending total cash amounts reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Disclosure of the nature of the restrictions on cash balances is required under the guidance. This standard is effective for annual and interim reporting periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. We adopted the guidance retrospectively effective as of January 1, 2018. Upon adoption, changes in restricted cash, which had previously been presented as investing activities, are now included within beginning and ending cash and equivalents, including restricted amounts, balances in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Additionally, in August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which provided guidance on certain cash flow issues. This standard is effective for annual and interim reporting periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. We adopted the guidance retrospectively effective as of January 1, 2018, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.Effective January 1, 2018, we have adopted the provisions of ASU 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which require equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. However, in accordance with the new guidance, the company has elected to measure certain equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes for similar investments of the issuer. The adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.Recently Issued But Not Yet Adopted Accounting StandardsIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The ASU requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheet. Leases which are identified as capital leases currently, will generally be identified as financing leases under the new guidance but otherwise their accounting treatment will remain relatively unchanged. Leases identified as operating leases currently, will generally remain in that category under the new standard, but both a right-of-use asset and a liability for remaining lease payments will now be required to be recognized on the balance sheet. This guidance will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2019. Management does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.39In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU replaces the existing incurred loss impairment guidance with a new impairment model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss ("CECL") model, which is based on expected credit losses. The CECL model requires, upon origination of a loan, the recognition of all expected credit losses over the life of the loan based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This standard is effective for annual and interim reporting periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for annual and interim periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We plan to adopt the standard on its effective date. The amendments in this standard will be recognized through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. While we are evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-13 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, this standard is expected to result in an increase to the Company's allowance for loan losses given the change to expected losses for the estimated life of the financial asset. The extent of the increase will depend on the asset quality of the portfolio, and economic conditions and forecasts at adoption.See Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our 2017 annual consolidated financial statements in our 2017 Form 10-K, for additional information on our significant accounting policies, including discussion of the nature of the restrictions on our cash balances.NOTE 3.

We presently do not intend to sell our debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position and believe that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of our amortized cost. There were no other-than-temporary impairments recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017.

See Note 5. Variable Interest Entities for further information on these restricted loans.(b)At September 30, 2018, loan receivables included discounts and deferred fees, net of premiums and deferred costs, of $5 million. At December 31, 2017, loan receivables included deferred costs, net of deferred fees, of $97 million.Loan Receivables AcquiredOn July 2, 2018, we completed our acquisition of the U.S. PayPal Credit financing program, comprising of $7.6 billion of outstanding loan receivables. We also extended our existing co-brand credit card program with PayPal and Synchrony Bank is now PayPal’s exclusive issuing bank for the PayPal Credit consumer financing program in the United States through 2028. This transaction was accounted for as an asset purchase and the receivables are included within Credit cards at September 30, 2018 in the table above.Our portfolio of loan receivables includes certain consumer and commercial loans acquired that were recorded atfair value at acquisition and subsequently accounted for based on cash flows expected to be collected, which arereferred to as purchase credit impaired (“PCI”).At September 30, 2018, the total recorded investment in PCI loan receivables is $107 million, for which there is no related valuation allowance. Unpaid balance of the PCI loan receivables at September 30, 2018 is $221 million.Allowance for Loan Losses ($ in millions)Balance at July 1, 2018 Provision charged to operations Gross charge-offs Recoveries Balance at September 30, 2018          Credit cards$5,757 $1,427 $(1,269) $202 $6,117Consumer installment loans51 9 (13) 4 51Commercial credit products50 15 (13) 2 54Other1 — — — 1Total$5,859 $1,451 $(1,295) $208 $6,22342($ in millions)Balance at July 1, 2017 Provision charged to operations Gross charge-offs Recoveries Balance at September 30, 2017          Credit cards$4,906 $1,287 $(1,140) $211 $5,264Consumer installment loans34 14 (12) 3 39Commercial credit products60 9 (14) 2 57Other1 — — — 1Total$5,001 $1,310 $(1,166) $216 $5,361 ($ in millions)Balance at January 1, 2018 Provision charged to operations Gross charge-offs Recoveries Balance at September 30, 2018          Credit cards$5,483 $4,016 $(4,016) $634 $6,117Consumer installment loans40 39 (40) 12 51Commercial credit products50 38 (39) 5 54Other1 — — — 1Total$5,574 $4,093 $(4,095) $651 $6,223          ($ in millions)Balance at January 1, 2017 Provision charged to operations Gross charge-offs Recoveries Balance at September 30, 2017          Credit cards$4,254 $3,866 $(3,518) $662 $5,264Consumer installment loans37 28 (37) 11 39Commercial credit products52 48 (48) 5 57Other1 — — — 1Total$4,344 $3,942 $(3,603) $678 $5,361          Delinquent and Non-accrual LoansAt September 30, 2018 ($ in millions)30-89 days delinquent 90 or more days delinquent Total past due 90 or more days delinquent and accruing Total non-accruing          Credit cards$2,129 $1,814 $3,943 $1,814 $—Consumer installment loans25 4 29 — 4Commercial credit products34 15 49 15 —Total delinquent loans$2,188 $1,833 $4,021 $1,829 $4Percentage of total loan receivables2.5% 2.1% 4.6% 2.1% —%At December 31, 2017 ($ in millions)30-89 days delinquent 90 or more days delinquent Total past due 90 or more days delinquent and accruing Total non-accruing          Credit cards$1,906 $1,849 $3,755 $1,849 $—Consumer installment loans25 5 30 — 5Commercial credit products31 15 46 15 —Total delinquent loans$1,962 $1,869 $3,831 $1,864 $5Percentage of total loan receivables2.4% 2.3% 4.7% 2.3% —%43Impaired Loans and Troubled Debt RestructuringsMost of our non-accrual loan receivables are smaller balance loans evaluated collectively, by portfolio, for impairment and therefore are outside the scope of the disclosure requirements for impaired loans. Accordingly, impaired loans represent restructured smaller balance homogeneous loans meeting the definition of a Troubled Debt Restructuring (“TDR”). We use certain loan modification programs for borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. These loan modification programs include interest rate reductions and payment deferrals in excess of three months, which were not part of the terms of the original contract. We have both internal and external loan modification programs. We use long-term modification programs for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty as a loss mitigation strategy to improve long-term collectability of the loans that are classified as TDRs. The long-term program involves changing the structure of the loan to a fixed payment loan with a maturity no longer than 60 months and reducing the interest rate on the loan. The long-term program does not normally provide for the forgiveness of unpaid principal but may allow for the reversal of certain unpaid interest or fee assessments. We also make loan modifications for customers who request financial assistance through external sources, such as consumer credit counseling agency programs. These loans typically receive a reduced interest rate but continue to be subject to the original minimum payment terms and do not normally include waiver of unpaid principal, interest or fees. The following table provides information on loans that entered a loan modification program during the periods presented: Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,($ in millions)2018 2017 2018 2017Credit cards$227 $210 $644 $557Consumer installment loans— — — —Commercial credit products1 1 3 3Total$228 $211 $647 $560Our allowance for loan losses on TDRs is generally measured based on the difference between the recorded loan receivable and the present value of the expected future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate of the loan. Interest income from loans accounted for as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. The following table provides information about loans classified as TDRs and specific reserves. We do not evaluate credit card loans for impairment on an individual basis but instead estimate an allowance for loan losses on a collective basis. As a result, there are no impaired loans for which there is no allowance.At September 30, 2018 ($ in millions)Total recordedinvestment Related allowance Net recorded investment Unpaid principal balanceCredit cards$1,149 $(510) $639 $1,034Consumer installment loans— — — —Commercial credit products4 (2) 2 4Total$1,153 $(512) $641 $1,038At December 31, 2017 ($ in millions)Total recordedinvestment Related allowance Net recorded investment Unpaid principal balanceCredit cards$1,038 $(444) $594 $925Consumer installment loans— — — —Commercial credit products5 (2) 3 5Total$1,043 $(446) $597 $93044Financial Effects of TDRsAs part of our loan modifications for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, we may provide multiple concessions to minimize our economic loss and improve long-term loan performance and collectability.

Secured loan receivables are largely comprised of consumer installment loans secured by equipment. Unsecured loan receivables are largely comprised of our open-ended consumer and commercial revolving credit card loans. As part of our credit risk management activities, on an ongoing basis, we assess overall credit quality by reviewing information related to the performance of a customer’s account with us, as well as information from credit bureaus, such as a Fair Isaac Corporation (“FICO”) or other credit scores, relating to the customer’s broader credit performance. FICO scores are generally obtained at origination of the account and are refreshed, at a minimum quarterly, but could be as often as weekly, to assist in predicting customer behavior. We categorize these credit scores into the following three credit score categories: (i) 661 or higher, which are considered the strongest credits; (ii) 601 to 660, considered moderate credit risk; and (iii) 600 or less, which are considered weaker credits. There are certain customer accounts for which a FICO score is not available where we use alternative sources to assess their credit and predict behavior. The following table provides the most recent FICO scores available for our customers at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, as a percentage of each class of loan receivable. The table below excludes 0.5%, 0.6% and 0.7% of our total loan receivables balance at each of September 30, 2018, December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively, which represents those customer accounts for which a FICO score is not available.

Unused credit card lines available to our customers totaled approximately $414 billion and $370 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. While these amounts represented the total available unused credit card lines, we have not experienced and do not anticipate that all of our customers will access their entire available line at any given point in time.46Interest Income by ProductThe following table provides additional information about our interest and fees on loans, including merchant discounts, from our loan receivables, including held for sale: Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,($ in millions)2018 2017 2018 2017Credit cards$4,538 $4,111 $12,647 $11,780Consumer installment loans41 35 114 101Commercial credit products37 36 107 104Other1 — 2 1Total$4,617 $4,182 $12,870 $11,986NOTE 5. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIESWe use VIEs to securitize loan receivables and arrange asset-backed financing in the ordinary course of business. Investors in these entities only have recourse to the assets owned by the entity and not to our general credit. We do not have implicit support arrangements with any VIE and we did not provide non-contractual support for previously transferred loan receivables to any VIE in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017. Our VIEs are able to accept new loan receivables and arrange new asset-backed financings, consistent with the requirements and limitations on such activities placed on the VIE by existing investors. Once an account has been designated to a VIE, the contractual arrangements we have require all existing and future loan receivables originated under such account to be transferred to the VIE. The amount of loan receivables held by our VIEs in excess of the minimum amount required under the asset-backed financing arrangements with investors may be removed by us under random removal of accounts provisions. All loan receivables held by a VIE are subject to claims of third-party investors.In evaluating whether we have the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance, we consider the purpose for which the VIE was created, the importance of each of the activities in which it is engaged and our decision-making role, if any, in those activities that significantly determine the entity’s economic performance as compared to other economic interest holders. This evaluation requires consideration of all facts and circumstances relevant to decision-making that affects the entity’s future performance and the exercise of professional judgment in deciding which decision-making rights are most important.In determining whether we have the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to a VIE, we evaluate all of our economic interests in the entity, regardless of form (debt, equity, management and servicing fees, and other contractual arrangements). This evaluation considers all relevant factors of the entity’s design, including: the entity’s capital structure, contractual rights to earnings or losses, subordination of our interests relative to those of other investors, as well as any other contractual arrangements that might exist that could have the potential to be economically significant. The evaluation of each of these factors in reaching a conclusion about the potential significance of our economic interests is a matter that requires the exercise of professional judgment.We consolidate VIEs where we have the power to direct the activities that significantly affect the VIEs' economic performance, typically because of our role as either servicer or administrator for the VIEs. The power to direct exists because of our role in the design and conduct of the servicing of the VIEs’ assets as well as directing certain affairs of the VIEs, including determining whether and on what terms debt of the VIEs will be issued.The loan receivables in these entities have risks and characteristics similar to our other financing receivables and were underwritten to the same standard. Accordingly, the performance of these assets has been similar to our other comparable loan receivables, and the blended performance of the pools of receivables in these entities reflects the eligibility criteria that we apply to determine which receivables are selected for transfer. Contractually, the cash flows from these financing receivables must first be used to pay third-party debt holders, as well as other expenses of the entity. Excess cash flows, if any, are available to us. The creditors of these entities have no claim on our other assets.47The table below summarizes the assets and liabilities of our consolidated securitization VIEs described above.($ in millions)September 30, 2018 December 31, 2017Assets   Loan receivables, net(a)$25,958 $24,990Other assets(b)74 62Total$26,032 $25,052    Liabilities   Borrowings$14,187 $12,497Other liabilities35 30Total$14,222 $12,527_______________________(a)Includes $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion of related allowance for loan losses resulting in gross restricted loans of $27.7 billion and $26.4 billion at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.(b)Includes $65 million and $55 million of segregated funds held by the VIEs at September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively, which are classified as restricted cash and equivalents and included as a component of other assets in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.The balances presented above are net of intercompany balances and transactions that are eliminated in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We provide servicing for all of our consolidated VIEs. Collections are required to be placed into segregated accounts owned by each VIE in amounts that meet contractually specified minimum levels. These segregated funds are invested in cash and cash equivalents and are restricted as to their use, principally to pay maturing principal and interest on debt and the related servicing fees. Collections above these minimum levels are remitted to us on a daily basis. Income (principally, interest and fees on loans) earned by our consolidated VIEs was $1.3 billion and $1.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Related expenses consisted primarily of provision for loan losses of $261 million and $303 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and interest expense of $86 million and $65 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Income (principally, interest and fees on loans) earned by our consolidated VIEs was $3.7 billion and $3.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, we recorded additions to customer-related intangible assets subject to amortization of $342 million and $175 million, respectively, primarily related to payments made to acquire and extend certain retail partner relationships. These additions had a weighted average amortizable life of 9 years and 10 years for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.Amortization expense related to retail partner contracts was $34 million and $28 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $92 million and $83 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and is included as a component of marketing and business development expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Under the acquisition agreement, the actual amount of contingent consideration to be paid to prior investors is dependent on certain future revenues of Loop Commerce over each annual period during the three-year period ending June 30, 2021. The fair value of the contingent consideration was estimated by applying the income approach based upon significant Level 3 inputs not observable in the market. The assumptions used in the analysis are inherently subjective, and thus the ultimate amount of the contingent consideration liability may differ materially from the most recent estimate. The contingent consideration obligation has been subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date following the acquisition, with changes to fair value recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. At the date of acquisition, the range of potential payments of this contingent consideration was between zero and $126 million. The higher end of this range would be payable in the event the future revenues of Loop Commerce meet the required targets for all three annual periods during the earnout term. Additionally, as part of the acquisition of Loop Commerce, the Company entered into compensation arrangements with certain employees of Loop Commerce which are also contingent on certain future revenues of Loop Commerce over each annual period during the three-year period ending June 30, 2021.Level 3 Fair Value MeasurementsOur Level 3 recurring fair value measurements primarily relate to state and municipal debt instruments, which are valued using non-binding broker quotes or other third-party sources, CRA investments which are valued using net asset values, as well as the contingent consideration obligation discussed above. For a description of our process to evaluate third-party pricing servicers, see Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2017 annual consolidated financial statements in our 2017 Form 10-K. Our state and municipal debt securities are classified as available-for-sale with changes in fair value included in accumulated other comprehensive income. The changes in our Level 3 assets and liabilities that are measured on a recurring basis for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 were not material.52Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Carried at Other than Fair Value Carrying Corresponding fair value amountAt September 30, 2018 ($ in millions)value Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3Financial Assets         Financial assets for which carrying values equal or approximate fair value:          Cash and equivalents(a)$12,068 $12,068 $12,068 $— $—Other assets(a)(b)$203 $203 $203 $— $—Financial assets carried at other than fair value:          Loan receivables, net(c)$81,298 $90,048 $— $— $90,048          Financial Liabilities          Financial liabilities carried at other than fair value:         Deposits$62,317 $62,235 $— $62,235 $—Borrowings of consolidated securitization entities$14,187 $14,081 $— $8,565 $5,516Senior unsecured notes$9,554 $9,332 $— $9,332 $—           Carrying Corresponding fair value amountAt December 31, 2017 ($ in millions)value Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3Financial Assets         Financial assets for which carrying values equal or approximate fair value:          Cash and equivalents(a)$11,602 $11,602 $11,602 $— $—Other assets(a)(b)$215 $215 $215 $— $—Financial assets carried at other than fair value:          Loan receivables, net(c)$76,373 $85,871 $— $— $85,871          Financial Liabilities          Financial liabilities carried at other than fair value:         Deposits$56,488 $56,754 $— $56,754 $—Borrowings of consolidated securitization entities$12,497 $12,475 $— $8,323 $4,152Senior unsecured notes$8,302 $8,471 $— $8,471 $—_______________________(a)For cash and equivalents and restricted cash and equivalents, carrying value approximates fair value due to the liquid nature and short maturity of these instruments.(b)This balance relates to restricted cash and equivalents, which is included in other assets.(c)Under certain retail partner program agreements, the expected sales proceeds related to the sale of their credit card portfolio may be limited to the amounts owed by our customers, which may be less than the fair value indicated above. 53NOTE 10. REGULATORY AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY As a savings and loan holding company and a financial holding company, we are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board and subject to the capital requirements as prescribed by Basel III capital rules and the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Bank is a federally chartered savings association. As such, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the U.S. Treasury (the “OCC”), which is its primary regulator, and by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). In addition, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is supervised by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and, possibly, additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could limit our business activities and have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines, we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require us and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of Total, Tier 1 and common equity Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1 capital to average assets (as defined).For Synchrony Financial to be a well-capitalized savings and loan holding company, the Bank must be well-capitalized and Synchrony Financial must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Federal Reserve Board to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, Synchrony Financial met all applicable requirements to be deemed well-capitalized pursuant to Federal Reserve Board regulations. At September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017, the Bank also met all applicable requirements to be deemed well-capitalized pursuant to OCC regulations and for purposes of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. There are no conditions or events subsequent to September 30, 2018 that management believes have changed the Company's or the Bank’s capital category.The actual capital amounts, ratios and the applicable required minimums of the Company and the Bank are as follows:Synchrony FinancialAt September 30, 2018 ($ in millions)Actual Minimum for capital adequacy purposes Amount Ratio(a) Amount Ratio(b)        Total risk-based capital$13,315 15.5% $6,875 8.0%Tier 1 risk-based capital$12,178 14.2% $5,156 6.0%Tier 1 leverage$12,178 12.3% $3,945 4.0%Common equity Tier 1 Capital$12,178 14.2% $3,867 4.5%At December 31, 2017 ($ in millions)Actual Minimum for capital adequacy purposes Amount Ratio(a) Amount Ratio(b)        Total risk-based capital$13,954 17.3% $6,454 8.0%Tier 1 risk-based capital$12,890 16.0% $4,840 6.0%Tier 1 leverage$12,890 13.8% $3,724 4.0%Common equity Tier 1 Capital$12,890 16.0% $3,630 4.5%54Synchrony BankAt September 30, 2018 ($ in millions)Actual Minimum for capital adequacy purposes Minimum to be well-capitalized under prompt corrective action provisions Amount Ratio(a) Amount Ratio(b) Amount Ratio            Total risk-based capital$11,588 15.7% $5,910 8.0% $7,387 10.0%Tier 1 risk-based capital$10,607 14.4% $4,432 6.0% $5,910 8.0%Tier 1 leverage$10,607 12.5% $3,390 4.0% $4,237 5.0%Common equity Tier I capital$10,607 14.4% $3,324 4.5% $4,802 6.5%At December 31, 2017 ($ in millions)Actual Minimum for capital adequacy purposes Minimum to be well-capitalized under prompt corrective action provisions Amount Ratio(a) Amount Ratio(b) Amount Ratio            Total risk-based capital$10,842 16.2% $5,340 8.0% $6,675 10.0%Tier 1 risk-based capital$9,958 14.9% $4,005 6.0% $5,340 8.0%Tier 1 leverage$9,958 12.9% $3,083 4.0% $3,854 5.0%Common equity Tier I capital$9,958 14.9% $3,004 4.5% $4,339 6.5%_______________________(a)Capital ratios are calculated based on the Basel III Standardized Approach rules which, at December 31, 2017, also included applicable transition provisions. (b)At September 30, 2018 and at December 31, 2017, Synchrony Financial and the Bank also must maintain a capital conservation buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital in excess of minimum risk-based capital ratios by at least 1.875 percentage points and 1.25 percentage points, respectively, to avoid limits on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers and similar employees.The Bank may pay dividends on its stock, with consent or non-objection from the OCC and the Federal Reserve Board, among other things, if its regulatory capital would not thereby be reduced below the applicable regulatory capital requirements. NOTE 11. EARNINGS PER SHAREBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the assumed conversion of all dilutive securities.The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share: Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30,(in millions, except per share data)2018 2017 2018 2017        Net earnings$671 $555 $2,007 $1,550        Weighted average common shares outstanding, basic734.9 787.3 750.2 801.3Effect of dilutive securities3.9 3.6 5.5 3.7Weighted average common shares outstanding, dilutive738.8 790.9 755.7 805.0       Earnings per basic common share$0.91 $0.70 $2.68 $1.93Earnings per diluted common share$0.91 $0.70 $2.66 $1.9355We have issued certain stock based awards under the Synchrony Financial 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan. A total of 5 million and 4 million shares for three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 3 million shares for both the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to these awards, were considered anti-dilutive and therefore were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. NOTE 12. INCOME TAXESWe file consolidated U.S. federal and state income tax returns separate and apart from GE. For periods up to and including the date of Separation, we were included in the consolidated U.S. federal and state income tax returns of GE, where applicable, but also filed certain separate state and foreign income tax returns. The tax provision is presented on a separate company basis as if we were a separate filer for tax purposes for all periods. The effects of tax adjustments and settlements from taxing authorities are presented in our condensed consolidated financial statements in the period in which they occur. Our current obligations for taxes are settled with the relevant tax authority, or GE, as applicable, on an estimated basis and adjusted in later periods as appropriate and are reflected in our consolidated financial statements in the periods in which those settlements occur. We recognize the current and deferred tax consequences of all transactions that have been recognized in the financial statements using the provisions of the enacted tax laws. In calculating the provision for interim period income taxes, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes, we estimate the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year and apply that estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date ordinary income. Adjustments to tax expense are made for year-to-date discrete items. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2018 decreased to 24.9%, compared to 36.9% in the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% included in the Tax Act. See “Management's Discussion and Analysis—Critical Accounting Estimates” in our 2017 Form 10-K, for a discussion of the significant judgments and estimates related to income taxes.For periods prior to Separation, we are under continuous examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and the tax authorities of various states as part of their audit of GE’s tax returns. The IRS is currently auditing GE's consolidated U.S. income tax returns for 2012 to 2015. We are under examination in various states going back to 2011 as part of their audit of GE’s tax returns. We believe that there are no issues or claims that are likely to significantly impact our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We further believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties that could result from such examinations.Unrecognized Tax Benefits($ in millions)September 30, 2018 December 31, 2017Unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest expense and penalties(a)$258 $255Portion that, if recognized, would reduce tax expense and effective tax rate(b)$179 $173____________________(a)Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were not material for all periods presented.(b)Includes gross state and local unrecognized tax benefits net of the effects of associated U.S. federal income taxes. Excludes amounts attributable to any related valuation allowances resulting from associated increases in deferred tax assets.We compute our unrecognized tax benefits on a separate return basis. For unrecognized tax benefits associated with periods prior to 2014, we will settle our liabilities, as required, in accordance with the Tax Sharing and Separation Agreement with GE, which we entered into in connection with our initial public offering in 2014. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that is reasonably possible to be resolved in the next twelve months is expected to be $76 million, of which $29 million, if recognized, would reduce the Company's tax expense and effective tax rate. 56NOTE 13. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND REGULATORY MATTERSIn the normal course of business, from time to time, we have been named as a defendant in various legal proceedings, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with our business activities. Certain of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages, or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. We are also involved, from time to time, in reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental agencies regarding our business (collectively, “regulatory matters”), which could subject us to significant fines, penalties, obligations to change our business practices or other requirements resulting in increased expenses, diminished income and damage to our reputation. We contest liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we establish an accrued liability for legal and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies which are both probable and reasonably estimable.Legal proceedings and regulatory matters are subject to many uncertain factors that generally cannot be predicted with assurance, and we may be exposed to losses in excess of any amounts accrued.For some matters, we are able to determine that an estimated loss, while not probable, is reasonably possible. For other matters, including those that have not yet progressed through discovery and/or where important factual information and legal issues are unresolved, we are unable to make such an estimate. We currently estimate that the reasonably possible losses for legal proceedings and regulatory matters, whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, and for which we are able to estimate a possible loss, are immaterial. This represents management’s estimate of possible loss with respect to these matters and is based on currently available information. This estimate of possible loss does not represent our maximum loss exposure. The legal proceedings and regulatory matters underlying the estimate will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly from current estimates.Our estimate of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given the varying stages of the proceedings, the existence of numerous yet to be resolved issues, the breadth of the claims (often spanning multiple years), unspecified damages and/or the novelty of the legal issues presented. Based on our current knowledge, we do not believe that we are a party to any pending legal proceeding or regulatory matters that would have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial condition or liquidity. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters, the ultimate outcome of a particular matter could be material to our operating results for a particular period depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our earnings for that period, and could adversely affect our business and reputation.Below is a description of certain of our regulatory matters and legal proceedings.Regulatory MattersOn October 30, 2014, the United States Trustee, which is part of the Department of Justice, filed an application in In re Nyree Belton, a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case pending in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York for orders authorizing discovery of the Bank pursuant to Rule 2004 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, related to an investigation of the Bank’s credit reporting. The discovery, which is ongoing, concerns allegations made in Belton et al. v. GE Capital Consumer Lending, a putative class action adversary proceeding pending in the same Bankruptcy Court. In the Belton adversary proceeding, which was filed on April 30, 2014, plaintiff alleges that the Bank violates the discharge injunction under Section 524(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code by attempting to collect discharged debts and by failing to update and correct credit information to credit reporting agencies to show that such debts are no longer due and owing because they have been discharged in bankruptcy. Plaintiff seeks declaratory judgment, injunctive relief and an unspecified amount of damages. On December 15, 2014, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order staying the adversary proceeding pending an appeal to the District Court of the Bankruptcy Court’s order denying the Bank’s motion to compel arbitration. On October 14, 2015, the District Court reversed the Bankruptcy Court and on November 4, 2015, the Bankruptcy Court granted the Bank's motion to compel arbitration.On May 9, 2017, the Bank received a Civil Investigative Demand from the CFPB seeking information related to the marketing and servicing of deferred interest promotions.57Other MattersThe Bank or the Company is, or has been, defending a number of putative class actions alleging claims under the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) as a result of phone calls made by the Bank. The complaints generally have alleged that the Bank or the Company placed calls to consumers by an automated telephone dialing system or using a pre-recorded message or automated voice without their consent and seek up to $1,500 for each violation, without specifying an aggregate amount. Campbell et al. v. Synchrony Bank was filed on January 25, 2017 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York. The original complaint named only J.C. Penney Company, Inc. and J.C. Penney Corporation, Inc. as the defendants but was amended on April 7, 2017 to replace those defendants with the Bank. Neal et al. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and Synchrony Bank, for which the Bank is indemnifying Wal-Mart, was filed on January 17, 2017 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina. The original complaint named only Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. as a defendant but was amended on March 30, 2017 to add Synchrony Bank as an additional defendant. Mott et al. v. Synchrony Bank was filed on February 2, 2018 in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida.58ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMarket risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio. We are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates.We borrow money from a variety of depositors and institutions in order to provide loans to our customers. Changes in market interest rates cause our net interest income to increase or decrease, as some of our assets and liabilities carry interest rates that fluctuate with market benchmarks. The interest rate benchmark for our floating rate assets is generally the prime rate, and the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate liabilities is generally either LIBOR or the federal funds rate. The prime rate and the LIBOR or federal funds rate could reset at different times or could diverge, leading to mismatches in the interest rates on our floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities. As of September 30, 2018, assuming an immediate 100 basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities, we estimate that net interest income over the following 12-month period would increase by approximately $67 million. This estimate projects net interest income over the following 12-month period and takes into consideration future growth and balance sheet composition. For a more detailed discussion of our exposure to market risk, refer to “Management's Discussion and Analysis—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in our 2017 Form 10-K.ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESUnder the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures, and our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2018. No change in internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2018 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 59PART II.
