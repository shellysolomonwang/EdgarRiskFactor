Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Regulation—We are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock; the Bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us, which could limit our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our common stock or make payments on our indebtedness” and “Regulation—Savings Association Regulation—Dividends and Stock Repurchases” in our 2016 Form 10-K. Capital____________________________________________________________________________________________Our primary sources of capital have been earnings generated by our business and existing equity capital. We seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support the risks of our business, meet regulatory requirements, adhere to rating agency targets and support future business growth. The level, composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment, strategic initiatives and legislative and regulatory developments. Within these constraints, we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that will provide attractive returns to our stockholders. Our capital adequacy assessment also includes tax and accounting considerations in accordance with regulatory guidance. We maintain a net deferred tax asset on our balance sheet, and we include this asset when calculating our regulatory capital levels. However, for regulatory capital purposes, deferred tax assets are limited to (i) the amount of taxes previously paid that a company could recover through loss carrybacks; and (ii) 10% of the amount of our Tier 1 capital. At June 30, 2017, no portion of our deferred tax asset was disallowed for regulatory capital purposes. Synchrony and the Bank are required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis. Under the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the U.S. Treasury's (the “OCC”) and the Federal Reserve Board's stress test regulations, the Bank and Synchrony are required to use stress-testing methodologies providing for results under various scenarios of economic and financial market stress. In addition, while as a savings and loan holding company we currently are not subject to the Federal Reserve Board's capital planning rule, we submitted a capital plan to the Federal Reserve Board in April 2017.Dividend and Share RepurchasesCash Dividends Declared Month of Payment Amount per Common Share Amount($ in millions, except per share data)      Three months ended March 31, 2017 February 2017 $0.13 $105Three months ended June 30, 2017 May 2017 $0.13 105Total dividends declared   $0.26 $210       On May 18, 2017, the Board announced plans to increase the quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share commencing in the third quarter of 2017. The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend on many factors, including the financial condition, earnings, capital and liquidity requirements of us and the Bank, regulatory restrictions, corporate law and contractual restrictions and other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant. In addition, banking laws and regulations and our banking regulators may limit our ability to pay dividends and make repurchases of our stock. For a discussion of regulatory restrictions on our and the Bank’s ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Regulation—Synchrony is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends and repurchase its common stock; the Bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to Synchrony, which could limit Synchrony's ability to pay dividends, repurchase its common stock or make payments on its indebtedness” in our 2016 Form 10-K. 29Shares Repurchased Under Publicly Announced Programs Total Number of Shares Purchased Dollar Value of Share Purchased     ($ and shares in millions)    Three months ended March 31, 2017 6.6 $238Three months ended June 30, 2017 15.7 438Total  22.3 $676     In May 2017 we completed our initial share repurchase program of up to $952 million (the "2016 Share Repurchase Program"). On May 18, 2017, the Company approved a share repurchase program of up to $1.64 billion through June 30, 2018 (the "2017 Share Repurchase Program"). We made and expect to continue to make share repurchases subject to market conditions and other factors, including legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals.Regulatory Capital Requirements - Synchrony FinancialAs a savings and loan holding company, we are required to maintain minimum capital ratios, under the applicable U.S. Basel III capital rules. For more information, see “Regulation—Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation” in our 2016 Form 10-K.For Synchrony Financial to be a well-capitalized savings and loan holding company, Synchrony Bank must be well-capitalized and Synchrony Financial must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Federal Reserve Board to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. As of June 30, 2017, Synchrony Financial met all the requirements to be deemed well-capitalized.The following table sets forth at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 the composition of our capital ratios for the Company calculated under the Basel III regulatory capital standards, respectively. Basel III Transition(unless otherwise stated) At June 30, 2017 At December 31, 2016($ in millions)Amount Ratio(1) Amount Ratio(1)Total risk-based capital$14,022 18.7% $14,129 18.5%Tier 1 risk-based capital$13,037 17.4% $13,135 17.2%Tier 1 leverage$13,037 14.8% $13,135 15.0%Common equity Tier 1 capital$13,037 17.4% $13,135 17.2%Common equity Tier 1 capital - fully phased-in (estimated)$12,891 17.2% $12,872 17.0%______________________(1)Tier 1 leverage ratio represents total tier 1 capital as a percentage of total average assets, after certain adjustments. All other ratios presented above represent the applicable capital measure as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. The increase in our Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was primarily due to the decrease in risk-weighted assets in the six months ended June 30, 2017. The decrease in risk-weighted assets was primarily due to the seasonal decrease in our loan receivables.Non-GAAP MeasuresThe capital ratios presented above include Common equity Tier 1 capital ("CET1") as calculated under the U.S. Basel III capital rules on a fully phased-in basis, which is not currently required by our regulators to be disclosed and, as such, is considered to be a non-GAAP measure. We believe that this capital ratio is a useful measure to investors because it is widely used by analysts and regulators to assess the capital position of financial services companies, although this ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of the components of our CET1 capital ratio as calculated on a fully phased-in basis set forth above, to the comparable GAAP components at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.30($ in millions)At June 30, 2017 At December 31, 2016Basel III - Common equity Tier 1 (transition)$13,037 $13,135Adjustments related to capital components during transition(1)(146) (263)    Basel III - Common equity Tier 1 (fully phased-in)$12,891 $12,872    Risk-weighted assets - Basel III (transition)$74,792 $76,179Adjustments related to risk weighted assets during transition(2)(44) (238)    Risk-weighted assets - Basel III (fully phased-in)$74,748 $75,941    ______________________ (1)Adjustments related to capital components to determine CET1 (fully phased-in) include the phase-in of the intangible asset exclusion.(2)Key differences between Basel III transition rules and fully phased-in Basel III rules relate to the calculation of risk-weighted assets including, but not limited to, adjustments for certain intangible assets and risk weighting of deferred tax assets.Regulatory Capital Requirements - Synchrony BankAt June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Bank met all applicable requirements to be deemed well-capitalized pursuant to OCC regulations and for purposes of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The following table sets forth the composition of the Bank’s capital ratios calculated under the Basel III rules at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.  At June 30, 2017 At December 31, 2016 Minimum to be Well-Capitalized under Prompt Corrective Action Provisions - Basel III($ in millions)Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount RatioTotal risk-based capital$10,193 16.8% $10,101 16.7% $6,067 10.0%Tier 1 risk-based capital$9,391 15.5% $9,312 15.4% $4,853 8.0%Tier 1 leverage$9,391 13.1% $9,312 13.2% $3,581 5.0%Common equity Tier 1 capital$9,391 15.5% $9,312 15.4% $3,943 6.5%Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could limit our business activities and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Regulation—Failure by Synchrony and the Bank to meet applicable capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on us” in our 2016 Form 10-K.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Unfunded Lending Commitments____________________________________________________________________________________________We do not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantees of third-party obligations. Guarantees are contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make a guaranteed payment or perform an obligation to a third-party based on certain trigger events. At June 30, 2017, we had not recorded any contingent liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Position related to any guarantees.We extend credit, primarily arising from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on our credit cards, in the ordinary course of business. See Note 4 - Loan Receivables and Allowance for Loan Losses to our condensed consolidated financial statements for more information on our unfunded lending commitments.31Critical Accounting Estimates____________________________________________________________________________________________In preparing our condensed consolidated financial statements, we have identified certain accounting estimates and assumptions that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. The critical accounting estimates we have identified relate to allowance for loan losses, asset impairment, income taxes and fair value measurements. All of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates future, economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. If these conditions change from those expected, it is reasonably possible that these judgments and estimates could change, which may result in incremental losses on loan receivables, future impairments of investment securities, goodwill and intangible assets, and the establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increases in our tax liabilities, among other effects. See “Management's Discussion and Analysis—Critical Accounting Estimates” in our 2016 Form 10-K, for a detailed discussion of these critical accounting estimates.New Accounting Standards____________________________________________________________________________________________In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of this standard, with a revised effective date for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The scope of ASU 2014-09 excludes interest and fee income on loans and gains and losses on investment securities, derivatives and the sales of financial instruments, and as a result, the majority of the Company's revenue will not be affected by the ASU. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or modified retrospective (cumulative effect) transition method. We do not expect the guidance to have a material impact on the timing or measurement of the Company’s revenues.In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU replaces the existing incurred loss impairment guidance with a new impairment model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss ("CECL") model, which is based on expected credit losses. The CECL model requires, upon origination of a loan, the recognition of all expected credit losses over the life of the loan based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This standard is effective for annual and interim reporting periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for annual and interim periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The amendments in this standard will be recognized through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. While we are evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-13 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, this standard is expected to result in an increase to the Company’s allowance for loan losses given the change to expected losses for the estimated life of the financial asset. The extent of the increase will depend on the asset quality of the portfolio, and economic conditions and forecasts at adoption.Regulation and Supervision____________________________________________________________________________________________Our business, including our relationships with our customers, is subject to regulation, supervision and examination under U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business, including lending practices, treatment of our customers, safeguarding deposits, customer privacy and information security, capital structure, liquidity, dividends and other capital distributions, transactions with affiliates, and conduct and qualifications of personnel.As a savings and loan holding company and, as of June 2017, a financial holding company, Synchrony is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. As a large provider of consumer financial services, we are also subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the CFPB. The Bank is a federally chartered savings association. As such, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC, which is its primary regulator, and by the CFPB. In addition, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is supervised by the FDIC. 32See “Regulation” in our 2016 Form 10-K for additional information. See also “—Capital” above, for discussion of the impact of regulations and supervision on our capital and liquidity, including our ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock. 33ITEM 1.

BUSINESS DESCRIPTIONSynchrony Financial (the “Company”) provides a range of credit products through programs it has established with a diverse group of national and regional retailers, local merchants, manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations and healthcare service providers. We primarily offer private label, Dual Card and general purpose co-branded credit cards, promotional financing and installment lending, loyalty programs and FDIC-insured savings products through Synchrony Bank (the “Bank”). References to the “Company”, “we”, “us” and “our” are to Synchrony Financial and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires.In November 2015, Synchrony Financial became a stand-alone savings and loan holding company following the completion of General Electric Company’s (“GE”) exchange offer, in which GE exchanged shares of GE common stock for all of the remaining shares of our common stock it owned (the “Separation”).NOTE 2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of PresentationThe accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).Preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates based on assumptions about current, and for some estimates, future, economic and market conditions (for example, unemployment, housing, interest rates and market liquidity) which affect reported amounts and related disclosures in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Although our current estimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect them to change in the future, as appropriate, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could be different than anticipated in those estimates, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial position. Among other effects, such changes could result in incremental losses on loan receivables, future impairments of investment securities, goodwill and intangible assets, increases in reserves for contingencies, establishment of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and increases in our tax liabilities.We primarily conduct our operations within the United States and Canada. Substantially all of our revenues are from U.S. customers. The operating activities conducted by our non-U.S. affiliates use the local currency as their functional currency. The effects of translating the financial statements of these non-U.S. affiliates to U.S. dollars are included in equity. Asset and liability accounts are translated at period-end exchange rates, while revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the respective periods.Consolidated Basis of PresentationThe Company’s financial statements have been prepared on a consolidated basis. Under this basis of presentation, our financial statements consolidate all of our subsidiaries – i.e., entities in which we have a controlling financial interest, most often because we hold a majority voting interest.39To determine if we hold a controlling financial interest in an entity, we first evaluate if we are required to apply the variable interest entity (“VIE”) model to the entity, otherwise the entity is evaluated under the voting interest model. Where we hold current or potential rights that give us the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance (“power”) combined with a variable interest that gives us the right to receive potentially significant benefits or the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses (“significant economics”), we have a controlling financial interest in that VIE. Rights held by others to remove the party with power over the VIE are not considered unless one party can exercise those rights unilaterally. We consolidate certain securitization entities under the VIE model because we have both power and significant economics. See Note 5. Variable Interest Entities.Interim Period PresentationThe condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto are unaudited. These statements include all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) that we considered necessary to present a fair statement of our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The results reported in these condensed consolidated financial statements should not be considered as necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the entire year. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our 2016 annual consolidated and combined financial statements and the related notes in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 (our "2016 Form 10-K"). Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of this standard, with a revised effective date for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The scope of ASU 2014-09 excludes interest and fee income on loans and gains and losses on investment securities, derivatives and the sales of financial instruments, and as a result, the majority of our revenue will not be affected by the ASU. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or modified retrospective (cumulative effect) transition method. We do not expect the guidance to have a material impact on the timing or measurement of the Company’s revenues.In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU replaces the existing incurred loss impairment guidance with a new impairment model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss ("CECL") model, which is based on expected credit losses. The CECL model requires, upon origination of a loan, the recognition of all expected credit losses over the life of the loan based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This standard is effective for annual and interim reporting periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for annual and interim periods for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The amendments in this standard will be recognized through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. While we are evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-13 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, this standard is expected to result in an increase to our allowance for loan losses given the change to expected losses for the estimated life of the financial asset. The extent of the increase will depend on the asset quality of the portfolio, and economic conditions and forecasts at adoption.See Note 2.

We presently do not intend to sell our debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position and believe that it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of our amortized cost. There were no other-than-temporary impairments recognized for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. 41Contractual Maturities of Investments in Available-for-Sale Debt Securities (excluding residential mortgage-backed securities) Amortized Estimated At June 30, 2017 ($ in millions)cost fair value    Due    Within one year$2,302 $2,300After one year through five years$274 $276After five years through ten years$3 $2After ten years$42 $42We expect actual maturities to differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to prepay certain obligations.There were no material realized gains or losses recognized for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016.Although we generally do not have the intent to sell any specific securities held at June 30, 2017, in the ordinary course of managing our investment securities portfolio, we may sell securities prior to their maturities for a variety of reasons, including diversification, credit quality, yield, liquidity requirements and funding obligations.

Accordingly, impaired loans represent restructured smaller balance homogeneous loans meeting the definition of a Troubled Debt Restructuring (“TDR”). We use certain loan modification programs for borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. These loan modification programs include interest rate reductions and payment deferrals in excess of three months, which were not part of the terms of the original contract. We have both internal and external loan modification programs. We primarily use long-term (12 to 60 months) modification programs for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty as a loss mitigation strategy to improve long-term collectability of the loans that are classified as TDRs. The long-term program involves changing the structure of the loan to a fixed payment loan with a maturity no longer than 60 months and reducing the interest rate on the loan. The long-term program does not normally provide for the forgiveness of unpaid principal but may allow for the reversal of certain unpaid interest or fee assessments. We also make loan modifications for customers who request financial assistance through external sources, such as consumer credit counseling agency programs. These loans typically receive a reduced interest rate but continue to be subject to the original minimum payment terms and do not normally include waiver of unpaid principal, interest or fees. The following table provides information on loans that entered a loan modification program during the periods presented: Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30,($ in millions)2017 2016 2017 2016Credit cards$175 $119 $347 $251Consumer installment loans— — — —Commercial credit products1 — 2 1Total$176 $119 $349 $252Our allowance for loan losses on TDRs is generally measured based on the difference between the recorded loan receivable and the present value of the expected future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate of the loan. Interest income from loans accounted for as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. The following table provides information about loans classified as TDRs and specific reserves. We do not evaluate credit card loans for impairment on an individual basis but instead estimate an allowance for loan losses on a collective basis. As a result, there are no impaired loans for which there is no allowance.At June 30, 2017 ($ in millions)Total recordedinvestment Related allowance Net recorded investment Unpaid principal balanceCredit cards$927 $(355) $572 $823Consumer installment loans— — — —Commercial credit products5 (2) 3 5Total$932 $(357) $575 $828At December 31, 2016 ($ in millions)Total recordedinvestment Related allowance Net recorded investment Unpaid principal balanceCredit cards$862 $(321) $541 $761Consumer installment loans— — — —Commercial credit products6 (3) 3 5Total$868 $(324) $544 $76644Financial Effects of TDRsAs part of our loan modifications for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, we may provide multiple concessions to minimize our economic loss and improve long-term loan performance and collectability.

Secured loan receivables are largely comprised of consumer installment loans secured by equipment. Unsecured loan receivables are largely comprised of our open-ended consumer and commercial revolving credit card loans. As part of our credit risk management activities, on an ongoing basis, we assess overall credit quality by reviewing information related to the performance of a customer’s account with us, as well as information from credit bureaus, such as a Fair Isaac Corporation (“FICO”) or other credit scores, relating to the customer’s broader credit performance. FICO scores are generally obtained at origination of the account and are refreshed, at a minimum quarterly, but could be as often as weekly, to assist in predicting customer behavior. We categorize these credit scores into the following three credit score categories: (i) 661 or higher, which are considered the strongest credits; (ii) 601 to 660, considered moderate credit risk; and (iii) 600 or less, which are considered weaker credits. There are certain customer accounts for which a FICO score is not available where we use alternative sources to assess their credit and predict behavior. The following table provides the most recent FICO scores available for our customers at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, as a percentage of each class of loan receivable. The table below excludes 0.7%, 0.7% and 0.9% of our total loan receivables balance at June 30, 2017, December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively, which represents those customer accounts for which a FICO score is not available.

Unused credit card lines available to our customers totaled approximately $360 billion and $348 billion at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. While these amounts represented the total available unused credit card lines, we have not experienced and do not anticipate that all of our customers will access their entire available line at any given point in time.Interest Income by ProductThe following table provides additional information about our interest and fees on loans from our loan receivables, including held for sale: Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30,($ in millions)2017 2016 2017 2016Credit cards$3,858 $3,432 $7,669 $6,868Consumer installment loans34 28 66 55Commercial credit products34 33 68 68Other1 1 1 1Total$3,927 $3,494 $7,804 $6,992NOTE 5. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIESWe use VIEs to securitize loans and arrange asset-backed financing in the ordinary course of business. Investors in these entities only have recourse to the assets owned by the entity and not to our general credit. We do not have implicit support arrangements with any VIE and we did not provide non-contractual support for previously transferred loan receivables to any VIE in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. Our VIEs are able to accept new loan receivables and arrange new asset-backed financings, consistent with the requirements and limitations on such activities placed on the VIE by existing investors. Once an account has been designated to a VIE, the contractual arrangements we have require all existing and future loans originated under such account to be transferred to the VIE. The amount of loan receivables held by our VIEs in excess of the minimum amount required under the asset-backed financing arrangements with investors may be removed by us under random removal of accounts provisions. All loan receivables held by a VIE are subject to claims of third-party investors.In evaluating whether we have the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance, we consider the purpose for which the VIE was created, the importance of each of the activities in which it is engaged and our decision-making role, if any, in those activities that significantly determine the entity’s economic performance as compared to other economic interest holders. This evaluation requires consideration of all facts and circumstances relevant to decision-making that affects the entity’s future performance and the exercise of professional judgment in deciding which decision-making rights are most important.In determining whether we have the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to a VIE, we evaluate all of our economic interests in the entity, regardless of form (debt, equity, management and servicing fees, and other contractual arrangements). This evaluation considers all relevant factors of the entity’s design, including: the entity’s capital structure, contractual rights to earnings or losses, subordination of our interests relative to those of other investors, as well as any other contractual arrangements that might exist that could have the potential to be economically significant. The evaluation of each of these factors in reaching a conclusion about the potential significance of our economic interests is a matter that requires the exercise of professional judgment.We consolidate VIEs where we have the power to direct the activities that significantly affect the VIEs' economic performance, typically because of our role as either servicer or administrator for the VIEs. The power to direct exists because of our role in the design and conduct of the servicing of the VIEs’ assets as well as directing certain affairs of the VIEs, including determining whether and on what terms debt of the VIEs will be issued.The loan receivables in these entities have risks and characteristics similar to our other financing receivables and were underwritten to the same standard. Accordingly, the performance of these assets has been similar to our other comparable loan receivables, and the blended performance of the pools of receivables in these entities reflects the eligibility criteria that we apply to determine which receivables are selected for transfer. Contractually, the cash flows from these financing receivables must first be used to pay third-party debt holders, as well as other expenses of the entity. Excess cash flows, if any, are available to us. The creditors of these entities have no claim on our other assets.46The table below summarizes the assets and liabilities of our consolidated securitization VIEs described above.($ in millions)June 30, 2017 December 31, 2016Assets   Loan receivables, net(a)$21,707 $22,892Other assets(b)670 107Total$22,377 $22,999    Liabilities   Borrowings$12,204 $12,388Other liabilities19 21Total$12,223 $12,409_______________________(a)Includes $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion of related allowance for loan losses resulting in gross restricted loans of $22.9 billion and $24.0 billion at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.(b)Includes $665 million and $100 million of segregated funds held by the VIEs at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, which are classified as restricted cash and equivalents and included as a component of other assets in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.The balances presented above are net of intercompany balances and transactions that are eliminated in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We provide servicing for all of our consolidated VIEs. Collections are required to be placed into segregated accounts owned by each VIE in amounts that meet contractually specified minimum levels. These segregated funds are invested in cash and cash equivalents and are restricted as to their use, principally to pay maturing principal and interest on debt and the related servicing fees. Collections above these minimum levels are remitted to us on a daily basis. Income (principally, interest and fees on loans) earned by our consolidated VIEs was $1.1 billion for both the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. Related expenses consisted primarily of provision for loan losses of $303 million and $275 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and interest expense of $63 million and $59 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Income (principally, interest and fees on loans) earned by our consolidated VIEs was $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Related expenses consisted primarily of provision for loan losses of $601 million and $517 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and interest expense of $128 million and $117 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.NOTE 6.

During the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, we recorded additions to customer-related intangible assets subject to amortization of $150 million and $25 million, respectively, primarily related to payments made to acquire and extend certain retail partner relationships. These additions had a weighted average amortizable life of 11 years and 9 years for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Amortization expense related to retail partner contracts was $28 million and $25 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $55 million and $50 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively and is included as a component of marketing and business development expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Our state and municipal debt securities are classified as available-for-sale with changes in fair value included in accumulated other comprehensive income.50The following table presents the changes in our Level 3 debt instruments that are measured on a recurring basis for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016.Changes in Level 3 Instruments Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30,($ in millions)2017 2016 2017 2016        Balance at beginning of period$43 $48 $46 $49Net realized/unrealized gains (losses)— 1 — 2Purchases1 — 1 —Settlements— — (3) (2)Balance at end of period$44 $49 $44 $49Non-Recurring Fair Value MeasurementsWe hold certain assets that have been measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis at June 30, 2017 and 2016. These assets can include repossessed assets and cost method investments that are written down to fair value when they are impaired, as well as loan receivables held for sale. Assets that are written down to fair value when impaired are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs. The assets held by us that were measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and the effects of the remeasurement to fair value were not material for all periods presented.51Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Carried at Other than Fair Value Carrying Corresponding fair value amountAt June 30, 2017 ($ in millions)value Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3Financial Assets         Financial assets for which carrying values equal or approximate fair value:          Cash and equivalents(a)$12,020 $12,020 $12,020 $— $—Other assets(b)$867 $867 $867 $— $—Financial assets carried at other than fair value:          Loan receivables, net(c)$70,457 $78,695 $— $— $78,695          Financial Liabilities          Financial liabilities carried at other than fair value:         Deposits$52,885 $53,333 $— $53,333 $—Borrowings of consolidated securitization entities$12,204 $12,225 $— $9,322 $2,903Senior unsecured notes$8,505 $8,641 $— $8,641 $—           Carrying Corresponding fair value amountAt December 31, 2016 ($ in millions)value Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3Financial Assets         Financial assets for which carrying values equal or approximate fair value:          Cash and equivalents(a)$9,321 $9,321 $9,321 $— $—Other assets(b)$347 $347 $347 $— $—Financial assets carried at other than fair value:          Loan receivables, net(c)$71,993 $79,566 $— $— $79,566          Financial Liabilities          Financial liabilities carried at other than fair value:         Deposits$52,055 $52,507 $— $52,507 $—Borrowings of consolidated securitization entities$12,388 $12,402 $— $9,191 $3,211Senior unsecured notes$7,759 $7,875 $— $7,875 $—_______________________(a)For cash and equivalents, carrying value approximates fair value due to the liquid nature and short maturity of these instruments. (b)This balance relates to restricted cash and equivalents, which is included in other assets.(c)Under certain retail partner program agreements, the expected sales proceeds related to the sale of their credit card portfolio may be limited to the amounts owed by our customers, which may be less than the fair value indicated above. 52NOTE 10. REGULATORY AND CAPITAL ADEQUACY As a savings and loan holding company and, as of June 2017, a financial holding company, we are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board and subject to the capital requirements as prescribed by Basel III capital rules and the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Bank is a federally chartered savings association. As such, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the U.S. Treasury (the “OCC”), which is its primary regulator, and by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”). In addition, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is supervised by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and, possibly, additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could limit our business activities and have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines, we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require us and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of Total, Tier 1 and common equity Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), and of Tier 1 capital to average assets (as defined).For Synchrony Financial to be a well-capitalized savings and loan holding company, the Bank must be well-capitalized and Synchrony Financial must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Federal Reserve Board to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. At June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, Synchrony Financial met all applicable requirements to be deemed well-capitalized pursuant to Federal Reserve Board regulations. At June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the Bank also met all applicable requirements to be deemed well-capitalized pursuant to OCC regulations and for purposes of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. There are no conditions or events subsequent to June 30, 2017 that management believes have changed the Company's or the Bank’s capital category.The actual capital amounts, ratios and the applicable required minimums of the Company and the Bank are as follows:Synchrony FinancialAt June 30, 2017 ($ in millions)Actual Minimum for capital adequacy purposes Amount Ratio(a) Amount Ratio        Total risk-based capital$14,022 18.7% $5,983 8.0%Tier 1 risk-based capital$13,037 17.4% $4,488 6.0%Tier 1 leverage$13,037 14.8% $3,523 4.0%Common equity Tier 1 Capital$13,037 17.4% $3,366 4.5%At December 31, 2016 ($ in millions)Actual Minimum for capital adequacy purposes Amount Ratio(a) Amount Ratio        Total risk-based capital$14,129 18.5% $6,094 8.0%Tier 1 risk-based capital$13,135 17.2% $4,571 6.0%Tier 1 leverage$13,135 15.0% $3,508 4.0%Common equity Tier 1 Capital$13,135 17.2% $3,428 4.5%53Synchrony BankAt June 30, 2017 ($ in millions)Actual Minimum for capital adequacy purposes Minimum to be well-capitalized under prompt corrective action provisions Amount Ratio(a) Amount Ratio(b) Amount Ratio            Total risk-based capital$10,193 16.8% $4,853 8.0% $6,067 10.0%Tier 1 risk-based capital$9,391 15.5% $3,640 6.0% $4,853 8.0%Tier 1 leverage$9,391 13.1% $2,864 4.0% $3,581 5.0%Common equity Tier I capital$9,391 15.5% $2,730 4.5% $3,943 6.5%At December 31, 2016 ($ in millions)Actual Minimum for capital adequacy purposes Minimum to be well-capitalized under prompt corrective action provisions Amount Ratio(a) Amount Ratio(b) Amount Ratio            Total risk-based capital$10,101 16.7% $4,825 8.0% $6,031 10.0%Tier 1 risk-based capital$9,312 15.4% $3,619 6.0% $4,825 8.0%Tier 1 leverage$9,312 13.2% $2,816 4.0% $3,520 5.0%Common equity Tier I capital$9,312 15.4% $2,714 4.5% $3,920 6.5%_______________________(a)Capital ratios are calculated based on the Basel III Standardized Approach rules, subject to applicable transition provisions, at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.(b)At June 30, 2017 and at December 31, 2016, Synchrony Financial and the Bank also must maintain a capital conservation buffer of common equity Tier 1 capital in excess of minimum risk-based capital ratios by at least 1.25 percentage points and 0.625 percentage points, respectively, to avoid limits on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers and similar employees.The Bank may pay dividends on its stock, with consent or non-objection from the OCC and the Federal Reserve Board, among other things, if its regulatory capital would not thereby be reduced below the applicable regulatory capital requirements. NOTE 11. EARNINGS PER SHAREBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the assumed conversion of all dilutive securities.The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share: Three months ended June 30, Six months ended June 30,(in millions, except per share data)2017 2016 2017 2016        Net earnings$496 $489 $995 $1,071        Weighted average common shares outstanding, basic804.0 833.9 808.5 833.9Effect of dilutive securities3.4 2.3 3.7 1.9Weighted average common shares outstanding, dilutive807.4 836.2 812.2 835.8       Earnings per basic common share$0.62 $0.59 $1.23 $1.28Earnings per diluted common share$0.61 $0.58 $1.23 $1.2854We have issued certain stock based awards under the Synchrony Financial 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan. A total of 5 million and 3 million shares for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 3 million shares for both the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, related to these awards were considered anti-dilutive and therefore were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share.NOTE 12. INCOME TAXESWe now file consolidated U.S. federal and state income tax returns separate and apart from GE. For periods up to and including the date of Separation, we were included in the consolidated U.S. federal and state income tax returns of GE, where applicable, but also filed certain separate state and foreign income tax returns. The tax provision is presented on a separate company basis as if we were a separate filer for tax purposes for all periods presented. The effects of tax adjustments and settlements from taxing authorities are presented in our condensed consolidated financial statements in the period in which they occur. Our current obligations for taxes are settled with the relevant tax authority, or GE, as applicable, on an estimated basis and adjusted in later periods as appropriate and are reflected in our consolidated financial statements in the periods in which those settlements occur. We recognize the current and deferred tax consequences of all transactions that have been recognized in the financial statements using the provisions of the enacted tax laws. In calculating the provision for interim period income taxes, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes, we estimate the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year and apply that estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date ordinary income. Adjustments to tax expense are made for year-to-date discrete items. See “Management's Discussion and Analysis—Critical Accounting Estimates” in our 2016 Form 10-K, for a discussion of the significant judgments and estimates related to income taxes.For periods prior to Separation, we are under continuous examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and the tax authorities of various states as part of their audit of GE’s tax returns. The IRS is currently auditing GE's consolidated U.S. income tax returns for 2012 and 2013. We are under examination in various states going back to 2008 as part of their audit of GE’s tax returns. We are not currently under audit with respect to any post-Separation periods. We believe that there are no issues or claims that are likely to significantly impact our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We further believe that we have made adequate provision for all income tax uncertainties that could result from such examinations.Tax Sharing and Separation AgreementIn connection with our initial public offering in August 2014 (“IPO”), we entered into a Tax Sharing and Separation Agreement (“TSSA”), which governs certain Separation-related tax matters between the Company and GE following the IPO. The TSSA governs the allocation of the responsibilities for the taxes of the GE group between GE and the Company. The TSSA also allocates rights, obligations and responsibilities in connection with certain administrative matters relating to the preparation of tax returns and control of tax audits and other proceedings relating to taxes. See Note 14. Income Taxes to our 2016 annual consolidated and combined financial statements in our 2016 Form 10-K for additional information on the TSSA.Unrecognized Tax Benefits($ in millions)June 30, 2017 December 31, 2016Unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest expense and penalties$163 $150Portion that, if recognized, would reduce tax expense and effective tax rate(a)108 99Accrued interest on unrecognized tax benefits9 6Accrued penalties on unrecognized tax benefits— —____________________(a)Includes gross state and local unrecognized tax benefits net of the effects of associated U.S. federal income taxes. Excludes amounts attributable to any related valuation allowances resulting from associated increases in deferred tax assets.55We compute our unrecognized tax benefits on a separate return basis. For unrecognized tax benefits associated with periods prior to 2014, we will settle our liabilities, as required, in accordance with the TSSA. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that may be resolved in the next twelve months is not expected to be material to our results of operations. NOTE 13. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND REGULATORY MATTERSIn the normal course of business, from time to time, we have been named as a defendant in various legal proceedings, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in connection with our business activities. Certain of the legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages, or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. We are also involved, from time to time, in reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental agencies regarding our business (collectively, “regulatory matters”), which could subject us to significant fines, penalties, obligations to change our business practices or other requirements resulting in increased expenses, diminished income and damage to our reputation. We contest liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we establish an accrued liability for legal and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies which are both probable and reasonably estimable.Legal proceedings and regulatory matters are subject to many uncertain factors that generally cannot be predicted with assurance, and we may be exposed to losses in excess of any amounts accrued.For some matters, we are able to determine that an estimated loss, while not probable, is reasonably possible. For other matters, including those that have not yet progressed through discovery and/or where important factual information and legal issues are unresolved, we are unable to make such an estimate. We currently estimate that the reasonably possible losses for legal proceedings and regulatory matters, whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, and for which we are able to estimate a possible loss, are immaterial. This represents management’s estimate of possible loss with respect to these matters and is based on currently available information. This estimate of possible loss does not represent our maximum loss exposure. The legal proceedings and regulatory matters underlying the estimate will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly from current estimates.Our estimate of reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given the varying stages of the proceedings, the existence of numerous yet to be resolved issues, the breadth of the claims (often spanning multiple years), unspecified damages and/or the novelty of the legal issues presented. Based on our current knowledge, we do not believe that we are a party to any pending legal proceeding or regulatory matters that would have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial condition or liquidity. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in such matters, the ultimate outcome of a particular matter could be material to our operating results for a particular period depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of our earnings for that period, and could adversely affect our business and reputation.Below is a description of certain of our regulatory matters and legal proceedings.56Regulatory MattersOn October 30, 2014, the United States Trustee, which is part of the Department of Justice, filed an application in In re Nyree Belton, a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case pending in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York for orders authorizing discovery of the Bank pursuant to Rule 2004 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, related to an investigation of the Bank’s credit reporting. The discovery, which is ongoing, concerns allegations made in Belton et al. v. GE Capital Consumer Lending, a putative class action adversary proceeding pending in the same Bankruptcy Court. In the Belton adversary proceeding, which was filed on April 30, 2014, plaintiff alleges that the Bank violates the discharge injunction under Section 524(a)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code by attempting to collect discharged debts and by failing to update and correct credit information to credit reporting agencies to show that such debts are no longer due and owing because they have been discharged in bankruptcy. Plaintiff seeks declaratory judgment, injunctive relief and an unspecified amount of damages. On December 15, 2014, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order staying the adversary proceeding pending an appeal to the District Court of the Bankruptcy Court’s order denying the Bank’s motion to compel arbitration. On October 14, 2015, the District Court reversed the Bankruptcy Court and on November 4, 2015, the Bankruptcy Court granted the Bank's motion to compel arbitration.On October 15, 2015, the Bank received a Civil Investigative Demand from the CFPB seeking information related to the Bank’s credit bureau reporting with respect to sold accounts. The information sought by the CFPB generally relates to the allegations made in Belton et al. v. GE Capital Consumer Lending. On May 9, 2016, the Bank received a NORA (Notice of Opportunity to Respond and Advise) letter from the CFPB indicating that the CFPB Office of Enforcement is considering whether to recommend that the CFPB take legal action relating to this matter.On May 9, 2017, the Bank received a Civil Investigative Demand from the CFPB seeking information related to the marketing and servicing of deferred interest promotions.Other MattersThe Bank or the Company is, or has been, defending a number of putative class actions alleging claims under the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) as a result of phone calls made by the Bank. The complaints generally have alleged that the Bank or the Company placed calls to consumers by an automated telephone dialing system or using a pre-recorded message or automated voice without their consent and seek up to $1,500 for each violation, without specifying an aggregate amount. Campbell et al. v. Synchrony Bank was filed on January 25, 2017 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York. The original complaint named only J.C. Penney Company, Inc. and J.C. Penney Corporation, Inc. as the defendants but was amended on April 7, 2017 to replace those defendants with the Bank. Neal et al. v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and Synchrony Bank, for which the Bank is indemnifying Wal-Mart, was filed on January 17, 2017 in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina. The original complaint named only Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. as a defendant but was amended on March 30, 2017 to add Synchrony Bank as an additional defendant.In addition to the TCPA class action lawsuits related to phone calls, the Company is a defendant in a putative class action lawsuit alleging claims under the TCPA relating to facsimiles. In Michael W. Kincaid, DDS et al. v. Synchrony Financial, plaintiff alleges that the Company violated the TCPA by sending fax advertisements without consent and without required notices, and seeks up to $1,500 for each violation. The amount of damages sought in the aggregate is unspecified. The original complaint was filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on January 20, 2016. On August 11, 2016, the Court granted the Company’s motion to dismiss based on the lack of personal jurisdiction. On August 15, 2016, the plaintiff re-filed the case in the Southern District of Ohio.57ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKMarket risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio. We are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates.We borrow money from a variety of depositors and institutions in order to provide loans to our customers. Changes in market interest rates cause our net interest income to increase or decrease, as some of our assets and liabilities carry interest rates that fluctuate with market benchmarks. The interest rate benchmark for our floating rate assets is generally the prime rate, and the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate liabilities is generally either LIBOR or the federal funds rate. The prime rate and the LIBOR or federal funds rate could reset at different times or could diverge, leading to mismatches in the interest rates on our floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities. As of June 30, 2017, assuming an immediate 100 basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities, we estimate that net interest income over the following 12-month period would increase by approximately $143 million. This estimate projects net interest income over the following 12-month period and takes into consideration future growth and balance sheet composition. For a more detailed discussion of our exposure to market risk, refer to “Management's Discussion and Analysis—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in our 2016 Form 10-K.ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESUnder the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures, and our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2017. No change in internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2017 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 58PART II.
