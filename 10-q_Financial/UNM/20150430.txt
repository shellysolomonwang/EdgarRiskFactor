ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSThere have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDSShares Issued Under Certain Employee Benefit PlansOur U.S. employees are eligible to participate in the Unum Group 401(k) Retirement Plan (the 401(k) Plan). One of the investment choices in the 401(k) Plan is the Unum Group Unitized Stock Fund, which gives participants the opportunity to invest amounts deposited in their plan accounts in units principally comprised of Unum Group common stock. The Unum Group common stock held in the stock fund is purchased in open market transactions by the plan trustee. During the first quarter of 2015, we determined that the number of shares of Unum Group common stock issued under the 401(k) Plan has exceeded the number of shares registered under the registration statement covering the 401(k) Plan. Under applicable federal securities laws, plan participants who purchased units that included unregistered shares may have a right to rescind their purchases and require us to repurchase their units for an amount equal to the price paid for the units (or, if the units have been sold, to receive damages for any loss that was incurred on the sale), plus interest. Generally, the federal statute of limitations applicable to securities rescission rights is one year from the date of acquisition of the security. On April 28, 2015, we filed a new registration statement on Form S-8 to register an additional 3,000,000 shares of common stock and related interests in the 401(k) Plan for offer to plan participants. Based on the latest data provided to us, we estimate that approximately 722,421 unregistered shares were included in units sold through the 401(k) Plan during the twelve months ended April 28, 2015, including approximately 243,480 shares sold during the first quarter of 2015. During this twelve month period, the closing price of our common stock ranged from a low of $31.05 per share to a high of $36.81 per share. The closing price of our common stock on April 28, 2015 was $33.79 per share. The failure to register the shares of common stock under the 401(k) Plan was inadvertent, and we expect to make a voluntary rescission offer to eligible plan participants during the second quarter of 2015. Based on the current market price of Unum Group's common stock, we do not expect that the exercise of any applicable rescission rights will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.Share Repurchase ProgramThe following table provides information about our share repurchase activity for the first quarter of 2015: (a) TotalNumber ofSharesPurchased (b) AveragePrice Paidper Share (1) (c) Total Number ofShares Purchasedas Part of PubliclyAnnouncedProgram (2) (d) Approximate DollarValue of Shares thatMay Yet BePurchased Underthe Program (2)January 1 - January 31, 2015— $— — $429,496,320February 1 - February 28, 20151,880,000 33.82 1,880,000 365,923,571March 1 - March 31, 20151,329,301 33.44 1,329,301 321,474,713Total3,209,301   3,209,301   (1)The average price paid per share excludes the cost of commissions.(2)In December 2013, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of Unum Group's common stock through June 12, 2015.  76ITEM 6.
