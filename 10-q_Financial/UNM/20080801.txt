The share repurchase program does not have an expiration date, and the pace of repurchase activity will depend upon various factors such as the level of available cash, alternative uses for cash, and our stock price. The authorization may be modified, extended, or terminated by our board of directors at any time.      (2) On January 31, 2008, we repurchased 14,000,000 shares of Unum Group’s common stock for $350.0 million using an accelerated share repurchase agreement. Under the terms of the repurchase agreement, we were to receive, or be required to pay, a price adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of Unum Group common stock during the term of the agreement. Any price adjustment payable to us was to be settled in shares of our common stock. Any price adjustment we would have been required to pay would have been settled in either cash or common stock. A 30 percent partial acceleration of the agreement, 4,200,000 shares, occurred on March 26, 2008 and settled on March 28, 2008 with the price adjustment resulting in the delivery to us of 482,483 additional shares of our common stock. The remaining 9,800,000 shares settled on May 29, 2008, with the price adjustment resulting in the delivery to us of 913,707 additional shares. In total, we repurchased 15,396,190 shares of our common stock under this agreement.    75    Table of Contents ITEM 4.
