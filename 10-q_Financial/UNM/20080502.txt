(2) On October 31, 2007, we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $700.0 million of Unum Group’s common stock. The share repurchase program does not have an expiration date, and the pace of repurchase activity will depend upon various factors such as the level of available cash, alternative uses for cash, and our stock price. The authorization may be modified, extended, or terminated by our board of directors at any time.      (3) On January 31, 2008, we repurchased 14,000,000 shares of Unum Group’s common stock for $350.0 million using an accelerated share repurchase agreement. Under the terms of the repurchase agreement, we may receive, or be required to pay, a price adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of Unum Group common stock during the term of the agreement. Any price adjustment payable to us will be settled in shares of our common stock. Any price adjustment we are required to pay will be settled in either cash or common stock. A 30 percent partial acceleration of the agreement, 4,200,000 shares, occurred on March 26, 2008 and settled on March 28, 2008 with the price adjustment resulting in the delivery to us of 482,483 additional shares of our common stock. We expect the price adjustment on the remaining 9,800,000 shares to settle on or before the completion of the agreement in May 2008.      (4) For the original shares repurchased in January 2008, the average price paid per share shown is the initial estimated repurchase agreement price adjusted for the partial acceleration of the agreement in March 2008.    67    Table of Contents  ITEM 6.
