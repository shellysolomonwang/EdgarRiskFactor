(3) On February 2, 2011, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of Unum Group’s common stock, in addition to the amount remaining to be repurchased under the previous authorization discussed above. The $1.0 billion share repurchase program has an expiration date of August 2012.    (4) On February 4, 2011, we repurchased 7,134,364 shares, at a cost of $200.0 million, using an accelerated repurchase agreement. As part of this transaction, we simultaneously entered into a forward contract indexed to the price of Unum Group common stock, which subjected the transaction to a future price adjustment. Under the terms of the repurchase agreement, we were to receive, or be required to pay, a price adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of Unum Group common stock during the term of the agreement, less a discount. Any price adjustment payable to us was to be settled in shares of Unum Group common stock. Any price adjustment we would have been required to pay would have been settled in either cash or common stock. The final price adjustment settlement occurred on March 18, 2011 resulting in the delivery to us of 563,954 additional shares. In total, we repurchased 7,698,318 shares pursuant to the accelerated repurchase agreement, which completed the $500.0 million repurchase authorization and initiated the $1.0 billion repurchase program.    89    Table of Contents   ITEM 6.
