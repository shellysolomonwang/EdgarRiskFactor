Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2008, and under “Part II. Other Information—Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended February 28, 2009 and May 31, 2009, which are filed with the SEC and available at the SEC’s internet site (http://www.sec.gov).  Introduction and Overview  Discover Financial Services is a leading credit card issuer and electronic payment services company. We offer credit cards as well as other financial products and services to qualified customers. We are also a leader in payment processing and related services for merchants and financial institutions. In the second quarter of 2009, we became a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and a financial holding company under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which subjects us to oversight, regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). Our fiscal year ends on November 30 of each year.  Our primary revenues come from interest income earned on loan receivables, securitization income derived from the transfer of credit card loan receivables to securitization trusts and subsequent issuance of beneficial interests through securitization transactions, and fees earned from cardmembers, merchants and issuers. The primary expenses required to operate our business include funding costs (interest expense), loan loss provisions, cardmember rewards, and expenses incurred to grow, manage and service our loan receivables.    40    Table of Contents Our business activities are funded primarily through the raising of consumer deposits, the process of asset securitization, and both secured and unsecured debt. In a credit card securitization, loan receivables are transferred to a securitization trust, from which beneficial interests are issued to investors. We continue to own and service the accounts that generate the securitized loans. The trusts utilized by us to facilitate asset securitization transactions are not our subsidiaries. These trusts are excluded from our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Because our securitization activities qualify as sales under GAAP and accordingly are not treated as secured financing transactions, we remove credit card loan receivables equal to the amount of the investors’ interests in securitized loans from our consolidated statements of financial condition. As a result, asset securitizations have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements in that the portions of interest income, provision for loan losses and certain components of other income related to the securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued are no longer recorded in our consolidated statements of income; however, they remain significant factors in determining the securitization income we receive on our retained beneficial interests in those transactions. See “—Accounting Treatment for Off-Balance Sheet Securitizations” below for information regarding recently issued amendments to the accounting standards applicable to asset securitizations and see “—Outlook” and “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Securitization Financing” below for a discussion of the current state of the securitization markets.  Our senior management evaluates business performance and allocates resources using financial data that is presented on a managed basis. Managed loans consist of our on-balance sheet loan portfolio, loans held for sale and loan receivables that have been securitized and against which beneficial interests have been issued. Owned loans, a subset of managed loans, refer to our on-balance sheet loan portfolio and loans held for sale and include the undivided seller’s interest we retain in our securitizations. A managed basis presentation, which is not a presentation in accordance with GAAP, involves reporting securitized loans with our owned loans in the managed basis statements of financial condition and reporting the earnings on securitized loans in the same manner as the owned loans instead of as securitization income. See “—GAAP to Managed Data Reconciliations.”  Key Highlights        •    Net income available to common stockholders for the three months ended August 31, 2009 was $559 million, up $379 million from the three months ended August 31, 2008, and includes approximately $287 million (after-tax) related to the Visa and MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement, as described in “Part II. Other Information—Item 1. Legal Proceedings.”        •    We re-entered the capital markets during the quarter by completing a common stock offering in which we sold approximately 60 million shares, raising $534 million, and through an unsecured term debt issuance which raised $400 million. Additionally, the securitization trust issued $1.5 billion of asset-backed securities eligible for funding under the Federal Reserve’s Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (“TALF”) and we completed a number of actions to adjust the credit enhancement structure of the securitization trusts.        •    Net interest income of $529 million for the quarter increased $153 million compared to the third quarter 2008. During the current quarter, we earned higher interest rates on standard balances and substantially reduced promotional rate offers, with those benefits partially offset by higher interest charge-offs. Net interest income also increased as the level of on-balance sheet loans rose as a result of maturing securitizations during the previous 12 months. Additionally, higher anticipated interest income on standard balances contributed significantly to the $69 million favorable revaluation of the interest-only strip receivable in the third quarter 2009, compared to a $34 million unfavorable revaluation in the prior year period.        •    Delinquency and charge-off rates continue to rise as a result of the current economic environment. In the current quarter, our managed over 30 days delinquency rate increased 125 basis points to 5.10% in comparison to the third quarter 2008, and the managed net charge-off rate increased 319 basis points to    41    Table of Contents       8.39% from the comparable prior year period. We recorded provision for loan losses of $381 million this quarter, which was slightly higher than the same quarter last year. Higher net charge-offs were largely offset by a decline in the allowance for loan losses as a result of lower on-balance sheet loans due to securitization activities completed during the quarter. By comparison, in the third quarter last year, we added $113 million due to an increase in on-balance sheet loans in the period.        •    In the third quarter 2009, operating expenses decreased $89 million, or 14%, from the third quarter 2008. Marketing expenses were $60 million less than last year as we significantly reduced promotional rate balance transfer offers, while compensation costs and other expenses declined as a result of lower headcount and cost containment initiatives.  Outlook  The general economic environment and rising consumer bankruptcies continue to adversely impact our business. Although we have seen some promising trends in certain economic indicators, we expect unemployment levels and bankruptcies to rise further and, therefore, we remain cautious in our outlook on consumer credit. Additionally, recently enacted credit card legislation will have a significant impact on our business. See “—Legislative and Regulatory Developments” below for a further discussion.  We continue to see lower consumer spending and a reduction in the availability of consumer credit generally as a result of the downturn in the economy. We anticipate the continued challenges in the economic environment will result in an increase in charge-offs and the allowance for loan losses for the remainder of 2009 and into 2010. Additionally, our results in 2010 will not benefit from the Visa and MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement and will be adversely impacted by the new credit card legislation.  In response to the difficult consumer credit environment, we have modified our loan growth strategies. We continue to manage balance transfer activity, and expect it to be below prior year volumes in the fourth quarter of 2009 and into 2010. Additionally, we have taken certain actions on new and existing accounts in response to pending legal restrictions on our ability to adjust rates on accounts that may later pose heightened risk. These actions include increasing rates on standard balances for new and existing accounts and converting many accounts with fixed annual percentage rates to variable rates.  Recent management actions, including reducing headcount, have resulted in a decline in our operating expenses in the third quarter of 2009. We continued to spend cautiously on marketing efforts, particularly related to new accounts and balance transfer offers. Although we expect our marketing expenses to increase in the fourth quarter due to new advertising campaigns for Discover Card and Diners Club, going forward we will continue to focus on sustaining a lower level of overall operating expenses compared to prior year periods.  During the quarter we increased our liquidity reserve, primarily consisting of cash and cash equivalents, to $10.6 billion, in anticipation of approximately $17.7 billion of asset-backed securities and deposit maturities in 2010. We were able to strengthen our liquidity position in the quarter through a sale of common stock, a debt offering and growth in direct-to-consumer deposits. We also completed actions to adjust the credit enhancement structure of the securitization trusts, which had the effect of removing the trusts from negative ratings watch. This allowed us, through the securitization trusts, to re-enter the public securitization market in July and September 2009 with $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, of issuances of asset-backed securities eligible for funding through the TALF program.  While we potentially have access through March 2010 to an additional $10.2 billion of issuances of asset-backed securities through the TALF program, uncertainty over existing FDIC guidance regarding standards for legal isolation of the transferred assets following the change in accounting rules under FASB Statements No. 166 and 167 (defined below) has recently made it difficult or impossible to obtain the required ratings for securities of our securitization trusts to qualify as eligible securities under the TALF program. Therefore, we do not expect our securitization trusts to be able to issue securities under the TALF program until this uncertainty is resolved. Further,    42    Table of Contents  the TALF program ends in March 2010 and there is no certainty that a non-government guaranteed market for the sale of our asset-backed securities will subsequently develop. See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Securitization Financing” for further discussion. Therefore, we will continue to emphasize our direct-to-consumer deposits and deposit products offered through affinity relationships, which grew $2 billion during the third quarter, bringing the total to approximately $10 billion at quarter end. We also plan to continue to use brokered certificates of deposit for intermediate and longer term funding.  We continue to work to enhance U.S. acceptance awareness among merchants, their employees and our customers while also continuing with our plan to expand international acceptance. In July, the PULSE Network became the global ATM network for Diners Club International cards. To further expand merchant acceptance in Western Europe and India, we have signed acquiring agreements with Elavon, Six MultiPay and Venture Infotek. Beginning in October, inbound Diners Club International volume in the U.S. will begin to shift to the Discover Network, which we expect to result in higher transaction volumes on the Network. We are also making progress on international acceptance for Discover cardmembers and, by the end of 2009, we expect that merchants in over 50 countries will be enabled to accept Discover cards. This will increase our opportunity to achieve higher volumes as international acceptance and acceptance awareness continue to grow.  Accounting Treatment for Off-Balance Sheet Securitizations  In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the “FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 166, Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets-an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 (“Statement No. 166”) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R) (“Statement No. 167”). Statement No. 166 amends the accounting for transfers of financial assets and will impact the accounting for our credit card asset securitization activities. Under Statement No. 166, the trusts used in our securitization transactions will no longer be exempt from consolidation. Statement No. 167 prescribes an ongoing assessment of our involvement in the activities of the trusts and our rights or obligations to receive benefits or absorb losses of the trusts that could be potentially significant in order to determine whether those entities will be required to be consolidated on our financial statements. The assessment under Statement No. 167 will result in the consolidation of the trusts by us. As a result, credit card receivables held by the trusts and debt issued from those entities will be presented as assets and liabilities of the Company beginning on the effective date of the new standards. The two standards become effective for us on December 1, 2009. Initial adoption is expected to have a material impact on our reported financial condition. If the trusts were consolidated using the carrying amounts of trust assets and liabilities as of August 31, 2009, this would result in an increase in total assets of approximately $21.1 billion and an increase in total liabilities of approximately $22.4 billion on our balance sheet, with the difference of approximately $1.3 billion recorded as a charge to retained earnings, net of tax. In addition, certain interests in the trust assets currently reflected on our balance sheet will be reclassified, primarily to loan receivables, cash and cash equivalents and accrued interest receivable. After adoption, our results of operations will no longer reflect securitization income, but will instead report interest income, provisions for loan losses and certain other income associated with all managed loan receivables and interest expense inclusive of interest on debt issued from the trusts. Because our securitization transactions will be accounted for under the new accounting standards as secured borrowings rather than asset sales, the cash flows from these transactions will be presented as cash flows from financing activities rather than cash flows from investing activities.  In the third quarter of 2009, we took certain actions to adjust the credit enhancement structure of the trusts as described in “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Funding Sources—Securitization Financing” below. These actions have the effect of causing the assets of the trusts to be included in our risk-weighted assets for regulatory capital purposes effective July 2009. As a result, the consolidation of the trusts under Statement No. 167 on December 1, 2009 will have a lesser impact on our regulatory capital calculations than would have otherwise been the case, because much of this effect has already been reflected as a result of the trust actions. However, the charge to retained earnings that we expect as a result of adopting Statement No. 167 will further reduce our regulatory capital ratios.    43    Table of Contents On December 15, 2008, FASB Staff Position FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8, Disclosures by Public Entities (Enterprises) about Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Interest Entities (“FSP FAS 140-4 and FIN 46(R)-8”) was issued. This staff position requires additional information related to securitization activities to be disclosed in advance of the effective date of these amendments. See Note 5: Credit Card Securitization Activities in “Part I. Item 1. Financial Statements” for the disclosures.  Legislative and Regulatory Developments  Legislation Addressing Credit Card Practices  On May 22, 2009, the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the “CARD Act”) was enacted. The CARD Act makes numerous changes to the Truth in Lending Act, affecting the marketing, underwriting, pricing, billing and other aspects of the consumer credit card business. Most of the requirements of the CARD Act become effective in February 2010. Several took effect in August 2009. On September 24, 2009, the House Financial Services Committee Chairman proposed legislation to accelerate the effective date of all of the CARD Act provisions to December 1, 2009. Compliance with this requirement would be extremely difficult, particularly because the Federal Reserve’s implementing rules have not been finalized, and some implementing regulations have not yet been proposed. No similar proposal has been introduced in the Senate. Prospects for a change in the compliance date are unclear.  Among the CARD Act’s requirements are the following:        •    Prohibits interest rate increases on outstanding balances except under limited circumstances;        •    Prohibits interest rate increases on new balances during the first year an account is opened except under limited circumstances;        •    Requires allocation of payments in excess of the required minimum payment to balances with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) before balances with a lower APR (for accounts with different APRs on different balances);        •    Restricts imposition of a default APR on existing balances unless an account is 60 days past due and requires that the increased APR resulting from a default be reduced if payments are timely made for six months;        •    Generally requires 45 days’ advance notice be provided prior to increasing any APR (as permitted by the CARD Act) or other significant changes to account terms. The notice must include a statement of the cardholder’s right to cancel the account prior to the effective date of the change;        •    Prohibits the use of the two-cycle average daily balance method of calculating interest and prohibits the assessment of interest on any portion of a balance that is repaid within the grace period;        •    Requires penalty fees (e.g., late fees and over-limit fees) to be “reasonable” and “proportionate” to the consumer’s violation of the account terms;        •    Prohibits card issuers from imposing over-limit fees unless the cardholder has expressly opted-in to the issuer authorizing such over-limit transactions and imposes other limits on such fees;        •    Requires card issuers to review accounts at least every six months when an APR has been increased to determine whether the APR should be reduced;        •    Prohibits issuance of a credit card to a consumer under the age of 21 unless there is a co-signer over the age of 21 or the issuer verifies the consumer has an independent means to repay; and        •    Requires new billing statement disclosures, such as the length of time and cost of paying down the account balances if only minimum payments are made.  A number of the CARD Act’s requirements reflect our existing practices and will not require modifications of policies or procedures. However, other provisions, such as those addressing limitations on interest rate    44    Table of Contents  increases, over-limit fees and payment allocation, require us to make fundamental changes to our current business practices and systems. For example, we have informed cardmembers that as of certain specified dates we will no longer charge over-limit fees, impose fees for payments made over the telephone, or change interest rates on existing balances when a customer’s payments are late. Restrictions on risk management practices that have been commonplace in the industry have compelled us, and our competitors, to manage risk through more restrictive underwriting and credit line management, reduce promotional offers, increase annual percentage rates and introduce new or higher fees.  Full implementation of the CARD Act requires the promulgation of regulations by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has issued proposed regulations implementing the majority of the provisions for public comment. The final regulations may differ from these proposed regulations. We are making changes that the CARD Act requires to be implemented in a relatively short timeframe. Other changes must await final regulatory guidance from the Federal Reserve. We are evaluating appropriate modifications to products, revenue generation, marketing strategies and other business practices that will be in compliance with the law, will be attractive to consumers and will provide a good return for our stockholders. The full impact of the CARD Act on us is unknown at this time as it ultimately depends upon Federal Reserve interpretation of some of the provisions, successful implementation of our strategies, consumer behavior, and the actions of our competitors.  The CARD Act requires the Federal Reserve and the Government Accountability Office to conduct various studies, including studies regarding interchange fees, reasons for credit limit reductions and rate increases, “small business” cards, and credit card terms and disclosures. Based on the results of these studies, new requirements that negatively impact us may be introduced as future legislation or regulation.  Other Credit Card and Student Loan Legislation  Congress may also consider other legislation affecting our business. Examples include a ceiling on the rate of interest that can be charged on credit cards, restrictions on interchange fees established by the dominant credit card networks, authority for merchants to provide discounts to customers who use certain types of credit or debit cards, and extending the provisions of the CARD Act to business cards.  We currently offer both federal and private student loans. On September 17, 2009, the House of Representatives passed the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act (“SAFRA”), which is currently under consideration in the Senate. If passed in its current form, SAFRA would require all federal student loans to be made directly by the federal government starting July 1, 2010, rather than by private institutions through the Federal Family Education Loan Program. Because SAFRA allows financial institutions to continue offering private student loans, we do not expect SAFRA to have an impact on our ability to continue offering private student loans.  Bankruptcy Legislation  The Senate Judiciary Committee is considering legislation that would disallow claims in Chapter 7 bankruptcy based on “high cost” consumer debt and exclude consumers with such debt from the bankruptcy “means test.” The means test requires debtors who can afford to repay a portion of their debts through Chapter 13 repayment plan do so, rather than discharge all indebtedness under Chapter 7. The proposed legislation, if enacted, could increase the percentage of bankruptcy filers who obtain full debt discharges to the detriment of all unsecured lenders, and could result in increased charge-offs of our loan receivables. It is unclear whether this legislation will be enacted by Congress.  Congress is also considering legislation to allow bankruptcy courts to restructure first mortgage loans (e.g., by reducing the loan amount to the value of the collateral, a process referred to as “cramdown”). This change is likely to increase the number of individuals who file for bankruptcy, which would adversely impact all creditors including Discover. While the House of Representatives has approved a cramdown bill, it has garnered significant opposition in the Senate and prospects for enactment are unclear.    45    Table of Contents Financial Regulatory Reform  On June 17, 2009, the Administration released a broad and complex plan for financial regulatory reform that would restructure the current regulatory system, significantly increasing supervision and regulation of financial firms, services and markets. The plan would create a new Financial Services Oversight Council, chaired by the U.S. Treasury and including the heads of the principal federal financial regulators as members, to identify systemic risks and improve interagency cooperation. The plan would strengthen capital and other prudential standards for all banks and bank holding companies and require all financial holding companies to be “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” on a consolidated basis. The plan also proposes the establishment of a new independent agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Agency (“CFPA”), which would regulate consumer financial services and products, such as credit, savings and payment products. The CFPA would have sole rulemaking and interpretive authority under existing and future consumer financial services laws and supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over all institutions subject to its regulations. The CFPA’s rules would serve as a floor allowing states to adopt and enforce stricter laws for institutions of all types, regardless of charter, and to enforce these laws, as well as regulations of the CFPA. The plan would also strengthen the supervision and regulation of securitization markets. It would require loan originators to retain a portion of the credit risk of securitized exposures and increase reporting by asset-backed securities issuers.  Some of the Administration’s proposals have been introduced in legislative form in Congress with substantial amendments and revisions. The President has urged Congress to enact these reforms into law by year end. The legislation remains controversial and many obstacles to achieving that goal exist.  Treasury Rules Governing Compensation for Troubled Asset Relief Program Participants  On June 10, 2009, the U.S. Treasury issued interim final rules implementing the compensation and corporate governance requirements under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which amended the requirements of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, as described in our quarterly report for the quarter ended February 28, 2009. The rules apply to us as a recipient of funds under the U.S. Treasury Capital Purchase Program as of the date of publication in the Federal Register on June 15, 2009. These rules were subject to a public comment period which has expired, but no final rule has been adopted. The rules clarify prohibitions on bonus payments, provide guidance on the use of restricted stock units, expand restrictions on golden parachute payments, mandate enforcement of clawback provisions unless unreasonable to do so, outline the steps compensation committees must take when evaluating risks posed by compensation arrangements, and require the adoption and disclosure of a luxury expenditure policy, among other things. New requirements under the rules include enhanced disclosure of perquisites and the use of compensation consultants, and a prohibition on tax gross-up payments.  * * *  Segments  We manage our business activities in two segments: U.S. Card and Third-Party Payments. In compiling the segment results that follow, the U.S. Card segment bears all overhead costs that are not specifically associated with a particular segment and all costs associated with Discover Network marketing, servicing and infrastructure, with the exception of an allocation of direct and incremental costs driven by the Third-Party Payments segment.  U.S. Card.

U.S. Card  The U.S. Card segment reported pretax income of $912.8 million for the three months ended August 31, 2009, as compared to $245.2 million for the three months ended August 31, 2008. The increase in pretax income was driven principally by $472.2 million in pretax income related to the Visa and MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement, higher net interest income as a result of higher interest rate spread, and lower operating expenses, partially offset by higher provision for loan losses due to higher net charge-offs and a higher reserve rate. Net interest income increased $168.6 million, or 15%, for the three months ended August 31, 2009 compared to August 31, 2008, due to the impact of higher interest rates on standard balances and a substantial reduction in promotional rate balances, partially offset by higher interest charge-offs. Provision for loan losses increased $170.4 million, or 23%, in third quarter 2009 compared to third quarter 2008, as a result of higher net charge-offs, which is reflective of the continued rise in consumer bankruptcies and unemployment, partially offset by a reduction in loan loss reserves due to the decline in on-balance sheet loans as a result of securitization activities. By comparison, during the third quarter 2008 there was an increase in loan loss reserves. Other income increased $573.2 million due to $472.2 million of income related to the Visa and MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement and a $68.9 million favorable revaluation of the interest-only strip receivable as compared to a $33.5 million unfavorable revaluation in the prior year period. Other expense decreased $96.2 million, or 16%, reflecting a focus on expense reduction through actions such as reducing employee headcount and temporarily decreasing new account acquisition costs.  The U.S. Card segment reported pretax income of $1.5 billion for the nine months ended August 31, 2009, up 58% from the nine months ended August 31, 2008. The increase in pretax income was driven by $1.4 billion of income from the Visa and MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement, increased net interest income and lower operating expenses, partially offset by higher provision for loan losses. Net interest income increased $522.1 million, or 17%, for the nine months ended August 31, 2009 compared to the same period in 2008, as we benefited from lower cost of funds and a higher level of loan receivables. Provision for loan losses increased $1.4 billion, or 72%, as a result of higher charge-offs and a higher reserve rate, reflective of the current economic environment.  The managed loan balance of $50.9 billion at August 31, 2009 was relatively unchanged from August 31, 2008 as lower cardmember payments and growth in both student and personal loans were largely offset by substantially lower balance transfer activity and sales volume. Rising unemployment and bankruptcy levels adversely impacted cardmember delinquencies and charge-offs, resulting in a 5.10% managed over 30 days delinquency rate for the segment, including non-credit card loans, up from 3.85% at August 31, 2008. For the three months ended August 31, 2009, the managed segment and credit card net charge-off rates were 8.39% and 8.63%, respectively, up 319 and 335 basis points, respectively, from the three months ended August 31, 2008. For the nine months ended August 31, 2009, the managed segment and credit card net charge-off rates were 7.56% and 7.74%, respectively, up 272 and 284 basis points, respectively, from the comparable prior year period.  Third-Party Payments  Transaction volumes, revenues and expenses in the Third-Party Payments segment grew in the third quarter of 2009 from the third quarter 2008, primarily as a result of the inclusion of an additional month of Diners Club results in third quarter 2009 as compared to third quarter 2008, as we acquired Diners Club on June 30, 2008. Transaction volume of $35.9 billion and $107.8 billion during the three and nine months ended August 31, 2009, respectively, was up $0.6 billion and $16.7 billion from the three and nine months ended August 31, 2008, respectively. Higher transaction volumes in the three months ended August 31, 2009 were largely driven by the inclusion of an additional month of Diners Club transaction volume in the third quarter of 2009 as compared to    49    Table of Contents  third quarter 2008, offset by lower sales volume from third-party issuers and a 1% decline in PULSE volumes. The nine months ended August 31, 2009 also benefited from the inclusion of Diners Club transaction volume in addition to higher activity from new and existing financial institutions on the PULSE network, partially offset by lower third-party issuer volume as a result of lower gasoline prices and lower overall spending.  These higher volumes drove increases in revenues, which were $61.4 million and $180.8 million for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2009, respectively, up $6.1 million and $52.9 million, respectively, from the three and nine months ended August 31, 2008. Higher revenues in the three and nine months ended August 31, 2009 were driven by the inclusion of an additional month of Diners Club revenues in the third quarter 2009 as compared to third quarter 2008. Higher revenues in the nine months ended August 31, 2009 were also driven by higher PULSE transaction volume and higher fee income allocated to the Third-Party Payments segment. The nine months ended August 31, 2008, included $5.2 million in revenue related to two separate one-time contractual payments. Operating expenses were $34.2 million and $98.0 million for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2009, respectively, up 28% and 46%, respectively, as compared to the three and nine months ended August 31, 2008. Both increases were driven by the inclusion of Diners Club in addition to international marketing expenses.  GAAP to Managed Data Reconciliation  Our senior management evaluates business performance and allocates resources using financial data that is presented on a managed basis. Securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued to third parties are removed from our GAAP statements of financial condition. Instances in which a wholly-owned subsidiary of Discover Bank acquires certificated beneficial interests in securitization transactions result in a reduction to loan receivables of the amount of the retained interest and a corresponding increase in investment securities. The portions of interest income, provision for loan losses and certain components of other income related to the securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued are no longer recorded in our GAAP statements of income; however, they remain significant factors in determining the securitization income we receive on our retained beneficial interests in those transactions. We do not establish an allowance for loan losses on our securitized loans, although a factor for uncollectibility is incorporated into the initial gain on sale of securitized loans.  The managed basis presentation generally reverses the effects of securitization transactions; however, there are certain assets that arise from securitization transactions that are not reversed. Specifically, these assets are the cash collateral accounts that provide credit enhancement to the investors in certain transactions and cardmember payments allocated to the securitized loans, both of which are held at the trusts. These assets also include the interest-only strip receivable, which reflects the estimated fair value of the excess cash flows allocated to securitized loans and retained certificated beneficial interests. Income derived from these assets representing interest earned on accounts at the trusts, changes in the fair value of the interest-only strip receivable, and interest income on investment securities also are not reversed in a managed presentation.  Managed loan data is relevant because we service the securitized and owned loans, and the related accounts, in the same manner without regard to ownership of the loans. Management believes it is useful for investors to consider the credit performance of the entire managed loan portfolio to understand the quality of loan originations and the related credit risks inherent in the owned portfolio and retained interests in securitizations. Loan receivables on a GAAP (or owned) basis and related performance measures, including yield, charge-offs and delinquencies can vary from those presented on a managed basis. Generally, loan receivables included in the securitization trusts are derived from accounts that are more seasoned, while owned loan receivables represent a greater concentration of newer accounts. The seasoning of an account is measured by the age of the account relationship. In comparison to more seasoned accounts, loan receivables of newer accounts typically have lower charge-offs and delinquencies and carry lower interest yields resulting from introductory offers to new cardmembers, though such offers have been substantially reduced in recent periods.    50    Table of Contents Financial measures using managed data are non-GAAP financial measures. Beginning with “—Earnings Summary,” the discussion of our results of operations and financial condition is on a GAAP basis. The following table provides a reconciliation of the loan receivables and related statistics that are impacted by asset securitization, and which are shown on a managed basis in this quarterly report, to the most directly comparable GAAP-basis financial measure:  Reconciliation of GAAP to Managed Data                            For the Three Months EndedAugust 31,     For the Nine Months EndedAugust 31,        2009     2008     2009     2008        (dollars in thousands)     Loan Receivables                       Total Loans                       GAAP Basis   $  25,489,809     $  21,767,483     $  25,489,809     $  21,767,483     Securitization Adjustment     25,414,036       28,659,822       25,414,036       28,659,822                                       Managed Basis   $ 50,903,845     $ 50,427,305     $ 50,903,845     $ 50,427,305                                             Average Total Loans                       GAAP Basis   $ 26,380,203     $ 21,053,804     $ 27,454,927     $ 20,820,031     Securitization Adjustment     24,590,853       27,965,279       23,868,274       27,629,914                                       Managed Basis   $ 50,971,056     $ 49,019,083     $ 51,323,201     $ 48,449,945                                             Interest Yield                       GAAP Basis     12.10 %      11.41 %      11.62 %      10.72 %    Securitization Adjustment     13.40 %      13.61 %      13.22 %      14.00 %    Managed Basis     12.73 %      12.67 %      12.36 %      12.59 %          Net Principal Charge-off Rate                       GAAP Basis     8.05 %      4.76 %      7.30 %      4.36 %    Securitization Adjustment     8.77 %      5.54 %      7.85 %      5.21 %    Managed Basis     8.39 %      5.20 %      7.56 %      4.84 %          Delinquency Rate (over 30 days)                       GAAP Basis     4.86 %      3.58 %      4.86 %      3.58 %    Securitization Adjustment     5.35 %      4.06 %      5.35 %      4.06 %    Managed Basis     5.10 %      3.85 %      5.10 %      3.85 %          Delinquency Rate (over 90 days)                       GAAP Basis     2.46 %      1.73 %      2.46 %      1.73 %    Securitization Adjustment     2.74 %      2.00 %      2.74 %      2.00 %    Managed Basis     2.60 %      1.88 %      2.60 %      1.88 %          Credit Card Loans                       Credit Card Loans                       GAAP Basis   $ 22,721,603     $ 20,688,685     $ 22,721,603     $ 20,688,685     Securitization Adjustment     25,414,036       28,659,822       25,414,036       28,659,822                                       Managed Basis   $ 48,135,639     $ 49,348,507     $ 48,135,639     $ 49,348,507                                             Average Credit Card Loans                       GAAP Basis   $ 24,051,037     $ 20,202,845     $ 25,459,830     $ 20,205,528     Securitization Adjustment     24,590,853       27,965,279       23,868,274       27,629,914                                       Managed Basis   $ 48,641,890     $ 48,168,124     $ 49,328,104     $ 47,835,442                                        51    Table of Contents                     For the Three Months EndedAugust 31,     For the Nine Months EndedAugust 31,        2009     2008     2009     2008        (dollars in thousands)     Interest Yield                   GAAP Basis   12.56 %    11.45 %    11.91 %    10.73 %    Securitization Adjustment   13.40 %    13.61 %    13.22 %    14.00 %    Managed Basis   12.99 %    12.70 %    12.54 %    12.62 %          Net Principal Charge-off Rate                   GAAP Basis   8.48 %    4.92 %    7.63 %    4.47 %    Securitization Adjustment   8.77 %    5.54 %    7.85 %    5.21 %    Managed Basis   8.63 %    5.28 %    7.74 %    4.90 %          Delinquency Rate (over 30 days)                   GAAP Basis   5.27 %    3.72 %    5.27 %    3.72 %    Securitization Adjustment   5.35 %    4.06 %    5.35 %    4.06 %    Managed Basis   5.31 %    3.92 %    5.31 %    3.92 %          Delinquency Rate (over 90 days)                   GAAP Basis   2.70 %    1.81 %    2.70 %    1.81 %    Securitization Adjustment   2.74 %    2.00 %    2.74 %    2.00 %    Managed Basis   2.72 %    1.92 %    2.72 %    1.92 %   Critical Accounting Estimates  In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management must make judgments and use estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are uncertain. For estimates that involve a high degree of judgment and subjectivity, it is possible that different estimates could reasonably be derived for the same period. For estimates that are particularly sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions, significant changes to the estimated amount from period to period are also possible. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and, in certain cases, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. Management has identified the estimates related to allowance for loan losses, our interest-only strip receivable, the valuation of certain certificated retained interests in Discover Card Execution Note Trust (“DCENT”), the accrual of cardmember rewards cost, the evaluation of goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets for potential impairment and the accrual of income taxes as critical accounting estimates.  These critical accounting estimates are discussed in greater detail in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2008. That discussion can be found within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the heading Critical Accounting Policies. There have not been any material changes in the methods used to formulate these critical accounting estimates from those discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2008.    52    Table of Contents Earnings Summary  The following table outlines changes in the consolidated statements of income for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):                                       For the ThreeMonths EndedAugust 31,   2009 vs. 2008 increase(decrease)     For the NineMonths EndedAugust 31,   2009 vs. 2008 increase(decrease)        2009   2008   $     %     2009     2008   $     %     Interest income   $ 833,217   $  681,692   $  151,525     22 %    $  2,506,994     $  1,956,557   $ 550,437     28 %    Interest expense     304,401     305,643     (1,242 )    0 %      937,126       958,332     (21,206 )    (2 %)                                                        Net interest income     528,816     376,049     152,767     41 %      1,569,868       998,225     571,643     57 %    Provision for loan losses     380,999     364,838     16,161     4 %      1,962,673       881,439     1,081,234     123 %                                                        Net interest income after provision for loan losses     147,817     11,211     136,606     NM       (392,805 )      116,786     (509,591 )    NM     Other income     1,315,960     875,121     440,839     50 %      3,587,036       2,695,557     891,479     33 %    Other expense     523,838     612,547     (88,709 )    (14 %)      1,643,589       1,821,715     (178,126 )    (10 %)                                                        Income from continuing operations before income tax expense     939,939     273,785     666,154     NM       1,550,642       990,628     560,014     57 %    Income tax expense     362,485     94,885     267,600     NM       626,994       371,356     255,638     69 %                                                        Income from continuing operations   $ 577,454   $ 178,900   $ 398,554     NM     $ 923,648     $ 619,272   $ 304,376     49 %                                                       Income from continuing operations for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2009 was $577.5 million and $923.6 million, respectively. Income from continuing operations was influenced by loan growth, an increase in the reserve rate, income from the Visa and MasterCard antitrust settlement and lower operating expenses. These factors, as well as other factors impacting our results, are discussed further below and in “—Key Highlights” above.  Net Interest Income  Net interest income represents the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets which we own and the interest expense incurred to finance those assets. Net interest margin represents interest income, net of interest expense, as a percentage of total interest-earning assets on an annualized basis. Our interest-earning assets consist of: (i) loan receivables, (ii) our liquidity reserve which includes amounts on deposit with the Federal Reserve, highly rated certificates of deposit, and triple-A rated government mutual funds, (iii) certain retained interests in securitization transactions included in amounts due from asset securitization, and (iv) investment securities. Interest-earning assets do not include investors’ interests in securitization transactions that have been transferred to third parties since they are not assets which we own. Similarly, interest income does not include the interest yield on the related loans. Our interest-bearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits, both brokered and direct. Net interest income is influenced by the following:        •    The level and composition of interest-earning assets and liabilities, including the percentage of floating rate credit card loan receivables we own and the percentage of floating rate liabilities we owe;        •    Changes in the interest rate environment, including the levels of interest rates and the relationship between interest rate indices, such as the prime rate and federal funds rate;        •    Credit performance of our loans, particularly with regard to charge-offs of finance charges which reduce interest income; and        •    The terms of certificates of deposit upon initial offering, including maturity and interest rate.  For the Three Months Ended August 31, 2009 and 2008  During the three months ended August 31, 2009, net interest income grew $152.8 million, or 41%, compared to the three months ended August 31, 2008. During the same periods, our net interest margin and interest rate spread increased to 5.28% and 4.40%, up from 4.57% and 3.76%, respectively. A higher level of on-balance sheet loans was the largest factor driving the increased net interest income, which, along with other factors, is discussed further below.    53    Table of Contents Interest income on credit card loans increased $180.1 million from the third quarter of 2008 as a result of retaining more loan receivables on-balance sheet as securitized receivables matured, as well as an increase in interest yield of 111 basis points. The increase in yield was the result of higher interest rates on standard balances and a substantial reduction in promotional rate balances. This was partially offset by rising interest charge-offs, which increased 80.7% to $114.8 million in third quarter 2009 compared to third quarter 2008, due to the deterioration in the current economic environment as well as a higher level of on-balance sheet loans.  Interest income on other consumer loans increased $20.8 million from the third quarter of 2008 reflecting growth in both personal and student loans partially offset by a 319 basis point decrease in interest yield. The yield decreased as the proportion of student loans, which bear lower interest rates than personal loans, as a component of total other consumer loans increased.  Interest income on other assets decreased $49.3 million from the third quarter of 2008, reflecting the unfavorable impact of the lower interest rate environment on our liquidity reserve and amounts due from asset securitization.  Interest expense had a minimal impact on net interest income as lower cost of funds was largely offset by a higher level of deposit funding. Beginning in the second half of 2008, we increased our deposit issuance in order to fund more loan receivables on-balance sheet as a result of securitization maturities. Since that time, benchmark interest rates have declined, also driving down deposit rates. These lower deposit rates contributed to a 62 basis point decline in the cost of deposit funding in third quarter 2009 compared to third quarter 2008.  For the Nine Months Ended August 31, 2009 and 2008  For the nine months ended August 31, 2009, net interest income grew $571.6 million, or 57%, compared to the nine months ended August 31, 2008. During the same periods, our net interest margin and interest rate spread increased to 5.27% and 4.42%, respectively, up from 4.09% and 3.29%, respectively. A higher level of on-balance sheet loans was the largest factor driving the increased net interest income, which, along with other factors, is discussed further below.  Interest income on credit card loans grew $647.0 million from the nine months ended August 31, 2008, as a result of retaining more loan receivables on-balance sheet as securitized receivables matured, in addition to a 118 basis point increase in interest yield. This increase in yield was driven by the inclusion of balance transfer fees in interest income beginning in the third quarter of 2008, an increase in interest rates on standard balances and a reduction in promotional rate offers. This was partially offset by rising interest charge-offs, which increased 99.1% to $363.8 million in third quarter 2009 compared to third quarter 2008, due to the deterioration in the current economic environment as well as a higher level of on-balance sheet loans.  Interest income on other consumer loans increased $71.2 million from the nine months ended August 31, 2008 reflecting growth in both personal and student loans partially offset by a 244 basis point decrease in interest yield. The yield decreased as the proportion of student loans, which bear lower interest rates than personal loans, as a component of total other consumer loans increased.  Interest income on other assets decreased $167.8 million from the nine months ended August 31, 2008, reflecting the unfavorable impact of the lower interest rate environment on our liquidity reserve and amounts due from asset securitization.  Lower interest expense and a lower cost of funds also contributed to higher net interest income. Beginning in the second half of 2008, we increased our deposit issuance in order to fund more loan receivables on-balance sheet as a result of securitization maturities. Since that time, benchmark interest rates have declined, also driving down deposit rates. These lower deposit rates contributed to a 56 basis point decline in our deposit funding costs in the nine months ended August 31, 2009 compared to the prior year period, which resulted in lower interest expense. However, the decline in interest expense was largely offset by the increase in the same caused by the level of deposit funding and a special industry-wide FDIC deposit insurance assessment, which for us was $16 million.    54    Table of Contents The following tables provide further analysis of net interest income, net interest margin and the impact of rate and volume changes (dollars in

Factors that influence the provision for loan losses include:        •    The impact of general economic conditions on the consumer, including unemployment levels, bankruptcy trends and interest rate movements;        •    Changes in consumer spending and payment behaviors;        •    Changes in our loan portfolio, including the overall mix of accounts, products and loan balances within the portfolio;        •    The level and direction of historical and anticipated loan delinquencies and charge-offs;        •    The credit quality of the loan portfolio, which reflects, among other factors, our credit granting practices and effectiveness of collection efforts; and        •    Regulatory changes or new regulatory guidance.  In calculating the allowance for loan losses, we estimate probable losses separately for segments of the loan portfolio that have similar risk characteristics. For our credit card loans, we use a migration analysis to determine the likelihood that a loan receivable will progress through various stages of delinquency to charge off. An estimated charge-off ratio is then applied to each delinquency category to derive an estimated reserve rate. To determine if any adjustments should be made to the reserve rate derived from the migration analysis, we consider current economic trends as well as the difference between actual charge-offs and what was estimated to be charged off in recent periods. For our other consumer loans, we consider historical and forecasted losses in estimating the related allowance for loan losses.  For the three months ended August 31, 2009, the provision for loan losses increased $16.2 million, or 4%, compared with the three months ended August 31, 2008, reflecting higher net charge-offs largely offset by a decrease in the allowance for loan losses. Higher net charge-offs are a result of the deterioration in the current economic environment, and are discussed further in “—Net Charge-offs” and “—Delinquencies” below. At August 31, 2009, the allowance for loan losses was $1.8 billion, a decrease of $154.1 million from the second quarter. This decrease reflects a $2.0 billion decline in the level of on-balance sheet loans in the quarter as a result of securitization activities as well as the impact of an increase in government guaranteed student loans during the quarter. Such student loans carry little default risk as they are 97% guaranteed by the federal government under the Federal Family Education Loan Program. Therefore, these loans are reserved at a significantly lower rate than the remaining portfolio.  For the nine months ended August 31, 2009, the provision for loan losses increased $1.1 billion, or 123%, compared with the nine months ended August 31, 2008, reflecting higher net charge-offs and an increase in the level of allowance for loan losses. Higher net charge-offs are a result of the deterioration of the credit quality in the loan portfolio, and are discussed further in “—Net Charge-offs” and “—Delinquencies” below. In the nine months ended August 31, 2009, we added $457.8 million to the allowance for loan losses, largely due to an increase in the reserve rate, which is attributable to higher charge-off and delinquency trends, discussed below.    58    Table of Contents The following table provides changes in the Company’s allowance for loan losses by loan type for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2009 and August 31, 2008 (dollars in thousands):                            For the Three Months EndedAugust 31,     For the Nine Months EndedAugust 31,         2009       2008       2009       2008      Balance at beginning of period   $ 1,986,473     $ 846,775     $ 1,374,585     $ 759,925     Provision for loan losses:                       Credit card loans     354,408       348,310       1,877,327       841,553     Other consumer loans     26,591       16,528       85,346       39,886                                       Total provision for loan losses     380,999       364,838       1,962,673       881,439     Charge-offs:                       Credit card loans     (559,672 )      (290,108 )      (1,604,491 )      (803,951 )    Other consumer loans     (21,179 )      (2,287 )      (46,559 )      (3,085 )                                      Total charge-offs     (580,851 )      (292,395 )      (1,651,050 )      (807,036 )    Recoveries:                       Credit card loans     45,486       40,420       145,503       125,032     Other consumer loans     253       131       649       409                                       Total recoveries     45,739       40,551       146,152       125,441                                       Net charge-offs     (535,112 )      (251,844 )      (1,504,898 )      (681,595 )                                      Balance at end of period   $ 1,832,360     $ 959,769     $ 1,832,360     $ 959,769                                      The following table provides the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type at August 31, 2009 and November 30, 2008 (dollars in thousands):                        August 31, 2009     November 30, 2008        $   %     $   %     Credit card loans   $ 1,736,150   94.7 %    $ 1,317,811   95.9 %    Other loans     96,210   5.3 %      56,774   4.1 %                              Total allowance for loan losses   $ 1,832,360   100.0 %    $ 1,374,585   100.0 %                             Net Charge-offs  Our net charge-offs include the principal amount of losses charged off less principal recoveries and exclude charged-off interest and fees, recoveries of interest and fees and fraud losses. Charged-off and recovered interest and fees are recorded in interest and loan fee income for loan receivables and in securitization income for securitized loans while fraud losses are recorded in other expense. Credit card loan receivables are charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes 180 days contractually past due, except in the case of cardmember bankruptcies and probate accounts. Cardmember bankruptcies and probate accounts are charged off at the end of the month 60 days following the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death but not later than the 180-day contractual time frame. The net charge-off rate is calculated by dividing net charge-offs for the period by the average loan receivables for the period.    59    Table of Contents The following table presents amounts and rates of net charge-offs of loan receivables (dollars in thousands):                                    For the Three Months EndedAugust 31,     For the Nine Months EndedAugust 31,        2009     2008     2009     2008        $   %     $   %     $   %     $   %     Credit card loans   $ 514,186   8.48 %    $ 249,688   4.92 %    $ 1,458,988   7.63 %    $ 678,919   4.47 %    Other loans     20,926   3.56 %      2,156   1.01 %      45,910   3.07 %      2,676   0.58 %                                              Total net charge-offs   $ 535,112   8.05 %    $ 251,844   4.76 %    $ 1,504,898   7.30 %    $ 681,595   4.36 %                                             The net charge-off rate on our loan receivables increased 329 basis points and 294 basis points for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2009, respectively, as compared to the comparable prior year periods. The higher net charge-off rate was due to higher delinquencies beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008 and lower recovery rates, reflecting the weakening economic environment as a result of rising unemployment, declining housing prices and the decrease in the availability of consumer credit, as well as an increase in bankruptcy-related charge-offs.  Delinquencies  Delinquencies are an indicator of credit quality at any point in time. Loan balances are considered delinquent when contractual payments on the loan become 30 days past due. Loan receivables are placed on non-accrual status upon receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death of a cardmember, as part of certain collection management processes, and other instances in which management feels collectibility is not assured.  The following table presents the amounts and delinquency rates of loan receivables over 30 days past due, loan receivables over 90 days delinquent and accruing interest and loan receivables that are not accruing interest, regardless of delinquency (dollars in thousands):                        August 31,2009     November 30,2008        $   %     $   %     Loans over 30 days delinquent   $ 1,237,636   4.86 %    $ 1,096,627   4.35 %    Loans over 90 days delinquent and accruing interest   $ 524,875   2.06 %    $ 444,324   1.76 %    Loans not accruing interest   $ 218,543   0.86 %    $ 173,123   0.69 %   The delinquency rates of loans over 30 days delinquent and loans over 90 days delinquent and accruing interest increased 51 basis points and 30 basis points, respectively, at August 31, 2009, as compared to November 30, 2008. The increase in both measures reflected the impact of the weaker economic environment on our cardmembers’ ability to pay their loan balances. Delinquency rates normally rise as charge-offs rise, however, since the third quarter 2008, we have been experiencing a pattern of charge-offs rising faster than delinquencies. This pattern is the result of having a higher proportion of balances move from a delinquent status to charge-off than in historical periods. The movement from delinquent status to charge-off has increased as more cardmembers are unable to become current on their past-due accounts and as more cardmembers declare bankruptcy. Loan receivables not accruing interest at August 31, 2009 increased 17 basis points to 0.86%, as compared to November 30, 2008, as a result of an increase in bankruptcy notifications.    60    Table of Contents Other Income  The following table presents the components of other income for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):                                          For the ThreeMonths EndedAugust 31,     2009 vs. 2008increase(decrease)     For the NineMonths EndedAugust 31,     2009 vs. 2008increase(decrease)        2009     2008     $     %     2009     2008     $     %     Securitization income   $ 567,288     $ 629,046     $ (61,758 )    (10 %)    $ 1,310,435     $ 1,970,574     $ (660,139 )    (33 %)    Loan fee income     75,528       56,514       19,014     34 %      195,843       198,611       (2,768 )    (1 %)    Discount and interchange revenue(1)     51,641       41,480       10,161     24 %      208,802       158,899       49,903     31 %    Fee products     78,875       61,124       17,751     29 %      228,899       179,583       49,316     27 %    Merchant fees     10,716       16,183       (5,467 )    (34 %)      35,289       52,876       (17,587 )    (33 %)    Transaction processing revenue     31,839       31,085       754     2 %      93,309       87,444       5,865     7 %    Loss on investments     (7,422 )      (5,325 )      (2,097 )    39 %      (9,239 )      (37,789 )      28,550     (76 %)    Antitrust litigation settlement     472,167       —        472,167     100 %      1,419,783       —        1,419,783     100 %    Other income     35,328       45,014       (9,686 )    (22 %)      103,915       85,359       18,556     22 %                                                              Total other income   $ 1,315,960     $ 875,121     $ 440,839     50 %    $ 3,587,036     $ 2,695,557     $ 891,479     33 %                                                                 (1) Net of rewards, including Cashback Bonus rewards, of $173.8 million and $190.0 million for the three months ended August 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and $498.8 million and $521.1 million for the nine months ended August 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  Total other income increased $440.8 million, or 50%, for the three months ended August 31, 2009, as compared to the three months ended August 31, 2008, primarily as a result of $472.2 million in income related to the Visa and MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement, partially offset by lower securitization income. For the nine months ended August 31, 2009, total other income increased $891.5 million, or 33%, as compared to the nine months ended August 31, 2008, largely because of $1.4 billion in income related to the Visa and MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement, partially offset by lower securitization income. Discussion of these key drivers as well as other factors are discussed in more detail below.  Securitization Income  Securitization income is a significant source of our income and is derived through the securitization and continued servicing of a portion of the credit card loan receivables we originated. Currently, the issuance of asset-backed securities to investors has the effect of removing the owned loan receivables from our consolidated statements of financial condition. Also, portions of net interest income, provision for loan losses and certain components of other income related to the securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued are no longer reported in our statements of income; however, they remain significant factors in determining securitization income we receive on our residual interests in those transactions. We allocate the cash flows derived from interest and loan fee revenue and, in recent years, merchant discount and interchange revenue earned on securitized loans (see further discussion of merchant discount and interchange revenue below) to investors in securitizations. These cash flows are used to pay investors in the transactions a contractual rate of return on their investment, to reimburse investors for losses of principal resulting from charged-off loans, net of recoveries, and to pay us a contractual fee for servicing the securitized loans. Any excess cash flows, referred to as excess spread, are paid to us. Both servicing fees and excess spread are recorded in securitization income. Securitization income also includes the net revaluation of the interest-only strip receivable and certain other retained interests, reflecting adjustments to the fair values of the retained interests that result from changes in the level of securitized loans and assumptions used to value the retained interests.    61    Table of Contents In November 2004, we began allocating merchant discount and interchange revenue to any new securitization transaction completed in accordance with revisions to governing securitization documents. Prior thereto, we did not allocate merchant discount and interchange revenue to investors in securitizations. In July 2009, we began allocating merchant discount and interchange to all securitization transactions, regardless of whether the transactions were initiated before or after November 2004.  Beginning December 1, 2009, credit card loan receivables held by the securitization trusts and debt issued from those entities to third-party investors will be presented as assets and liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial condition, and our results of operations will no longer reflect securitization income, but will instead report interest income and provisions for loan losses associated with all managed loan receivables and interest expense associated with debt issued from the trusts to third-party investors. For more information, see “—Accounting Treatment for Off-Balance Sheet Securitizations.”  The table below presents the components of securitization income (dollars in thousands):                                          For the ThreeMonths EndedAugust 31,     2009 vs. 2008increase(decrease)     For the NineMonths EndedAugust 31,     2009 vs. 2008increase(decrease)        2009     2008     $     %     2009     2008     $     %     Excess spread   $ 379,934     $ 528,862     $ (148,928 )    (28 %)    $ 1,091,974     $ 1,573,192     $ (481,218 )    (31 %)    Servicing fees on securitized loans     123,878       139,592       (15,714 )    (11 %)      357,195       416,248       (59,053 )    (14 %)    Net revaluation of retained interests     68,880       (33,513 )      102,393     N M      (122,315 )      (2,989 )      (119,326 )    N M    Other (principally transaction costs)     (5,404 )      (5,895 )      491     8 %      (16,419 )      (15,877 )      (542 )    (3 %)                                                              Securitization income   $ 567,288     $ 629,046     $ (61,758 )    (10 %)    $ 1,310,435     $ 1,970,574     $ (660,139 )    (33 %)                                                             For the three months ended August 31, 2009, securitization income decreased $61.8 million, or 10%, as compared to the three months ended August 31, 2008. For the nine months ended August 31, 2009, securitization income decreased $660.1 million, or 33%, as compared to the nine months ended August 31, 2008. These decreases are primarily attributable to a lower excess spread on securitized loans and a decrease in the net revaluation of retained interests through the second quarter of 2009, which are detailed further in the tables and discussion below. For the three and nine months ended August 31, 2009, the level of average securitized loans was $3.4 billion and $3.8 billion lower than the comparable prior year periods as a result of maturing securitized loans coming back on-balance sheet.    62    Table of Contents Excess spread.

For the nine months ended August 31, 2009, excess spread on securitized loans decreased $481.2 million, or 31%, as compared to the nine months ended August 31, 2008. The decrease in both periods was partially attributable to higher net charge-offs due to the current economic environment. Additionally, lower other fee revenue on securitized loans, somewhat offset by lower servicing fees, were the result of the lower level of securitized loans.  Servicing fees on securitized loans. We are paid a servicing fee from the cash flows generated by the securitized loans. Servicing fees are paid to us for servicing the transferred loan receivables in accordance with contractual requirements. These cash flows include interest income and loan fee income and, effective with trust actions taken in July 2009, discount and interchange revenue for all securitized loans. For the three and nine months ended August 31, 2009, servicing fees decreased $15.7 million, or 11%, and $59.1 million, or 14%, respectively, from the prior year due to a lower level of securitized loans outstanding during the period.  Net revaluation of retained interests. The components of net revaluation of retained interests are summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands):                                   For the Three MonthsEnded August 31,     2009 vs. 2008increase(decrease)     For the Nine MonthsEnded August 31,     2009 vs. 2008increase(decrease)        2009   2008     $     2009     2008     $     Initial gain on new securitization transactions(1)   $ 7,887   $ 9,785     $ (1,898 )    $ 8,842     $ 71,872     $ (63,030 )    Revaluation of retained interests     60,993     (43,298 )      104,291       (131,157 )      (74,861 )      (56,296 )                                                    Net revaluation of retained interests   $ 68,880   $ (33,513 )    $ 102,393     $ (122,315 )    $ (2,989 )    $ (119,326 )                                                       (1) Net of issuance discounts, as applicable.    63    Table of Contents The net revaluation of retained interests for the three months ended August 31, 2009 increased $102.4 million, as compared to the three months ended August 31, 2008. For the three months ended August 31, 2009 we had $1.5 billion of new third-party securitization transactions, which resulted in an initial gain of $7.9 million. For the three months ended August 31, 2008, we had $1.2 billion of new third-party securitization transactions, which resulted in $9.8 million of initial gains. The favorable revaluation of retained interests of $61.0 million during the three months ended August 31, 2009 was largely related to changes in assumptions used to value the interest-only strip receivable, including higher anticipated interest income on standard balances, as compared to the unfavorable revaluation of $43.3 million during the three months ended August 31, 2008, which was due to unfavorable changes in assumptions used to value the interest-only strip receivable and lower projected excess spread.  The net revaluation of retained interests for the nine months ended August 31, 2009 decreased $119.3 million, as compared to the nine months ended August 31, 2008. For the nine months ended August 31, 2009 we had $2.3 billion of new third-party securitization transactions, which resulted in an initial gain of $8.8 million. For the nine months ended August 31, 2008, we had $5.6 billion of new third-party securitization transactions, resulting in $71.9 million of initial gains. The unfavorable revaluation of $131.2 million during the nine months ended August 31, 2009 was largely related to changes in assumptions used to value the interest-only strip receivable, including higher projected charge-offs. The unfavorable revaluation of $74.9 million during the nine months ended August 31, 2008 was largely related to net gain amortization associated with the maturity of securitization transactions.  Loan Fee Income  Loan fee income consists primarily of fees on credit card loans and includes late, over-limit, cash advance and other miscellaneous fees. Loan fee income increased $19.0 million, or 34%, for the three months ended August 31, 2009, as compared to the three months ended August 31, 2008, due to increased income from late fees. Loan fee income decreased $2.7 million, or 1%, for the nine months ended August 31, 2009, as compared to the nine months ended August 31, 2008, as a result of deferring balance transfer fee income beginning in the second quarter of 2008, historically accounted for in loan fee income, partially offset by higher late fees.  Discount and Interchange Revenue  Discount and interchange revenue includes discount revenue and acquirer interchange net of interchange paid to third-party issuers in the United States. We earn discount revenue from fees charged to merchants with whom we have entered into card acceptance agreements for processing cardholder purchase transactions and acquirer interchange revenue from merchant acquirers on all Discover Network card transactions made by cardholders at merchants with whom merchant acquirers have entered into card acceptance agreements for processing cardholder purchase transactions. We incur an interchange cost to card issuing entities that have entered into contractual arrangements to issue cards on the Discover Network. This cost is contractually established and is based on the card issuing organization’s transaction volume and is reported as a reduction to discount and interchange revenue. We offer our cardmembers various reward programs, including the Cashback Bonus reward program, pursuant to which we pay certain cardmembers a percentage of their purchase amounts based on the type and volume of the cardmember’s purchases. Reward costs are recorded as a reduction to discount and interchange revenue.  Discount and interchange revenue increased $10.2 million, or 24%, and $49.9 million, or 31%, for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2009, respectively, compared to the three and nine months ended August 31, 2008. These increases were primarily attributable to higher revenues earned on a higher level of owned loans in the nine months ended August 31, 2009 as compared to the nine months ended August 31, 2008. Additionally, rewards costs were lower for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2009 as compared to the three and nine months ended August 31, 2008, due to a decline in sales volume partially offset by adjustments made in the third quarter of 2008 to the rewards liability for an increase in expected forfeitures of accumulated rewards.    64    Table of Contents Fee Products  We earn revenue related to fees received for selling ancillary credit-related products and services including debt deferment/debt cancellation and identity theft protection services to cardmembers. The amount of revenue recorded is generally based on a percentage of a cardmember’s outstanding balance or a flat fee and is recognized over the agreement or contract period as earned. Fee products income increased $17.8 million, or 29%, and $49.3 million, or 27%, for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2009, respectively, as compared to the three and nine months ended August 31, 2008, primarily related to an increase in the number of cardmembers that purchased these products and services as well as higher balances upon which the fees are based.  Loss on Investments  During the three and nine months ended August 31, 2009, we recorded a $7.4 million and a $8.2 million other-than-temporary impairment, respectively, related to our investment in the asset-backed commercial paper notes of Golden Key U.S. LLC, which invested in mortgage-backed securities. In comparison, the three and nine months ended August 31, 2008 reflected a $5.3 million and $36.6 million other-than-temporary impairment, respectively. See additional information on other-than-temporary-impairments recorded in the consolidated statements of income in Note 3: Investment Securities.  Antitrust Litigation Settlement  Amounts received in conjunction with the Visa and MasterCard antitrust litigation settlement, including related interest, are recorded in this line item when earned. We received payments of $472 million in each of the first three quarters of 2009 from Visa as payment in part for its portion of the settlement and accrued $4.2 million during the first three quarters of 2009 in related interest income. See additional information in “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Special Dividend and Settlement of Visa and MasterCard Antitrust Litigation.” We entered into an agreement with Morgan Stanley at the time of our spin-off to give us sole control over the prosecution and settlement of the litigation and to determine how proceeds from the litigation would be shared. We have notified Morgan Stanley that it breached the agreement and the amount due to Morgan Stanley, if any, is a matter of dispute. The dispute is a subject of litigation between the parties. See “Part II. Other Information—Item 1. Legal Proceedings.”  Other Income  Other income includes revenues from the sale of merchant portfolios to third-party acquirers, royalty revenues earned by Diners Club, revenues from the referral of declined applications to certain third-party issuers on the Discover Network, unrealized gains and losses related to derivative contracts and other miscellaneous revenue items. Other income was down $9.7 million for the three months ended August 31, 2009 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2008, due to lower gains on sales of merchant portfolios and lower revenues from the referral of declined applications to third-party issuers. Other income increased $18.6 million for the nine months ended August 31, 2009 compared to August 31, 2008 due to the inclusion of approximately $58.6 million of revenue from Diners Club in the nine months ended August 31, 2009 compared to only $12.6 million in the prior period, as we acquired Diners Club on June 30, 2008. The increase in the nine months ended August 31, 2009 was partially offset by lower gains on sales of merchant portfolios and lower revenues from the referral of declined applications to third-party issuers.    65    Table of Contents Other Expense  The following table represents the components of other expense for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):                                      For the ThreeMonths EndedAugust 31,   2009 vs. 2008increase(decrease)     For the NineMonths EndedMay 31,   2009 vs. 2008increase(decrease)        2009   2008   $     %     2009   2008   $     %     Employee compensation and benefits   $ 208,528   $ 222,426   $ (13,898 )    (6 %)    $ 636,167   $ 658,086   $ (21,919 )    (3 %)    Marketing and business development     77,814     137,928     (60,114 )    (44 %)      292,169     411,519     (119,350 )    (29 %)    Information processing and communications     67,679     76,675     (8,996 )    (12 %)      217,017     234,400     (17,383 )    (7 %)    Professional fees     83,746     82,775     971     1 %      228,419     237,839     (9,420 )    (4 %)    Premises and equipment     18,437     20,274     (1,837 )    (9 %)      54,732     59,718     (4,986 )    (8 %)    Other expense     67,634     72,469     (4,835 )    (7 %)      215,085     220,153     (5,068 )    (2 %)                                                      Total other expense   $ 523,838   $ 612,547   $ (88,709 )    (14 %)    $ 1,643,589   $ 1,821,715   $ (178,126 )    (10 %)                                                     Total other expense decreased $88.7 million, or 14%, for the three months ended August 31, 2009, as compared to the three months ended August 31, 2008 and decreased $178.1 million, or 10%, for the nine months ended August 31, 2009, as compared to the nine months ended August 31, 2008. The decrease in both periods was primarily driven by lower marketing, compensation and information processing expenses, partially offset by the inclusion of $14.5 million and $30.8 million, respectively, of Diners Club expenses and the impact of a $20 million one-time expense related to a reduction in headcount. A reduction in new account acquisition effectively drove lower marketing expense as well as declines in other expense related to postage, supplies and credit bureau inquiry fees. Employee compensation and benefits expenses decreased as a result of lower discretionary expenses. Information processing and communications expenses declined due to lower data processing projects and lower telecommunication expenses.  Income Tax Expense  The following table reconciles our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate:                        For the Three Months EndedAugust 31,     For the Nine Months EndedAugust 31,        2009     2008     2009     2008     U.S. federal statutory income tax rate   35.0 %    35.0 %    35.0 %    35.0 %    U.S. state and local income taxes and other, net of U.S. federal income tax benefits   3.5     3.4     3.4     3.2     State examinations and settlements   —      (3.9 )    —      (1.1 )    Valuation allowance—capital loss   —      —      1.5     —      Nondeductible compensation   0.1     —      0.5     —      Other   —      0.2     —      0.4                               Effective income tax rate   38.6 %    34.7 %    40.4 %    37.5 %                             In the second quarter of 2009, we recorded a valuation allowance of $23.7 million against deferred tax assets largely related to our assessment of the likelihood that the tax benefit of capital losses related to the sale of the Goldfish business in 2008 is no longer realizable. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2009, we recorded approximately $8 million of tax expense related to nondeductible stock-based compensation. These items resulted in additional tax expense for the nine months ended August 31, 2009.    66    Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources  We monitor and review liquidity and capital management strategies seeking to maintain prudent levels of each. Our senior management reviews financial performance relative to these strategies, monitors the availability of alternative financing sources, evaluates liquidity risk and capital adequacy, and assesses the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. Our liquidity and funding risk management strategies are designed to mitigate the risk that we may be unable to access adequate financing to fund our business and service our financial obligations when they come due. Liquidity risk is addressed through various funding criteria and targets that guide our access to the long-term and short-term debt and equity capital markets and various deposit distribution channels, the maturity profile of our liabilities, the diversity of our funding sources and investor base, as well as the level of our liquidity reserve.  Liquidity risk is assessed by several measures including our maturity profile. The maturities of the various funding instruments are reviewed during the funding planning and execution process to ensure the maturities are appropriately staggered. The mix of funding sources and the composition of our investor base are also reviewed during the funding process to assess whether there is appropriate diversification. Our primary funding sources include deposits (sourced directly or through brokers), term asset-backed securitizations, asset-backed commercial paper conduit financing and long-term borrowings.  Certain of our borrowing costs and the ability to raise funds in specific ratings sensitive markets are directly impacted by our credit ratings. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The credit ratings of Discover Financial Services, Discover Bank and the trusts through which we access the securitization markets are reflected in the table below:                               DiscoverFinancialServices   DiscoverBank   Outlookfor SeniorUnsecuredDebt   Discover CardMaster Trust I(2)     Discover Card ExecutionNote Trust(2)        SeniorUnsecuredDebt   SeniorUnsecuredDebt     Class A   Class B     Class A   Class B     Class C     Moody’s Investors Service   Ba1   Baa3   Negative   Aaa   A2     Aaa   A2     Baa2     Standard & Poor’s   BBB-   BBB   Stable   AAA   AA     AAA   AA     A-     Fitch Ratings   BBB   BBB   Negative   AAA   A+ (1)    AAA   A+ (1)    BBB (1)       (1) Currently on ratings watch positive after our actions related to the trusts. See “—Funding Sources—Securitization Financing” below for more detail.    (2) Ratings are for outstanding issuances of asset-backed securities issued by the trusts. On September 25, 2009, Moody’s Investor Service announced that it will likely place under review for downgrade the ratings of certain outstanding issuances of triple-A credit card asset-backed securities if the FDIC has not provided clarity with regard to its existing guidance on standards for legal isolation of the transferred assets at the time that FASB Statements No. 166 and 167 go into effect, which for us is December 1, 2009. See “—Funding Sources—Securitization Financing” below for more detail regarding the uncertainty over the FDIC guidance.  We maintain a process designed to evaluate our liquidity position and our vulnerabilities to disruptions in our funding markets. This process results in contingency funding plans that model a range of potential cash outflows during a liquidity stress event, including, but not limited to: (i) repayment of all debt maturing within an assumed stress period; (ii) expected funding requirements from receivable maintenance, growth and/or volatility; and (iii) customer cash withdrawals from interest-bearing deposits. Other potential liquidity stress events which are related to our securitization structures are described in “—Funding Sources—Securitization Financing.” Our contingency funding plans are designed to evaluate both short-term liquidity stress as well as a prolonged liquidity stress event. In a liquidity stress event, we would seek to increase deposits, liquidate investments and use contingent funding sources to meet our liquidity needs. At August 31, 2009, our contingent funding sources included approximately $10.6 billion in our liquidity reserve (primarily invested in amounts on deposit with the Federal Reserve, highly rated certificates of deposit, and triple-A rated government mutual funds), $1.5 billion of unutilized commitments from third-party asset-backed commercial paper conduits and $2.4 billion of unsecured committed credit. We increased our liquidity reserve by approximately $1.6 billion since the second quarter, in    67    Table of Contents  anticipation of approximately $17.7 billion of asset-backed securities and deposit maturities in 2010. In addition to these contingent sources, at August 31, 2009, we also had $6.4 billion of available capacity through the Federal Reserve discount window, which includes access to $3.2 billion through the Federal Reserve Term Auction Facility.  We continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet with appropriate levels of capital and liquidity to fund operations. For the third quarter of 2009, we funded our business operations by utilizing multiple funding sources described in further detail below, relying primarily on direct-to-consumer deposit issuance and capital market transactions. Over the next 12 months, we expect to be able to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund business activities through access to our funding sources, relying primarily on deposit issuance. In the event that existing access to deposit channels and/or access to capital markets becomes disrupted during the next 12 months, we believe that we would be able to satisfy all maturing obligations and fund business operations during that time by utilizing our contingent funding sources, including our liquidity reserve, remaining asset-backed commercial paper conduit capacity, committed credit facility capacity and Federal Reserve discount window capacity.  While we potentially have access through March 2010 to an additional $10.2 billion of issuances of asset-backed securities through the TALF program, uncertainty over existing FDIC guidance regarding standards for legal isolation of the transferred assets following the change in accounting rules under FASB Statements No. 166 and 167 has recently made it difficult or impossible to obtain the required ratings for securities of our securitization trusts to qualify as eligible securities under the TALF program. Therefore, we do not expect our securitization trusts to be able to issue securities under the TALF program until this uncertainty is resolved. See “—Funding Sources—Securitization Financing.”  U.S. Treasury Capital Purchase Program. On March 13, 2009, we issued and sold to the U.S. Treasury 1,224,558 shares of senior preferred stock and a ten-year warrant to purchase 20,500,413 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $8.96 per share, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.2 billion. The issuance is part of the U.S. Treasury’s Troubled Asset Relief Program (“TARP”) Capital Purchase Program (“CPP”), under which the U.S. Treasury purchased senior preferred stock and warrants in eligible institutions to increase the flow of credit to businesses and consumers and to support the economy.  The senior preferred stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital and pays a cumulative dividend at the rate of five percent per annum for the first five years and at the rate of nine percent per annum beginning May 15, 2014. The senior preferred stock is generally non-voting, other than class voting rights on certain matters that could amend the rights of or adversely affect the stock. The terms of the senior preferred stock provide that the stock may not be redeemed, as opposed to repurchased, prior to May 15, 2012 unless we have received aggregate gross proceeds from one or more qualified equity offerings (as described below) of at least $306 million. In such a case, we may redeem the senior preferred stock, in whole or in part, subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve, upon notice, up to a maximum amount equal to the aggregate net cash proceeds received by us from such qualified equity offerings. A “qualified equity offering” is a sale and issuance for cash by us, to persons other than us or our subsidiaries after March 13, 2009, of shares of perpetual preferred stock, common stock or a combination thereof, that in each case qualify as Tier 1 capital at the time of issuance under the applicable risk-based capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve. On or after May 15, 2012, the senior preferred stock may be redeemed by us at any time, in whole or in part, subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve and notice requirements.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to a letter agreement between us and the U.S. Treasury, we are permitted, after obtaining the approval of the Federal Reserve, to repay the senior preferred stock at any time, and when such senior preferred stock is repaid, the U.S. Treasury is required to liquidate the warrant, all in accordance with The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, as it may be amended from time to time (“ARRA”), and any rules and regulations thereunder.  The U.S. Treasury may transfer the senior preferred stock to a third party at any time. The U.S. Treasury may only transfer or exercise an aggregate of one half of the shares of common stock underlying the warrant    68    Table of Contents  prior to the earlier of the redemption of all of the shares of senior preferred stock and December 31, 2009. Participation in the CPP restricts our ability to increase dividends on our common stock above historical levels or to repurchase our common stock until three years have elapsed, unless (i) all of the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S Treasury is redeemed, (ii) all of the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S Treasury has been transferred to third parties, or (iii) we receive the consent of the U.S. Treasury.  Participation in the CPP subjects us to increased oversight by the U.S. Treasury and banking regulators. The U.S. Treasury has the power to unilaterally amend the terms of the purchase agreement to the extent required to comply with changes in applicable federal law and to inspect our corporate books and records through our federal banking regulators. In addition, the U.S. Treasury has the right to appoint two directors to our board if we miss dividend payments for six dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, on the preferred stock. Participation in the CPP also subjects us to increased Congressional scrutiny.  In connection with participating in the CPP, we became a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 and a financial holding company under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Registration as a bank holding company subjects us to new legal and regulatory requirements, including minimum capital requirements, and subjects us to oversight, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve.  We are also subject to certain restrictions on executive compensation for our senior executive officers and the next 20 most highly compensated employees under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, as amended (the “EESA”). Our “senior executive officers” for this purpose include our chief executive officer, chief financial officer and the three most highly compensated executive officers other than the chief executive officer and chief financial officer. We agreed that for such time as the U.S. Treasury continues to own any of our securities under the CPP, we will take all necessary action to ensure that our compensation and other benefit plans with respect to our senior executive officers and certain other employees comply with EESA restrictions relating to executive compensation, which include (i) limits on compensation and incentives to take unnecessary and excessive risks that would threaten the value of the company, (ii) a provision for recovery (i.e., clawback) of amounts of compensation that later prove to have been based on materially inaccurate financial statements or other performance metrics, and (iii) limitations on golden parachute payments. Furthermore, on June 10, 2009, the U.S. Treasury issued interim final rules implementing the compensation and corporate governance requirements under ARRA, which amended the requirements of EESA. For additional information, see “—Legislative and Regulatory Developments—Treasury Rules Governing Compensation for Troubled Asset Relief Program Participants.” Additionally, we may not deduct for federal income tax purposes executive compensation of our senior executive officers in excess of $500,000 per year, which includes any portion of their stock-based deferred compensation earned after our participation in TARP.  Equity Capital Management. Management views equity capital as an important source of financial strength. We determine the level of capital necessary to support our business based on our managed loan receivables, goodwill and other intangible assets, taking into account, among other things, regulatory requirements, rating agency guidelines and internally managed requirements to sustain growth.  Equity increased to $8.4 billion at August 31, 2009 from $5.9 billion at November 30, 2008. Our capital level has been positively impacted by the closing of our transaction under the CPP in March 2009 described above. In addition to CPP, in the third quarter 2009 we completed a $534 million common stock offering in which we issued approximately 60 million shares at a price of $8.89 after subtracting underwriter discounts and commissions. The level of capital throughout 2008 and 2009 has also been positively impacted by the Visa and Master Card antitrust litigation settlement more fully described below.  Under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”), the Federal Reserve and other bank regulatory agencies, we must maintain minimum levels of capital that are dependent upon the risk of the financial institution’s assets. These requirements are more fully described in Note 13: Capital Adequacy to the consolidated financial statements. At August 31, 2009, Discover Financial Services and Discover Bank exceeded the regulatory minimums to which they were subject.    69    Table of Contents Dividends. Our Board of Directors declared a common stock cash dividend of $.02 per share in September 2009, payable on October 22, to holders of record on October 1. The quarterly common stock dividend was reduced from $.06 per share to $.02 per share in the first quarter of 2009 in order to enhance our capital position. This reduction to $.02 per share has strengthened our capital base by approximately $20 million per quarter. The declaration and payment of future dividends, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, capital levels, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends in the future. In addition, as a result of applicable banking law regulations and guidance and provisions that may be contained in our borrowing agreements or the borrowing agreements of our subsidiaries, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders may be further limited. Under the terms of our CPP transaction, we are prohibited from increasing dividends on our common stock above historical levels ($.06 per share) until March 2012 unless (i) all of the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury is redeemed, (ii) all of the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury has been transferred to third parties, or (iii) we receive the consent of the U.S. Treasury. Furthermore, so long as any of the preferred stock is outstanding, dividend payments on our common stock will be prohibited unless all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on such preferred stock.  Also in the third quarter of 2009, we accrued $15 million of dividends on our senior preferred stock issued under the CPP, which represents a rate of 5% per year.  Special Dividend and Settlement of Visa and MasterCard Antitrust Litigation. On October 27, 2008, we settled our antitrust litigation with Visa and MasterCard for $2.75 billion. We received a lump sum amount of $862.5 million from MasterCard in the fourth quarter of 2008 and $472 million from Visa in each of the first, second and third quarters of 2009, which we recorded in other income in the U.S. Card segment. We expect to earn the last payment of $472 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. At the time of our spin-off, we entered into an agreement with Morgan Stanley to give us sole control over the prosecution and settlement of the antitrust lawsuit with Visa and MasterCard and to determine how proceeds from the litigation would be shared. As a result, we have incurred an obligation to accrue amounts pursuant to the special dividend agreement with respect to settlement proceeds from Visa and MasterCard only to the extent that we have already earned and received such proceeds pursuant to the terms of the settlement with Visa and MasterCard as of the balance sheet date. During the third quarter of 2009 we accrued $140.3 million in connection with the special dividend agreement, which brought the total amount accrued in our consolidated statement of financial condition as of August 31, 2009 to $653.5 million. We have notified Morgan Stanley that Morgan Stanley breached the special dividend agreement and the amount due to Morgan Stanley, if any, is a matter of dispute. The dispute is a subject of litigation between the parties. See “Part II. Other Information—Item 1. Legal Proceedings.”  Stock Repurchase Program. On December 3, 2007, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of our outstanding shares of common stock under a new share repurchase program. This share repurchase program expires on November 30, 2010, and may be terminated at any time. At August 31, 2009, we had not repurchased any stock under this program. Under the terms of our CPP transaction, we are prohibited from repurchasing our common stock until March 2012, except in connection with the administration of an employee benefit plan in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, unless (i) all of the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury is redeemed, (ii) all of the senior preferred stock issued to the U.S. Treasury has been transferred to third parties, or (iii) we receive the consent of the U.S. Treasury. Furthermore, so long as any of the preferred stock issued under the CPP is outstanding, we may not repurchase any of our shares of common stock unless all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on such preferred stock.    70    Table of Contents Impact of FASB Statements No. 166 and 167. The trusts used in the securitizations currently are not consolidated on our financial statements for reporting purposes because the trusts are qualifying special purpose entities under FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, as amended. In June 2009, the FASB issued Statements No. 166 and 167 which will be effective for us on December 1, 2009. These statements will require us to consolidate the securitization trusts on our balance sheet, which will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and our regulatory capital. For further discussion, see “—Accounting Treatment for Off-Balance Sheet Securitizations” above. For a further discussion of the regulatory capital impact, see “—Funding Sources—Securitization Financing.”  Funding Sources  Deposits. We utilize deposits to diversify funding sources and to reduce our reliance on short-term credit sensitive funding sources, thus enhancing our liquidity position. We obtain our deposits through two channels: (i) products offered directly to consumers through direct mail, internet origination and affinity relationships, including certificates of deposit, money market accounts and online savings accounts; and (ii) contractual arrangements with securities brokerage firms, which place deposits with their customers and other brokerage firms. We currently utilize five of the largest securities brokerage firms to obtain deposit funding through distribution of our certificates of deposit to their customers. Four of these five brokerage firms have external selling group capability, which allows them to distribute deposits through other brokerage firms. We have elected to use the selling group capabilities of these brokerage firms to increase our deposit gathering capabilities.  Our certificates of deposit have maturities ranging from one month to fifteen years, and had a weighted average maturity of 26 months at August 31, 2009. Total interest-bearing deposits at August 31, 2009 were $29.5 billion, the remaining maturities of which are summarized in the following table (dollars in thousands):                           Total   Three Monthsor Less   Over ThreeMonthsThrough SixMonths   Over SixMonthsThroughTwelveMonths   Over TwelveMonths   Certificates of deposit in amounts less than $100,000(1)   $ 22,096,073   $ 1,312,154   $ 1,391,181   $ 4,322,693   $ 15,070,045   Certificates of deposit in amounts of $100,000(1) or greater     3,135,241     319,171     360,756     1,027,188     1,428,126   Savings deposits, including money market deposit accounts     4,237,745     4,237,745     —      —      —                                    Total interest-bearing deposits   $ 29,469,059   $ 5,869,070   $ 1,751,937   $ 5,349,881   $ 16,498,171                                      (1) Represents the basic insurance amount covered by the FDIC. Effective May 20, 2009, a standard insurance amount of $250,000 per depositor is in effect through December 31, 2013.  Securitization Financing. Historically, we have used the securitization of credit card receivables as one of our largest sources of funding, including both the public securitization market and the privately placed asset-backed commercial paper conduit financing market.  From 2008 into 2009, market events and capital market disruptions had made the securitization market unavailable at volumes and pricing that would be attractive to us. In November 2008, the Federal Reserve announced the launch of the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, in an effort to facilitate the issuance of asset-backed securities by offering financing on relatively favorable terms. On August 17, 2009, the Federal Reserve extended the TALF program from December 31, 2009 to March 31, 2010. Under the TALF extension, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York will lend funds on a non-recourse basis to holders of certain triple-A rated asset-backed securities, including newly issued credit-card backed securities, in an amount up to    71    Table of Contents  the total amount of maturities of a particular issuer through March 31, 2010. Through the TALF program, DCENT issued its first TALF-eligible transaction on July 14, 2009 for $1.5 billion with a three year term. DCENT issued a second TALF-eligible transaction on September 11, 2009 for $1.3 billion with a three year term.  While we potentially have access through March 2010 to an additional $10.2 billion of issuances of asset-backed securities through the TALF program, uncertainty over existing FDIC guidance regarding standards for legal isolation of the transferred assets following the change in accounting rules under FASB Statements No. 166 and 167 has recently made it difficult or impossible to obtain the required ratings for securities of our securitization trusts to qualify as eligible securities under the TALF program. The triple-A rating of DCENT Class A Notes issued to date has been based, in part, on the FDIC’s rule entitled “Treatment by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as Conservator or Receiver of Financial Assets Transferred by an Insured Depository Institution in Connection with a Securitization or Participation” (the “FDIC Rule”), which provides that the FDIC will not seek to reclaim or recover assets transferred in connection with a securitization, or recharacterize them as assets of the insured depository institution, provided such transfer meets the conditions for sale accounting treatment under GAAP. Pursuant to FASB Statements No. 166 and 167, effective December 1, 2009, the transfer of assets made to the Discover Card Master Trust I (“DCMT”) and DCENT will no longer qualify for sale accounting treatment. Consequently, there is uncertainty in the securitization market as to how the FDIC will treat assets transferred into securitization vehicles under FASB Statements No. 166 and 167. Citing this uncertainty, Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s have recently announced that they will not provide a triple-A rating to securities issued by certain securitization structures until the FDIC has provided clarity with respect to the FDIC Rule. As securities issued in connection with the TALF program are required to have triple-A ratings from at least two of the nationally recognized rating agencies, we do not expect our securitization trusts to be able to issue securities through TALF until this uncertainty around the FDIC Rule has been resolved. We expect that this uncertainty will also prevent us from issuing asset-backed securities outside of the TALF program until it has been resolved.  Further, the criteria for issuances of asset-backed securities eligible for funding under the TALF program continue to evolve and we cannot be certain that we would be able to meet such criteria in the future. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York recently introduced a formal risk assessment process for all proposed issuances of non-mortgage asset-backed securities beginning in November. The process will involve Federal Reserve review of proposed issuances to determine whether they meet standards related to credit quality, transparency and simplicity of structure.  The securitization trusts we use to securitize our credit card loan receivables are not consolidated with our financial statements, but will be on December 1, 2009. See “—Accounting Treatment for Off-Balance Sheet Securitizations” for more information. Securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued generally are accounted for as sold and, accordingly, are removed from our consolidated statements of financial condition. Generally we securitize between approximately 50% and 60% of our managed credit card loan receivables. Outstanding public and private asset-backed commercial paper conduit financing, including issuances to related parties, at August 31, 2009 was $22.4 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. At August 31, 2009, we had $1.5 billion in unused asset-backed commercial paper conduit capacity.  The following table summarizes expected maturities of the investors’ interests in securitizations at August 31, 2009 (dollars in thousands):                           Total   Less ThanOne Year   One YearThroughThree Years   Four YearsThroughFive Years   After FiveYears   Scheduled maturities of the investors’ interests in securitizations   $ 25,086,474   $ 11,579,646   $ 7,960,822   $ 4,465,759   $ 1,080,247  We access the public asset-backed securitization market through DCMT and, since July 26, 2007, DCENT, using receivables generated by our U.S. Card business. Through DCMT we have used a structure utilizing    72    Table of Contents  Class A, triple-A rated certificates and Class B, single-A rated certificates held by third parties, with credit enhancement provided by the subordinated Class B certificates, a cash collateral account and a more subordinated Series 2009-CE certificate that we retain. DCENT consists of four classes of securities, (Class A, B, C and D) with the most senior class generally receiving a triple-A rating. In this structure, in order to issue senior, higher rated classes of notes, it is necessary to obtain the appropriate amount of credit enhancement, generally through the issuance of junior, lower rated or more highly subordinated classes of notes. In the first half of 2009, substantially all of the securities issued by the securitization trusts were placed on ratings watch with negative outlooks by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s rating agencies. In the third quarter 2009, we completed the following initiatives primarily to address the trusts’ ratings watches:        •    Issuance of DiscoverSeries Class D (2009-1) note from DCENT that adds 6.5% credit enhancement to all outstanding notes of the DiscoverSeries and that would be available to support new issuances of DiscoverSeries notes through increases in the stated principal amount. On August 31, 2009, the stated principal amount of the Class D notes was approximately $651 million, which was approximately 6.5% of the then outstanding notes of DCENT including the Class D notes. A wholly-owned subsidiary of Discover Bank acquired the DCENT Class D issuance.        •    Issuance of Series 2009-CE from DCMT provides credit enhancement to DCMT investor certificates. This subordinate series supports all outstanding series of DCMT other than Series 2007-CC (which enables issuance of the DCENT notes, for which the DiscoverSeries Class D notes are being issued). The stated principal amount of this subordinate series was approximately $1 billion, which is equivalent to 6.5% of the series investor interests, including the subordinate series. DCMT Series 1996-4, which had lower initial levels of credit enhancement, received additional credit enhancement through the subordinate series in an amount bringing its enhancement levels in line with other comparable series of DCMT certificates. The DCMT Series 2009-CE investor certificates were acquired by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Discover Bank.        •    On July 31, 2009, DCMT began to allocate to Series 1996-4, Series 2003-3 and Series 2003-4, Subseries 2 their proportionate share of the interchange allocated to DCMT. These series, which were issued before Discover Bank began transferring interchange to DCMT, previously did not receive any allocation of interchange. The remaining 14 series of DCMT investor certificates already received allocations of interchange. This change eliminates the difference between group excess spread and interchange sub-group excess spread and causes these three older series to have allocations consistent with those for all DCMT securities issued during or after 2004.  In addition to the actions undertaken to maintain credit ratings, in September 2009 we issued Series 2009-SD from DCMT to enhance excess spread for all outstanding series of investor certificates and tranches of DiscoverSeries notes. Series 2009-SD makes all of its principal collections available for reallocation on an as-needed basis to all outstanding series (including the DiscoverSeries) to cover shortfalls in interest and servicing fees and to reimburse charge-offs for those other series. The availability of these principal collections increases excess spread levels for DCMT and for the DiscoverSeries notes. The Series 2009-SD interest will remain equal to approximately 2.0% of the total investors’ interests in DCMT and DCENT at any time, and is scheduled to mature in December 2011. However, it may mature earlier with rating agency consent or it may be extended in accordance with its terms. The DCMT Series 2009-SD investor certificates were acquired by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Discover Bank.  These trust actions resulted in all of the negative ratings watches of our trusts’ ratings being removed and such ratings being either affirmed or upgraded. The trust actions also resulted in approximately $1.65 billion of seller’s interest as of August 31, 2009, included in loans receivable on our consolidated statements of financial condition, being recharacterized as held-to-maturity investment securities, and accordingly, a reduction to the allowance for loan losses of approximately $119.3 million. Additionally, these trust actions resulted in the Company and Discover Bank being required to include the assets of the trusts, exclusive of any retained interests held on-balance sheet, in our regulatory capital calculations beginning in the third quarter 2009. Although this inclusion for regulatory capital purposes reduces the capital ratios of the Company and Discover Bank, the capital ratios of the Company and    73    Table of Contents  Discover Bank continue to remain above the well-capitalized levels. See additional detail on our capital amounts and ratios in Note 13: Capital Adequacy to our consolidated financial statements.  At August 31, 2009, we had triple-A rated note issuance capacity of $2.7 billion in DCENT. In order to maintain this level of triple-A rated note issuance capacity, we have purchased approximately $1.1 billion principal amount of subordinated notes issued by DCENT, which are classified as available-for-sale investment securities for accounting purposes. On September 1, 2009, we issued $0.4 billion of additional subordinated notes, which increased our triple-A rated note issuance capacity to $5.0 billion. On September 11, 2009, we issued $1.3 billion of triple-A notes eligible for funding under TALF, decreasing our triple-A rated note issuance availability to $3.7 billion. The capacity of our securitization trusts to issue triple-A rated securities is subject to resolution of uncertainty around the FDIC Rule as described above. In the future, we may purchase additional subordinated notes to increase our triple-A rated note issuance capacity.  As of August 31, 2009, the balance of cash collateral account loans on which we provided funding was $939.7 million and is recorded in amounts due from asset securitization in our consolidated statement of financial condition at its fair value of $913.1 million. A majority of this funding was obtained through a loan facility entered into between a consolidated special purpose subsidiary, DRFC Funding LLC, and third-party lenders. At August 31, 2009, $593.2 million of the DRFC Funding LLC loan facility remains outstanding and is recorded in long-term borrowings in our consolidated statement of financial condition. Repayment of this loan facility is secured by $889.7 million of cash collateral account loans at August 31, 2009.  The following table summarizes estimated maturities of the cash collateral accounts at August 31, 2009 (dollars in thousands):                          Total   Less ThanOne Year   One YearThroughThree Years   Four YearsThroughFive Years   After FiveYears   Scheduled maturities of cash collateral accounts   $ 939,737   $ 428,947   $ 363,158   $ 147,632   —   The securitization structures include certain features designed to protect investors that could result in earlier than expected repayment of the underlying securities, accelerating the need for alternative funding. The primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements, the insufficiency of which triggers early repayment of the securities. We refer to this as “economic early amortization,” which is based on excess spread levels. Excess spread is the amount by which income received by a trust during a collection period, including interest collections, fees and interchange, exceeds the fees and expenses of the trust during such collection period, including interest expense, servicing fees and charged-off receivables. In the event of an economic early amortization, which would occur if the excess spread falls below 0% for a contractually specified period, generally a three-month rolling average, the receivables that otherwise would have been subsequently purchased by the trust from us would instead continue to be recognized on our consolidated statement of financial condition since the cash flows generated in the trust would instead be used to repay investors in the asset-backed securities. As of August 31, 2009, no economic early amortization events have occurred. The tables below provide information concerning investors’ interests and related excess spreads at August 31, 2009 (dollars in thousands):                 Investors’Interests   # of SeriesOutstanding   DCMT interchange series   $ 15,070,431   17   DCMT non-interchange series (1)     —    —                Discover Card Master Trust I     15,070,431   17   Discover Card Execution Note Trust (DiscoverSeries notes)     10,016,043   22               Total investors’ interests   $ 25,086,474   39                  (1) Effective July 31, 2009, all DCMT certificates and all notes issued by DCENT include cash flows derived from merchant discount and interchange revenue earned by Discover Card.    74    Table of Contents            3-Month RollingAverage ExcessSpread(1)     Group excess spread percentage (2)   5.37 %    Interchange Subgroup excess spread percentage (2)   6.44 %    DiscoverSeries excess spread percentage   5.27 %       (1) DCMT certificates refer to the higher of the Group and Interchange Subgroup excess spreads shown above, as well as their applicable series excess spreads, in assessing whether an economic early amortization has occurred. DiscoverSeries notes refer to the higher of the Group, Interchange Subgroup and DiscoverSeries excess spreads shown above in assessing whether an economic early amortization has occurred.    (2) The three-month rolling average group excess spread for DCMT includes one monthly rate containing the performance of series not allocated merchant discount and interchange revenue. Beginning with the month ended September 30, 2009, the three-month average Group excess spread and Interchange Subgroup excess spread will be the same.  An additional aspect of our securitization structure is a requirement that we accumulate principal collections into a reserve account in the amount of scheduled maturities on a pro rata basis over the 12 months prior to a security’s maturity date. We have the option under our securitization documents to shorten this accumulation period, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including reaffirmation from each of the rating agencies of the security’s required rating. Historically, we have exercised this option to shorten the accumulation period to one month prior to maturity. If we were to determine that the payment rate on the underlying receivables would not support a one-month accumulation period, or if one or more of the rating agencies were to require an accumulation period of longer than one month, we would need to begin accumulating principal cash flows earlier than we have historically. We do not believe that an inability to shorten the accumulation period would materially impact our ability to execute our liquidity management strategies.  Long-Term Borrowings and Bank Notes. At August 31, 2009, we had $1.2 billion principal amount of senior notes outstanding. In the third quarter 2009, we issued a ten-year $400 million senior unsecured note with a fixed interest rate of 10.25% that matures in July 2019. In addition to this new senior note issuance, we had $400 million principal amount of floating rate senior unsecured outstanding, which mature in June 2010, and $400 million fixed rate senior notes outstanding that mature in June 2017. In October 2008, the FDIC established the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (the “TLGP”) pursuant to which the FDIC will guarantee the timely payment of interest and principal on certain newly-issued senior unsecured debt of eligible entities issued on or before October 31, 2009. Discover Bank has opted into the TLGP and is eligible to receive the benefit of the TLGP guarantee in connection with the issuance of senior unsecured debt of up to $312.5 million.  Available Credit Facilities  Secured Committed Credit Facilities. The maintenance of revolving committed credit agreements serves to further diversify our funding sources. In connection with our asset securitization program, we have access to committed undrawn funding capacity through privately placed asset-backed commercial paper conduits to support credit card loan receivables funding requirements. At August 31, 2009, we had used $2.7 billion of capacity under these conduits, with $1.5 billion remaining capacity available to us. The original commitments of these facilities range from 364-day renewable agreements to multi-year extendable commitments.  Unsecured Committed Credit Facility. Our unsecured committed credit facility of $2.4 billion is available through May 2012. This facility serves to diversify our funding sources and enhance our liquidity. This facility is provided by a group of major global banks, and is available to both Discover Financial Services and Discover Bank (Discover Financial Services may borrow up to 30% and Discover Bank may borrow up to 100% of the total commitment). We anticipate that the facility will support general liquidity needs and may be drawn to meet short-term funding needs from time to time. We have no outstanding balances due under the facility.  Federal Reserve. Discover Bank has access to the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s discount window. As of August 31, 2009, Discover Bank had $6.4 billion of available capacity through the Federal discount    75    Table of Contents  window, which includes $3.2 billion capacity through the Term Auction Facility. On April 27, 2009, the Federal Reserve decreased the amount it will lend against certain loans pledged as collateral. In the second quarter of 2009, we added personal loans as pledged assets that primarily offset the decrease in the discount window capacity.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Funding Sources—Securitization Financing” and “—Accounting Treatment for Off-Balance Sheet Securitizations.”  Guarantees  Guarantees are contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make payments to a guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying asset, liability, or equity security of a guaranteed party, rate or index. Our guarantees relate to certain representations and warranties made with regard to securitized loans, transactions processed on the Discover Network and transactions processed by Diners Club licensees. Also included in guarantees are contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to a guaranteed party based on another entity’s failure to perform under an agreement. See Note 14: Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our guarantees.  Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments  In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Contractual obligations at August 31, 2009, which include deposits, long-term borrowings, purchase obligations and operating and capital lease obligations, were $32.0 billion. For a description of our contractual obligations as of November 30, 2008, see our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending November 30, 2008 under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments.”  As part of our risk management strategies, we reduced our unused commitments by $33 billion from November 30, 2008 to $174 billion, as a result of closing inactive accounts. Such commitments arise primarily from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on certain credit cards, provided there is no violation of conditions established in the related agreement. These commitments, substantially all of which we can terminate at any time and which do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, are periodically reviewed based on account usage and customer creditworthiness. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we guarantee payment on behalf of subsidiaries relating to contractual obligations with external parties. The activities of the subsidiaries covered by these guarantees, if any, are included in our consolidated financial statements.      Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio. We are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates.  Interest Rate Risk. Changes in interest rates impact interest-earning assets, principally managed loan receivables. Changes in interest rates also impact interest sensitive liabilities that finance these assets, including asset-backed securitizations, deposits, and short-term and long-term borrowings.  Our interest rate risk management policies are designed to measure and manage the potential volatility of earnings that may arise from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the existing    76    Table of Contents  repricing schedules of credit card loan receivables. To the extent that asset and related financing repricing characteristics of a particular portfolio are not matched effectively, we may utilize interest rate derivative contracts, such as swap agreements, to achieve our objectives. Interest rate swap agreements effectively convert the underlying asset or financing from fixed to floating rate or from floating to fixed rate.  We use an interest rate sensitivity simulation to assess our interest rate risk exposure. For purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical, adverse change in interest rates over the 12-month period from our reporting date, we assume that all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of the beginning of the period. The sensitivity is based upon the hypothetical assumption that all relevant types of interest rates that affect our results would increase instantaneously, simultaneously and to the same degree.  Our interest rate sensitive assets include certain loan receivables, Federal Funds sold, certain amounts due from asset securitizations, interest-earning deposits and certain investment securities. Although we have moved the majority of our credit card accounts to variable rates, some of our accounts are still at fixed rates. Due to new credit card legislation, we have restrictions on our ability to mitigate interest rate risk by adjusting rates on existing balances. Assets with rates that are fixed at period end but which will mature, or otherwise contractually reset to a market-based indexed rate or other fixed rate prior to the end of the 12-month period, are considered to be rate sensitive. The latter category includes certain credit card loans that may be offered at below-market rates for an introductory period, such as balance transfers and special promotional programs, after which the loans will contractually reprice in accordance with our normal market-based pricing structure. For purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for such loans, only the effect of the hypothetical 100 basis point change in the underlying market-based indexed rate or other fixed rate has been considered rather than the full change in the rate to which the loan would contractually reprice. For assets that have a fixed interest rate at the fiscal period end but which contractually will, or are assumed to, reset to a market-based indexed rate or other fixed rate during the next 12 months, earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date. In addition, for all interest rate sensitive assets, earnings sensitivity is calculated net of expected loan losses.  Interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next 12-month period. Thus, liabilities that vary with changes in a market-based index, such as Federal Funds or LIBOR, which will reset before the end of the 12-month period, or liabilities whose rates are fixed at the fiscal period end but which will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a market-based indexed rate prior to the end of the 12-month period, also are considered to be rate sensitive. For these fixed rate liabilities, earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date.  Assuming an immediate 100 basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at August 31, 2009, we estimate that the pretax income of lending and related activities (reported on a managed basis) over the following 12-month period would be increased by approximately $108 million. Assuming the same 100 basis point increase, we estimated the reduction of pretax income for the 12-month period following November 30, 2008 to be approximately $38 million. At August 31, 2009, we are slightly more asset sensitive due to changes in our asset composition and timing. We have not provided an estimate of any impact on pretax income of a decrease in interest rates as many of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities are tied to interest rates that are already at or near their minimum levels and, therefore, could not decrease any further.      Item 4. Controls and Procedures  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange    77    Table of Contents  Act”)), which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this report that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  Part II. OTHER INFORMATION      Item 1. Legal Proceedings  In the normal course of business, we have been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions, and other litigation, arising in connection with our activities. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. We have historically relied on the arbitration clause in our cardmember agreements, which has limited the costs of, and our exposure to, litigation. We are also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental agencies regarding our business, including, among other matters, accounting and operational matters, some of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other relief. Litigation and regulatory actions could also adversely affect our reputation.  We contest liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigations and proceedings are in the early stages, we cannot predict with certainty the loss or range of loss, if any, related to such matters, how such matters will be resolved, when they will ultimately be resolved, or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, might be. Subject to the foregoing, we believe, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that the outcome of the pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, although the outcome of such matters could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular future period, depending on, among other things, our level of income for such period.  We filed a lawsuit captioned Discover Financial Services, Inc. v. Visa USA Inc., MasterCard Inc. et al. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on October 4, 2004. Through this lawsuit we sought to recover substantial damages and other appropriate relief in connection with Visa’s and MasterCard’s illegal anticompetitive practices that, among other things, foreclosed us from the credit and debit network services markets. The lawsuit followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s October 2004 denial of Visa’s and MasterCard’s petition for review of the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals affirming a lower court decision in a case brought by the U.S. Department of Justice in which the court found that Visa’s and MasterCard’s exclusionary rules violated the antitrust laws and harmed competition and consumers by foreclosing us from offering credit and debit network services to banks. During the third quarter of 2008, the court issued rulings on the parties’ motions for summary judgment. Among other things, the court’s rulings precluded Visa and MasterCard from relitigating elements of our core claim that were already decided in the U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit and otherwise limited the remaining issues for trial, which was scheduled for October 14, 2008.    78    Table of Contents We executed an agreement to settle the lawsuit with MasterCard and Visa on October 27, 2008. The agreement became effective on November 4, 2008 upon receipt of the approval of Visa’s Class B shareholders. Under the settlement, Visa and MasterCard agreed to pay us up to $2.75 billion in exchange for our agreement to dismiss the lawsuit and release all claims. MasterCard agreed to pay us a lump sum in the amount of $862.5 million, which we received in the fourth quarter of 2008. Visa agreed to pay us up to an aggregate amount of approximately $1.9 billion, in four installments of up to $472 million each on December 15, 2008, March 13, 2009, June 15, 2009 and September 28, 2009, plus interest. The payments from Visa are contingent on the Company achieving certain financial performance measures. For each of the first three fiscal quarters in 2009, Visa agreed to pay us an amount equal to 5% of each quarter’s total combined transaction sales volume for Company payment cards, including payment cards issued by the Company and payment cards issued by third parties on the Discover, PULSE and Diners Club networks, up to the maximum amount for each quarter stated above. For the fourth payment, which covers a three-week period in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009, Visa agreed to pay us an amount equal to 21% of the period’s total combined transaction sales volume, up to the maximum quarterly payment amount stated above. The settlement agreement provides for adjustments to the maximum amounts and for other adjustments based on whether we achieve the financial performance measures. On December 15, 2008, March 13, 2009, June 15, 2009 and September 28, 2009, we received quarterly payments from Visa in the amounts of $472 million each.  At the time of our 2007 spin-off from Morgan Stanley, we entered into an agreement with Morgan Stanley regarding the manner in which the antitrust case against Visa and MasterCard was to be pursued and settled and how proceeds of the litigation were to be shared (the “Special Dividend Agreement”). As previously disclosed, the agreement provided that, upon resolution of the litigation, after expenses, we would be required to pay Morgan Stanley the first $700 million of value of cash or non-cash proceeds (increased at the rate of 6% per annum until paid in full) (the “minimum proceeds”), plus 50% of any proceeds in excess of $1.5 billion, subject to certain limitations and a maximum potential payment to Morgan Stanley of $1.5 billion. All payments by us to Morgan Stanley would be net of taxes payable by us with respect to such proceeds. On October 21, 2008, Morgan Stanley filed a lawsuit against us in New York Supreme Court for New York County seeking a declaration that Morgan Stanley did not breach the Special Dividend Agreement, did not interfere with any of our existing or prospective agreements for resolution of the antitrust case against Visa and MasterCard and that Morgan Stanley is entitled to receive a portion of the settlement proceeds as set forth in the Special Dividend Agreement. On November 18, 2008, we filed our response to Morgan Stanley’s lawsuit, which includes counterclaims against Morgan Stanley for interference with our efforts to resolve the antitrust lawsuit against Visa and MasterCard and willful and material breach of the Special Dividend Agreement, which expressly provided that we would have sole control over the investigation, prosecution and resolution of the antitrust lawsuit. Through our counterclaims we seek a ruling that because of Morgan Stanley’s willful, material breach of the Special Dividend Agreement it has no right to any of the proceeds from the settlement. We have also requested damages in an amount to be proven at trial. As of September 2009, the parties are currently engaged in pre-trial discovery, and depositions are set to begin in October. Morgan Stanley has also moved for partial summary judgment, and the summary judgment argument is set for late October.      Item 1A. Risk Factors  There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2008, and in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended February 28, 2009 and May 31, 2009.    79    Table of Contents   Item 2.
