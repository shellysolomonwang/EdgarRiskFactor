Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2007 and “Part II. Other Information — Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended May 31, 2008, filed with the SEC and available at the SEC's internet site (http://www.sec.gov).  Introduction and Overview  Discover Financial Services is a leading credit card issuer and electronic payment services company with one of the most recognized brands in U.S. financial services. We offer credit cards and prepaid cards as well as other financial products and services to qualified customers. We are also a leader in payment processing and related services for merchants and financial institutions. Our fiscal year ends on November 30 of each year.  We continue to increase acceptance of cards issued on our signature card network (the “Discover Network”) among small and mid-sized merchants in the United States through agreements with third-party acquirers. The purchase of Diners Club International (“Diners Club”), completed on June 30, 2008, provides us with another strong brand name and continues our progress toward increasing acceptance worldwide. As we achieve interoperability between Diners Club and the Discover Network over the next two to three years, we expect Discover Network cardholders to be able to use their cards at merchants that accept Diners Club cards around the world, and Diners Club cardholders to be able to use their cards on the Discover Network in North America. The results of Diners Club are included in the Third-Party Payments segment.  Our primary revenues come from interest income earned on loan receivables, securitization income derived from the transfer of credit card loan receivables to securitization trusts and subsequent issuance of beneficial interests through securitization transactions, and fees earned from cardmembers, merchants and issuers. The     29    Table of Contents  primary expenses required to operate our business include funding costs (interest expense), loan losses, cardmember rewards, and expenses incurred to grow and service our loan receivables (e.g., compensation expense and marketing).  Our business activities are funded primarily through the process of asset securitization, the raising of consumer deposits, and both secured and unsecured debt. In a credit card securitization, loan receivables are first transferred to the securitization trust, from which beneficial interests are issued to investors. We continue to own and service the accounts that generate the securitized loans. The trusts utilized by us to facilitate asset securitization transactions are not our subsidiaries. These trusts are excluded from our consolidated and combined financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Because our securitization activities qualify as sales under GAAP and accordingly are not treated as secured financing transactions, we remove credit card loan receivables equal to the amount of the investor interests in securitized loans from our consolidated statements of financial condition. As a result, asset securitizations have a significant effect on our consolidated and combined financial statements in that the portions of interest income, provision for loan losses and certain components of other income related to the securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued are no longer recorded in our consolidated and combined statements of income; however, they remain significant factors in determining the securitization income we receive on our retained beneficial interests in those transactions. See “—Accounting Treatment for Off-Balance Sheet Securitizations” below for information regarding proposed amendments to the accounting standards applicable to asset securitizations and see “—Outlook” below for a discussion of the current state of the securitization markets.  Our senior management evaluates business performance and allocates resources using financial data that is presented on a managed basis. Managed loans consist of our on-balance sheet loan portfolio, loans held for sale and loan receivables that have been securitized and against which beneficial interests have been issued. Owned loans, a subset of managed loans, refer to our on-balance sheet loan portfolio and loans held for sale and include the undivided seller’s interest we retain in our securitizations. A managed basis presentation, which is a non-GAAP presentation, involves reporting securitized loans with our owned loans in the managed basis statements of financial condition and reporting the earnings on securitized loans in the same manner as the owned loans instead of as securitization income. The managed basis presentation generally reverses the effects of securitization transactions; however, there are certain assets that arise from securitization transactions that are not reversed. Specifically, these assets are the cash collateral accounts that provide credit enhancement to the investors in the transactions and cardmember payments allocated to the securitized loans, both of which are held at the trusts. These assets also include the interest-only strip receivable, reflecting the estimated fair value of the excess cash flows allocated to securitized loans and retained certificated beneficial interests. Income derived from these assets representing interest earned on accounts at the trusts, changes in the fair value of the interest-only strip receivable and interest income on investment securities also are not reversed in a managed presentation.  Managed loan data is relevant because we service the securitized and owned loans, and the related accounts, in the same manner without regard to ownership of the loans. Therefore, management believes it is useful for investors to consider the credit performance of the entire managed loan portfolio to understand the quality of loan originations and the related credit risks inherent in the owned portfolio and retained interests in our securitizations.  Financial measures using managed data are non-GAAP financial measures. Whenever managed data is presented in this quarterly report, a reconciliation of the managed data to the most directly comparable GAAP-basis financial measure is provided. See “—GAAP to Managed Data Reconciliations.”  Third Quarter Highlights        •    During the third quarter of 2008, we experienced growth in revenues (net interest income plus other income) as a result of Discover Card volume, installment loan growth and strong transaction volume in     30    Table of Contents       our payments business as compared to the third quarter of 2007. Managed loans grew to $50 billion, from $47 billion, reflecting growth in both credit card and installment loans. Card volume grew year over year as sales volumes and balance transfers grew 5% and 11%, respectively, over the prior year. Our payments business volume increased by 48% over the prior year to $35 billion, including a $5 billion volume contribution from Diners Club.        •    The consumer credit environment continues to be challenging. The managed net charge-off rate for the quarter was 5.20% and the managed over 30 days delinquency rate was 3.85% at the end of the period. The owned charge-off rate and owned over 30 days delinquency rate were 4.76% and 3.58%, respectively, for the quarter. Additionally, the loan loss reserve rate increased to 4.41% in the quarter compared to 3.28% in the third quarter of 2007.        •    We increased our liquidity reserve by $1.2 billion since May 31, 2008 to $9.6 billion. Growth in funding in the quarter was achieved primarily through our deposit gathering channels. Deposit balances grew by approximately $2.2 billion, with approximately half the growth coming from direct-to-consumer deposits. We also completed two securitization transactions resulting in proceeds of $1.2 billion during the quarter.        •    On June 30, 2008, we purchased Diners Club for $168 million in cash, expanding our credit and debit payments business globally. At the end of the quarter, Diners Club is consolidated into our statement of financial condition, and two months of its operating results are included in our consolidated statements of income.  Outlook  Our financial results continue to be adversely impacted by the challenging consumer credit environment and capital market conditions, which began with declines in the housing markets, rising unemployment and the write-down of mortgage-related securities, and spread to other financial instruments and the financial markets more generally. We believe deterioration in the consumer credit environment in the United States has been driven primarily by decreased availability of credit to consumers, rising unemployment levels, declining housing prices and rising energy costs. We recorded higher provision for loan losses this quarter as a result of higher charge-offs, owned loan growth and in anticipation of higher future charge-off rates. We have been experiencing a trend of a greater percent of delinquent accounts flowing into later stages of delinquency and eventually into charge- off. Although our underwriting and portfolio management strategies and geographic diversity are designed to manage exposure to credit losses, the delinquency trend and continued challenges in the consumer credit environment are likely to lead to a higher charge-off rate.  Deterioration in the capital markets, which has caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital, merge with larger and stronger financial institutions and, in some cases, fail, has led to concerns by market participants about the stability of financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties. We believe these concerns have resulted in a contraction of available credit, even for the most credit-worthy borrowers. Historically, we have used the asset-backed securities market as an important source of funding. The continued disruption in the capital markets has resulted in higher costs of and reduced access to asset-backed securitization funding. Due to recent market events, the public asset-backed securitization market has not been available at volumes and pricing levels that would be attractive to us. Our last public asset-backed securitization transaction was on June 18, 2008. It is difficult to predict if or when securitization markets will return to historical capacity and pricing levels.  Our response to the disruptions in the securitization markets has been and we anticipate will continue to be increased utilization of brokered and direct-to-consumer deposit channels. As of August 31, 2008, we had total deposits of $27.0 billion. Our use of deposit funding is dependent upon consumers choosing to deposit funds with our banking subsidiary, Discover Bank, and the willingness of third-party brokers to sell our deposits to their customers. Future market developments, as well as changes in consumer and market perceptions, could impact our ability to maintain and increase our deposit funding levels. An inability to obtain deposit funding in the future would materially adversely affect our liquidity position, financial condition and funding costs.    31    Table of Contents We have approximately $2.6 billion in public asset-backed securities maturing during the fourth quarter of 2008. As the downturn in execution levels in the capital markets is expected to continue, we anticipate that some or all of the fourth quarter maturities will be funded through our deposit channels. This shift will result in higher levels of owned loan receivables, a related increase in allowance for loan losses and a greater reduction in the value of the interest-only strip receivable. We also have $1.5 billion of unutilized commitments from third-party commercial paper asset-backed conduits for securitization funding, including a $750 million conduit facility established in the third quarter.  The interest rate environment remains a challenge to our business. Since August 31, 2008, LIBOR has moved to significantly higher levels. If LIBOR remains elevated during the fourth quarter, we will experience higher interest expense on our off-balance sheet borrowings resulting in a reduction in our securitization income and a decline in the value of our interest-only strip receivable.  Our payments business continues to be an area of opportunity for us. Our payments business grew its transaction volume in the third quarter, which we expect to continue throughout the rest of this year and into next year, as this business continues to benefit from new and existing relationships with financial institutions. The addition of Diners Club enhances our opportunities in the global payments business. However, we will begin to incur interoperability and integration costs associated with Diners Club and, therefore, do not expect Diners Club to contribute to future results at the same level as in the third quarter.  Accounting Treatment for Off-Balance Sheet Securitizations  The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) has issued proposed amendments to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, as amended (“Statement No. 140”), and FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (“FIN 46R”). Under the proposed amendment to Statement No. 140, the concept of a qualifying special purpose entity (“QSPE”) has been eliminated. QSPEs are currently exempt from the consolidation provisions of FIN 46R and, as a result, amendments to that standard are being considered as well. Exposure Drafts for proposed amendments to each standard were issued on September 15, 2008, and each is subject to a 60-day public comment period. Based on comments it may receive and other considerations, the FASB may revise the amendments before issuing final guidance. The changes to these standards, if adopted as proposed, may make it more difficult for us to maintain or establish sale accounting treatment in connection with transfers of financial assets in securitization transactions and could result in consolidation of the securitization entities by us. This would have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. For example, the impact of the potential consolidation, if applied as of August 31, 2008, may require us to add approximately $27 billion of securitized receivables to our assets, add the related debt issued to third-party investors to our liabilities, and reclassify amounts due from securitization. As proposed, each amended standard would become effective for us on December 1, 2009. For a discussion of certain risks to us associated with the proposed amendments, see the discussion under “Part II. Other Information—Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended May 31, 2008. In addition, a new FASB Staff Position, which will require additional disclosures for securitization activities prior to the effective date of the amendments to Statement No. 140 and FIN 46R, is expected to be effective for us as early as December 1, 2008. On September 15, 2008, the federal banking agencies issued a joint press release stating that they are evaluating the potential impact that these proposals could have on banking organizations’ financial statements, regulatory capital, and other regulatory requirements.  Legislative and Regulatory Developments  The Federal Reserve Board has proposed significant amendments to regulations that would limit or modify certain credit card practices, including, but not limited to, restrictions on applying rate increases to existing balances, payment allocation and default pricing. The Federal Reserve Board has indicated it hopes to publish final rules by the end of the year. We do not know the content of the final amendments nor the resulting impact     32    Table of Contents  from the amendments at this time. If the amendments are adopted as proposed, the amendments would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For a discussion of certain risks to us associated with the proposed amendments, see the discussion under “Part II. Other Information—Item 1A. Risk Factors” in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended May 31, 2008. In September, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a bill that would impose restrictions similar to those proposed by the Federal Reserve Board, but Congress did not take final action on this legislation before adjourning.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has proposed amendments to the deposit insurance assessment rates. The proposed amendments are subject to a 30 day public comment period. If adopted as proposed, we would have to pay higher deposit insurance assessments.  * * *  The remaining discussion provides a summary of our results of operations for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2008 and 2007, as well as our financial condition at August 31, 2008 and November 30, 2007. All information and comparisons are based on continuing operations.  Segments  We manage our business activities in two segments: U.S. Card and Third-Party Payments. In compiling the segment results that follow, the U.S. Card segment bears all overhead costs that are not specifically associated with a particular segment and all costs associated with Discover Network marketing, servicing and infrastructure, with the exception of an allocation of direct and incremental costs driven by the Third-Party Payments segment.  U.S. Card. The U.S. Card segment includes Discover Card-branded credit cards issued to individuals and small businesses on the Discover Network and other consumer products and services, including installment loans, prepaid cards and other consumer lending and deposit products offered through our Discover Bank subsidiary.  Third-Party Payments. The Third-Party Payments segment includes the PULSE Network (“PULSE”), an automated teller machine, debit and electronic funds transfer network; Diners Club, a global payments network; and our third-party issuing business, which includes credit, debit and prepaid cards issued on the Discover Network by third parties.    33    Table of Contents The following table presents segment data on a managed basis and a reconciliation to a GAAP presentation (dollars in thousands):                            Managed Basis         GAAP Basis   For the Three Months Ended   U.S. Card   Third-PartyPayments(1)   Total   SecuritizationAdjustment(2)     Total   August 31, 2008                        Interest income   $ 1,637,588   $ 662   $ 1,638,250   $  (956,558 )   $ 681,692   Interest expense     534,870     17     534,887     (229,244 )     305,643                                     Net interest income     1,102,718     645     1,103,363     (727,314 )     376,049   Provision for loan losses     754,028     —      754,028     (389,190 )     364,838   Other income     482,311     54,686     536,997     338,124       875,121   Other expense     585,760     26,787     612,547     —        612,547                                     Income from continuing operations before income tax expense   $ 245,241   $  28,544   $ 273,785   $ —      $ 273,785                                     August 31, 2007                        Interest income   $  1,626,214   $ 594   $  1,626,808   $ (951,944 )   $ 674,864   Interest expense     703,024     —      703,024     (385,900 )     317,124                                     Net interest income     923,190     594     923,784     (566,044 )     357,740   Provision for loan losses     418,349     —      418,349     (272,522 )     145,827   Other income     481,060     29,465     510,525     293,522       804,047   Other expense     605,264     20,620     625,884     —        625,884                                     Income from continuing operations before income tax expense   $ 380,637   $ 9,439   $ 390,076   $ —      $ 390,076                                     For the Nine Months Ended                         August 31, 2008                        Interest income   $ 4,861,739   $ 1,823   $ 4,863,562   $ (2,907,005 )   $ 1,956,557   Interest expense     1,754,450     19     1,754,469     (796,137 )     958,332                                     Net interest income     3,107,289     1,804     3,109,093     (2,110,868 )     998,225   Provision for loan losses     1,962,633     —      1,962,633     (1,081,194 )     881,439   Other income     1,539,796     126,087     1,665,883     1,029,674       2,695,557   Other expense     1,754,685     67,030     1,821,715     —        1,821,715                                     Income from continuing operations before income tax expense   $ 929,767   $ 60,861   $ 990,628   $ —      $ 990,628                                     August 31, 2007                        Interest income   $ 4,709,530   $ 1,726   $ 4,711,256   $ (2,786,530 )   $  1,924,726   Interest expense     1,990,471     19     1,990,490     (1,118,137 )     872,353                                     Net interest income     2,719,059     1,707     2,720,766     (1,668,393 )     1,052,373   Provision for loan losses     1,268,674     —      1,268,674     (830,973 )     437,701   Other income     1,497,367     89,395     1,586,762     837,420       2,424,182   Other expense     1,779,750     61,733     1,841,483     —        1,841,483                                     Income from continuing operations before income tax expense   $ 1,168,002   $ 29,369   $ 1,197,371   $ —      $ 1,197,371                                        (1) Diners Club was acquired on June 30, 2008.    (2) The Securitization Adjustment column presents the effect of loan securitizations by recharacterizing as securitization income the portions of the following items that relate to the securitized loans: interest income, interest expense, provision for loan losses, discount and interchange revenue and loan fee revenues. Securitization income is reported in other income.    34    Table of Contents The segment discussions that follow for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2008 and 2007 are on a managed basis.  U.S. Card  The U.S. Card segment reported pretax income of $245.2 million for the three months ended August 31, 2008, down $135.4 million, or 36%, as compared to August 31, 2007. The decrease in pretax income was driven by higher provision for loan losses, which was partially offset by an increase in net interest income. Provision for loan losses increased $335.7 million, or 80%, as a result of higher net charge-offs and a higher reserve rate, each of which is reflective of current economic conditions and recent delinquency trends, as well as owned loan growth. Net interest income increased $179.5 million, or 19%, when compared to the same period in 2007, reflecting widening net interest margins benefiting from lower cost of funds as our borrowing costs declined as a result of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate reductions in the first half of 2008 and amortization of balance transfer fees previously recorded in loan fee income. Other expenses decreased $19.5 million, or 3%, due to lower marketing expenditures, lower depreciation expense on information technology equipment and lower legal fees during the three months ended August 31, 2008, partially offset by higher compensation expenses. Other income was relatively flat as an increase in discount and interchange revenue was offset by the inclusion of balance transfer fee amortization in interest income beginning in the third quarter of 2008.  The U.S. Card segment reported pretax income of $929.8 million for the nine months ended August 31, 2008, down $238.2 million, or 20%, as compared to August 31, 2007. The decrease in pretax income was driven by higher provision for loan losses, which was partially offset by increased net interest income. Provision for loan losses increased $694.0 million, or 55%, as a result of higher net charge-offs and a higher reserve rate, each of which is reflective of current economic conditions and recent delinquency trends, as well as owned loan growth. Net interest income increased $388.2 million, or 14%, as interest income benefited from higher average loan receivables as well as an increase in the level of interest-earning assets related to the liquidity reserve, partially offset by an increase in borrowings to support the asset growth. The lower interest rate environment drove down our cost of funds significantly, but was partially offset by lower interest income earned on our floating rate interest-earning assets. Other income increased $42.4 million, or 3%, due to an increase in discount and interchange revenue partially offset by the inclusion of balance transfer fee amortization in interest income beginning in the third quarter of 2008. Other expenses decreased $25.0 million, or 1%, due to lower legal fees partially offset by higher compensation expenses.  The managed loan balance of $50.4 billion at August 31, 2008 was up 6% from August 31, 2007. This increase in loans is attributable to increases in credit card sales, installment loans and balance transfers in addition to lower payment rates. The weakening economic environment adversely impacted cardmember delinquencies and charge-offs. The managed over 30 days delinquency rate for the segment, including non-credit card loans, was 3.85%, 69 basis points higher than last year, and the managed credit card over 30 days delinquency rate was 3.92%, up 76 basis points from last year. For the three months ended August 31, 2008, the managed segment and credit card charge-off rates were 5.20% and 5.28%, up 154 and 161 basis points from the three and nine months ended August 31, 2007, respectively. For the nine months ended August 31, 2008, the managed segment and credit card charge-off rates were 4.84% and 4.90%, up 101 and 107 basis points from the comparable prior year periods, respectively. Our loan growth combined with the deterioration in the credit environment led to a $113.0 million increase to our reserves over and above our net charge-offs for the quarter.  Third-Party Payments  The Third-Party Payments segment continues to produce solid results. Volume, revenues and pretax income all grew significantly in the third quarter of 2008 as compared to the third quarter of 2007. Our volumes continue to benefit from new issuers and increased volume from existing issuers. This increase in volume coupled with higher fee income and the inclusion of Diners Club results for July and August drove increases in revenues and pretax income.    35    Table of Contents The Third-Party Payments segment reported pretax income of $28.5 million for the three months ended August 31, 2008, up $19.1 million as compared to the three months ended August 31, 2007. The increase in pretax income was driven by increased revenues from transaction growth and an increase in fee revenue, as well as a $7.2 million contribution from Diners Club. Third-Party Payments volume was $35.3 billion, up 48% compared to last year, reflecting the impact of new issuers, increased volume from existing issuers and the addition of July and August Diners Club volume of $5.2 billion. Diners Club volume is derived from data provided by licensees for Diners Club-branded cards issued outside of North America and is subject to subsequent revision or amendment.  The Third-Party Payments segment reported pretax income of $60.9 million for the nine months ended August 31, 2008, up $31.5 million, as compared to August 31, 2007. The increase in pretax income was driven by increased revenues from transaction growth, $5.2 million in revenue related to two separate one-time contractual payments and an increase in fee revenue, as well as a $7.2 million contribution from Diners Club, partially offset by marketing and pricing incentives. Third-Party Payments volume was $91.1 billion, up 35% compared to last year, reflecting the impact of new issuers, increased volume from existing issuers and the addition of July and August Diners Club volume of $5.2 billion.  GAAP to Managed Data Reconciliations  Securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued to third parties are removed from our consolidated statements of financial condition. Instances in which we retain certificated beneficial interests in the securitization transactions result in a reduction to loan receivables of the amount of the retained interest and a corresponding increase in available-for-sale investment securities. The portions of interest income, provision for loan losses and certain components of other income related to the securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued are no longer recorded in our consolidated and combined statements of income; however, they remain significant factors in determining the securitization income we receive on our retained beneficial interests in those transactions. Management believes it is useful for investors to consider the credit performance of the entire managed loan portfolio to understand the quality of loan originations and the related credit risks inherent in the owned portfolio and retained interests in securitization. Loan receivables on a GAAP (or owned) basis and related performance measures, including yield, charge-offs and delinquencies can vary from those presented on a managed basis. Generally, loan receivables included in the securitization trusts are derived from accounts that are more seasoned, while owned loan receivables represent a greater concentration of newer accounts, occurring as a result of the degree to which receivables from newer accounts are added to the trusts. The seasoning of an account is measured by the age of the account relationship. In comparison to more seasoned accounts, loan receivables of newer accounts typically carry lower interest yields resulting from introductory offers to new cardmembers and lower charge-offs and delinquencies.  Beginning with “—Earnings Summary,” the discussion of GAAP results is presented on a consolidated and combined basis with any material differences between segment performance specifically identified.

For estimates that involve a high degree of judgment and subjectivity, it is possible that different estimates could reasonably be derived for the same period. For estimates that are particularly sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions, significant changes to the estimated amount from period to period are also possible. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in the consolidated and combined financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts in the consolidated and combined financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and, in certain cases, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition. Management has identified the policies related to the estimation of the allowance for loan losses, the accounting for asset securitization transactions, interest income recognition, the accrual of cardmember rewards cost, the evaluation of goodwill for potential impairment and accrual of income taxes as critical accounting policies.  These critical accounting policies are discussed in greater detail in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2007. That discussion can be found within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the heading Critical Accounting Policies. There have not been any material changes in the critical accounting policies from those discussed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2007.

Other income increased $71.1 million due to an increase in securitization income and other income, partially offset by lower loan fee income. The provision for loan losses increased reflecting higher net charge-offs as a result of the weakening economic environment.  Income from continuing operations for the nine months ended August 31, 2008 was $619.3 million, down 18% compared to the nine months ended August 31, 2007, driven by higher provision for loan losses and lower net interest income, partially offset by higher other income. Net interest income decreased $54.1 million due to     38    Table of Contents  an increase in interest expense, partially offset by an increase in interest income. The provision for loan losses increased reflecting higher net charge-offs and a higher allowance for loan losses as a result of the weakening economic environment. Other income increased primarily due to higher securitization income which resulted from higher excess spread on securitized loans.  Net Interest Income  Net interest income represents the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets which we own and the interest expense incurred to finance those assets. Net interest margin represents interest income, net of interest expense, as a percentage of total interest-earning assets. Our interest-earning assets consist of loan receivables, our liquidity reserve which includes Federal Funds sold and money market mutual funds, certain retained interests in securitization transactions included in amounts due from asset securitization and investment securities. Interest-earning assets do not include investor interests in securitization transactions that have been transferred to third parties since they are not assets which we own. Similarly, interest income does not include the interest yield on the related loans. Our interest-bearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits, both brokered and direct. Net interest income is influenced by the following:        •    The level and composition of interest-earning assets and liabilities, including the percentage of floating rate credit card loan receivables we own and percentage of floating rate liabilities we owe;        •    Changes in the interest rate environment, including the levels of interest rates and the relationship between interest rate indices;        •    Credit performance of our loans, particularly with regard to charge-offs of finance charges which reduce interest income;        •    The terms of certificates of deposit upon initial offering, including maturity and interest rate; and        •    Effectiveness of interest rate swaps in our interest rate risk management program.  Net interest income increased $18.3 million, or 5%, during the three months ended August 31, 2008, as compared to the three months ended August 31, 2007, related to an $11.5 million decrease in interest expense and $6.8 million increase in interest income. During the three months ended August 31, 2008, our net interest income improved because of lower cost of funds and amortization of balance transfer fees previously included in loan fee income. But the lower interest rate environment also negatively impacted the return on our interest-earning assets and, therefore, our net interest margin, which decreased 45 basis points to 4.57% for the three months ended August 31, 2008 as compared to 5.02% for the three months ended August 31, 2007.  The decline in interest expense was due to a 79 basis point decrease in our cost of funds to 4.52%, reflecting the effect of the declining interest rate environment on our floating rate liabilities as well as lower issuance costs on new certificates of deposit. This was offset in part by a higher level of funding needed to support the growth of our interest-earning assets, specifically related to installment and credit card loan growth and a higher level of liquidity. The increase in interest income reflected this higher level of assets as well as the inclusion of $33.3 million of balance transfer fee amortization in interest income beginning in the third quarter of 2008, previously reported in loan fee income. This was partially offset by the impact of a lower interest rate environment on our floating rate assets, specifically amounts due from securitization, our liquidity reserve and a portion of loan receivables, 40% of which earned interest at floating rates for the three months ended August 31, 2008 as compared to 48% in the prior comparative period. Interest income was also adversely impacted by an increase in finance charge charge-offs related to the deteriorating credit performance of our loan receivables.  Net interest income decreased $54.1 million, or 5%, and net interest margin decreased 106 basis points to 4.09% during the nine months ended August 31, 2008, as compared to the nine months ended August 31, 2007, related to an $85.9 million increase in interest expense partially offset by a $31.8 million increase in interest income. During the nine months ended August 31, 2008, our net interest income declined because of a higher     39    Table of Contents  level of borrowings and lower interest rates earned on our floating rate interest-earning assets, which also negatively impacted our net interest margin. However, these declines were partially offset by a lower cost of funds, interest earned on our loan installment products and the inclusion of balance transfer fee amortization in interest income.  The increase in interest expense was largely due to our higher average funding levels in 2008. Partially offsetting this increase in funding levels was the impact of a 52 basis point decrease to 4.73% in our cost of funds for the nine months ended August 31, 2008 as a result of the lower interest rate environment. Interest income increased due to the higher average liquidity reserve and installment loan growth as well as the inclusion of $33.3 million of balance transfer fee amortization in interest income beginning in the third quarter of 2008, previously reported in loan fee income. These increases were partially offset by higher finance charge charge-offs in addition to the impact of a lower interest rate environment on our floating rate assets, specifically our liquidity reserve, amounts due from securitization and loan receivables, 41% of which earned interest at floating rates for the nine months ended August 31, 2008 as compared to 54% in the prior comparative period.    40    Table of Contents Average Balance Sheet Analysis                                For the Three Months Ended      August 31, 2008   August 31, 2007      AverageBalance     Rate

Loan Quality  Provision for Loan Losses  Provision for loan losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate to absorb the estimated probable losses in the loan portfolio at each period end date. Factors that influence the provision for loan losses include the level and direction of loan delinquencies and charge-offs, changes in consumer spending and payment behaviors, bankruptcy trends, regulatory changes or new regulatory guidance, the seasoning of our loan portfolio, interest rate movements and their impact on consumer behavior, and changes in our loan portfolio, including the overall mix of accounts, products and loan balances within the portfolio. We also consider the credit quality of the loan portfolio in determining the allowance for loan losses. Credit quality at any time reflects, among other factors, our credit granting practices and effectiveness of collection efforts, the impact of general economic conditions on the consumer, and the seasoning of the loans.    43    Table of Contents For the three months ended August 31, 2008, the provision for loan losses increased $219.0 million, or 150%, compared with the three months ended August 31, 2007, primarily reflecting higher net charge-offs as a result of higher bankruptcies and the deteriorating economic environment as well as an increase in the level of the allowance for loan losses due to higher loan balances and an increase in the loan loss reserve rate. By comparison, for the three months ended August 31, 2007, we decreased the level of allowance for loan losses by $15.2 million, reflecting improved credit performance during that period.  For the nine months ended August 31, 2008, the provision for loan losses increased $443.7 million, or 101%, compared with the nine months ended August 31, 2007, reflecting an increase in the level of allowance for loan losses and higher net charge-offs. In the nine months ended August 31, 2008, we added $199.8 million to the allowance for loan losses, reflecting loan growth and an increase in the loan loss reserve rate due to higher delinquencies which we believe is primarily attributable to the U.S. housing and mortgage issues and a deteriorating economic environment. For the nine months ended August 31, 2007, we decreased the level of allowance for loan losses by $74.5 million, reflecting improved credit performance and slightly lower loan balances.  The allowance for loan losses increased $330.3 million, or 52%, at August 31, 2008, as compared to August 31, 2007. The higher level was attributable to rising delinquency and charge-off rates on credit card loan receivables, as well as higher loan portfolio balances driven by growth in credit card loan receivables and other consumer loans. The factors impacting the changes in credit quality across these periods are discussed further in “–Net Charge-offs” and “–Delinquencies” below.  Allowance for Loan Losses  The following table provides a summary of the allowance for loan losses (dollars in thousands):                            For the Three Months EndedAugust 31,      For the Nine Months EndedAugust 31,         2008       2007       2008       2007      Balance at beginning of period   $ 846,775     $ 644,701     $ 759,925     $ 703,917     Additions:                       Provision for loan losses     364,838       145,827       881,439       437,701     Deductions:                       Charge-offs     (292,395 )     (201,648 )     (807,036 )     (635,157 )   Recoveries     40,551       40,578       125,441       122,997                                       Net charge-offs     (251,844 )     (161,070 )     (681,595 )     (512,160 )                                     Balance at end of period   $ 959,769     $ 629,458     $ 959,769     $ 629,458                                      Net Charge-offs  Our net charge-offs include the principal amount of losses charged off less current period principal recoveries and exclude charged-off interest and fees, current period recoveries of interest and fees and fraud losses. Charged-off and recovered interest and fees are recorded in interest and loan fee income for loan receivables and in securitization income for securitized loans while fraud losses are recorded in other expense. Credit card loans are charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes 180 days contractually past due, except in the case of cardmember bankruptcies and probate accounts. Cardmember bankruptcies and probate accounts are charged off at the end of the month 60 days following the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death but not later than the 180-day contractual time frame. The net charge-off rate is calculated by dividing net charge-offs for the period by the average loan receivables for the period.    44    Table of Contents The following table presents amounts and rates of net charge-offs of loan receivables (dollars in thousands):                                    For the Three Months EndedAugust 31,     For the Nine Months EndedAugust 31,        2008     2007     2008     2007     Net charge-offs   $  251,844   4.76 %   $  161,070   3.23 %   $  681,595   4.36 %   $  512,160   3.39 %  The net charge-off rate on our loan receivables increased 153 basis points and 97 basis points for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2008, respectively, as compared to the respective prior year periods. The higher net charge-off rate in both periods was due to higher delinquencies beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007, reflecting the weakening economic environment, the declining U.S. housing markets and mortgage industry and an increase in bankruptcy-related charge-offs.  Delinquencies and Non-Performing Loans  Delinquencies are an indicator of credit quality at any point in time. Loan balances are considered delinquent when contractual payments on the loan become 30 days past due.  The following table presents the amounts and delinquency rates of loan receivables over 30 days delinquent, loans receivables over 90 days delinquent and accruing interest and loan receivables that are not accruing interest, regardless of delinquency (dollars in thousands):                        August 31,2008     November 30,2007        $   %     $   %     Loans over 30 days delinquent   $  780,060   3.58 %   $  678,963   3.26 %   Loans over 90 days delinquent and accruing interest   $ 329,037   1.51 %   $ 271,227   1.30 %   Loans not accruing interest   $ 115,877   0.53 %   $ 102,286   0.49 %  The delinquency rates of loans over 30 days delinquent and loans over 90 days delinquent and accruing interest increased 32 basis points and 21 basis points, respectively, at August 31, 2008, as compared to November 30, 2007. This increase in both measures reflected a weaker economic environment and the declining U.S. housing markets and mortgage industry. Delinquency rates normally rise as charge-offs rise, however, in 2008, we experienced a pattern of charge-offs rising faster than delinquencies because a greater percentage of delinquent accounts are now flowing into the later stages of delinquency and eventually into charge-off and also because of an increase in consumer bankruptcy filings.  Loan receivables are placed on non-accrual status upon receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death of a cardmember and as part of certain collection management processes. Loan receivables not accruing interest at August 31, 2008 increased 4 basis points to 0.53%, as compared to November 30, 2007, as a result of an increase in bankruptcy notifications.    45    Table of Contents Other Income  The following discussion presents the significant components of and changes in other income which are shown in the table below (dollars in thousands):                                          For theThree Months EndedAugust 31,     2008 vs. 2007increase(decrease)     For theNine Months EndedAugust 31,     2008 vs. 2007increase(decrease)        2008     2007     $     %     2008     2007     $     %     Securitization income   $ 629,046     $ 565,075     $ 63,971     11 %   $ 1,970,574     $ 1,657,941     $ 312,633     19 %   Loan fee income     56,514       86,665       (30,151 )   (35 %)     198,611       246,009       (47,398 )   (19 %)   Discount and interchange revenue (1)     41,480       37,898       3,582     9 %     158,899       183,443       (24,544 )   (13 %)   Insurance     48,762       41,204       7,558     18 %     143,717       125,635       18,082     14 %   Merchant fees     16,183       22,798       (6,615 )   (29 %)     52,876       71,977       (19,101 )   (27 %)   Transaction processing revenue     31,085       25,271       5,814     23 %     87,444       74,968       12,476     17 %   Loss on investments     (5,325 )     (4 )     (5,321 )   NM       (37,789 )     (4 )     (37,785 )   NM     Other income     57,376       25,140       32,236     128 %     121,225       64,213       57,012     89 %                                                             Total other income   $  875,121     $  804,047     $ 71,074     9 %   $  2,695,557     $  2,424,182     $  271,375     11 %                                                                (1) Net of rewards, including Cashback Bonus rewards, of $190.0 million and $200.2 million for the three months ended August 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively, and $521.1 million and $561.7 million for the nine months ended August 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.  Total other income increased $71.1 million, or 9%, for the three months ended August 31, 2008, as compared to the three months ended August 31, 2007, primarily due to an increase in securitization income and other income, partially offset by a decline in loan fee income as a result of deferrals of balance transfer fees in 2008 historically accounted for in loan fee income. For the nine months ended August 31, 2008, total other income increased $271.4 million, or 11%, as compared to the nine months ended August 31, 2007, largely because of an increase in securitization income and other income, partially offset by losses on investments, lower discount and interchange revenue and a decrease in loan fee income.  For securitization transactions completed on or after November 3, 2004, in accordance with governing securitization documents, we allocate portions of our discount and interchange revenue to new securitization transactions. Within other income, this change to allocating discount and interchange revenue has the effect of decreasing discount and interchange revenue and increasing securitization income. The amount of discount and interchange revenue allocated to securitization transactions has increased since this change was made in 2004 and is expected to continue increasing as new transactions which include such allocations are completed and securitizations transactions that did not receive allocations mature. For the three and nine months ended August 31, 2008, approximately 86% and 83%, respectively, of total securitized loans were allocated discount and interchange revenue compared to 72% and 65% for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2007, respectively.  Securitization Income  Securitization income is a significant source of our income and is derived through asset securitizations and continued servicing of a portion of the credit card receivables we originated. The issuance of asset-backed securities to investors has the effect of removing the owned loan receivables from the consolidated statements of financial condition. Also, portions of interest income, provision for loan losses and certain components of other income related to the securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued are no longer reported in our statements of income; however, they remain significant factors in determining securitization income we receive on our retained beneficial interest in those transactions. Investors in securitizations are allocated the cash flows derived from interest and loan fee revenue earned on securitized loans, and beginning in November 2004, portions of our discount and interchange revenue. These cash flows are used to pay the investors in the transactions a contractual fixed or floating rate of return on their investment, to reimburse investors for losses of     46    Table of Contents  principal resulting from charged-off loans, net of recoveries, and to pay us a contractual fee for servicing the securitized loans. Any excess cash flows remaining are paid to us. Both servicing fees and excess spread are recorded in securitization income. Securitization income also includes the net revaluation of the interest-only strip receivable and certain other retained interests, reflecting adjustments to the fair values of the retained interests that result from changes in the level of securitized loans and assumptions used to value the retained interests. The table below presents the components of securitization income (dollars in thousands):                                          For theThree Months EndedAugust 31,     2008 vs. 2007increase(decrease)     For theNine Months EndedAugust 31,     2008 vs. 2007increase(decrease)        2008     2007     $     %     2008     2007     $     %     Excess spread   $ 528,862     $ 458,134     $ 70,728     15 %   $ 1,573,192     $ 1,259,334     $ 313,858     25 %   Servicing fees on securitized loans     139,592       136,050       3,542     3 %     416,248       399,546       16,702     4 %   Net revaluation of retained interests(1)      (33,513 )     (23,905 )     (9,608 )   40 %     (2,989 )     13,870       (16,859 )   (122 %)   Other (principally transaction costs)     (5,895 )     (5,204 )     (691 )   (13 %)     (15,877 )     (14,809 )     (1,068 )   (7 %)                                                             Securitization income   $  629,046     $  565,075     $  63,971     11 %   $  1,970,574     $  1,657,941     $  312,633     19 %                                                                (1) Net of issuance discounts, as applicable.  For the three and nine months ended August 31, 2008, the increase in securitization income as compared to the three and nine months ended August 31, 2007 primarily reflects higher excess spread on securitized loans offset in part by a decrease in the net revaluation of retained interests, which are detailed further in the tables and discussion below.

In both periods, the increase was attributable to higher net interest income and higher other fee revenue on securitized loans, offset in part by higher net charge-offs. The increase in net interest income related largely to a decrease in interest paid to investors reflective of the impact of a lower average LIBOR on floating rate investor interests, offset in part by wider spreads paid to investors on newer transactions. Higher other fee revenue was attributable to the higher level of outstanding securitized loans receiving discount and interchange revenue. The higher net charge-offs were reflective of the weakening economic and credit environment. Additionally, a higher level of average securitized loans in both periods contributed to higher excess spread.    47    Table of Contents Net revaluation of retained interests. The components of net revaluation of retained interests are summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands):                                    For theThree Months EndedAugust 31,     2008 vs. 2007increase(decrease)     For theNine Months EndedAugust 31,     2008 vs. 2007increase(decrease)        2008     2007     $     2008     2007     $     Initial gain on new securitization transactions(1)   $  9,785     $  13,078     $ (3,293 )   $  71,872     $  93,782     $  (21,910 )   Revaluation of retained interests     (43,298 )     (36,983 )     (6,315 )     (74,861 )     (79,912 )     5,051                                                       Net revaluation of retained interests   $ (33,513 )   $ (23,905 )   $  (9,608 )   $ (2,989 )   $ 13,870     $ (16,859 )                                                        (1) Net of issuance discounts, as applicable.  The net revaluation of retained interests for the three months ended August 31, 2008 decreased $9.6 million, as compared to the three months ended August 31, 2007. The decrease reflected lower initial gains on new securitization transactions related to $1.2 billion and $0.9 billion of new securitization transactions for the three months ended August 31, 2008 and August 31, 2007, respectively, reflecting the effect of higher interest rates to be paid to investors on transactions closing in the quarter related to current securitization market trends as well as lower projected excess spread on new securitizations. The unfavorable revaluation of the interest-only strip receivable in the three months ended August 31, 2008 was largely due to unfavorable changes in assumptions used in valuing the interest-only strip receivable compared to the most recent period end, including lower projected excess spread, and net gain amortization related to the maturity of securitization transactions. The lower projected excess spread reflected higher projected charge-offs and higher interest rate projections and widening spreads on new securitizations as a result of the current trends in the securitization markets. The unfavorable revaluation of retained interests in the comparable prior year period was primarily due to net gain amortization related to the maturity of securitization transactions. The three months ended August 31, 2008 also included an $11.1 million higher revaluation of cash collateral accounts reflective of their decreasing remaining life compared to an unfavorable revaluation for the three months ended August 31, 2007.  The net revaluation of retained interests for the nine months ended August 31, 2008 decreased $16.9 million, as compared to the nine months ended August 31, 2007. The decrease included $21.9 million lower initial gains on $5.6 billion of new securitizations for the nine months ended August 31, 2008, as compared to $6.2 billion of new securitization transactions for the nine months ended August 31, 2007, as well as higher interest rates to be paid to investors on newer securitizations related to ongoing securitization market trends. The unfavorable revaluation of retained interests for the nine months ended August 31, 2008 largely related to lower net gain amortization associated with the maturity of securitization transactions partially offset by unfavorable changes in the interest-only strip receivable. In the second and third quarters of 2008, adverse changes in the assumptions used in valuing the interest-only strip receivable, including higher charge-offs and widening spreads, largely offset the favorable valuation recorded in the first quarter of 2008. The unfavorable revaluation of retained interests in the comparable prior year period was primarily due to net gain amortization related to the maturity of securitization transactions.  Loan Fee Income  Loan fee income consists primarily of fees on credit card loans and includes late, overlimit, cash advance and other miscellaneous fees. Loan fee income decreased $30.2 million, or 35%, and $47.4 million, or 19%, for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2008, as compared to August 31, 2007, respectively, as a result of deferrals of balance transfer fees beginning in the second quarter of 2008 historically accounted for in loan fee income which will be accreted into interest income over the life of the loan beginning in the third quarter of 2008.    48    Table of Contents Discount and Interchange Revenue  Discount and interchange revenue includes discount revenue and acquirer interchange net of interchange paid to third-party issuers in the United States. We earn discount revenue from fees charged to merchants with whom we have entered into card acceptance agreements for processing cardholder purchase transactions and acquirer interchange revenue from merchant acquirers on all Discover Network card transactions made by cardholders at merchants with whom merchant acquirers have entered into card acceptance agreements for processing cardholder purchase transactions. We incur an interchange cost to card issuing entities that have entered into contractual arrangements to issue cards on the Discover Network. This cost is contractually established and is based on the card issuing organizations’ transaction volume and is reported as a reduction to discount and interchange revenue. We offer our cardmembers various reward programs, including the Cashback Bonus reward program, pursuant to which we pay certain cardmembers a percentage of their purchase amounts based on the type and volume of the cardmember’s purchases. Reward costs are recorded as a reduction to discount and interchange revenue. For securitization transactions completed on or after November 3, 2004, in accordance with governing securitization documents, we allocate portions of discount and interchange revenue to new securitization transactions, which results in a decrease in discount and interchange revenue and an increase in securitization income. However, cardmember rewards costs associated with the securitized loans are not allocated to investor interests, and as such, do not impact securitization income.  Discount and interchange revenue for the three months ended August 31, 2008 was relatively flat when compared to August 31, 2007, as lower rewards costs related to revised forfeiture assumptions and higher discount and interchange revenue were largely offset by higher allocations of discount and interchange revenue to securitized loans. Discount and interchange revenue decreased $24.5 million, or 13%, for the nine months ended August 31, 2008, as compared to August 31, 2007, due to higher allocations to securitized loans, partially offset by lower cardmember rewards costs related to revised forfeiture assumptions and higher discount and interchange revenue. The increase in allocations to securitized loans was due to a higher level of outstanding securitized loans receiving such allocations in the current year than in 2007.  Loss on Investments  We concluded there had been an other-than-temporary impairment in our investment in the asset-backed commercial paper notes of Golden Key U.S. LLC, which invested in mortgage-backed securities, resulting in a $5.3 million and $36.6 million write-down of the notes to $72.1 million in the three and nine months ended August 31, 2008, respectively. We continue to monitor the value of the investment. Future valuations may result in further impairment of the investment. In comparison, there were no material losses on investment securities for the three and nine months ended August 31, 2007.  Other Income  Other income includes revenues from the sale of merchant portfolios to third-party acquirers, royalty revenues from Diners Club, revenues on various fee-based products, revenues from the referral of declined applications to certain third-party issuers on the Discover Network, unrealized gains and losses related to derivative contracts and other miscellaneous revenue items. Other income increased $32.2 million, or 128%, primarily due to reporting an unrealized gain for the three months ended August 31, 2008 compared to an unrealized loss on interest rate swap agreements for the three months ended August 31, 2007, the inclusion of Diners Club revenue and an increase in gains on the sales of merchant portfolios. Other income increased $57.0 million, or 89%, for the nine months ended August 31, 2008, as compared to the nine months ended August 31, 2007, primarily due to lower unrealized losses on interest rate swap agreements, $13.0 million from transitional services provided to Goldfish, the inclusion of Diners Club revenue, and an increase in gains on the sales of merchant portfolios.    49    Table of Contents Other Expense  The following table represents the components of other expense for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):                                      For theThree Months EndedAugust 31,   2008 vs. 2007increase (decrease)     For theNine Months EndedAugust 31,   2008 vs. 2007increase (decrease)        2008   2007    $       %      2008   2007    $       %      Employee compensation and benefits   $  222,426   $  210,541   $ 11,885     6 %   $ 658,086   $ 641,155   $ 16,931     3 %   Marketing and business development     137,928     153,786     (15,858 )   (10 %)     411,519     420,287     (8,768 )   (2 %)   Information processing and communications     76,675     83,779     (7,104 )   (8 %)     234,400     245,019     (10,619 )   (4 %)   Professional fees     82,775     88,111     (5,336 )   (6 %)     237,839     267,029     (29,190 )   (11 %)   Premises and equipment     20,274     19,962     312     2 %     59,718     60,094     (376 )   (1 %)   Other expense     72,469     69,705     2,764     4 %     220,153     207,899     12,254     6 %                                                     Total other expense   $ 612,547   $ 625,884   $  (13,337 )   (2 %)   $  1,821,715   $  1,841,483   $  (19,768 )   (1 %)                                                    Total other expense decreased $13.3 million, or 2%, for the three months ended August 31, 2008, as compared to the three months ended August 31, 2007, primarily related to lower marketing expenditures, lower depreciation expense on information technology equipment as certain assets became fully depreciated in the current period and lower legal fees. These decreases were partially offset by the inclusion of Diners Club expenses and higher compensation and benefits in the current period.  Total other expense decreased $19.8 million, or 1%, for the nine months ended August 31, 2008, as compared to the nine months ended August 31, 2007, primarily related to lower legal fees, lower depreciation expense on information technology equipment as certain assets became fully depreciated in the current period and lower marketing expenditures, partially offset by higher compensation and benefits, higher fraud expenses and the inclusion of Diners Club expenses in the current period.  Income Tax Expense  The following table reconciles our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate:                        For the Three Months EndedAugust 31,      For the Nine Months EndedAugust 31,         2008     2007     2008     2007     U.S. federal statutory income tax rate   35.0 %   35.0 %   35.0 %   35.0 %   U.S. state and local income taxes, net of U.S. federal income tax benefits   3.4     1.8     3.2     1.8     State examinations and settlements   (3.9 )   —      (1.1 )   —      Non-deductible spin-off costs   —      1.4     —      0.4     Other   0.2     (0.8 )   0.4     (0.2 )                             Effective income tax rate   34.7 %   37.4 %   37.5 %   37.0 %                            During the three months ended August 31, 2008, we settled certain state examination issues, which resulted in a tax benefit for the quarter. We expect the fourth quarter effective tax rate will approximate the effective tax rates for the first and second quarters of 2008.    50    Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources  We seek to maintain liquidity, capital and funding policies that ensure our credit ratings and bank capitalization levels are sufficient to provide cost-effective access to debt and deposit markets thus providing sufficient liquidity to fund our business. Our liquidity and funding risk management policies are designed to mitigate the risk that we may be unable to access adequate financing to fund our business and service our financial obligations when they come due. Liquidity risk is addressed through various funding criteria and targets that guide our access to the long-term and short-term debt capital markets and various deposit distribution channels, the maturity profile of our liabilities, the diversity of our funding sources and investor base, as well as the level of our liquidity reserve.  Liquidity risk is assessed by several measures including our maturity profile, which measures funding in various maturity tranches. The maturities of the various funding instruments are reviewed during the funding planning and execution process to ensure the maturities are staggered. The mix of funding sources and the composition of our investor base are also reviewed during the funding process to assess whether there is appropriate diversification. Funding sources include deposits, term asset-backed securitizations, asset-backed commercial paper conduit financing and short-term borrowings.  We monitor and review liquidity and capital management policies and execute strategies seeking to maintain prudent levels of liquidity and capital. Our senior management reviews financial performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative financing sources, evaluates liquidity risk and capital adequacy, and assesses the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities. Management has implemented liquidity and capital management policies which seek to provide us with adequate access to funding through the business cycle.  Our borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are directly impacted by our credit ratings. Discover Bank and Discover Financial Services have maintained investment grade ratings. Discover Bank has a BBB rating from Standard & Poor’s, a Baa2 deposit and Baa2 senior unsecured rating from Moody’s Investors Service and a BBB rating from Fitch Ratings. Discover Financial Services has a BBB- long-term rating from Standard & Poor’s, a Baa3 senior unsecured rating from Moody’s Investors Service and a BBB long-term rating from Fitch Ratings. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, it may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.  We maintain a process designed to continuously evaluate our liquidity position and our vulnerabilities to disruptions in our funding markets. This process results in contingency funding plans which model a wide range of potential cash outflows during a liquidity stress event, including, but not limited to: (i) repayment of all debt maturing within an assumed stress period; (ii) expected funding requirements from receivable maintenance, growth and/or volatility; and (iii) customer cash withdrawals from interest-bearing deposits. In a liquidity stress event, we would seek to increase deposits, liquidate investments and use alternative funding sources (such as Federal Funds, the Federal Reserve’s Term Auction Facility and discount window and our $2.5 billion credit facility) to fund our loan receivables and meet our other liquidity needs.  The ongoing disruptions in the debt and asset-backed capital markets have caused credit spreads to widen materially and reduced the availability of new issuances of asset-backed securities. At August 31, 2008, our contingent sources included approximately $9.6 billion in our liquidity reserve (primarily invested in Federal Funds sold, money market mutual funds and triple-A rated money market mutual funds), $1.5 billion of unutilized commitments from third-party commercial paper asset-backed conduits for securitization funding, and $2.5 billion of unsecured committed credit. In total, we had triple-A rated note issuance capacity of $5.0 billion in the Discover Card Execution Note Trust (“DCENT”), subject to market availability. In order to maintain this level of triple-A rated note issuance capacity, we have retained $1.1 billion principal amount of subordinated notes issued by DCENT, categorized as investment securities available-for-sale for accounting purposes. In the future, we may retain additional subordinated notes to maintain our triple-A rated note issuance capacity.    51    Table of Contents Our consolidated statement of financial condition at August 31, 2008 consisted primarily of loan receivables, the balance of which fluctuates from time to time due to trends in credit card spending and payments, as well as the issuance of new securitization transactions and maturities of existing securitization transactions. For the three and nine months ended August 31, 2008, we executed $750 million and $3.5 billion of public securitization transactions, respectively. Although the asset-backed securitization markets have been an important source of funding for us, the securitization markets have remained under stress, resulting in higher costs and reduced issuance capacity. Due to recent market events, the public asset-backed securitization market has not been available at volumes and pricing levels that would be attractive to us. It is difficult to predict if and when securitization markets will return to historical capacity and pricing levels. A decrease in securitization activity would increase owned loans on our balance sheet and result in additional provisions for loan losses and decreased securitization income. Our response to the tightened securitization markets has been and will continue to be utilization of deposits. For more information, see the “Outlook” section at the beginning of this Item 2 and “—Current Funding Sources” below.  Equity Capital Management. Management views equity capital as an important source of financial strength. We determine the level of capital necessary to support our business based on our managed loan receivables, goodwill and other intangible assets, taking into account, among other things, regulatory requirements, rating agency guidelines and internally managed requirements to sustain growth.  Under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) and other bank regulatory agencies, FDIC-insured financial institutions must maintain minimum levels of capital that are dependent upon the risk of the financial institutions assets, specifically (a) 3% to 5% of Tier 1 capital, as defined, to average assets (“leverage ratio”), (b) 4% to 6% of Tier 1 capital, as defined, to risk-weighted assets (“Tier 1 risk-weighted capital ratio”) and (c) 8% to 10% of total capital, as defined, to risk-weighted assets (“total risk-weighted capital ratio”). At August 31, 2008, the leverage ratio, Tier 1 risk-weighted capital ratio and total risk-weighted capital ratio of Discover Bank as well as our other FDIC-insured financial institution, Bank of New Castle, exceeded these regulatory minimums.  Dividend Policy. Although we intend to reinvest a substantial portion of our earnings in our business, we intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend on our common stock, subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. The declaration and payment of dividends, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends. In addition, as a result of applicable banking regulations and provisions that may be contained in our borrowing agreements or the borrowing agreements of our subsidiaries, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders may further be limited.  Share Repurchase Program. On December 3, 2007, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of our outstanding shares of common stock under a new share repurchase program. This share repurchase program expires on November 30, 2010, and may be terminated at any time. At August 31, 2008, we had not repurchased any stock under this program.  Special Dividend. On June 19, 2007, we declared a special dividend to Morgan Stanley. Pursuant to the special dividend, upon resolution of our outstanding litigation with Visa U.S.A., Inc. and MasterCard Inc., after expenses, we are required to pay Morgan Stanley (1) the first $700 million of value of cash or non-cash proceeds (increased at the rate of 6% per annum until paid in full) (the “minimum proceeds”) and (2) 50% of any proceeds in excess of $1.5 billion, subject to certain limitations and a maximum potential payment to Morgan Stanley of $1.5 billion. All payments by us to Morgan Stanley will be net of taxes payable by us with respect to such proceeds. If, in connection with or following a change in control of our company, the litigation is settled for an amount less than minimum proceeds, we are required to pay Morgan Stanley an amount equal to the minimum proceeds. As a result of our agreement to pay the value of non-cash proceeds, we may be required to pay amounts to Morgan Stanley in excess of cash received in connection with the litigation. The value of non-cash proceeds will be determined by an independent third party.    52    Table of Contents Current Funding Sources  Securitization Financing. We have historically generated a significant portion of our funding through the securitization of credit card loan receivables utilizing non-consolidated securitization trusts. Securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued to third parties are accounted for as sold and are removed from the consolidated statements of financial condition. Certain securitized loans against which certificated beneficial interests have been retained by us result in the removal of credit card loan receivables from the consolidated statements of financial condition and are re-characterized as investment securities.  We have utilized both the term securitization markets as well as the privately placed asset-backed commercial paper conduit financing market. Outstanding term financing and asset-backed commercial paper conduit financing at August 31, 2008 were $23.4 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively.  The continued disruption in the capital markets has resulted in higher costs of and reduced access to asset-backed securitization funding. Due to recent market events, the public asset-backed securitization market has not been available at volumes and pricing levels that would be attractive to us. Our last public asset-backed securitization transaction was on June 18, 2008. It is difficult to predict if or when securitization markets will return to historical capacity and pricing levels.  The following table summarizes expected maturities of the investors’ interest in securitizations at August 31, 2008 (dollars in thousands):                           Total   Less ThanOne Year(1)   One YearThroughThree Years   Four YearsThroughFive Years   AfterFive Years   Expected maturities of the investors’ interest in securitizations   $  28,296,587   $  6,357,896   $  16,217,636   $  3,731,581   $  1,989,474      (1) In the fourth quarter of 2008, approximately $2.6 billion of investors’ interest in public securitizations is expected to mature.  We access the term asset securitization markets through the Discover Card Master Trust I and, beginning July 26, 2007, the Discover Card Execution Note Trust. Through the Discover Card Master Trust I, we have been using a structure utilizing Class A, triple-A rated certificates and Class B, single-A rated certificates held by third parties, with credit enhancement provided by the subordinated Class B certificates and a cash collateral account. The Discover Card Execution Note Trust includes three classes of securities sold to investors, the most senior class generally receiving a triple-A rating. In this structure, in order to issue senior higher rated classes of notes, it is necessary to obtain the appropriate amount of credit enhancement through the issuance of junior lower rated classes of notes. We have retained $1.1 billion principal amount of these junior notes, which are categorized as available-for-sale investment securities on our balance sheet.  At August 31, 2008, cash collateral accounts underlying the securitization transactions of Discover Card Master Trust I had a balance of $1.5 billion, of which we financed $1.3 billion (reflected in amounts due from asset securitization in the consolidated statements of financial condition). The rights to repayment of a portion of the cash collateral account loans have been sold to a subsidiary, DRFC Funding LLC, as part of a secured financing and are not expected to be available to creditors of DFS. At August 31, 2008, $0.8 billion remains outstanding under this secured financing.  The following table summarizes estimated maturities of the cash collateral accounts at August 31, 2008 (dollars in thousands):                           Total   Less ThanOne Year   One YearThroughThree Years   Four YearsThroughFive Years   AfterFive Years   Estimated maturities of cash collateral accounts   $  1,341,580   $  401,842   $  713,158   $  167,369   $  59,211    53    Table of Contents The securitization structures include certain features designed to protect investors that could result in earlier-than-expected repayment of the transactions, accelerating the need for alternative funding. The primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements (“economic early amortization”). In the event of an economic early amortization (which would occur if the excess spread falls below 0% for a contractually specified period, generally a three-month average), the receivables that otherwise would have been subsequently purchased by the trust from us would instead continue to be recognized on our statement of financial condition since the cash flows generated in the trust would instead be used to repay investors in the asset-backed securities. As of August 31, 2008, no economic early amortization events have occurred. The table below provides information concerning investor interest and related excess spreads at August 31, 2008 (dollars in thousands):                    Investor Interest   # of SeriesOutstanding   3-Month RollingAverage ExcessSpread     Interchange series(1)   $ 16,484,217   18   8.39 %   Non-interchange series     3,947,370   4   4.75 %                   Discover Card Master Trust I     20,431,587   22   4.75 %   Discover Card Execution Note Trust(1)      7,865,000   20   7.41 %                   Total investor interest   $  28,296,587   42                          (1) Discover Card Master Trust I certificates issued on or after November 4, 2004 and all notes issued by DCENT include cash flows derived from discount and interchange revenue earned by Discover Card.  Deposits. We utilize deposits to diversify funding sources and to reduce our reliance on short-term credit-sensitive funding sources, thus enhancing our liquidity position. We obtain our deposits through two channels: agency arrangements with securities brokerage firms, which place deposits with their customers, and increasingly, products offered directly to consumers through direct mail and internet origination, which include direct retail certificates of deposit and money market accounts. Our response to the disruptions in the securitization markets has been and we anticipate will continue to be increased utilization of brokered and direct-to-consumer deposit channels.  Our certificates of deposit have maturities ranging from one month to fifteen years, having a weighted average maturity of 27 months at August 31, 2008, which is up from 22 months at May 31, 2008 as a result of third quarter issuances of deposits with longer maturities. Total interest-bearing deposits at August 31, 2008 were $26.9 billion, the remaining maturities of which are summarized in the following table (dollars in thousands):                           Total   Three Monthsor Less   Over ThreeMonthsThroughSix Months   OverSix MonthsThroughTwelveMonths   Over TwelveMonths   Certificates of deposit in amounts less than $100,000   $ 21,562,963   $ 2,053,294   $ 2,130,251   $ 3,254,120   $ 14,125,298   Certificates of deposit in amounts of $100,000 or greater     1,214,194     112,235     153,447     378,481     570,031   Savings deposits, including money market deposit accounts     4,101,136     4,101,136     —      —      —                                    Total interest-bearing deposit accounts   $  26,878,293   $  6,266,665   $  2,283,698   $  3,632,601   $  14,695,329                                  Long-Term Borrowings and Bank Notes. At August 31, 2008, we had $400 million principal amount of floating rate senior notes outstanding which mature in June 2010 and $400 million principal amount of fixed rate senior notes outstanding which mature in June 2017. Additionally, we had $250 million principal amount of bank notes outstanding at August 31, 2008 which mature in February 2009.    54    Table of Contents Available Credit Facilities  Secured Committed Credit Facilities. The maintenance of revolving committed credit agreements serves to further diversify our funding sources. In connection with our asset securitization program, we have access to committed undrawn funding capacity through third-party bank-sponsored securitization conduits to support credit card loan receivables funding requirements. At August 31, 2008, these conduits totaled $6.4 billion, of which $1.5 billion was unused. The original commitments of these facilities range from 364-day renewable agreements to multi-year extendable commitments.  Unsecured Committed Credit Facilities. As of August 31, 2008, our unsecured committed credit facility of $2.5 billion had a remaining life of 45 months. This facility serves to diversify our funding sources and enhance our liquidity. This facility became effective at the time of the Distribution, is provided by a group of major global banks, and is available to both Discover Financial Services and Discover Bank (Discover Financial Services may borrow up to 30% and Discover Bank may borrow up to 100% of the total commitment). We anticipate that the facility will support general liquidity needs and may be drawn to meet short-term funding needs from time to time. At August 31, 2008, we had no outstanding balances due under the facility.  Federal Reserve. Discover Bank may access the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s discount window or participate in the Federal Reserve's Term Auction Facility (“TAF”) if additional liquidity needs arise. In December 2007, the Federal Reserve announced the establishment of a temporary TAF. All depository institutions that are judged to be in generally sound financial condition by their local Reserve Bank and that are eligible to borrow under the primary credit discount window program are eligible to participate in TAF auctions.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Current Funding Sources—Securitization Financing.”  Guarantees  Guarantees are contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make payments to a guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying asset, liability, or equity security of a guaranteed party, rate or index. Our guarantees relate to certain representations and warranties made with regard to securitized loans, transactions processed on the Discover Network, transactions processed by Diners Club licensees and indemnifications made in conjunction with the sale of the Goldfish business. Also included in guarantees are contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to a guaranteed party based on another entity’s failure to perform under an agreement. See Note 11: Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further discussion regarding our guarantees.    55    Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments  In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Contractual obligations at August 31, 2008 include deposits, long-term borrowings, operating and capital lease obligations, purchase obligations and income tax obligations associated with FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (“FIN 48”). Our future cash payments associated with our contractual obligations as of August 31, 2008 are summarized below (dollars in thousands):                              Total   Payments Due By Period        Less ThanOne Year   One YearThroughThree Years   Four YearsThroughFive Years   More ThanFive Years   Other   Deposits(1)   $ 26,959,253   $ 12,263,923   $ 10,838,424   $ 2,526,702   $ 1,330,204   $ —    Bank notes(2)     250,000     250,000     —      —      —      —    Secured borrowings(3)     801,053     207,895     593,158     —      —      —    Unsecured borrowings(4)     800,000     —      400,000     —      400,000     —    Capital lease obligations(5)     3,980     1,369     2,611             —    Operating leases(5)     39,077     5,791     10,427     7,968     14,891     —    Interest payments on fixed rate debt     232,200     25,800     51,600     51,600     103,200     —    Purchase obligations(6)     423,978     275,913     121,361     18,949     7,755     —    FIN 48 obligations(7)     283,829     —      —      —      —      283,829                                         Total contractual obligations   $  29,793,370   $  13,030,691   $  12,017,581   $  2,605,219   $  1,856,050   $  283,829                                            (1) See Note 6: Deposits to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information concerning our deposits. The certificates of deposit accrue interest at fixed rates. All other interest-bearing deposits accrue interest at variable rates.    (2) See Note 7: Long-Term Borrowings to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further discussion. Total future payment of interest charges is estimated to be $3.3 million as of August 31, 2008, utilizing the current interest rate of 2.95% at August 31, 2008.    (3) Interest charges on secured borrowings, of which the full repayment is dependent upon the available balances of the cash collateral accounts at the maturities of the underlying securitization transactions, are based on a fifty basis point spread over monthly commercial paper issuance costs. See Note 7: Long-Term Borrowings to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further discussion. Total future payment of interest charges is estimated to be $40.8 million as of August 31, 2008, utilizing the current interest rate of 3.21% at August 31, 2008.    (4) See Note 7: Long-Term Borrowings to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further discussion. Total future payment of interest charges for the floating rate note is estimated to be $23.6 million as of August 31, 2008, utilizing the current interest rate of 3.31% at August 31, 2008. Total future payment of interest charges for the fixed rate note is equal to the amount reported included in the table above under Interest payments on fixed rate debt.    (5) See Note 11: Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information concerning our capital and operating lease obligations.    (6) Purchase obligations for goods and services include payments under, among other things, consulting, outsourcing, data, advertising, sponsorship, software license and telecommunications agreements. Purchase obligations also include payments under rewards program agreements with merchants. Purchase obligations at August 31, 2008 reflect the minimum contractual obligation under legally binding contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable. These amounts exclude obligations for goods and services that already have been incurred and are reflected on our consolidated statement of financial condition.    (7) See Note 9: Income Taxes to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further information concerning our FIN 48 obligations. We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on December 1, 2007 at which date we had approximately $283.8 million of tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, related to uncertain tax positions. Because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to estimate the years in which settlement will occur with the respective taxing authorities.  At August 31, 2008, we had extended credit for consumer and commercial loans of approximately $213 billion. Such commitments arise primarily from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on certain credit cards, provided there is no violation of conditions established in the related agreement. These commitments, substantially all of which we can terminate at any time and which do not necessarily represent     56    Table of Contents  future cash requirements, are periodically reviewed based on account usage and customer creditworthiness. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we guarantee payment on behalf of subsidiaries relating to contractual obligations with external parties. The activities of the subsidiaries covered by these guarantees, if any, are included in our consolidated and combined financial statements.  Employee Benefit Plans  On October 8, 2008, we announced amendments to discontinue the accrual of future benefits in our U.S. defined benefit Pension Plan and our Supplemental Retirement Income Plan effective December 31, 2008. The amendment of the Pension Plan will be considered a curtailment and will result in the acceleration of a deferred benefit that resulted from a 2004 change in the Pension Plan. As a result, we expect to recognize a non-cash pretax credit of approximately $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. In connection with these changes, we have redesigned our 401(k) Plan with enhanced benefit features which become effective in January 2009. Beginning in 2009, it is anticipated that the increased expense associated with the redesigned 401(k) Plan will be substantially offset by a reduction in the ongoing expense associated with the amended Pension Plan.      Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio. We are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates.  Interest Rate Risk. Changes in interest rates impact interest-earning assets, principally managed loan receivables. Changes in interest rates also impact interest sensitive liabilities that finance these assets, including asset-backed securitizations, deposits, and short-term and long-term borrowings.  Our interest rate risk management policies are designed to measure and manage the potential volatility of earnings that may arise from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the existing repricing schedules of credit card loan receivables as well as our right, with notice to cardmembers, to reprice certain fixed or floating rate credit card loan receivables to a new interest rate in the future. To the extent that asset and related financing repricing characteristics of a particular portfolio are not matched effectively, we may utilize interest rate derivative contracts, such as swap agreements, to achieve our objectives. Interest rate swap agreements effectively convert the underlying asset or financing from fixed to floating rate or from floating to fixed rate.  We use an interest rate sensitivity simulation to assess our interest rate risk exposure. For purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical, adverse change in interest rates over the 12-month period from our reporting date, we assume that all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of the beginning of the period.  Interest rate sensitive assets are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next 12-month period. Our interest rate sensitive assets include certain loan receivables, Federal Funds sold, certain amounts due from asset securitizations, interest-earning deposits and certain investment securities. Portions of our credit card loan receivables have fixed interest rates, although we have the right, with notice to cardmembers, to subsequently reprice these receivables to a new interest rate unless the account has been closed or the cardmember opts out of repricing actions. Therefore, we consider a portion of the credit card loan receivables with a fixed interest rate to be interest rate sensitive. We measured the earnings sensitivity for these assets from the expected repricing date, which takes into consideration the required notice period. In addition, assets with rates that are fixed at period end but which will mature, or otherwise contractually reset to a market-based indexed or other fixed rate prior to the end of the 12-month period, also are considered to be rate sensitive. The latter category includes certain credit card loans that may be offered at below-market rates for an introductory period, such as balance transfers and special promotional programs, after which the loans will contractually reprice in accordance with our normal market-based pricing structure. For purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for such loans, only the effect of the hypothetical 100 basis point change in the underlying market-based indexed or other fixed rate has been considered rather than the full change in the rate to which the     57    Table of Contents  loan would contractually reprice. For assets that have a fixed interest rate at the fiscal period end but which contractually will, or are assumed to, reset to a market-based indexed or other fixed rate during the next 12 months, earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date. In addition, for all interest rate sensitive assets, earnings sensitivity is calculated net of expected loan losses.  Interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next 12-month period. Thus, liabilities that vary with changes in a market-based index, such as Federal Funds or LIBOR, which will reset before the end of the 12-month period, or liabilities whose rates are fixed at the fiscal period end but which will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a market-based indexed rate prior to the end of the 12-month period, also are considered to be rate sensitive. For these fixed rate liabilities, earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date.  Assuming an immediate 100 basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at August 31, 2008, we estimate that the pretax income of lending and related activities over the following 12-month period would be reduced by approximately $87.0 million. We estimate the comparable reduction of pretax income for the 12-month period following November 30, 2007, to be approximately $108.0 million. The hypothetical decline in pretax income was less than the prior year due to lower market-based indexes and their impact to the replacement cost of maturing debt as well as fewer interest rate sensitive liabilities. This was offset in part by widened credit spreads in some funding markets as well as fewer interest rate sensitive credit card receivables.  The model assumes that the balances of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at the period end will remain constant over the next 12-month period. It does not assume any growth, strategic change in business focus, change in asset pricing philosophy or change in asset/liability funding mix. Thus, this model represents a static analysis that cannot adequately portray how we would respond to significant changes in market conditions such as those recently experienced. Furthermore, the analysis does not necessarily reflect our expectations regarding the movement of interest rates in the near term, including the likelihood of an immediate 100 basis point change in market interest rates, nor necessarily the actual effect on earnings if such rate changes were to occur.  Foreign Currency Exchange Risk. At November 30, 2007, we had foreign currency exchange risk as a result of credit card loan receivables from our Goldfish business which were denominated in pounds sterling. These receivables were primarily funded by the issuance of debt by unrelated conduit providers and intercompany lending. We mitigated this risk by using forward contracts to hedge our net investment in international operations. As of August 31, 2008, we believe the foreign currency exchange risk related to the remaining net assets of discontinued operations, which are denominated in pounds sterling, is immaterial.      Item 4. Controls and Procedures.  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Historically, we have relied on certain financial, administrative and other resources of Morgan Stanley to operate our business, including portions of human resources, information technology, accounting, tax, corporate services and treasury. In conjunction with our separation from Morgan Stanley, we continue to enhance our own     58    Table of Contents  financial, administrative and other support systems or contract with third parties as we replace Morgan Stanley’s systems. We continue to establish our own accounting and auditing policies and systems on a stand-alone basis. We entered into agreements with Morgan Stanley under which Morgan Stanley has provided some of these services to us on a transitional basis, most of which ended within the third quarter of 2008, with remaining services, mostly information technology related, expected to end in the first half of 2009. We are making these changes as part of our separation from Morgan Stanley and in anticipation of reporting on our internal control over financial reporting.  Other than those noted above, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  Part II. OTHER INFORMATION      Item 1. Legal Proceedings.  In the normal course of business, we have been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions, and other litigation, arising in connection with our activities. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. We have historically relied on the arbitration clause in our cardmember agreements, which has limited the costs of, and our exposure to, litigation. We are also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental agencies regarding our business, including, among other matters, accounting and operational matters, some of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other relief. Litigation and regulatory actions could also adversely affect our reputation.  We contest liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigation and proceedings are in the early stages, we cannot predict with certainty the loss or range of loss, if any, related to such matters, how such matters will be resolved, when they will ultimately be resolved, or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, might be. Subject to the foregoing, we believe, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that the outcome of the pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, although the outcome of such matters could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular future period, depending on, among other things, our level of income for such period.  We filed a lawsuit captioned Discover Financial Services, Inc. v. Visa USA Inc., MasterCard Inc. et al. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on October 4, 2004. Through this lawsuit we seek to recover substantial damages and other appropriate relief in connection with Visa’s and MasterCard’s illegal anticompetitive practices that, among other things, foreclosed us from the credit and debit network services markets. Trial is currently scheduled for October 14, 2008. This lawsuit follows the U.S. Supreme Court’s October 2004 denial of Visa’s and MasterCard’s petition for review of the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals affirming a lower court decision in a case brought by the U.S. Department of Justice in which the court found that Visa’s and MasterCard’s exclusionary rules violated the antitrust laws and harmed competition and consumers by foreclosing us from offering credit and debit network services to banks. During the third quarter, the court issued rulings on the parties' motions for summary judgment. Among other things, the court's rulings preclude Visa and MasterCard from relitigating elements of our core claim that were already decided in the U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit and otherwise limit the remaining issues for trial.  There can be no assurance that we will be successful in recovering any damages in this action. Upon resolution of the litigation, after expenses, we will be required to pay Morgan Stanley the first $700 million of value of cash or non-cash proceeds (increased at the rate of 6% per annum until paid in full) (the “minimum     59    Table of Contents  proceeds”), plus 50% of any proceeds in excess of $1.5 billion, subject to certain limitations and a maximum potential payment to Morgan Stanley of $1.5 billion. All payments by us to Morgan Stanley will be net of taxes payable by us with respect to such proceeds. If, in connection with or following a change of control of the Company, the litigation is settled for an amount less than the minimum proceeds, we will be required to pay Morgan Stanley an amount equal to the minimum proceeds. As a result of our agreement to pay the value of non-cash proceeds, we may be required to pay amounts to Morgan Stanley in excess of cash received in connection with the litigation. The value of non-cash proceeds will be determined by an independent third party.      Item 1A. Risk Factors.  There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2007, and our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended May 31, 2008.
