Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this quarterly report.  Federal Reserve Board Proposed Amendments  The Federal Reserve Board has proposed amendments to regulations that would place limitations on certain credit card practices, including, but not limited to, restrictions on applying rate increases to existing balances, payment allocation and default pricing. The Federal Reserve Board has indicated it hopes to publish final rules by the end of the year. For more information, see “The Federal Reserve Board’s proposed amendments to regulations, if adopted as proposed, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations” under “Part II. Other Information—Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this quarterly report.  The remaining discussion provides a summary of the results of operations for the three and six months ended May 31, 2008 and 2007, as well as the financial condition at May 31, 2008 and November 30, 2007. All information and comparisons are based on continuing operations.  Segments  We manage our business activities in two segments: U.S. Card and Third-Party Payments. In compiling the segment results that follow, the U.S. Card segment bears all overhead costs that are not specifically associated with a particular segment and all costs associated with Discover Network marketing, servicing and infrastructure, with the exception of an allocation of direct and incremental costs driven by the Third-Party Payments segment.  U.S. Card. The U.S. Card segment includes Discover Card-branded credit cards issued to individuals and small businesses over Discover’s signature card network and other consumer products and services business, including prepaid and other consumer lending and deposit products offered through our Discover Bank subsidiary.  Third-Party Payments. The Third-Party Payments segment includes PULSE Network (“PULSE”), an automated teller machine, debit and electronic funds transfer network, and our third-party payments business.    31    Table of Contents The following table presents segment data on a managed basis and a reconciliation to a GAAP presentation (dollars in thousands):                            Managed Basis   SecuritizationAdjustment(1)     GAAP Basis   For the Three Months Ended   U.S. Card   Third- PartyPayments   Total     Total   May 31, 2008                        Interest income   $ 1,572,164   $ 533   $ 1,572,697   $  (960,634 )   $ 612,063   Interest expense     550,629     —      550,629     (237,381 )     313,248                                     Net interest income     1,021,535     533     1,022,068     (723,253 )     298,815   Provision for loan losses     581,537     —      581,537     (370,568 )     210,969   Other income     455,074     37,133     492,207     352,685       844,892   Other expense     585,949     20,876     606,825     —        606,825                                     Income from continuing operations before income tax expense   $ 309,123   $  16,790   $ 325,913   $ —      $ 325,913                                     May 31, 2007                        Interest income   $  1,601,324   $ 558   $  1,601,882   $ (964,226 )   $ 637,656   Interest expense     693,837     4     693,841     (390,419 )     303,422                                     Net interest income     907,487     554     908,041     (573,807 )     334,234   Provision for loan losses     444,249     —      444,249     (299,573 )     144,676   Other income     526,304     29,248     555,552     274,234       829,786   Other expense     601,966     21,792     623,758     —        623,758                                     Income from continuing operations before income tax expense   $ 387,576   $ 8,010   $ 395,586   $ —      $ 395,586                                     For the Six Months Ended                         May 31, 2008                        Interest income   $ 3,224,151   $ 1,161   $ 3,225,312   $ (1,950,447 )   $ 1,274,865   Interest expense     1,219,580     2     1,219,582     (566,893 )     652,689                                     Net interest income     2,004,571     1,159     2,005,730     (1,383,554 )     622,176   Provision for loan losses     1,208,605     —      1,208,605     (692,004 )     516,601   Other income     1,057,485     71,401     1,128,886     691,550       1,820,436   Other expense     1,168,925     40,243     1,209,168     —        1,209,168                                     Income from continuing operations before income tax expense   $ 684,526   $ 32,317   $ 716,843   $ —      $ 716,843                                     May 31, 2007                        Interest income   $ 3,083,316   $ 1,132   $ 3,084,448   $ (1,834,586 )   $  1,249,862   Interest expense     1,287,447     19     1,287,466     (732,237 )     555,229                                     Net interest income     1,795,869     1,113     1,796,982     (1,102,349 )     694,633   Provision for loan losses     850,325     —      850,325     (558,451 )     291,874   Other income     1,016,307     59,930     1,076,237     543,898       1,620,135   Other expense     1,174,486     41,113     1,215,599     —        1,215,599                                     Income from continuing operations before income tax expense   $ 787,365   $ 19,930   $ 807,295   $ —      $ 807,295                                        (1) The Securitization Adjustment column presents the effect of loan securitizations by recharacterizing as securitization income the portions of the following items that relate to the securitized loans: interest income, interest expense, provision for loan losses, discount and interchange revenue and loan fee revenues. Securitization income is reported in other income.    32    Table of Contents The segment discussions that follow for the three and six months ended May 31, 2008 and 2007 are on a managed basis.  U.S. Card  The U.S. Card segment reported pretax income of $309.1 million for the three months ended May 31, 2008, down 20%, as compared to May 31, 2007. The decrease in pretax income was driven by higher provision for loan losses and lower other income, which was partially offset by an increase in net interest income. Provision for loan losses increased $137.3 million, or 31%, as a result of higher net charge-offs, which reflects current economic conditions and recent delinquency trends. Other income decreased $71.2 million, or 14%, due to a $44.5 million unfavorable net revaluation of our retained interest in securitizations as compared to a $36.4 million favorable net revaluation in the second quarter of 2007, and a $31.3 million write-down of our investment in asset-backed commercial paper notes in Golden Key U.S. LLC, partially offset by higher discount and interchange revenue due to growth in sales volume and lower rewards costs related to revised forfeiture assumptions. Net interest income increased $114.0 million, or 13%, reflecting widening net interest margins benefiting from lower cost of funds and a reduction in, and higher rates on, promotional balances.  The U.S. Card segment reported pretax income of $684.5 million for the six months ended May 31, 2008, down 13%, as compared to May 31, 2007. The decrease in pretax income was driven by higher provision for loan losses, which was partially offset by increased net interest income. Provision for loan losses increased $358.3 million, or 42%, as a result of higher charge-offs and a higher allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses increased due to loan growth and an increase in the loan loss reserve rate, which is reflective of the current credit environment and recent delinquency trends. Net interest income increased $208.7 million, or 12%, as interest income benefited from higher average loan receivables as well as an increase in the level of interest-earning assets related to the liquidity reserve, partially offset by an increase in borrowings to support the asset growth.  For the three months ended May 31, 2008, managed loans grew 2%, to $47.8 billion. This increase in loans is attributable to an increase in installment loans and an increase in sales volume of $22.5 billion, up 2% over last year. The weakening economic environment adversely impacted cardmember delinquencies and charge-offs. The managed over 30 day delinquency rate for the segment, including non-credit card loans, was 3.81%, 84 basis points higher than last year, and the managed credit card over 30 day delinquency rate was 3.85%, up 88 basis points from last year. For the three months ended May 31, 2008, the managed segment and credit card charge-off rates were 4.99% and 5.05%, up 102 and 108 basis points from the three months ended May 31, 2007, respectively. For the six months ended May 31, 2008, the managed segment and credit card charge-off rates were 4.66% and 4.70%, up 75 and 78 basis points from the comparable prior year period, respectively.  Third-Party Payments  The Third-Party Payments segment reported pretax income of $16.8 million for the three months ended May 31, 2008, more than double the pretax income of $8.0 million reported for the three months ended May 31, 2007. The increase in pretax income was driven by increased revenues from transaction growth and an increase in fee revenue along with a decline in transaction processing and consulting costs. Third-Party Payment debit and credit volume was $29.4 billion, up 33% compared to last year, reflecting the impact of new issuer signings in 2007 as well as increased volumes from existing issuers.  The Third-Party Payments segment reported pretax income of $32.3 million for the six months ended May 31, 2008, up 62%, as compared to May 31, 2007. The increase in pretax income was driven by increased revenues from transaction growth, $3 million in revenue related to one-time contractual payment, a decline in transaction processing and consulting costs and an increase in fee revenue, partially offset by marketing and pricing incentives. Third-Party Payments debit and credit volume was $55.8 billion, up 29% compared to last year, reflecting the impact of new issuer signings in 2007 as well as increased volumes from existing issuers.    33    Table of Contents GAAP to Managed Data Reconciliations  Securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued to third parties are removed from our statements of financial condition. Instances in which we retain certificated beneficial interests in the securitization transactions result in a reduction to loan receivables of the amount of the retained interest and a corresponding increase in investment securities—available-for-sale. The portions of interest income, provision for loan losses and certain components of other income related to the securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued are no longer recorded in our statements of income; however, they remain significant factors in determining the securitization income we receive on our retained beneficial interests in those transactions. Management believes it is useful for investors to consider the credit performance of the entire managed loan portfolio to understand the quality of loan originations and the related credit risks inherent in the owned portfolio and retained interests in securitization. Loan receivables on a GAAP (or owned) basis and related performance measures, including yield, charge-offs and delinquencies can vary from those presented on a managed basis. Generally, loan receivables included in the securitization trusts are derived from accounts that are more seasoned, while owned loan receivables represent a greater concentration of newer accounts, occurring as a result of the degree to which receivables from newer accounts are added to the trusts. The seasoning of an account is measured by the age of the account relationship. In comparison to more seasoned accounts, loan receivables of newer accounts typically carry lower interest yields resulting from introductory offers to new cardmembers and lower charge-offs and delinquencies.  Beginning with “—Earnings Summary,” the discussion of GAAP results is presented on a consolidated and combined basis with any material differences between segment performance specifically identified.

For estimates that involve a high degree of judgment and subjectivity, it is possible that different estimates could reasonably be derived for the same period. For estimates that are particularly sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions, significant changes to the estimated amount from period to period are also possible. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in the consolidated and combined financial statements are appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts in the consolidated and combined financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations and, in certain cases, could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition. Management has identified the policies related to the estimation of the allowance for loan losses, the accounting for asset securitization transactions, interest income recognition, the accrual of cardmember rewards cost, the evaluation of goodwill for potential impairment and accrual of income taxes as critical accounting policies.  These critical accounting policies are discussed in greater detail in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2007.

Net interest income decreased $35.4 million due to a decrease in interest income and an increase in interest expense. The provision for loan losses increased reflecting higher net charge-offs as a result of the weakening economic environment.  Income from continuing operations for the six months ended May 31, 2008 was $440.4 million, down 14% compared to the six months ended May 31, 2007, driven by lower net interest income and higher provision for loan losses, partially offset by higher other income. Net interest income decreased $72.5 million due to an increase in     36    Table of Contents  interest expense, partially offset by an increase in interest income. The provision for loan losses increased reflecting higher net charge-offs and a higher allowance for loan losses as a result of the weakening economic environment. Other income increased primarily due to higher securitization income which resulted from higher excess spread on securitized loans.  Net Interest Income  Net interest income represents the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets which we own and the interest expense incurred to finance those assets. Net interest margin states the interest income, net of interest expense, as a percentage of total interest-earning assets. Our interest-earning assets consist primarily of loan receivables, certain retained interests in securitization transactions included in amounts due from asset securitization and investment securities, and our liquidity reserve which includes Federal Funds sold and bank deposits. Investor interests in securitization transactions that have been transferred to third parties are not assets which we own, and accordingly, have been excluded from interest-earning assets. Similarly, interest income does not include the interest yield on the related loans.  Interest income is influenced by the amount of interest-earning assets we own, the most significant of which is our loan receivables. Our loan receivables can be influenced by portfolio growth strategies, cardmember spending and payment behavior, and changes in the amount of our securitized loans. Typically, new securitization transactions have the effect of decreasing loan receivables, whereas maturities of existing securitization transactions increase loan receivables. Interest income is also influenced by changes in certain amounts due from asset securitization, which are the largest component of other interest-earning assets. The levels of these assets are impacted by securitization maturities and can vary in relation to the level of securitized loans. Additionally, the liquidity reserve, which may vary based on market conditions and liquidity targets, has an impact on interest income.  Changes in the interest rate environment can influence the interest yield earned on interest rate sensitive assets, and accordingly impact interest income. Credit card loan receivables earn interest at both fixed rates as well as floating rates tied to the prime rate, the mix of which can vary over time. During the three months and six months ended May 31, 2008, average credit card loan receivables earning interest at floating rates decreased to 40% and 42%, respectively, of average loan receivables as compared to 56% and 58% during the three and six months ended May 31, 2007, respectively. The decreases in the percentage of floating rate credit card loan receivables helped to minimize the adverse impact on interest yield of the declining interest rate environment. Other interest rate sensitive assets, specifically our liquidity reserve and certain retained interests in securitization transactions, also were adversely impacted by the declining interest rate environment.  Credit performance is another factor which influences interest yield of loan receivables. Charge-offs related to finance charge balances are recorded as a reduction to interest income. Accordingly, an increase in the level of finance charge charge-offs can adversely impact interest yield and interest income.  Interest-bearing liabilities reflect our funding requirements and consist primarily of deposits and, to a lesser degree, borrowings. We incur interest expense on our interest-bearing liabilities at fixed rates as well as floating rates which are tied to various short-term market indices. Accordingly, changes in the interest rate environment, changes in the percentage of floating rate interest-bearing liabilities and the replacement of maturing debt can impact interest expense. Interest expense also includes the effects of certain interest rate swaps we enter into as part of our interest rate risk management program. During the three and six months ended May 31, 2008, floating rate average interest-bearing liabilities as a percentage of total average interest-bearing liabilities were 34% and 36%, respectively, as compared to 45% and 52% for the respective prior year comparisons. The decreasing interest rate environment favorably impacted our funding costs during the three month and six months ended May 31, 2008.    37    Table of Contents Net interest income for the three months ended May 31, 2008 decreased $35.4 million, or 11%, as compared to the three months ended May 31, 2007, due to a decrease in interest income as well as an increase in interest expense. Net interest income for the six months ended May 31, 2008 decreased $72.5 million, or 10%, as compared to the six months ended May 31, 2007, due to an increase in interest expense, partially offset by an increase in interest income.  For the three months ended May 31, 2008, interest income decreased $25.6 million, or 4%, as compared to the three months ended May 31, 2007, due to a 144 basis point decrease in the interest yield, offset in part by an increase of $4.2 billion in average interest-earning assets. The decrease in the interest yield reflected a higher mix of lower yielding assets related to a higher liquidity reserve as well as the impact of a declining interest rate environment on floating rate interest-earning assets. The interest yield was also adversely impacted, but to a lesser degree, by an increase in finance charge charge-offs related to recent higher charge-off rates on our credit card loan receivables. The increase in interest-earning assets reflected a higher liquidity reserve.  For the three months ended May 31, 2008, interest expense increased $9.8 million, or 3%, as compared to the three months ended May 31, 2007, due to a $4.1 billion higher level of funding to support the increase in interest-earning assets, offset in part by a 64 basis point decrease in the average cost of funds. The decrease in the cost of funds reflected the impact of a declining interest rate environment on floating rate interest-bearing liabilities as well as a decrease in the cost of issuing new certificates of deposits as compared to the three months ended May 31, 2007.  For the six months ended May 31, 2008, interest income increased $25.0 million, or 2%, as compared to the six months ended May 31, 2007, due to $5.7 billion higher average interest-earning assets, offset in part by a 152 basis point decrease in the interest yield. The increase in average interest-earning assets reflected a higher average liquidity reserve level as we maintain a higher liquidity reserve in response to current economic conditions. During the six months ended May 31, 2007, our average liquidity reserve level was lower as we established our initial liquidity reserve in anticipation of the spin-off. Similar to the three months ended May 31, 2008, the decrease in the interest yield reflected the impact of a declining interest rate environment.  For the six months ended May 31, 2008, interest expense increased $97.5 million, or 18%, as compared to the six months ended May 31, 2007, due to a $5.7 billion higher level of funding to support the increase in interest-earning assets, offset in part by a 39 basis point decrease in the average cost of funds. Similar to the three months ended May 31, 2008, the cost of funds was favorably impacted by a declining interest rate environment as well as a decrease in the cost of issuing new certificates of deposits as compared to the six months ended May 31, 2007.  The higher level of interest-earning assets and the lower yield resulted in a 102 basis point decline in net interest margin for the three months ended May 31, 2008, as compared to the prior year respective period. The higher level of interest-earning assets and the lower yield caused a 137 basis point decrease in net interest margin for the six months ended May 31, 2008, as compared to prior year respective period.    38    Table of Contents The following tables provide further analysis of net interest income, net interest margin and the impact of rate and volume changes (dollars in thousands):  Average

Provision for Loan Losses  Provision for loan losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at a level adequate to absorb the estimated probable losses in the loan portfolio at each period end date. Factors that influence the provision for loan losses include the level and direction of loan delinquencies and charge-offs, changes in consumer spending and payment behaviors, bankruptcy trends, regulatory changes or new regulatory guidance, the seasoning of our loan portfolio, interest rate movements and their impact on consumer behavior, and changes in our loan portfolio, including the overall mix of accounts, products and loan balances within the portfolio. We also consider the credit quality of the loan portfolio in determining the allowance for loan losses. Credit quality at any time reflects, among other factors, our credit granting practices and effectiveness of collection efforts, the impact of general economic conditions on the consumer, and the seasoning of the loans.  For the three months ended May 31, 2008, the provision for loan losses increased $66.3 million, or 46%, compared with the three months ended May 31, 2007, primarily reflecting higher net charge-offs as a result of the deteriorating economic environment. Despite the decline in credit performance, the level of the allowance for     41    Table of Contents  loan losses decreased $13.6 million during the three months ended May 31, 2008, due to lower owned loans as a result of securitization activity, offset in part by an increase in the reserve rate. In the three months ended May 31, 2007, we decreased the level of allowance for loan losses by $18.5 million, reflecting improved credit performance.  For the six months ended May 31, 2008, the provision for loan losses increased $224.7 million, or 77%, compared with the six months ended May 31, 2007, reflecting an increase in the level of allowance for loan losses and higher net charge-offs. In the six months ended May 31, 2008, we added $86.8 million to the allowance for loan losses, reflecting loan growth and an increase in the loan loss reserve rate due to higher delinquencies which we believe is primarily attributable to the downturns in the U.S. housing markets and mortgage industry and a deteriorating economic environment. In the six months ended May 31, 2007, we decreased the level of allowance for loan losses by $59.2 million, reflecting improved credit performance and slightly lower loan balances.  Allowance for Loan Losses  The following table provides a summary of the allowance for loan losses (dollars in thousands):                            For the Three Months EndedMay 31,     For the Six Months EndedMay 31,        2008     2007     2008     2007     Balance at beginning of period   $ 860,378     $ 663,172     $ 759,925     $ 703,917     Additions:                       Provision for loan losses     210,969       144,676       516,601       291,874     Deductions:                       Charge-offs     (269,013 )     (204,384 )     (514,641 )     (433,509 )   Recoveries     44,441       41,237       84,890       82,419                                       Net charge-offs     (224,572 )     (163,147 )     (429,751 )     (351,090 )                                     Balance at end of period   $ 846,775     $ 644,701     $ 846,775     $  644,701                                      The allowance for loan losses increased $202.1 million, or 31%, at May 31, 2008, as compared to May 31, 2007. The higher level was attributable to rising delinquency and charge-off rates on credit card loan receivables, as well as higher loan portfolio balances driven by growth in credit card loan receivables and other consumer loans. The factors impacting the changes in credit quality across these periods are discussed further in “–Net Charge-offs” and “–Delinquencies” below.  Net Charge-offs  Our net charge-offs include the principal amount of losses charged off less current period principal recoveries and exclude charged-off interest and fees, current period recoveries of interest and fees and fraud losses. Charged-off and recovered interest and fees are recorded in interest and loan fee income for loan receivables and in securitization income for securitized loans while fraud losses are recorded in other expense. Credit card loans are charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes 180 days contractually past due, except in the case of cardmember bankruptcies and probate accounts. Cardmember bankruptcies and probate accounts are charged off at the end of the month 60 days following the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death but not later than the 180-day contractual time frame. The net charge-off rate is calculated by dividing net charge-offs for the period by the average loan receivables for the period.  The following table presents amounts and rates of net charge-offs of loan receivables (dollars in thousands):                                    For the Three Months EndedMay 31,     For the Six Months EndedMay 31,        2008     2007     2008     2007     Net charge-offs   $  224,572   4.49 %   $  163,147   3.47 %   $  429,751   4.15 %   $  351,090   3.47 %    42    Table of Contents The net charge-off rate on our loan receivables increased 102 basis points and 68 basis points for the three and six months ended May 31, 2008, respectively, as compared to the respective prior year periods. The higher net charge-off rate in both periods was due to higher delinquencies beginning in the fourth quarter of 2007, reflecting the weakening economic environment, the downturns in the U.S. housing markets and mortgage industry and an increase in bankruptcy-related charge-offs.  Delinquencies  Delinquencies are an indicator of credit quality at any point in time. Loan balances are considered delinquent when contractual payments on the loan become 30 days past due.  The following table presents the amounts and delinquency rates of loan receivables over 30 days delinquent, loans receivables over 90 days delinquent and accruing interest and loan receivables that are not accruing interest, regardless of delinquency (dollars in thousands):                        May 31, 2008     November 30, 2007        $   %     $   %     Loans over 30 days delinquent   $ 725,741   3.54 %   $ 678,963   3.26 %   Loans over 90 days delinquent and accruing interest   $ 322,479   1.57 %   $  271,227   1.30 %   Loans not accruing interest   $  114,442   0.56 %   $ 102,286   0.49 %  The delinquency rates of loans over 30 days delinquent and loans over 90 days delinquent and accruing interest increased 28 basis points and 27 basis points, respectively, at May 31, 2008, as compared to November 30, 2007. This increase in both measures reflected a weaker economic environment and the downturns in the U.S. housing markets and mortgage industry.  Loan receivables are placed on non-accrual status upon receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death of a cardmember and as part of certain collection management processes. Loan receivables not accruing interest at May 31, 2008 increased 7 basis points to 0.56%, as compared to November 30, 2007, as a result of an increase in bankruptcy notifications.

For the six months ended May 31, 2008, total other income increased $200.3 million, or 12%, as compared to the six months ended May 31, 2007, largely because of an increase in securitization income, partially offset by losses on investments, lower discount and interchange revenue and a decrease in loan fee income.  For securitization transactions completed on or after November 3, 2004, in accordance with governing securitization documents, we allocate portions of our discount and interchange revenue to new securitization transactions. Within other income, this change to allocating discount and interchange revenue has the effect of decreasing discount and interchange revenue and increasing securitization income. The amount of discount and interchange revenue allocated to securitization transactions has increased since this change was made in 2004 and is expected to continue increasing as new transactions which include such allocations are completed and securitizations transactions that did not receive allocations mature. For the three and six months ended May 31, 2008, approximately 83% and 81%, respectively, of total securitized loans were allocated discount and interchange revenue compared to 64% and 61% for the three and six months ended May 31, 2007, respectively.  Securitization Income  Securitization income is a significant source of our income and is derived through asset securitizations and continued servicing of a portion of the credit card receivables we originated. The issuance of asset-backed securities to investors has the effect of removing the owned loan receivables from the consolidated statements of financial condition. Also, portions of interest income, provision for loan losses and certain components of other income related to the securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued are no longer reported in our statements of income; however, they remain significant factors in determining securitization income we receive on our retained beneficial interest in those transactions. Investors in securitizations are allocated the cash flows derived from interest and loan fee revenue earned on securitized loans. In addition, for securitization transactions completed on or after November 3, 2004, in accordance with governing securitization documents, we allocate portions of our discount and interchange revenue to new securitization transactions. These cash flows are used to pay the investors in the transactions a contractual fixed or floating rate of return on their investment, to reimburse investors for losses of principal resulting from charged-off loans, net of recoveries, and to pay us a contractual fee for servicing the securitized loans. Any excess cash flows remaining are paid to us. Both servicing fees and excess spread are recorded in securitization income. Securitization income also includes the net revaluation of the interest-only strip receivable and certain other retained interests, reflecting adjustments to the fair values of the retained interests that result from changes in the level of securitized loans and assumptions used to value the retained interests.  Securitization income is significantly influenced by the level of average securitized loans. For both the three months ended May 31, 2008 and 2007, the average securitized loans were $27.6 billion. For the six months ended May 31, 2008 and 2007, the average securitized loans were $27.5 billion and $26.3 billion, respectively. The higher average securitized loans for the six months ended May 31, 2008 reflected a higher beginning level of securitized loans, which was offset in part by a higher level of deal maturities. In addition, lower average securitized loans in the six months ended May 31, 2007 reflected the timing of new securitization transactions later in the period.    44    Table of Contents The table below presents the components of securitization income (dollars in thousands):                                          For theThree Months EndedMay 31,     2008 vs. 2007increase (decrease)     For theSix Months EndedMay 31,     2008 vs. 2007increase (decrease)        2008     2007     $     %     2008     2007     $     %     Excess spread   $  539,297     $  415,840     $  123,457     30 %   $  1,044,330     $ 801,201     $  243,129     30 %   Servicing fees on securitized loans     138,393       137,441       952     1 %     276,656       263,496       13,160     5 %   Net revaluation of retained interests(1)     (44,473 )     36,354       (80,827 )   NM       30,524       37,775       (7,251 )   (19 %)   Other (principally transaction costs)     (5,186 )     (5,069 )     (117 )   (2 %)     (9,982 )     (9,606 )     (376 )   (4 %)                                                             Securitization income   $ 628,031     $ 584,566     $ 43,465     7 %   $ 1,341,528     $  1,092,866     $  248,662     23 %                                                                (1) Net of issuance discounts, as applicable.  For the three months ended May 31, 2008, securitization income increased $43.5 million, or 7%, as compared to the three months ended May 31, 2007. The increase reflects higher excess spread on securitized loans, offset in part by lower net revaluation of retained interests. For the six months ended May 31, 2008, securitization income increased $248.7 million, or 23%, as compared to the six months ended May 31, 2007 reflecting higher excess spread on securitized loans.  Excess spread.

For the six months ended May 31, 2008, excess spread on securitized loans increased $243.1 million, or 30%, as compared to the six months ended May 31, 2007. The increase in both periods was attributable to higher net interest income and higher other fee revenue on securitized loans, offset in part by higher net charge-offs. The increase in net interest income related largely to a decrease in interest paid to investors reflective of the impact of a lower average LIBOR on floating rate investor interests, offset in part by wider spreads paid to investors on newer transactions. Higher other fee revenue was attributable to the higher level of outstanding securitized loans receiving discount and interchange revenue. The higher net charge-offs reflected a higher rate of charge-offs on securitized loans as a result of the weakening economic environment. The increase in excess spread in the six month period was also attributable to the higher level of average securitized loans.    45    Table of Contents Net revaluation of retained interests. The components of net revaluation of retained interests are summarized in the table below (dollars in thousands):                                   For theThree Months EndedMay 31,     2008 vs. 2007increase (decrease)     For theSix Months EndedMay 31,     2008 vs. 2007increase (decrease)         2008       2007      $      2008       2007      $     Initial gain on new securitization transactions(1)   $ 25,332     $ 56,914       $(31,582 )   $ 62,087     $ 80,703     $ (18,616 )   Revaluation of retained interests     (69,805 )     (20,560 )     (49,245 )     (31,563 )     (42,928 )   11,365                                                     Net revaluation of retained interests   $  (44,473 )   $ 36,354     $  (80,827 )   $  30,524     $  37,775     $ (7,251 )                                                      (1) Net of issuance discounts, as applicable.  The net revaluation of retained interests includes the initial gain on securitized loan receivables and changes in the fair value of retained interests, including the interest-only strip receivable and the cash collateral accounts provided as credit enhancement to certain securitization transactions. Gains are not recorded on securitized loan receivables against which certificated beneficial interests have been retained by us, and such certificated retained beneficial interests are classified as investment securities available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The net revaluation of the interest-only strip receivable represents changes in the estimated present value of certain components of excess spread on the securitized loans to be earned in the future. Changes in the maturity profile and the estimate of performance measures of the securitized loans, such as interest yield and charge-offs, as well as changes in the interest rate environment, can affect future excess spread projections and, accordingly, the net revaluation of the interest-only strip receivable. Changes in the interest rate environment can also affect the estimated present value of future interest and principal cash flows on the cash collateral accounts which is reflected in net revaluation of retained interests.  The net revaluation of retained interests for the three months ended May 31, 2008 decreased $80.8 million, as compared to the three months ended May 31, 2007. The decrease reflected lower initial gains on new securitization transactions related to $1.9 billion in new securitization transactions for the three months ended May 31, 2008, as compared to $3.7 billion in new securitization transactions for the three months ended May 31, 2007. The unfavorable net revaluation of the interest-only strip receivable in the three months ended May 31, 2008 related to lower projected excess spread, as compared to February 29, 2008, offset in part by net gain amortization related to the maturity of securitization transactions. The lower projected excess spread reflected higher projected charge-offs and a lower projected net interest spread. The three months ended May 31, 2008 also reflected an unfavorable net revaluation of cash collateral accounts reflective of higher long-term interest rate projections. The unfavorable net revaluation of retained interests in the comparable prior year period was primarily due to net gain amortization related to the maturity of securitization transactions.  The net revaluation of retained interests for the six months ended May 31, 2008 decreased $7.3 million, as compared to the six months ended May 31, 2007. The decrease reflected lower initial gains on new securitization transactions related to $4.4 billion in new securitization transactions for the six months ended May 31, 2008, as compared to $5.3 billion in new securitization transactions for the six months ended May 31, 2007. This was offset in part by a lower unfavorable net revaluation of retained interests in the six months ended May 31, 2008 related to net gain amortization associated with the maturity of securitization transactions, offset in part by higher projected excess spread. The higher projected excess spread reflected the decrease in the absolute interest rate environment, as compared to that assumed at November 30, 2007, offset in part by lower projected yield and higher projected charge-offs. The six months ended May 31, 2008 also reflected an unfavorable net revaluation of cash collateral accounts due to higher long-term interest rate projections. The unfavorable net revaluation of retained interests in the comparable period in prior year was primarily due to net gain amortization related to the maturity of securitization transactions.  Loan Fee Income  Loan fee income consists primarily of fees on credit card loans and includes late, overlimit, balance transfer, cash advance and other miscellaneous fees. Loan fee income decreased $16.5 million, or 23%, and $17.2 million, or 11%,     46    Table of Contents  for the three and six months ended May 31, 2008, as compared to May 31, 2007, respectively, as a result of deferrals of balance transfer fees in 2008 historically accounted for in loan fee income which will be accreted into interest income over the life of the loan.  Discount and Interchange Revenue  Discount and interchange revenue includes discount revenue and acquirer interchange net of interchange paid to third-party issuers in the United States. We earn discount revenue from fees charged to merchants with whom we have entered into card acceptance agreements for processing cardholder purchase transactions and acquirer interchange revenue from merchant acquirers on all Discover Network card transactions made by cardholders at merchants with whom merchant acquirers have entered into card acceptance agreements for processing cardholder purchase transactions. We incur an interchange cost to card issuing entities that have entered into contractual arrangements to issue cards on the Discover Network. This cost is contractually established and is based on the card issuing organizations’ transaction volume and is reported as a reduction to discount and interchange revenue. We offer our cardmembers various reward programs, including the Cashback Bonus reward program, pursuant to which we pay certain cardmembers a percentage of their purchase amounts based on the type and volume of the cardmember’s purchases. Reward costs are recorded as a reduction to discount and interchange revenue. For securitization transactions completed on or after November 3, 2004, in accordance with governing securitization documents, we allocate portions of discount and interchange revenue to new securitization transactions, which results in a decrease in discount and interchange revenue and an increase in securitization income. However, cardmember rewards costs associated with the securitized loans are not allocated to investor interests, and as such, do not impact securitization income.  Discount and interchange revenue for the three months ended May 31, 2008 was relatively flat when compared to May 31, 2007, as lower rewards costs related to revised forfeiture assumptions, largely offset lower discount and interchange revenue related to higher allocations to securitized loans which have the effect of reclassifying discount and interchange revenue to securitization income. Discount and interchange revenue decreased $28.1 million, or 19%, for the six months ended May 31, 2008, as compared to May 31, 2007, due to higher allocations to securitized loans, partially offset by lower cardmember rewards costs related to revised forfeiture assumptions and higher discount and interchange revenue related to increased sales volume. The increase in allocations to securitized loans was due to a higher level of outstanding securitized loans receiving such allocations in the current year than in 2007.  Loss on Investments  In the three months ended May 31, 2008, we concluded there had been an other-than-temporary impairment in our investment in the asset-backed commercial paper notes of Golden Key U.S. LLC which invested in mortgage-backed securities. This impairment resulted in a $31.3 million write-down of the notes to $77.4 million. We expect this investment may be restructured by the issuer later in 2008 which could result in further impairment. In comparison, there were no losses on investment securities for the three and six months ended May 31, 2007.  Other Income  Other income includes revenues on various fee-based products, revenues from the referral of declined applications to certain third-party issuers on the Discover Network, unrealized gains and losses related to derivative contracts, gains on sales of mortgage loans and other miscellaneous revenue items. Other income increased $13.9 million, or 71%, primarily due to $10.6 million in lower unrealized losses on interest rate swap agreements and a $6.2 million increase in gains on the sales of merchant portfolios. Other income increased $24.8 million, or 63%, for the six months ended May 31, 2008, as compared to the six months ended May 31, 2007, primarily due to $15.0 million in lower unrealized losses on interest rate swap agreements and a $10.2 million increase in gains on the sale of merchant portfolios.    47    Table of Contents Other Expense  The following table represents the components of other expense for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):                                      For theThree Months EndedMay 31,   2008 vs. 2007increase (decrease)     For theSix Months EndedMay 31,   2008 vs. 2007increase (decrease)        2008   2007    $      %      2008   2007    $       %      Employee compensation and benefits   $  218,290   $  215,447   $ 2,843     1 %   $ 435,660   $ 430,614   $ 5,046     1 %   Marketing and business development     132,038     131,959     79     0 %     273,591     266,501     7,090     3 %   Information processing and communications     79,449     82,396     (2,947 )   (4 %)     157,725     161,240     (3,515 )   (2 %)   Professional fees     81,392     102,853     (21,461 )   (21 %)     155,064     178,918     (23,854 )   (13 %)   Premises and equipment     19,803     20,557     (754 )   (4 %)     39,444     40,132     (688 )   (2 %)   Other expense     75,853     70,546     5,307     8 %     147,684     138,194     9,490     7 %                                                     Total other expense   $ 606,825   $ 623,758   $  (16,933 )   (3 %)   $  1,209,168   $  1,215,599   $  (6,431 )   (1 %)                                                    Total other expense decreased $16.9 million, or 3%, for the three months ended May 31, 2008, as compared to the three months ended May 31, 2007, primarily related to lower legal fees incurred related to the Visa and MasterCard litigation and lower consulting fees during the three months ended May 31, 2007, partially offset by higher fraud expenses in the current period.  Total other expense decreased $6.4 million, or 1%, for the six months ended May 31, 2008, as compared to the six months ended May 31, 2007, primarily related to lower legal fees incurred related to the Visa and MasterCard litigation and lower consulting fees during the six months ended May 31, 2007, partially offset by higher television advertising and higher fraud expenses in the current period.  Income Tax Expense  The following table reconciles our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate:                        For the Three Months EndedMay 31,     For the Six Months EndedMay 31,        2008     2007     2008     2007     U.S. federal statutory income tax rate   35.0 %   35.0 %   35.0 %   35.0 %   U.S. state and local income taxes, net of U.S. federal income tax benefits   3.1     1.8     3.1     1.8     Other   0.1     (0.1 )   0.5     —                                Effective income tax rate   38.2 %   36.7 %   38.6 %   36.8 %                            Liquidity and Capital Resources  We seek to maintain liquidity, capital and funding policies that ensure our credit ratings and bank capitalization levels are sufficient to provide cost effective access to debt and deposit markets thus providing sufficient liquidity to fund our business. Our liquidity and funding risk management policies are designed to mitigate the risk that we may be unable to access adequate financing to service our financial obligations when they come due. Liquidity risk is addressed through various funding criteria and targets that guide our access to the long-term and short-term debt capital markets, the maturity profile of our liabilities, the diversity of our funding sources and investor base, as well as the level of our liquidity reserve as part of a contingency funding plan.    48    Table of Contents Liquidity risk is assessed by several measures including the liquidity position, which measures funding in various maturity tranches. The maturities of the various funding instruments are reviewed during the funding planning and execution process to ensure the maturities are staggered. The mix of funding sources and the composition of our investor base are also reviewed during the funding process to ensure appropriate diversification. Funding sources include externally derived short-term borrowings, asset-backed commercial paper conduit financing, long-term asset-backed securitizations, bank deposits and bank notes.  We monitor and review liquidity and capital management policies and execute strategies to maintain prudent levels of liquidity and capital. Our senior management reviews financial performance relative to these policies, monitors the availability of alternative financing sources, evaluates liquidity risk and capital adequacy, and assesses the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities.  Management has implemented liquidity and capital management policies which seek to provide us with adequate access to and supply of funding through the business cycle. Accordingly, Discover Bank has maintained an investment grade rating and Discover Financial Services received an investment grade rating following the Distribution. Discover Bank has maintained its BBB rating from S&P and has been assigned a Baa2 deposit and Baa2 senior unsecured rating from Moody’s and a BBB rating from Fitch. Discover Financial Services has been assigned a BBB- long-term rating from S&P, a Baa3 senior unsecured rating from Moody’s and a BBB long-term rating from Fitch.  Our Contingency Funding Plan (“CFP”) is designed to withstand a Discover stress event characterized by limited access to the asset-backed securitization and deposit markets over a defined period. Our CFP model incorporates a wide range of potential cash outflows during a liquidity stress event, including, but not limited to: (i) repayment of all debt maturing within an assumed stress period; (ii) expected funding requirements from receivable growth and/or volatility; and (iii) customer cash withdrawals from interest-bearing deposits. If we are unable to continue to securitize our credit card receivables at acceptable pricing levels, or at all, including by reason of the early amortization of any of our securitization transactions, we would seek to liquidate investments, increase bank deposits and use alternative funding sources (such as Federal Reserve Bank sources, Federal Funds, bank notes and unsecured debt) to fund increases in loan receivables and meet our other liquidity needs.  During the first half of 2008, the ongoing disruptions in the debt and asset-backed capital markets caused credit spreads to widen materially and reduced the availability of new issuance in some funding markets. As a result, we retained a portion of the subordinated notes issued during the period as investment securities available-for-sale. At May 31, 2008, our contingent sources included approximately $8.4 billion in our liquidity reserve (primarily invested in Federal Funds sold and bank deposits), $1.7 billion of unutilized commitments from third-party commercial paper asset-backed conduits for securitization funding, and $2.5 billion of unsecured committed credit. In addition, we had AAA-rated note issuance capacity of $4.5 billion in the Discover Card Execution Note Trust, subject to market availability.  Our consolidated statement of financial condition at May 31, 2008 consisted primarily of credit card loan receivables, the balance of which fluctuates from time to time due to trends in credit card spending and payments, as well as the issuance of new securitization transactions and maturities of existing securitization transactions. For the three and six months ended May 31, 2008, we executed $1.9 billion and $3.5 billion of public securitization transactions, respectively.  Equity Capital Management. Management views equity capital as an important source of financial strength. We determine the level of capital necessary to support our business based on our managed credit card loan receivables, goodwill and other intangible assets, taking into account, among other things, regulatory requirements, rating agency guidelines and internally managed requirements to sustain growth.  Under regulatory capital requirements adopted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) and other bank regulatory agencies, FDIC-insured financial institutions must maintain minimum levels of capital that are dependent upon the risk of the financial institutions assets, specifically (a) 3% to 5% of Tier 1 capital, as     49    Table of Contents  defined, to average assets (“leverage ratio”), (b) 4% to 6% of Tier 1 capital, as defined, to risk-weighted assets (“Tier 1 risk-weighted capital ratio”) and (c) 8% to 10% of total capital, as defined, to risk-weighted assets (“total risk-weighted capital ratio”). At May 31, 2008, the leverage ratio, Tier 1 risk-weighted capital ratio and total risk-weighted capital ratio of Discover Bank as well as our other FDIC-insured financial institution, Bank of New Castle, exceeded these regulatory minimums.  Dividend Policy. Although we intend to reinvest a substantial portion of our earnings in our business, we intend to continue to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend on our common stock, subject to the approval of our Board of Directors. The declaration and payment of dividends, as well as the amount thereof, are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other factors deemed relevant by the Board of Directors. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends. In addition, as a result of applicable banking regulations and provisions that may be contained in our borrowing agreements or the borrowing agreements of our subsidiaries, our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders may further be limited.  Stock Repurchase Program. On December 3, 2007, Discover Financial Services announced that its Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of Discover Financial Services’ outstanding stock under a new share repurchase program. This share repurchase program expires on November 30, 2010, and may be terminated at any time. At May 31, 2008, we had not repurchased any stock under this program.  Special Dividend. On June 19, 2007, we declared a special dividend to Morgan Stanley. Pursuant to the special dividend, upon resolution of our outstanding litigation with Visa U.S.A., Inc. and MasterCard Inc., after expenses, we are required to pay Morgan Stanley (1) the first $700 million of value of cash or non-cash proceeds (increased at the rate of 6% per annum until paid in full) (the “minimum proceeds”) and (2) 50% of any proceeds in excess of $1.5 billion, subject to certain limitations and a maximum potential payment to Morgan Stanley of $1.5 billion. All payments by us to Morgan Stanley will be net of taxes payable by us with respect to such proceeds. If, in connection with or following a change in control of our company, the litigation is settled for an amount less than minimum proceeds, we are required to pay Morgan Stanley an amount equal to the minimum proceeds. As a result of our agreement to pay the value of non-cash proceeds, we may be required to pay amounts to Morgan Stanley in excess of cash received in connection with the litigation. The value of non-cash proceeds will be determined by an independent third party.  Current Funding Sources  Securitization Financing. We generate a significant portion of our funding through the securitization of credit card loan receivables utilizing non-consolidated securitization trusts. Securitized loans against which beneficial interests have been issued to third parties are accounted for as sold and are removed from the consolidated statements of financial condition. Certain securitized loans against which certificated beneficial interests have been retained by us result in the removal of credit card loan receivables from the consolidated statements of financial condition and are re-characterized as investment securities. We have historically securitized between approximately 50% and 60% of our managed credit card loan receivables.  We utilize both the term securitization market as well as the privately placed asset-backed commercial paper conduit financing market. Outstanding term financing and asset-backed commercial paper conduit financing at May 31, 2008 were $22.6 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, with the $4.4 billion being net of $0.4 billion funded during May for repayment in June.  The following table summarizes expected maturities of the investors’ interests in securitizations at May 31, 2008 (dollars in thousands):                           Total   Less ThanOne Year   One YearThroughThree Years   Four YearsThroughFive Years   After FiveYears   Expected maturities of the investors’ interest in securitizations   $  26,996,955   $  5,341,685   $  15,552,636   $  3,776,317   $  2,326,317    50    Table of Contents We access the term asset securitization market through the Discover Card Master Trust I and, beginning July 26, 2007, the Discover Card Execution Note Trust. Through the Discover Card Master Trust I, we have been using a structure utilizing Class A, triple-A rated certificates and Class B, single-A rated certificates held by third parties, with credit enhancement provided by the subordinated Class B certificates and a cash collateral account. The Discover Card Execution Note Trust includes three classes of securities sold to investors, the most senior class generally receiving a triple-A rating. In this structure, in order to issue senior, higher rated, classes of notes, it is necessary to obtain the appropriate amount of credit enhancement, generally through the issuance of junior, lower rated classes of notes.  At May 31, 2008, cash collateral accounts underlying the securitization transactions of Discover Card Master Trust I had a balance of $1.6 billion, of which we financed $1.4 billion (reflected in amounts due from asset securitization in the consolidated statements of financial condition). The rights to repayment of a portion of the cash collateral account loans have been sold to a special purpose subsidiary, DRFC Funding LLC, as part of a secured financing and are not expected to be available to creditors of DFS. At May 31, 2008, $0.8 billion is owed related to this secured financing.  The following table summarizes estimated maturities of the cash collateral accounts at May 31, 2008 (dollars in thousands):                           Total   Less ThanOne Year   One YearThroughThree Years   Four YearsThroughFive Years   AfterFive Years   Estimated maturities of cash collateral accounts   $  1,373,131   $  386,025   $  713,158   $  189,474   $  84,474  The securitization structures include certain features designed to protect investors that could result in earlier-than-expected amortization of the transactions, accelerating the need for alternative funding. The primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements (“economic early amortization”). In the event of an economic early amortization (which would occur if the excess spread falls below 0% for a contractually specified period, generally a three-month average), the receivables that otherwise would have been subsequently purchased by the trust from us would instead continue to be recognized on our statement of financial condition since the cash flows generated in the trust would instead be used to repay investors in the asset-backed securities. As of May 31, 2008, no economic early amortization events have occurred. The table below provides information concerning investor interest and related excess spreads at May 31, 2008 (dollars in thousands):                    InvestorInterest   # of SeriesOutstanding   3-Month RollingAverage ExcessSpread     Interchange series(1)   $ 16,064,217   18   8.80 %   Non-interchange series     3,982,738   5   5.39 %                   Discover Card Master Trust I     20,046,955   23   5.39 %   Discover Card Execution Note Trust(1)      6,950,000   16   8.08 %                   Total investor interest   $  26,996,955   39                          (1) Discover Card Master Trust I certificates issued on or after November 4, 2004 and all notes issued by DCENT include cash flows derived from discount and interchange revenue earned by Discover Card.    51    Table of Contents Deposits. We utilize deposits to diversify funding sources and to reduce our reliance on short-term credit-sensitive funding sources, thus enhancing our liquidity position. We obtain our deposits through various channels: direct retail certificates of deposit and money market accounts, retail and institutional brokerage arrangements and money market accounts, under which we receive funds swept through external third-parties. Direct consumer retail deposits are marketed to and received from individual customers, without the use of a third-party intermediary, and are an important, stable funding source that typically reacts more slowly to interest rate changes than other deposits. Brokered deposits are deposits placed to consumers through registered brokers.  Our certificates of deposits have maturities ranging from one month to fifteen years, having a weighted average maturity of 22 months at May 31, 2008. Total interest-bearing deposits at May 31, 2008 were $24.7 billion, the remaining maturities of which are summarized in the following table (dollars in thousands):                           Total   Three Monthsor Less   Over ThreeMonthsThroughSix Months   Over SixMonthsThroughTwelveMonths   Over TwelveMonths   Certificates of deposit in amounts less than $100,000   $ 19,441,068   $ 3,550,377   $ 2,006,814   $ 4,086,288   $ 9,797,589   Certificates of deposit in amounts of $100,000 or greater     917,155     237,498     98,716     261,600     319,341   Savings deposits, including money market deposit accounts     4,357,881     4,357,881     —      —      —                                    Total interest-bearing deposits   $  24,716,104   $  8,145,756   $  2,105,530   $  4,347,888   $  10,116,930                                  Long-Term Borrowings and Bank Notes. On June 12, 2007, we received proceeds on the issuance of $800 million par value of unsecured debt to external third parties. The financing is comprised of $400 million having a three-year maturity with a floating coupon and $400 million with a ten-year maturity with a fixed coupon. The transaction provided additional liquidity to us to support funding requirements of our subsidiaries.  At May 31, 2008, we had $250 million par value in bank notes outstanding which mature in February 2009. We may issue additional bank notes under our Global Bank Note Program given that certain credit criteria are met.  Available Credit Facilities  Secured Committed Credit Facilities. The maintenance of revolving committed credit agreements serves to further diversify our funding sources. In connection with our asset securitization program, we have access to committed undrawn funding capacity through third-party bank-sponsored securitization conduits to support credit card loan receivables funding requirements. At May 31, 2008, these conduits totaled $6.5 billion, of which $1.7 billion was unused. The original commitments of these facilities range from 364-day renewable agreements to multi-year extendable commitments.  Unsecured Committed Credit Facilities. As of May 31, 2008, our unsecured committed credit facility of $2.5 billion had a remaining life of 48-months. This facility serves to diversify our funding sources and enhance our liquidity. This facility became effective at the time of the Distribution, is provided by a group of major global banks, and is available to both Discover Financial Services and Discover Bank. We anticipate that the facility will support general liquidity needs and may be drawn to meet short-term funding needs from time to time. At May 31, 2008, we had no outstanding balances due under the facility.    52    Table of Contents Federal Reserve. Discover Bank may access the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s discount window or participate in the Federal Reserve’s Term Auction Facility (“TAF”), if additional liquidity needs arise. In December 2007, the Federal Reserve announced the establishment of a temporary TAF. All depository institutions that are judged to be in generally sound financial condition by their local Reserve Bank and that are eligible to borrow under the primary credit discount window program are eligible to participate in TAF auctions.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Current Funding Sources—Securitization Financing.”  Guarantees  Guarantees are contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make payments to a guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying asset, liability, equity security of a guaranteed party, rate or index. Our guarantees relate to certain representations and warranties made with regard to securitized loans, transactions processed through the Discover Network and indemnifications made in conjunction with the sale of the Goldfish business. Also included in guarantees are contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on another entity’s failure to perform under an agreement. See Note 10: Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees to the consolidated and combined financial statements for further discussion regarding our guarantees.  Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments  In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Contractual obligations at May 31, 2008, which include deposits, long-term borrowings and operating and capital lease obligations, were $27.2 billion. For a description of our contractual obligations as of November 30, 2007, see our annual report on Form 10-K from the fiscal year ending November 30, 2007 under “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments.”  We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on December 1, 2007 at which date we had approximately $283.8 million of tax liabilities, including interest and penalties, related to uncertain tax positions. Because of the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities, we are unable to estimate the years in which settlement will occur with the respective taxing authorities.  At May 31, 2008, we extended credit for consumer and commercial loans of approximately $215 billion. Such commitments arise primarily from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on certain credit cards, provided there is no violation of conditions established in the related agreement. These commitments, substantially all of which we can terminate at any time and which do not necessarily represent future cash requirements, are periodically reviewed based on account usage and customer creditworthiness. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we guarantee payment on behalf of subsidiaries relating to contractual obligations with external parties. The activities of the subsidiaries covered by these guarantees, if any, are included in our consolidated and combined financial statements.      Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio. We are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates.  Interest Rate Risk. Changes in interest rates impact interest-earning assets, principally credit card loan receivables, as well as excess spread received in connection with the securitized loan receivables against which beneficial interests have been issued. Changes in interest rates also impact interest sensitive liabilities that finance these assets, including asset-backed securitizations, short-term and long-term borrowings and deposits.    53    Table of Contents Our interest rate risk management policies are designed to reduce the potential volatility of earnings that may arise from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the existing repricing schedules of credit card loan receivables as well as our right, with notice to cardmembers, to reprice certain fixed or floating rate credit card loan receivables to a new interest rate in the future. To the extent that asset and related financing repricing characteristics of a particular portfolio are not matched effectively, we may utilize interest rate derivative contracts, such as swap agreements, to achieve our objectives. Interest rate swap agreements effectively convert the underlying asset or financing from fixed to floating rate or from floating to fixed rate.  We use an interest rate sensitivity simulation to assess our interest rate risk exposure. For purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical, adverse change in interest rates over the 12-month period from our reporting date, we assume that all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of the beginning of the period.  Interest rate sensitive assets are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next 12-month period. Our interest rate sensitive assets include certain loan receivables, Federal Funds sold, certain amounts due from asset securitizations, interest-earning deposits in other banks and certain investment securities. Portions of our credit card loan receivables have fixed interest rates, although we have the right, with notice to cardmembers, to subsequently reprice these receivables to a new interest rate unless the account has been closed or the cardmember opts out of repricing actions. Therefore, we consider a portion of the credit card loan receivables with a fixed interest rate to be interest rate sensitive. We measured the earnings sensitivity for these assets from the expected repricing date, which takes into consideration the required notice period. In addition, assets with rates that are fixed at period end but which will mature, or otherwise contractually reset to a market-based indexed or other fixed rate prior to the end of the 12-month period, also are considered to be rate sensitive. The latter category includes certain credit card loans that may be offered at below-market rates for an introductory period, such as balance transfers and special promotional programs, after which the loans will contractually reprice in accordance with our normal market-based pricing structure. For purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for such loans, only the effect of the hypothetical 100 basis point change in the underlying market-based indexed or other fixed rate has been considered rather than the full change in the rate to which the loan would contractually reprice. For assets that have a fixed interest rate at the fiscal period end but which contractually will, or are assumed to, reset to a market-based indexed or other fixed rate during the next 12 months, earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date. In addition, for all interest rate sensitive assets, earnings sensitivity is calculated net of expected loan losses.  Interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next 12-month period. Thus, liabilities that vary with changes in a market-based index, such as Federal Funds or LIBOR, which will reset before the end of the 12-month period, or liabilities whose rates are fixed at the fiscal period end but which will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a market-based indexed rate prior to the end of the 12-month period, also are considered to be rate sensitive. For these fixed rate liabilities, earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date.  Assuming an immediate 100 basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at May 31, 2008, we estimate that the pretax income of lending and related activities over the following 12-month period would be reduced by approximately $93.2 million. We estimate the comparable reduction of pretax income for the 12-month period following November 30, 2007, to be approximately $108.0 million. The hypothetical decline in pretax income was less than the prior year due to lower market-based indexes and their impact to the replacement cost of maturing debt as well as fewer interest rate sensitive liabilities. This was offset in part by widened credit spreads in some funding markets as well as fewer interest rate sensitive credit card receivables.  The model assumes that the balances of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at the period end will remain constant over the next 12-month period. It does not assume any growth, strategic change in business focus, change in asset pricing philosophy or change in asset/liability funding mix. Thus, this model represents a     54    Table of Contents  static analysis that cannot adequately portray how we would respond to significant changes in market conditions such as those recently experienced. Furthermore, the analysis does not necessarily reflect our expectations regarding the movement of interest rates in the near term, including the likelihood of an immediate 100 basis point change in market interest rates, nor necessarily the actual effect on earnings if such rate changes were to occur.  Foreign Currency Exchange Risk. At November 30, 2007, we had foreign currency exchange risk as a result of credit card loan receivables from our U.K. business which were denominated in pounds sterling. These receivables were primarily funded by the issuance of debt by unrelated conduit providers and intercompany lending. We mitigated this risk by using forward contracts to hedge our net investment in international operations. As of May 31, 2008, substantially all of the remaining net assets of discontinued operations were denominated in pounds sterling. We mitigated this risk by using forward foreign currency contracts to hedge the net assets through the date these assets are expected to be dividended to its parent as well as through the date of any potential post-closing adjustments.      Item 4. Controls and Procedures  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), which are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Exchange Act filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Historically, we have relied on certain financial, administrative and other resources of Morgan Stanley to operate our business, including portions of human resources, information technology, accounting, tax, corporate services and treasury. In conjunction with our separation from Morgan Stanley, we are currently in the process of enhancing our own financial, administrative and other support systems or contracting with third parties to replace Morgan Stanley’s systems. We are establishing our own accounting and auditing policies and systems on a stand-alone basis. We have entered into agreements with Morgan Stanley under which Morgan Stanley is providing some of these services to us on a transitional basis, which are expected to end within the third quarter of 2008. We are making these changes as part of our separation from Morgan Stanley and in anticipation of reporting on our internal control over financial reporting.  Other than those noted above, there have been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.  Part II. Other Information      Item 1. Legal Proceedings  In the normal course of business, the Company has been named, from time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions, and other litigation, arising in connection with its activities. Certain of the actual or threatened legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. The Company has historically relied on the arbitration     55    Table of Contents  clause in its cardmember agreements, which has limited the costs of, and its exposure to, litigation. The Company is also involved, from time to time, in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental agencies regarding its business, including, among other matters, accounting and operational matters, some of which may result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other relief. Litigation and regulatory actions could also adversely affect the Company’s reputation.  The Company contests liability and/or the amount of damages as appropriate in each pending matter. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly in cases where claimants seek substantial or indeterminate damages or where investigation and proceedings are in the early stages, the Company cannot predict with certainty the loss or range of loss, if any, related to such matters, how such matters will be resolved, when they will ultimately be resolved, or what the eventual settlement, fine, penalty or other relief, if any, might be. Subject to the foregoing, the Company believes, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that the outcome of the pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, although the outcome of such matters could be material to our operating results and cash flows for a particular future period, depending on, among other things, our level of income for such period.  The Company filed a lawsuit captioned Discover Financial Services, Inc. v. Visa USA Inc., MasterCard Inc. et al. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on October 4, 2004. Through this lawsuit the Company seeks to recover substantial damages and other appropriate relief in connection with Visa’s and MasterCard’s illegal anticompetitive practices that, among other things, foreclosed the Company from the credit and debit network services markets. Trial is currently scheduled for September 9, 2008. This lawsuit follows the U.S. Supreme Court’s October 2004 denial of Visa’s and MasterCard’s petition for review of the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals affirming a lower court decision in a case brought by the U.S. Department of Justice in which the court found that Visa’s and MasterCard’s exclusionary rules violated the antitrust laws and harmed competition and consumers by foreclosing the Company and American Express from offering credit and debit network services to banks. The Company also has challenged certain practices engaged in by Visa in the debit network services market as violative of the antitrust laws.  There can be no assurance that we will be successful in recovering any damages in this action. Upon resolution of the litigation, after expenses, the Company will be required to pay Morgan Stanley the first $700 million of value of cash or non-cash proceeds (increased at the rate of 6% per annum until paid in full) (the “minimum proceeds”), plus 50% of any proceeds in excess of $1.5 billion, subject to certain limitations and a maximum potential payment to Morgan Stanley of $1.5 billion. All payments by the Company to Morgan Stanley will be net of taxes payable by the Company with respect to such proceeds. If, in connection with or following a change of control of the Company, the litigation is settled for an amount less than the minimum proceeds, the Company will be required to pay Morgan Stanley an amount equal to the minimum proceeds. As a result of our agreement to pay the value of non-cash proceeds, we may be required to pay amounts to Morgan Stanley in excess of cash received in connection with the litigation. The value of non-cash proceeds will be determined by an independent third party.      Item 1A. Risk Factors  You should carefully consider each of the risks described below, which supplement the risks disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2007. You should also consider all of the other risks disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K in evaluating us. Our business, financial condition, cash flows and/or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks.    56    Table of Contents Future guidance from the Financial Accounting Standards Board may impact the accounting treatment of the securitization of our credit card receivables, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition, reserve requirements, capital requirements, liquidity, cost of funds and operations.  The Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) is currently engaged in projects to amend Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, as amended (“FAS 140”), and FASB Interpretation No. 46R, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (“FIN 46R”). Currently under FAS 140, the transfers of our credit card receivables in securitization transactions qualify for sale accounting treatment. The trusts used in our securitizations are not consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes because the trusts are qualifying special purpose entities (QSPEs) under FAS 140. Because the transfers qualify as sales and the trusts are not subject to consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the trusts are not reported on our balance sheet under GAAP.  In April 2008, the FASB proposed the elimination of the QSPE concept from GAAP, but it has not formally issued proposed amendments to FAS 140 or FIN 46R. If the QSPE concept is eliminated, our securitization structure will have to be evaluated under FIN 46R for potential consolidation. The FASB will issue its proposed amendments for public comment and, based upon public comments received and other considerations, may revise the amendments before issuing final guidance. Amendments could become effective as early as for our fiscal year beginning December 1, 2008. Although we cannot at this time predict the content of the proposed or final amendments, we may lose sale accounting treatment for previous and future transfers of securitized receivables and we may be required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the trusts, which would materially affect our statement of financial condition. For example, the impact of the potential consolidation, if applied as of May 31, 2008, may require us to add approximately $26 billion of securitized receivables to our assets, add the related debt issued to third-party investors to our liabilities, and reclassify amounts due from securitization.  As a result of the addition of the securitized receivables to our balance sheet, we may be required to increase capital for Discover Bank to satisfy regulatory capital requirements. If Discover Bank were to fail to meet its regulatory capital requirements, it would become subject to restrictions that could materially adversely affect our ability to conduct normal operations, our liquidity and our cost of funds, such as limiting our ability to issue brokered deposits. See “An inability to accept or obtain brokered deposits in the future could materially adversely affect our liquidity position and funding costs” in the “Risk Factors” section in our annual report on Form 10-K. In addition, changes to the accounting treatment for securitizations may impact the market for securitizations, which could result in a weakening in investor demand for our securitized receivables. See “We may be unable to securitize our receivables at acceptable rates or at all, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity, cost of funds, reserves and capital requirements” in the “Risk Factors” section in our annual report on Form 10-K.  As noted above, we cannot at this time predict the proposed or final amendments to FAS 140 and FIN 46R, including whether our current securitization structure will satisfy any new requirements for sale accounting treatment; whether, when and in what form any transfers that currently qualify as sales will be recognized on our balance sheet; what effect the recognition of transfers would have on capital, capital requirements, the ability to maintain a sufficient level of receivables in the trust, or our results of operations; whether the amendments will cause Discover Bank to sponsor fewer securitizations; whether the amendments will trigger any financial covenants in our credit facility; or what effect the amendments will have on our credit ratings. See “We rely in part on unsecured and secured debt for our funding and the inability to access the U.S. or U.K. debt markets could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations” in the “Risk Factors” section in our annual report on Form 10-K.  For the reasons discussed above, if future guidance from FASB impacts the accounting treatment of our securitizations, it could materially adversely affect our financial condition, reserve requirements, capital requirements, liquidity, cost of funds and operations.    57    Table of Contents The success of our acquisition of Diners Club International depends upon our ability to maintain the full operability of the Diners Club International network and integrate the network with the Discover Network. If we are unsuccessful in doing so, we may be unable to sustain and grow our international network business.  On July 1, 2008, we announced our purchase of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Diners Club International for $165 million in cash from Citibank, N.A. (“Citi”). We acquired the Diners Club International network, brand, trademarks, employees, and license agreements with 44 network participants that issue Diners Club cards and that maintain an acceptance network consisting of merchant and cash access locations in 185 countries worldwide. Diners Club licensees are not included in this acquisition. Under the terms of the purchase, Citibank has agreed to remain a significant long-term international issuer on the Diners Club network. Discover will not issue cards or extend consumer credit in international markets as a result of the transaction. Over the next two to three years, we expect to integrate the Diners Club International network with the Discover Network to allow Discover Network cardholders to use their cards at merchants that accept Diners Club cards around the world, and Diners Club cardholders to use their cards on the Discover Network in North America.  The success of our acquisition of Diners Club International in the immediate term depends upon our ability to maintain the full operability of the Diners Club International network for existing Diners Club International cardholders, network participants and merchants. We rely on existing Diners Club International infrastructure to support Diners Club International network operations and the assistance of Citi during a transition period for certain network and operational support services. If we were to lose the assistance of key Diners Club personnel or Citi during the transition, we may face difficulty maintaining operations at the same level. We rely upon numerous network partners in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean for merchant acceptance for existing Diners Club International cardholders. We also rely on the Diners Club International network’s current availability of cash access locations for its existing cardholders. If we are unable to continue to offer either acceptable North American merchant acceptance or sufficient cash access locations to existing Diners Club International cardholders, we may experience decreased transaction volume, which would reduce our revenues.  The long-term success of our acquisition of Diners Club International depends upon the successful integration of the technologies of the Discover Network and the Diners Club International network. We may face difficulties in achieving interoperability between the networks, including higher overall costs or longer timeframes than anticipated, as a result of the complexity of international operations, the potential loss of key Diners Club personnel in the transition, or other factors that we cannot predict at this time. If we are unable to integrate the networks well and at a reasonable cost, we may be unable to achieve the synergies we anticipate and grow our business internationally.  If we are unable to maintain relationships with the network participants that issue Diners Club International cards and that maintain a merchant acceptance network, we may be unable to sustain and grow our international network business.  The success of our acquisition of Diners Club International largely depends upon the cooperation and support of the network participants that issue Diners Club cards and that maintain a merchant acceptance network. Unlike the Discover Network, we have minimal direct merchant relationships in the Diners Club International network, instead relying on network participants located outside the United States to help us sustain and grow our international business. As a result of a number of factors, including any difficulties in the transition and integration process, network participants may choose not to renew the license agreements with us when their terms expire. In addition, the increasingly competitive marketplace for cross-border issuance and acceptance of credit cards may result in lower participation fees for networks like the Diners Club International network. In addition, many of the merchants in the acceptance network, primarily small and mid-size merchants, may not be contractually committed to the network participants for any period of time and may cease to participate in the Diners Club International network at any time on short notice. If we are unable to continue our relationships with network participants or if the network participants are unable to continue their relationships with merchants, our ability to maintain or increase revenues and to remain competitive would be adversely affected.    58    Table of Contents The Federal Reserve Board’s proposed amendments to regulations, if adopted as proposed, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  The Federal Reserve Board has proposed amendments to Regulation AA (Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices) and Regulation Z (Truth in Lending) that place limitations on certain credit card practices and mandate increased disclosures to consumers including, but not limited to, the following:        •    Applying rate increases to existing balances. The proposed amendments would prohibit interest rate increases on outstanding balances except under limited circumstances.        •    Payment allocation. The proposed amendments would require allocation of payments in excess of the required minimum payment to non-promotional balances before promotional balances. For accounts with different annual percentage rates (APRs) on different balances, payments cannot be applied to the lowest-rate balances first.        •    Default pricing. The proposed amendments would restrict imposition of a higher or default APR on existing balances unless an account is 30 days past due.  The comment periods for the proposed amendments expire in August 2008 for Regulation AA and July 2008 for Regulation Z. The Federal Reserve Board has indicated it hopes to publish final rules by the end of the year. We do not know the content of the final amendments nor the resulting impact from the amendments at this time. If the amendments are adopted as proposed, the amendments would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.      Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds
