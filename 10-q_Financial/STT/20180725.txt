ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSIn the normal course of our business activities, we are exposed to a variety of risks. The following description of risk factors consists of updates to the risk factors associated with our business previously disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A of the 2017 Form 10-K. Please refer to those previously disclosed risk factors, in addition to the below risk factors and our other disclosures in our SEC filings, when considering the risks and uncertainties associated with our business activities. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements and should be read in conjunction with Part 1, Financial Information of this Form 10-Q. These risk factors may be important to understanding other statements in this Form 10-Q.Consummation of our planned acquisition of Charles River Development is subject to the satisfaction of closing conditions and regulatory approvals, the failure of which may prevent or delay the consummation of the acquisition.On July 20, 2018, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Charles River Development, a provider of investment management front office tools and solutions. The acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2018, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of closing conditions and regulatory approvals. We cannot provide any assurance that all of the closing conditions will be satisfied or waived, nor can we provide any assurance that all necessary regulatory approvals will be obtained. The failure to satisfy some or all of the required conditions or the failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals could delay the completion of the acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring.We propose to finance the acquisition in part through the issuance of common stock and preferred stock; however, the closing of the acquisition is not conditioned upon such financing, and such financing may not be available on terms consistent with our expectations or at all. We bear the risk that such equity issuances are not successful, including without limitation, the financial risks and risks associated with our capital structure and regulatory compliance. In addition, if completed, the effects of such financing may be more dilutive to our existing shareholders than contemplated when we entered into the acquisition agreement. Even if we successfully consummate our planned acquisition of Charles River Development, we may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction or the benefits may take longer to realize than expectedOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the planned acquisition will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate Charles River Development into our business and realize anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies. The integration of Charles River Development into our business will be a complex, costly and time-consuming process, and our management may face significant challenges in implementing such integration, including, without limitation, challenges related to:•retaining Charles River Development’s current clients, some of which are our competitors;•integrating Charles River Development’s software solutions with our existing products and services and related operations and systems, including performance, risk and compliance analytics, investment manager operations outsourcing, accounting, administration and custody; •retaining key employees of Charles River Development;•implementing our plans to develop an integrated front-to-middle-to-back office platform that is competitive and meets our clients’ requirements; and•accelerating the development of enhancements to the features and functions of Charles River Development’s software solutions. Any delay or failure in achieving any of the foregoing could adversely impact the expected benefits of the acquisition.  State Street Corporation | 97Table of Contents ITEM 2.
