ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS   The discussion below should be read in conjunction with the Risk Factors section included in Part I, Item 1A in our 2006 Form 10-K.  Liquidity Management   Liquidity management is critical to the management of our consolidated balance sheet and to our ability to service our customer base. In managing our consolidated balance sheet, our primary source of funding is customer deposits. Although historically we have maintained a stable deposit base that has grown with the growth of our assets under custody, our deposits are predominantly short-term, transaction-based deposits by institutional investors. Our ability to continue to attract these deposits, and other funding sources such as certificates of deposit and commercial paper, is subject to variability based upon a number of factors, including volume and volatility in the global securities markets, our credit rating and the relative interest rates that we are prepared to pay for these liabilities.   We generally use our sources of funds to invest in a portfolio of investment securities and to maintain the liquidity necessary to provide extensions of credit to our customers. These funds are invested in a variety of assets ranging from short-term interest-bearing deposits with banks to longer-maturity investment securities. While we have historically maintained our investment portfolio at a relatively short duration with respect to interest-rate risk, the average maturity of the investment portfolio is significantly longer than the contractual maturity of our deposit base. In addition, as part of our custody business, we provide overdraft financing as a component of our custody services, and liquidity lines to third-party commercial paper conduits and mutual funds, as well as more traditional extensions of credit. The demand for credit is difficult to forecast and control, and may be at its peak at times of dislocation in the securities markets, potentially compounding liquidity issues. Other sources of funding available to us, and upon which we include as a regular component of our liquidity management strategy, include inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from the Federal Reserve discount window or comparable non-U.S. central banking sources.   In a period of financial disruption, or if there were negative developments with respect to State Street, the availability and cost of our funding sources could be adversely affected. In that event, we may incur a significantly higher cost of funds, reducing our net interest revenue, or may need to dispose of a portion of our investment portfolio, which, depending upon market conditions, could result in our realizing a loss upon those dispositions. We devote significant resources to monitoring and managing such liquidity risks, but those efforts may not be successful or sufficient to deal with dramatic or unanticipated changes in the global securities markets or other event-driven reductions in market liquidity.   In our business activities, we assume liquidity risk and a modest amount of interest-rate risk in managing longer-term assets or asset pools which are funded on a short-term basis, or where the customers participating in these products may have a right to the return of cash or assets on limited notice. These business activities include, among others, the unconsolidated asset-backed commercial paper conduits managed by our Structured Products group, securities finance collateral pools and money market and other short-term investment funds. In the commercial paper conduits, for example, pools of medium- and long-term financial instruments, principally mortgage- and other asset-backed securities, are financed through the issuance of short-term commercial paper. The conduits strive to maintain a positive margin between the rate of return on their longer-term assets and the short-term cost of funding, and they mitigate their interest-rate risk primarily by investing in longer-term, higher-return floating-rate securities. This mismatch in the maturity of the investment pools and funding creates risk if disruptions occur in the liquidity of the short-term debt or asset-backed securities  62       markets, or if the cost of short-term borrowings exceeds the conduits' rate of return on the investment securities portfolio.   In connection with the administration of the activities of the commercial paper conduits, we provide contractual back-up liquidity to the conduits if they cannot meet their liquidity needs through the issuance of commercial paper. These contractual obligations include the liquidity asset purchase agreements, described in the "Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis in Part I of this Form 10-Q. Other institutions can and do provide liquidity to the conduits. In the event that maturing commercial paper cannot be placed by the conduits, the liquidity providers are required by contract to, among other things, provide liquidity to the conduits by purchasing portfolio assets from them. We may also provide liquidity by purchasing commercial paper or providing other extensions of credit to the conduits.   Beginning in the third quarter of 2007, asset-backed commercial paper conduits, including those sponsored by State Street, experienced significantly less liquidity and higher borrowing costs in the global fixed-income securities markets, and in a few cases, required liquidity support from their sponsoring bank. Although conditions have improved since late August and early September 2007, the fixed-income markets remain significantly disrupted, and the potential for decreased liquidity, increased funding costs and adverse asset valuations remains a material risk. While the conduits historically have rarely drawn upon our contractual back-up liquidity support, we on occasion have purchased, and during the third quarter of 2007 did purchase, commercial paper from the conduits, which we recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. We may do so again in the future. These purchases of commercial paper were funded from our general liquidity, and the liquidity asset purchase agreements were not drawn upon.   The conduits are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements. However, if circumstances change we may be required, under existing accounting standards, to consolidate the conduits onto our consolidated balance sheet. For example, if changes in market conditions require us to update the assumptions in our expected loss model, we may be required to increase the amount of first-loss notes in order for the investors in the first-loss notes to continue to be considered the primary beneficiaries of the conduits. If, for some reason, the conduits are not able to issue additional first-loss notes or take other actions, we may be determined to be the primary beneficiary of the conduits, and would be required to consolidate the conduits' assets and liabilities onto our consolidated balance sheet. Additional information about our use of an expected loss model and the third-party investors in first-loss notes is provided in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q. Existing accounting standards may be changed or interpreted differently in the future in a manner that increases the risk of consolidation of the conduits.   Consolidation, or the purchase of assets of the conduits pursuant to the contractual agreements described above, could affect the size of our consolidated balance sheet and related funding requirements, our financial and regulatory capital ratios and, if the conduit assets include unrealized losses, could require us to recognize those losses. Because of our contractual agreements to purchase assets from the conduits through the liquidity asset purchase agreements under specified conditions, we are also exposed to the credit risks in the conduits' portfolios. Additional information about the size and composition of the conduits' balance sheets is included in the "Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis in Part I of this Form 10-Q.   Other of our business activities that involve managing pools of assets that are funded in the short-term markets and invested in longer-term markets include managing securities finance collateral pools and money market and other short-term investment funds. These businesses involve similar risks inherent in an arbitrage of funding and investment; however, in these businesses, we primarily act in an agency capacity and do not have the direct principal risk. For example, if a collateral pool or a money market fund that we manage were to have unexpected liquidity demands from investors in the pool that  63       exceeded available liquidity, the investment pools would be required to sell assets to meet those redemption requirements. During periods of disruption in the credit markets, it may be difficult to sell the assets held by these pools at a reasonable price. In those circumstances, the financial loss accrues to the pools' investors and not to us.   Similarly, credit risks inherent in these portfolios are attributable to the investors in the investment pools and not to State Street. These investment pools may have significant exposure to individual credits. While we do not bear the direct financial risks of these pools, the incurrence of substantive losses in these pools, particularly in money market funds, could result in significant harm to our reputation and significantly and adversely affect the prospects of our associated business units. In some circumstances, we may seek to mitigate that risk by compensating the investment pools for all or a portion of such losses even if not contractually obligated to do so; however, that would potentially result in the recognition of significant losses or a greater use of capital than we have available.   Investment, operational and other decisions and actions, often made to achieve scale and other benefits, are implemented over multiple investment pools as applicable, increasing the opportunity for losses, even small losses, to have a significant effect. To mitigate these risks to the investment pools, we seek to prudently manage the duration and credit exposure of the pools, to satisfy large liquidity demands by the in-kind delivery of securities held by the pools and to closely monitor liquidity demand from investors; however, market conditions or increased defaults could result in our inability to effectively manage those risks. To some degree, all of our investment management pools hold potential risks to our reputation and business prospects if the asset pools that we manage have higher than anticipated redemption or other liquidity requirements and the pools incur losses to meet such demands.   Other parts of our business where we primarily act as agent, such as other investment management activities of State Street Global Advisors and certain of State Street Global Markets' business units, do not currently have significant liquidity requirements; however, as we develop new products in response to customer demand and to remain competitive in a dynamic marketplace, we could take on more principal risk in these businesses. Any increase in the extent to which these or other businesses assume principal positions would increase the risks associated with our liquidity management strategy.   The disruption in the global fixed-income securities markets beginning in the third quarter of 2007 has had a substantially greater impact upon liquidity and valuations in those markets than has historically been experienced. Because demand from investors for fixed-income products has markedly decreased and dealers have been less prepared to take principal exposures, funding sources, such as the commercial paper markets for conduits, have been less reliable and more expensive. At the same time, the ability of the markets to absorb the sale of large portfolios of certain types of securities has been substantially impaired. These conditions have also led to greater difficulty in accurately valuing portfolio positions. These market conditions have made the management of our own and our clients' liquidity significantly more challenging. Through prudent actions and careful monitoring, we were successful in avoiding any significant adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations during the third quarter. However, as discussed above, the risks to State Street inherent in its management of liquidity are significant, and a further deterioration in the credit markets could adversely affect our consolidated financial position, including our regulatory capital ratios, and could adversely affect our results of operations and our business prospects in the future.

This program was publicly announced on March 16, 2006, and was reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2006. On March 15, 2007, our Board of Directors authorized a second program for the purchase of up to 15 million additional shares of our common stock. This program was publicly announced on March 15, 2007, and was reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2007. There is no expiration date for either program.  ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION   On October 30, 2007, the Executive Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved amendments to the State Street Corporation Executive Supplemental Retirement Plan, or "ESRP," formerly known as the State Street Corporation Supplemental Defined Benefit Pension Plan. These amendments, which reflect a shift from a defined benefit to a defined contribution structure, will result in a reduction in future benefits for participants and costs of the ESRP to State Street and greater predictability of such costs. Each of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Ronald E. Logue, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Edward J. Resch, and our Vice Chairmen, William W. Hunt, Joseph L. Hooley and Joseph C. Antonellis, collectively the "Named Executives," participates in the ESRP.   The ESRP provides retirement benefits to officers at the executive vice president level or higher. The following summarizes these benefits, as in effect prior to the October 30, 2007 amendments. Benefits for officers elected executive vice president on or after March 1, 2000, including Messrs. Hooley, Hunt, and Resch, accrued at the annual rate of 2.5% of eligible earnings up to a maximum of 50% of eligible earnings. For officers elected executive vice president prior to February 2000, including Messrs. Logue and Antonellis, the benefit is 50% of eligible earnings. For these purposes, benefits are expressed as a life annuity commencing at age 65, and eligible earnings consist, generally, of the five-year average of base salary plus bonus under the applicable annual incentive plan. Participants must be 53 years old and their combined age and years of service must total 60 before they vest in all or a portion of their accrued benefit and are therefore eligible for early retirement. For participants who retire early, the benefit is reduced by a factor of 3% for each year under the age of 65. However, any participant who on January 1, 2005 was at least age 55 and had completed at least 10 years of service is subject instead to a monthly early retirement reduction of his or her accrued benefit aggregating to 1% per year between ages 60 and 65 and to 2.5% per year between ages 53 and 60 (the "pre-2005 reduction factors"). Amounts payable under the ESRP are offset by amounts that are payable under the State Street Management Supplemental Retirement Plan, the State Street qualified defined benefit plan and other sources, including a former employer's pension plan, but excluding social security.  65        The amendments to the ESRP include, effective January 1, 2008, ceasing all future benefit accruals under both defined benefit formulas except for a two-year transition subsidy to participants who meet a specified combination of age and completed years of eligible service on December 31, 2007. The subsidy will provide for the continued accrual of benefits under the respective defined benefit formula through January 1, 2010. Other than Mr. Hunt, each of the Named Executives is eligible for the subsidy. If a participant's employment ends during the transition period, his or her benefit calculation will be based on a final average pay formula consisting of the average of the highest five consecutive years' pay in the ten-year period preceding the date of termination. Those eligible participants still in service on January 1, 2010 will have their accrued benefit calculated as of that date. Thereafter, the amount of that benefit will be increased 3% for each year that they remain employed by State Street through 2017. Due to the special circumstances of his late career hire as our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Resch will receive one extra year of transition subsidy, for a total of three years, and will qualify for the pre-2005 reduction factors, although otherwise ineligible for those factors based on his age and service.   After their respective transition periods end, each of the Named Executives will receive each year that they remain employed by State Street an annual defined contribution credit to their ESRP account of $200,000 which may be allocated among available notional investment options by the participant. Each Named Executive will also receive each year an additional $200,000 credit allocated automatically to a notional State Street stock fund or the Executive Compensation Committee may choose instead, in lieu of this latter $200,000 credit, to grant a $200,000 deferred stock award under State Street's 2006 Equity Incentive Plan for the applicable year. Vested participants who terminate their employment on or after January 1, 2008, will receive their benefit from the ESRP in three equal annual installments with the first payment commencing on the first day of the month following the six-month anniversary of their termination of employment.
