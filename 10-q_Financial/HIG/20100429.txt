Item 1A.   RISK FACTORS    Investing in The Hartford involves risk. In deciding whether to invest in The Hartford, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, any of which could have a significant or material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, operating results or liquidity of The Hartford. This information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and the other reports and materials filed by The Hartford with the SEC.  Our operating environment remains challenging in light of uncertainty about the timing and strength of an economic recovery and the impact of governmental budgetary and regulatory initiatives. The steps we have taken to realign our businesses and strengthen our capital position may not be adequate to mitigate the financial, competitive and other risks associated with our operating environment, particularly if economic conditions deteriorate from their current levels or regulatory requirements change significantly, and we may be required to or we may seek to raise additional capital or take other strategic or financial actions that could adversely affect our business and results or trading prices for our capital stock.  Persistent volatility in financial markets and uncertainty about the timing and strength of a recovery in the global economy adversely affected our business and results in 2009, and we believe that these conditions may continue to affect our operating environment in 2010. High unemployment, lower family income, lower business investment and lower consumer spending in most geographic markets we serve have adversely affected the demand for financial and insurance products, as well as their profitability in some cases. Our results, financial condition and statutory capital remain sensitive to equity and credit market performance, and we expect that market volatility will continue to pressure returns in our life and property and casualty investment portfolios and that our hedging costs will remain high. Until economic conditions become more stable and improve, we also expect to experience realized and unrealized investment losses, particularly in the commercial real estate sector where significant market illiquidity and risk premiums exist that reflect the current uncertainty in the real estate market. Deterioration or negative rating agency actions with respect to our investments could also indirectly adversely affect our statutory capital and risk-based capital ratios, which could in turn have other negative consequences for our business and results.  The steps we have taken to realign our businesses and strengthen our capital position may not be adequate if economic conditions do not stabilize in line with our forecasts or if they experience a significant deterioration. These steps include ongoing initiatives, particularly the execution risk relating to the repositioning of our investment portfolios. In addition, we have modified our variable annuity product offerings and, in October 2009, launched a new variable annuity product. However, the future success of this new variable annuity product will be dependent on market acceptance. The level of market acceptance of this new product will directly affect the level of variable annuity sales of the Company in the future. If our actions are not adequate, our ability to support the scale of our business and to absorb operating losses and liabilities under our customer contracts could be impaired, which would in turn adversely affect our overall competitiveness. We could be required to raise additional capital or consider other actions to manage our capital position and liquidity or further reduce our exposure to market and financial risks. We may also be forced to sell assets on unfavorable terms that could cause us to incur charges or lose the potential for market upside on those assets in a market recovery. We could also face other pressures, such as employee recruitment and retention issues and potential loss of distributors for our products. Finally, trading prices for our capital stock could decline as a result or in anticipation of sales of our common stock or equity-linked instruments.  Even if the measures we have taken (or take in the future) are effective to mitigate the risks associated with our current operating environment, they may have unintended consequences. For example, rebalancing our hedging program may better protect our statutory surplus, but also result in greater U.S. GAAP earnings volatility. Actions we take may also entail impairment or other charges or adversely affect our ability to compete successfully in an increasingly difficult consumer market.  Regulatory developments relating to the recent financial crisis may also significantly affect our operations and prospects in ways that we cannot predict. U.S. and overseas governmental and regulatory authorities, including the SEC, the Office of Thrift Supervision, or the OTS, the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority are considering enhanced or new regulatory requirements intended to prevent future crises or otherwise stabilize the institutions under their supervision. The reforms being discussed include several that contemplate comprehensive restructuring of the regulation of the financial services industry, including possibly the merger of the OTS with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Enactment of such measures likely would lead to stricter regulation of financial institutions generally, and heightened prudential requirements for systemically important firms in particular. Such measures could include taxation of financial transactions, liabilities and employee compensation.   116    Table of Contents  Other changes under discussion in the U.S. include: breaking up firms that are considered “too big to fail” or mandating certain barriers between their activities in order to allow for an orderly resolution of failing financial institutions; establishing a “Federal Insurance Office” within Treasury to, among other things, conduct a study of how to improve insurance regulation in the United States; providing regulators with new means of limiting activities of financial firms; regulating compensation in the financial services industry; enhancing corporate governance, especially regarding risk management; and creating a new agency, the “Consumer Financial Protection Agency,” to protect U.S. consumers who buy financial products. A substantial number of the financial reforms currently discussed in the U.S. and globally may become law, although it is difficult to predict which will become law, how such reforms will be implemented or the exact impact they will have on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for a particular future period. If adopted, these changes will require regulatory implementation, the full impact of which will not be known until later.  New regulations will likely affect critical matters, including capital requirements, and published proposals by insurance regulatory authorities that have reduced or could reduce the pressure on our capital position may not be adopted, may be adopted in a form that does not afford as much capital relief as anticipated, or may be subsequently reversed in the future. If we fail to manage the impact of these developments effectively, our prospects, results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  The stress scenario modeled projections and the related assumptions that we disclosed in connection with our repurchase of the Series E Preferred Stock were prepared for purposes of planning the public offerings for the repurchase of the Series E Preferred Stock. Actual sources and uses of capital under stressed economic conditions may vary significantly, as the stress scenario does not incorporate all risks to which the Company would be exposed under stressed economic conditions and the models used may, in any event, produce inaccurate projections. Investors are cautioned that the stress scenario modeled projections and related assumptions are therefore of limited value in assessing the Company’s future prospects.  In connection with determining the structure and size of our capital raise for the repurchase of the Series E Preferred Stock held by Treasury, we utilized stressed model projections that depend on a variety of factors and assumptions each of which is subject to business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies that are inherently unpredictable. Using these stress model projections, we also illustrated the potential sources and uses of capital during 2010 and 2011. We created these hypothetical stress-scenario models on the basis of fundamental assumptions about the performance of key variables, including, among others, stressed equity market levels and losses in the residential and commercial real estate markets. The stress-scenario models resulting from these assumptions not only illustrate hypothetical sources and uses of capital, but also produce assumed stress-scenario values for a variety of other variables that can independently significantly affect surplus. Although our modeled stress-scenario projections reflect assumptions about the adverse performance of these other variables, they do not reflect further impacts on surplus that could arise from additional, discrete adverse performance of these other variables. The actual performance of these other variables, which include but are not limited to interest rates, Yen/U.S. dollar, Yen/Euro and other foreign exchange rates, market volatility, catastrophe loss experience and policyholder behavior, may differ materially from the assumptions included in the projections and may, as a result, cause actual results in a stress scenario to differ materially from those that were projected. Moreover, our assumptions do not reflect all risks to which the Company would be exposed under stressed economic conditions. As a result, actual results may differ, and in the past have differed, materially from projected results. Investors are cautioned that the stress scenario modeled projections and related assumptions are therefore of limited value in assessing our future prospects.  No outside party has approved or provided any other form of assurance with respect to these projections, and these projections have not been examined by any independent expert. Projections are also necessarily speculative in nature and the risk that our modeled projections will be wrong is increased as a result of the number and nature of the variables underlying the assumptions on which they are based and the fact that they do not reflect other important risks that would be present in a severely constrained operating environment as described above. Many of these variables are also beyond our control and influenced by a variety of factors, and it can be expected that one or more of our assumptions will prove to be incorrect, possibly in material ways, especially in a stress scenario. Moreover, the reliability of forecasted information diminishes the farther in the future that data is projected. Our actual sources and uses of capital in a stress scenario may vary significantly and adversely from those we projected. Investors are accordingly cautioned not to place undue reliance on information included or incorporated by reference in the Offerings relating to our projected capital position in these stress scenarios, and investors should also understand that these projections are of limited value in assessing the Company’s prospects in an environment that is not subject to stress assumptions. Because we prepared this information for purposes of determining the structure and size of our capital raise for the repurchase of the Series E Preferred Stock, we do not undertake to update this information.   117    Table of Contents  Although we repurchased our Series E Preferred Stock issued to Treasury in the CPP, we remain subject to certain restrictions, oversight and costs relating to our receipt of federal assistance and our status as a savings and loan holding company that could materially affect our business, results and prospects.  Even though we repurchased all of the Series E Preferred Stock, we do not intend to repurchase the related warrant. Although we believe we will no longer be subject to the executive compensation restrictions, provisions of our agreement with Treasury relating to the CPP will remain in effect for so long as Treasury continues to hold the warrant or shares of our common stock received upon exercising the warrant, and we will continue to be a savings and loan holding company by virtue of our ownership of Federal Trust Bank (“FTB”), a federally chartered, FDIC-insured thrift, the acquisition of which was a condition to our participation in the CPP. We will therefore remain subject to various restrictions, oversight and costs and other potential consequences that could materially affect our business, results and prospects, including the following:     •   As a savings and loan holding company, we are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OTS, including with respect to required capital, cash flow, organizational structure, risk management and earnings at the parent company level, and to the OTS reporting requirements. All of our activities must be financially-related activities as defined by federal law (which includes insurance activities), and the OTS has enforcement authority over us, including the right to pursue administrative orders or penalties and the right to restrict or prohibit activities determined by the OTS to be a serious risk to FTB. We must also be a source of strength to FTB, which could require further capital contributions.       •   We believe that the limitations on the amount and form of bonus, retention and other incentive compensation that we may pay to executive officers and senior management no longer apply to us from and after the date we repurchased all of the Series E Preferred Stock. Nevertheless, recipients of federal assistance continue to be subject to intense scrutiny, and future regulatory initiatives could be adopted at the federal or state level that have the effect of constraining the business or management of those enterprises. These initiatives include a pending proposal before the Connecticut legislature that would, if adopted, impose a tax on bonuses paid by recipients of TARP funds. In addition, the Obama administration has proposed a financial crisis responsibility tax that would be levied on the largest financial institutions in terms of assets for at least the next ten years to recoup any shortfall from the TARP. We cannot predict the scope or impact of future regulatory initiatives or the effect that they may have on our ability to attract and retain key personnel, the cost and complexity of our compliance programs or on required levels of regulatory capital.       •   Future federal statutes may adversely affect the terms of the CPP that remain applicable to us, and Treasury may amend the terms of our agreement unilaterally if required by future statutes, including in a manner materially adverse to us.    Our ability to declare and pay dividends is subject to limitations.  The payment of future dividends on our capital stock is subject to the discretion of our board of directors, which considers, among other factors our operating results, overall financial condition, credit-risk considerations and capital requirements, as well as general business and market conditions.  Moreover, as a holding company that is separate and distinct from our insurance subsidiaries, we have no significant business operations of our own. Therefore, we rely on dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries and other subsidiaries as the principal source of cash flow to meet our obligations. These obligations include payments on our debt securities and the payment of dividends on our capital stock. The Connecticut insurance holding company laws limit the payment of dividends by Connecticut-domiciled insurers. In addition, these laws require notice to and approval by the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment by those subsidiaries of any dividend if the dividend and other dividends or distributions made within the preceding 12 months exceeds the greater of:     •   10% of the insurer’s policyholder surplus as of December 31 of the preceding year, and       •   net income, or net gain from operations if the subsidiary is a life insurance company, for the previous calendar year, in each case determined under statutory insurance accounting principles.    In addition, if any dividend of a Connecticut-domiciled insurer exceeds the insurer’s earned surplus, it requires the prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Commissioner.  The insurance holding company laws of the other jurisdictions in which our insurance subsidiaries are incorporated, or deemed commercially domiciled, generally contain similar, and in some instances more restrictive, limitations on the payment of dividends. Our property-casualty insurance subsidiaries are permitted to pay up to a maximum of approximately $1.4 billion in dividends to us in 2010 without prior approval from the applicable insurance commissioner. Statutory dividends from our life insurance subsidiaries in 2010 require prior approval from the applicable insurance commissioner. The aggregate of these amounts, net of amounts required by our subsidiary Hartford Life, Inc., or HLI, is the maximum our insurance subsidiaries could pay to us in 2010. In 2009, we and HLI received $700 in dividends from our life insurance subsidiaries representing the movement of a life subsidiary to us, and we received $251 in dividends from our property-casualty insurance subsidiaries. During the first quarter of 2010, neither we nor HLI received dividends from the life insurance subsidiaries. During the first quarter of 2010, we received $450 in dividends from its property-casualty insurance subsidiaries.   118    Table of Contents  Our rights to participate in any distribution of the assets of any of our subsidiaries, for example, upon their liquidation or reorganization, and the ability of holders of our common stock to benefit indirectly from a distribution, are subject to the prior claims of creditors of the applicable subsidiary, except to the extent that we may be a creditor of that subsidiary. Claims on these subsidiaries by persons other than us include, as of March 31, 2010, claims by policyholders for benefits payable amounting to $117.0 billion, claims by separate account holders of $160.2 billion, and other liabilities including claims of trade creditors, claims from guaranty associations and claims from holders of debt obligations, amounting to $14.5 billion.  In addition, as a savings and loan holding company, we are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OTS, including with respect to required capital, cash flow, organization structure, risk management and earnings at the parent company level.  Holders of our capital stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Moreover, our common stockholders are subject to the prior dividend rights of any holders of our preferred stock or depositary shares representing such preferred stock then outstanding. As of March 31, 2010, there were 575,000 shares of our Series F Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. Under the terms of the Series F Preferred Stock, our ability to declare and pay dividends on or repurchase our common stock will be subject to restrictions in the event we fail to declare and pay (or set aside for payment) full dividends on the Series F Preferred Stock.  The terms of our outstanding junior subordinated debt securities also prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our capital stock or purchasing, acquiring, or making a liquidation payment on such stock, if we have given notice of our election to defer interest payments but the related deferral period has not yet commenced or a deferral period is continuing.  Our framework for managing business risks may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss to us that could adversely affect our businesses.  Our business performance is highly dependent on our ability to manage risks that arise from a large number of day-to-day business activities, including insurance underwriting, claims processing, servicing, investment, financial and tax reporting and other activities, many of which are very complex and for some of which we rely on third parties. We seek to monitor and control our exposure to risks arising out of these activities through a risk control framework encompassing a variety of reporting systems, internal controls, management review processes and other mechanisms. We cannot be completely confident that these processes and procedures will effectively control all known risks or effectively identify unforeseen risks, or that our employees and third-party agents will effectively implement them. Management of business risks can fail for a number of reasons, including design failure, systems failure, failures to perform or unlawful activities on the part of employees or third parties. In the event that our controls are not effective or not properly implemented, we could suffer financial or other loss, disruption of our businesses, regulatory sanctions or damage to our reputation. Losses resulting from these failures can vary significantly in size, scope and scale and may have material adverse effects on our financial condition or results of operations.
