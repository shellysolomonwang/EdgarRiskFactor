Item 1A. Risk Factors.  Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and you should carefully consider them. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. For discussion of our potential risks or uncertainties, please refer to “Item 1A-Risk Factors” included in our 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as set forth in the following updated risk factor, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions.  From time to time, we may be subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to our current and past business operations, including, but not limited to:        •    actions by regulatory authorities that may restrict our ability to increase or maintain our premium rates, require us to reduce premium rates, imposes fines or penalties and result in other expenses;        •    market conduct examinations, for which we are required to pay the expenses of the regulator as well as our own expenses, and which may result in fines, penalties, or other adverse consequences;        •    disputes regarding our lender-placed insurance products including those relating to rates, agent compensation, consumer disclosure, continuous coverage requirements, loan tracking services and other services that we provide to mortgage servicers;        •    disputes over coverage or claims adjudication;        •    disputes over our treatment of claims, in which states or insureds may allege that we failed to make required payments or to meet prescribed deadlines for adjudicating claims;        •    disputes regarding sales practices, disclosures, premium refunds, licensing, regulatory compliance, underwriting and compensation arrangements;        •    disputes with agents, brokers or network providers over compensation and termination of contracts and related claims;        •    disputes alleging bundling of credit insurance and warranty products with other products provided by financial institutions;        •    disputes with tax and insurance authorities regarding our tax liabilities;        •    disputes relating to customers’ claims that the customer was not aware of the full cost or existence of the insurance or limitations on insurance coverage; and        •    industry-wide investigations regarding business practices including, but not limited to, the use and the marketing of certain types of insurance policies or certificates of insurance.  The premiums we charge are subject to review by regulators. If they consider our loss ratios to be too low, they could require us to reduce our rates. Significant rate reductions could materially reduce our profitability.  On October 7, 2013, American Security Insurance Company (“ASIC”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, reached an agreement with the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (“FOIR”) to file for a 10% reduction in lender-placed hazard insurance rates in that state. These rates became effective for new and renewing policies starting in first quarter 2014. As part of the agreement, ASIC eliminated commissions and client quota-share reinsurance arrangements to meet new requirements of lender-placed insurance providers in Florida. ASIC recorded approximately $354,000 and $547,000 of direct earned premiums in Florida for the nine months ended September 2014 and full year 2013, respectively, for the types of policies that are subject to the rate reduction.    66    Table of Contents In addition, on March 21, 2013, the Company and two of its wholly owned subsidiaries, ASIC and American Bankers Insurance Company of Florida (“ABIC”), reached an agreement with the New York Department of Financial Services (“NYDFS”) regarding the Company’s lender-placed insurance business in the State of New York. Under the terms of the agreement, and without admitting or denying any wrongdoing, ASIC made a $14,000 (non tax-deductible) settlement payment to the NYDFS. In addition, among other things, ASIC and ABIC agreed to modify certain business practices in accordance with requirements that apply to all New York-licensed lender-placed insurers of properties in the state, and filed their new lender-placed program and new rates in New York. In August 2014, the NYDFS approved the new rates. The changes to the program affect annual lender-placed hazard and real estate owned policies issued in the State of New York, which accounted for approximately $91,000 and $101,000 of Assurant Specialty Property’s net earned premiums for the nine months ended September 2014 and full year 2013, respectively.  In October 2012, ASIC reached an agreement with the California Department of Insurance to reduce premium rates for lender-placed hazard insurance products by 30.5%. The rate reduction reflects factors specific to California such as continued favorable loss experience in the state and different assumptions about future experience compared to our previous rate filing. The new rates in California began to apply to policies newly issued or renewed with effective dates on or after January 19, 2013. ASIC recorded approximately $69,000 and $106,000 of net earned premiums ($68,000 and $99,000 of gross written premium) in California for the type of policies that are subject to the rate reduction for the nine months ended September 2014 and full year 2013, respectively.  Lender-placed insurance products accounted for approximately 72% and 73% of Assurant Specialty Property’s net earned premiums for the nine months ended September 2014 and full year 2013, respectively. The approximate corresponding contributions to segment net income in these periods were 78% and 87%, respectively. The portion of total segment net income attributable to lender-placed products may vary substantially over time depending on the frequency, severity and location of catastrophic losses, the cost of catastrophe reinsurance and reinstatement coverage, the variability of claim processing costs and client acquisition costs, and other factors. In addition, we expect placement rates for these products to decline.  The Company files rates with the state departments of insurance in the ordinary course of business. As previously disclosed, in addition to this routine correspondence, the Company has been engaged in discussions and proceedings with certain state regulators regarding our lender-placed insurance business. The results of such reviews may vary. It is possible that other state departments of insurance and regulatory authorities may choose to initiate or continue to review the appropriateness of the Company’s premium rates for its lender-placed insurance products. If, in the aggregate further reviews by state departments of insurance lead to significant decreases in premium rates for the Company’s lender-placed insurance products, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  Further, actions by certain regulators—including but not limited to the NYDFS, FOIR and Federal Housing Finance Agency (“FHFA”)—may cause changes to the structure of the lender-placed insurance industry, including the arrangements under which we issue insurance and track coverage on mortgaged properties. These changes could materially adversely affect the results of operations of Assurant Specialty Property and the results of operations and financial condition of the Company.  In addition, the Company is involved in a variety of litigation relating to its current and past business operations and may from time to time become involved in other such actions. In particular, the Company is a defendant in class actions in a number of jurisdictions regarding its lender-placed insurance programs. These cases allege a variety of claims under a number of legal theories. The plaintiffs seek premium refunds and other relief. The Company continues to defend itself vigorously in these class actions and, as appropriate, to enter into settlements.  We participate in settlements on terms that we consider reasonable in light of the strength of our defenses; however, the results of any pending or future litigation and regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable and involve significant uncertainty. Unfavorable outcomes in litigation or regulatory proceedings, or significant problems in our relationships with regulators, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, our reputation, our ratings, and our ability to continue to do business. They could also expose us to further investigations or litigation. In addition, certain of our clients in the mortgage and credit card and banking industries are the subject of various regulatory investigations and litigation regarding mortgage lending practices, credit insurance, debt-deferment and debt cancelation products, and the sale of ancillary products, which could indirectly affect our businesses.    67    Table of Contents Item 2.
