Item 1A. Risk Factors.  Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and you should carefully consider them. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. For discussion of our potential risks or uncertainties, please refer to “Item 1A—Risk Factors” included in our 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as set forth in the additional risk factors below, there have been no material changes during Third Quarter 2010 to the risk factors disclosed in our 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Recently enacted legislation reforming the U.S. health care system may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  In March 2010, President Obama signed Health Care Reform into law. Provisions of Health Care Reform and related reforms have and will become effective at various dates over the next several years and will make sweeping and fundamental changes to the U.S. health care system that are expected to significantly affect the health insurance industry. We are in the process of evaluating the effects of Health Care Reform and specific federal and state rules and regulations that have been and will be promulgated thereunder on our health and employee benefits insurance businesses, as well as the overall market for individual and small group health insurance, disability and dental insurance. We cannot predict or quantify the precise effects of Health Care Reform on our business, but they will include, in particular, a requirement that the loss ratios for some of our product lines be no less than 80%, or that we rebate the difference to consumers; the need to reduce commissions, and the consequent risk that insurance producers may sell less of our products than they have in the past; as well as changes in the benefits provided under some of our products; limits on lifetime and annual benefit maximums; a prohibition from imposing any pre-existing condition exclusion as it applies to enrollees under the age of 19 who apply for coverage; limits on our ability to rescind coverage for persons who have misrepresented or omitted material information when they applied for coverage and, after January 1, 2014, elimination of our ability to underwrite health insurance products with certain narrow exceptions; a requirement to offer coverage to any person who applies for such coverage; increased costs to modify and/or sell our products; intensified competitive pressures that limit our ability to increase rates due to state insurance exchanges; significant risk of customer loss; new and higher taxes and fees; and the need to operate with a lower expense structure at both the business segment and enterprise level. Additionally, certain limitations on the deductibility of employee compensation due to Health Care Reform may affect the deductibility of certain payments made to employees and service providers by various Assurant entities in amounts that have not been determined.  Health Care Reform, among other factors, may materially affect the future profitability of our business and lead to a material impairment of goodwill on the Company’s balance sheet. Generally, management evaluates whether goodwill is impaired by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is developed using certain assumptions and estimates that could change once the impact of Health Care Reform becomes clearer. Management may conclude that goodwill (and other intangible assets) is impaired in future quarters in any of our segments. For more information, see “Item 7—MD&A—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” in this report and in our 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.    61    Table of Contents   A.M. Best, Moody’s, and S&P rate the financial strength of our insurance company subsidiaries, and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease.  Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. A.M. Best rates most of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries. Moody’s rates six of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries and S&P rates seven of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries. These ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. These ratings are subject to periodic review by A.M. Best, Moody’s, and S&P, and we cannot assure that we will be able to retain them. In 2009 for example, S&P lowered its counterparty credit and financial strength ratings of two of our life insurance subsidiaries from A to BBB+ due to the recent operating performance of Assurant Health. In addition, S&P lowered its counterparty credit rating of Assurant, Inc. from BBB+ to BBB, citing reduced earnings diversification, and placed a negative outlook on all Assurant ratings due to pressures on our various businesses from the economic climate. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2010, Moody’s lowered the financial strength rating of four of our insurance subsidiaries that write business for the Health, Employee Benefits and Solutions businesses from A2 to A3 and lowered the senior debt rating of Assurant, Inc. from Baa1 to Baa2, citing uncertainty surrounding the viability of the Company’s core health insurance products in the current environment as the reason. We believe that because of recent economic developments that have negatively affected the entire insurance industry, we are more susceptible to ratings downgrades than in prior years.  If our ratings are lowered from their current levels by A.M. Best, Moody’s, or S&P, our competitive position in the respective insurance industry segments could be materially adversely impacted and it could be more difficult for us to market our products. Rating agencies may take action to lower our ratings in the future due to concerns regarding, among other things, our liquidity or solvency, the competitive environment, the adequacy of our reserves, the outcome of pending litigation or regulatory investigations. They may also change their methodology or requirements for determining ratings, or they may become more conservative in assigning ratings. Ratings agencies or regulators could also increase capital requirements for the Company or its subsidiaries.  Since customers and their advisors place importance on our financial strength ratings, we may lose customers and compete less successfully if we are downgraded. In addition, ratings impact our ability to attract investment capital on favorable terms. If our financial strength ratings are reduced from their current levels by A.M. Best, Moody’s, or S&P, our cost of borrowing would likely increase, our sales and earnings could decrease and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  As of September 30, 2010, contracts representing approximately 15% of Assurant Solutions’ and 24% of Assurant Specialty Property’s net earned premiums and fee income contain provisions requiring the applicable subsidiaries to maintain minimum A.M. Best financial strength ratings ranging from “A” or better to “B” or better, depending on the contract. Our clients may terminate these contracts or fail to renew them if the subsidiaries’ ratings fall below these minimums. Under our marketing agreement with SCI, American Memorial Life Insurance Company (“AMLIC”), one of our subsidiaries, is required to maintain an A.M. Best financial strength rating of “B” or better throughout the term of the agreement. If AMLIC fails to maintain this rating for a period of 180 days, SCI may terminate the agreement.  Additionally, certain contracts in the DRMS business, representing approximately 7% of Assurant Employee Benefits’ net earned premiums for the quarter ended September 30, 2010 contain provisions requiring the applicable subsidiaries to maintain minimum A.M. Best financial strength ratings of “A-” or better. DRMS clients may terminate the agreements and in some instances recapture in force business if the ratings of applicable subsidiaries fall below “A-”. Similarly, distribution and service agreements representing approximately 13% of Assurant Health’s net earned premiums for the quarter ended September 30, 2010 contain provisions requiring the applicable subsidiaries to maintain minimum A.M. Best financial strength ratings of “A-” or better, for the distribution agreements, or “B+” or better, for the service agreement. If the ratings of applicable Assurant Health subsidiaries fall below these threshold ratings levels, distribution and service partners would have the right to terminate their agreements. Termination or failure to renew these agreements could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.    62    Table of Contents     Item 2.
