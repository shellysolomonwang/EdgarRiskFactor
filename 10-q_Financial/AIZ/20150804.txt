Item 1A. Risk FactorsCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and you should carefully consider them. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. For discussion of our potential risks or uncertainties, please refer to “Item 1A-Risk Factors” included in our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our 2015 First Quarter Form 10-Q. Except as set forth in the following updated risk factors, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 2014 Annual Report on Form 10-K and our 2015 First Quarter Form 10-Q.Risks Related to Our Company Our revenues and profits may decline if we were unable to maintain relationships with significant clients, distributors and other parties important to the success of our business. The success of our business depends largely on our relationships and contractual arrangements with significant clients—including mortgage servicers, lenders, mobile device carriers, retailers, OEMs and others—and with brokers, agents and other parties. Many of these arrangements are exclusive and some rely on preferred provider or similar relationships. If our key clients, intermediaries or other parties terminate important business arrangements with us, or renew contracts on terms less favorable to us, our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, each of our Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property segments receives a substantial portion of its revenue from a few clients. As of June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014 no single client accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenue. However, a reduction in business with or the loss of one or more such clients could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations at the respective segment. Examples of important business arrangement include, at Assurant Solutions, relationships with mobile device carriers, retailers and financial and other institutions through which we distribute our products, including an exclusive distribution relationship with SCI relating to the distribution of our preneed insurance policies. In Assurant Specialty Property, we have exclusive and non-exclusive relationships with certain mortgage lenders and manufactured housing lenders and property managers, and in turn we are eligible to insure properties securing loans guaranteed by or sold to government-sponsored entities (“GSEs”) and serviced by the mortgage loan servicers with whom we do business. In our lender-placed insurance business, the change in requirements for eligibility to insure properties securing loans of GSEs—and restrictions imposed by state regulators—could affect our ability to do business with certain mortgage loan servicers or the volume or profitability of such business. In addition, the transfer by mortgage servicer clients of loan portfolios to other carriers or the participation by other carriers in insuring or reinsuring lender-placed insurance risks that we have historically insured could materially reduce our revenues and profits from this business.  We are also subject to the risk that clients, distributors and other parties may face financial difficulties, reputational issues or problems with respect to their own products and services or regulatory restrictions that may lead to decreased sales of our products and services. Moreover, if one or more of our clients or distributors consolidate or align themselves with other companies, we may lose significant business, resulting in material decreases in revenues and profits.66Item 2.
