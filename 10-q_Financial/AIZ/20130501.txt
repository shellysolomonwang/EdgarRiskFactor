Item 1A. Risk Factors.  Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and you should carefully consider them. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. For discussion of our potential risks or uncertainties, please refer to “Item 1A—Risk Factors” included in our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as set forth in the following updated risk factor, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions.  From time to time, we may be subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to our current and past business operations, including, but not limited to:        •    actions by regulatory authorities that may challenge our ability to increase or maintain our premium rates, require us to reduce premium rates, impose fine or penalties and/or result in other fees;        •    disputes regarding our lender-placed insurance products including those relating to rates, agent compensation, consumer disclosure, continuous coverage requirements, loan tracking services and other services that we provide to mortgage servicers;        •    disputes over coverage or claims adjudication including, but not limited to, pre-existing conditions in individual medical contracts and rescissions of policies;        •    disputes over our treatment of claims, in which states or insureds may allege that we failed to make required payments or to meet prescribed deadlines for adjudicating claims;        •    disputes regarding sales practices, disclosures, premium refunds, licensing, regulatory compliance, underwriting and compensation arrangements;        •    disputes with agents, brokers or network providers over compensation and termination of contracts and related claims;        •    disputes alleging bundling of credit insurance and warranty products with other products provided by financial institutions;        •    disputes with tax and insurance authorities regarding our tax liabilities;        •    disputes relating to customers’ claims that the customer was not aware of the full cost or existence of the insurance or limitations on insurance coverage; and        •    industry-wide investigations regarding business practices including, but not limited to, the use and the marketing of certain types of insurance policies or certificates of insurance.  As previously disclosed, on March 21, 2013, the Company, ASIC and ABIC reached an agreement with the NYDFS regarding the Company’s lender-placed insurance business in the State of New York. For additional detail on this settlement, please see Assurant Specialty Property’s results of operations section in “Item 2—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this report, above.  In addition, as previously disclosed, ASIC reached an agreement with the California Department of Insurance to reduce premium rates for lender-placed hazard insurance products by 30.5%. The rate reduction reflects factors specific to California such as continued favorable loss experience in the state and different assumptions about future experience compared to our previous rate filing. The new rates in California began to apply to policies newly issued or renewed with effective dates on or after January 19,    57    Table of Contents  2013. ASIC recorded approximately $111,000 of net earned premiums ($154,000 of gross written premium) for full year 2012 for the type of policies subject to the rate reduction. The actual effect of the California rate decrease on the Company’s net earned premiums and net income over the course of 2013 and beyond will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company’s mix of lender-placed insurance products, lapse rates, rate and timing of renewals, placement rates, changes in client contracts and actual expenses incurred.  As previously disclosed, Assurant Specialty Property’s business strategy has been to pursue long-term growth in lender-placed homeowners insurance and adjacent markets with similar characteristics, such as lender-placed flood insurance and lender-placed mobile home insurance. Lender-placed insurance products accounted for approximately 70% and 71% of Assurant Specialty Property’s net earned premiums for the first quarter of 2013 and full year 2012, respectively. The approximate corresponding contributions to segment net income in these periods were 81% and 90%, respectively. The portion of total segment net income attributable to lender-placed products may vary substantially over time depending on the frequency, severity and location of catastrophic losses, the cost of catastrophe reinsurance and reinstatement coverage, the variability of claim processing costs and client acquisition costs, and other factors. In addition, we expect placement rates for these products to decline.  The Company files rates with the state departments of insurance in the ordinary course of business. As previously disclosed, in addition to this routine correspondence, the Company has been engaged in discussions and proceedings with certain state regulators regarding our lender-placed insurance business. Because assumptions used in rate filings vary by state as a result of differing regulatory requirements, expected loss experience and catastrophe exposure, the results of such reviews may vary widely. It is possible that other state departments of insurance and regulatory authorities may choose to initiate or continue to review the appropriateness of the Company’s premium rates for its lender-placed insurance products. If in the aggregate further reviews by state departments of insurance lead to significant decreases in premium rates for the Company’s lender-placed insurance products, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  Unfavorable outcomes in litigation or regulatory proceedings, or significant problems in our relationships with regulators, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, our reputation, our ratings, and our ability to continue to do business. They could also expose us to further investigations or litigations. In addition, certain of our clients in the mortgage and credit card and banking industries are the subject of various regulatory investigations and/or litigation regarding mortgage lending practices, credit insurance, debt-deferment and debt cancelation products, and the sale of ancillary products, which could indirectly affect our businesses.    58    Table of Contents Item 2.
