Item 1A. Risk Factors  Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and you should carefully consider them. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. For discussion of our potential risks or uncertainties, please refer to “Item 1A—Risk Factors” included in our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as set forth in the following updated risk factor, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions.  From time to time, we may be subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to our current and past business operations, including, but not limited to:        •    disputes over coverage or claims adjudication including, but not limited to, pre-existing conditions in individual medical contracts and rescissions of policies;        •    disputes over our treatment of claims, where states or insured may allege that we failed to make required payments or to meet prescribed deadlines for adjudicating claims;        •    disputes regarding sales practices, disclosures, premium refunds, licensing, regulatory compliance, underwriting and compensation arrangements;        •    disputes with agents, brokers or network providers over compensation and termination of contracts and related claims;        •    actions by regulatory authorities that may challenge our ability to increase or maintain our premium rates, require us to reduce current premium rates and/or result in other fees;        •    disputes alleging packaging of credit insurance products with other products provided by financial institutions;        •    disputes with tax and insurance authorities regarding our tax liabilities;        •    disputes relating to customers’ claims that the customer was not aware of the full cost or existence of the insurance or limitations on insurance coverage; and        •    industry-wide investigations regarding business practices including, but not limited to, the use and the marketing of certain types of insurance policies or certificates of insurance.  In fall 2011, Assurant, along with other insurers and with mortgage servicers, received a request for information from the NYDFS regarding its lender-placed insurance business. On February 7, 2012, the Company and two of its wholly owned insurance subsidiaries, American Security Insurance Company and American Bankers Insurance Company of Florida, each received a subpoena from the NYDFS requesting information regarding the lender-placed business and related document retention practices. In response to the subpoenas, depositions were conducted in late February involving designated witnesses for the Company and the foregoing subsidiaries. On March 23, 2012, the Company received an additional request from the NYDFS for further information relating to its lender-placed insurance program in New York and submitted a response on April 13, 2012. Along with other companies in the industry, the Company has been requested to testify at public hearings of the NYDFS in mid-May and American Security Insurance Company has submitted additional information to the NYDFS in response to the Notice of Public Hearings. The Company is committed to cooperating fully with the NYDFS.    56    Table of Contents In addition, the Company is also engaged in discussions with the California State Department of Insurance (the “Department”) regarding the Company’s lender-placed insurance premium rates. In 2010, the Company submitted a proposed 10% rate decrease, which the Department did not approve. The Company recently re-filed proposed rates. Further discussions with the Department may follow before new rates take effect. The new rates would affect policies that, in 2011, accounted for approximately half of California property insurance net earned premiums.  Unfavorable outcomes in litigation or regulatory proceedings, or significant problems in our relationships with regulators, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, our reputation, and our ability to continue to do business. They could also expose us to further investigations or litigations. In addition, certain of our clients in the mortgage industry are the subject of various regulatory investigations and/or litigation regarding mortgage lending practices, which could indirectly affect our business.    57    Table of Contents   Item 2.
