Item 1A. Risk Factors.  Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and you should carefully consider them. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. For discussion of our potential risks or uncertainties, please refer to “Item 1A—Risk Factors” included in our 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K and March 31, 2010 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except as set forth in the additional risk factor below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Recently enacted legislation reforming the U.S. health care system may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  In March 2010, President Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively, “Health Care Reform”) into law. Provisions of Health Care Reform and related reforms will become effective at various dates over the next several years and make sweeping and fundamental changes to the U.S. health care system that are expected to significantly affect the health insurance industry. We are in the process of evaluating the effects of Health Care Reform and specific federal and state rules and regulations that may be promulgated thereunder on our health and employee benefits insurance businesses, as well as the overall market for individual and small group health insurance, disability and dental insurance. We cannot predict or quantify the precise effects on our business of Health Care Reform, but they will include, among other things, changes in the benefits provided under some of our products; a requirement that the loss ratios for some of our product lines be no less than specified percentages, or that we rebate the difference to consumers; the need to reduce commissions, and the consequent risk that insurance producers may sell less of our products than they have in the past; limits on lifetime and annual benefit maximums; a prohibition from imposing any pre-existing condition exclusion as it applies to enrollees under the age of 19 who apply for coverage; limits on our ability to rescind coverage for persons who have misrepresented or omitted material information when they applied for coverage and, after January 1, 2014; elimination of our ability to underwrite health insurance products with certain narrow exceptions; a requirement to offer coverage to any person who applies for such coverage; increased costs to modify and/or sell our products; intensified competitive pressures that limit our ability to increase rates due to state insurance exchanges; significant risk of customer loss; new taxes and fees; and the need to operate with a lower expense structure at both the business segment and enterprise level.  Health Care Reform may materially affect the future profitability of our business and lead to a material impairment of goodwill on the Company’s balance sheet. Generally, management evaluates whether goodwill is impaired by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is developed using certain assumptions and estimates that could change once the impact of Health Care Reform becomes clearer. Management may conclude that goodwill (and other intangible assets) are impaired in future quarters, particularly in our Assurant Health and Assurant Employee Benefits segments.
