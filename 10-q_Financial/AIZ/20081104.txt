Item 1A. Risk Factors.  Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and you should carefully consider them. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. For discussion of our potential risks or uncertainties, refer to “Item 1A—Risk Factors” included in our 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Risks Related to Our Company  Current conditions in the capital and credit markets may significantly and adversely affect our access to capital and our ability to meet liquidity needs.  The global capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption for more than twelve months. In recent weeks, the volatility and disruption have reached unprecedented levels. In some cases, the markets have exerted downward pressure on availability of liquidity and credit capacity for certain issuers.  Liquidity and credit capacity are important to our business because they allow us to pay our operating expenses, interest on our debt and dividends on our common stock, and replace certain maturing liabilities. The principal sources of our liquidity are insurance premiums, fee income, cash flow from our investment portfolio and liquid assets, consisting mainly of cash or assets that are readily convertible into cash. Sources of liquidity in normal markets also include a variety of short- and long-term instruments.  In the event current resources do not satisfy our needs, we may have to seek additional methods of financing our operations. The availability of additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the volume of trading activities, the overall availability of credit to the financial services industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the possibility that clients or lenders could develop a negative perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects if we continue to incur large investment losses or if the level of our business activity persistently decreased due to a market downturn. Continuing disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets could have an adverse effect on our core business, our insurance operations. Such market conditions may limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities; satisfy statutory capital requirements; generate fee income and market-related revenue to meet liquidity needs; and access the capital necessary to grow our business. Potentially, we may be forced to delay raising or be unable to raise capital or bear an unattractive cost of capital which could decrease our profitability and reduce our financial flexibility. Our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and statutory capital position could be materially and adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets.  General economic, financial market and political conditions may adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions. Particularly, difficult conditions in financial markets and the global economy may negatively affect our results.  General economic, financial market and political conditions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The stress experienced by global capital markets that began in the second half of 2007 continued and substantially increased during the third quarter of 2008. Recently, concerns over inflation, energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, the global mortgage market, a declining global real estate market, and the loss of consumer confidence and a reduction in consumer spending have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward. These factors, combined with volatile energy prices, declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment, have precipitated an economic slowdown and fears of a possible global recession. Any of these factors may influence our results. Specifically, during periods of economic downturn:    57    Table of Contents     •    individuals and businesses (i) may choose not to purchase our insurance products, warranties and other related products and services, (ii) may terminate existing policies or contracts or permit them to lapse, (iii) may choose to reduce the amount of coverage purchased (iv) in the case of business customers of Assurant Health or Assurant Employee Benefits, may have fewer employees requiring insurance coverage due to reductions in their staffing levels, or (v) in the case of Assurant Solutions and Assurant Specialty Property, clients are more likely to experience financial distress or declare bankruptcy which could have an adverse impact on the remittance of premiums from such clients as well as the collection of receivables from such clients for items such as unearned premiums.        •    disability insurance claims and claims on other specialized insurance products tend to rise;        •    there is a higher loss ratio on credit card and installment loan insurance due to rising unemployment and disability levels;        •    insureds tend to increase their utilization of health and dental benefits if they anticipate becoming unemployed or losing benefits; and        •    substantial decreases in loan availability and origination could have a long-term effect on premium writings.  In addition, general inflationary pressures may affect the costs of medical and dental care, as well as repair and replacement costs on our real and personal property lines, increasing the costs of paying claims. Inflationary pressures may also affect the costs associated with our preneed insurance policies, particularly those that are guaranteed to grow with the Consumer Price Index (or “CPI”).  Recently, legislation has been passed in an attempt to stabilize the financial markets. This legislation or similar proposals, as well as companion actions such as monetary or fiscal actions of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board or comparable authorities in other countries, may fail to stabilize the financial markets. This legislation and other proposals or actions may also have other consequences, including material effects on interest rates and foreign exchange rates, which could materially affect our investments, results of operations and liquidity in ways that we cannot predict. The failure to effectively implement this legislation and related proposals or actions could also result in material adverse effects, notably increased constraints on the liquidity available in the banking system and financial markets and increased pressure on stock prices, any of which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.  In addition, we are subject to extensive laws and regulations that are administered and enforced by a number of different governmental authorities and non-governmental self-regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, foreign regulators, state insurance regulators, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the New York Stock Exchange, the U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys general. In light of the difficult economic conditions, some of these authorities are considering or may in the future consider enhanced or new regulatory requirements intended to prevent future crises or to otherwise assure the stability of institutions under their supervision. These authorities may also seek to exercise their supervisory or enforcement authority in new or more robust ways. All of these possibilities, if they occurred, could affect the way we conduct our business and manage our capital, either of which in turn could materially affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.  Our investment portfolio is subject to several risks that may diminish the value of our invested assets and affect our profitability. Given the current global economic slowdown, our investment portfolio may continue to suffer reduced returns or losses that could reduce our profitability.  Investment returns are an important part of our overall profitability and significant fluctuations in the fixed maturity market could impair our profitability, financial condition and/or cash flows. Our investments are subject to market-wide risks and fluctuations, as well as to risks inherent in particular securities. In particular, volatility of claims may force us to liquidate securities prior to maturity, which may cause us to incur capital losses. If we do not structure our investment portfolio so that it is appropriately matched with our insurance liabilities, we may be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a significant loss to cover such liabilities. Our net investment income and net realized (losses)/gains on investments collectively accounted for approximately 3.4% of our total revenues during the nine month period ending September 30, 2008 and 9.4% of our total revenues during the nine month period ending September 30, 2007. See “Item 2—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Investments” for additional information on our investment portfolio and related risks.    58    Table of Contents The U.S. mortgage market has experienced unprecedented disruptions resulting from credit quality deterioration in a significant portion of loans originated. Beginning in the sub-prime mortgage lending market, the decline has extended into the markets for collateralized mortgage obligations, mortgage-backed securities and the lending markets generally. This has led to reduced investor demand for mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities and increased investor yield requirements for those loans and securities. This continuing decline has resulted in restrictions in the resale markets for non-conforming loans and has had an adverse effect on retail mortgage lending operations in many markets, especially alternative documentation loans (typically offered to qualified borrowers who have relatively high credit scores but are not required to provide full documentation to support personal income and assets owned). These conditions may continue or worsen in the future. Although at September 30, 2008, only a small portion of our mortgage-backed securities were secured by sub-prime mortgage collateral, if the market disruption continues these events could ultimately impact our fixed maturity and commercial mortgage loan portfolio and may have a material adverse effect on the value of our investment portfolio, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  The performance of our investment portfolio is subject to continuing fluctuations due to changes in interest rates and market conditions.  Changes in interest rates can materially adversely affect the performance of some of our investments. Interest rate volatility can increase or reduce unrealized gains or unrealized losses in our portfolios. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control. Fixed maturity and short-term investments represented 76.8% of the fair value of our total investments as of September 30, 2008 and 76.7% of the fair value of our total investments as of December 31, 2007. See “Item 2—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Investments” for additional information on the effect of fluctuations in interest rates.  The fair market value of the fixed maturity securities in our portfolio and the investment income from these securities fluctuate depending on general economic and market conditions. Because all of our fixed maturity securities are classified as available for sale, changes in the market value of these securities are reflected in our balance sheet. The fair market value generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates, while net investment income realized by us from future investments in fixed maturity securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates. In addition, actual net investment income and/or cash flows from investments that carry prepayment risk, such as mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, may differ from those anticipated at the time of investment as a result of interest rate fluctuations. An increase in interest rates, will increase the net unrealized loss position of our current investment portfolio.  We employ asset/liability management strategies to reduce the adverse effects of interest rate volatility and to increase the likelihood that cash flows are available to pay claims as they become due. Our asset/liability management strategies include asset/liability duration management, structuring our bond and commercial mortgage loan portfolios to limit the effects of prepayments and consistent monitoring of, and appropriate changes to, the pricing of our products.  Asset/liability management strategies may fail to eliminate or reduce the adverse effects of interest rate volatility, and significant fluctuations in the level of interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, our preneed insurance policies are generally whole life insurance policies with increasing death benefits. In extended periods of declining interest rates or rising inflation, there may be compression in the spread between the death benefit growth rates on these policies and the investment earnings that we can earn, resulting in a negative spread. As a result, declining interest rates or high inflation rates may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our overall financial condition. See “Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Inflation Risk” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.  Assurant Employee Benefits calculates reserves for long-term disability and life waiver of premium claims using net present value calculations based on current interest rates at the time claims are funded and expectations regarding future interest rates. Waiver of premium refers to a provision in a life insurance policy pursuant to which an insured with a disability that lasts for a specified period no longer has to pay premiums for the duration of the disability or for a stated period, during which time the life insurance coverage provides continued coverage. If interest rates decline, reserves for open and/or new claims in Assurant Employee Benefits would    59    Table of Contents need to be calculated using lower discount rates thereby increasing the net present value of those claims and the required reserves. Depending on the magnitude of the decline, this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, investment income may be lower than that assumed in setting premium rates.  Our investment portfolio is subject to various risks that may result in further realized investment losses.  We are subject to credit risk in our investment portfolio, primarily from our investments in corporate bonds, preferred stocks, leveraged loans, and municipal bonds. Defaults by third parties in the payment or performance of their obligations could reduce our investment income and realized investment gains or result in the continued recognition of investment losses. The value of our investments may be materially adversely affected by increases in interest rates, downgrades in the corporate bonds included in the portfolio and by other factors that may result in the continued recognition of other-than-temporary impairments. Each of these events may cause us to reduce the carrying value of our investment portfolio.  Further, the value of any particular fixed maturity security is subject to impairment based on the creditworthiness of a given issuer. As of September 30, 2008, fixed maturity securities represented 71.9% of the fair value of our total invested assets. Our fixed maturity portfolio also includes below investment grade securities (rated “BB” or lower by nationally recognized securities rating organizations). These investments comprise approximately 5.1% of the fair value of our total investments as of September 30, 2008 and generally provide higher expected returns, but present greater risk and can be less liquid than investment grade securities. A significant increase in defaults and impairments on our fixed maturity investment portfolio could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. See “Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Credit Risk” in our 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the composition of our fixed maturity investment portfolio.  We currently invest in a small amount of equity securities (approximately 3.9% of the fair value of our total investments as of September 30, 2008). However, we have had higher percentages in the past and may make more such investments in the future. Investments in equity securities generally provide higher expected total returns, but present greater risk to preservation of principal than our fixed maturity investments. Recent volatility in the equity markets has led, and may continue to lead, to a decline in the market value of our investments in equity securities.  In the third quarter of 2008, the Company recognized net realized losses on investments totaling $194,483 after tax and reported gross unrealized losses of $778,590. Net realized losses generally emanate from two sources: losses related to sales and losses related to other-than-temporary impairments. If the current economic downturn continues to negatively affect companies, industry sectors or countries, the Company may have additional realized and unrealized investment losses and further increases in other-than-temporary impairments. We regularly monitor our investment portfolio to ensure investments that may be other-than-temporarily impaired are identified in a timely fashion, properly valued, and any impairments are charged against earnings in the proper period. Assessment factors include, but are not limited to, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and rating of the issuer, whether any collateral is held, and the intent and ability of the Company to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery. However, the determination that a security has incurred an other-than-temporary decline in value requires the judgment of management. Inherently, there are risks and uncertainties involved in making these judgments. Therefore, changes in facts and circumstances and critical assumptions could result in management’s decision that further impairments have occurred. This could lead to additional losses on investments, particularly those that management has the intent and ability to hold until recovery in value occurs. For further details on the third quarter net investment losses and other-than-temporary-impairments, please see “Item 2—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Investments.”  In addition, while we currently do not utilize derivative instruments to hedge or manage our interest rate or equity risk, we may do so in the future. Derivative instruments generally present greater risk than fixed maturity investments or equity investments because of their greater sensitivity to market fluctuations. Since August 1, 2003, we have been utilizing derivative instruments to manage the exposure to inflation risk created by our preneed insurance policies that are tied to the CPI. However, our protection would be limited by the derivative instruments if there were a sharp increase in inflation on a sustained long-term basis which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.    60    Table of Contents A.M. Best, Moody’s, and S&P rate the financial strength of our insurance company subsidiaries, and a decline in these ratings could affect our standing in the insurance industry and cause our sales and earnings to decrease.  Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. A.M. Best rates most of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries. Moody’s rates six of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries and S&P rates seven of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries. These ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities. These ratings are subject to periodic review by A.M. Best, Moody’s, and S&P, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain these ratings. As a result of our pending SEC investigation A.M. Best, Moody’s and S&P have placed a negative outlook on our ratings. Additionally, given recent economic developments that have negatively affected the entire insurance industry, we believe that we are currently more susceptible to ratings downgrades. For more information on the specific A.M. Best, Moody’s, and S&P ratings of our domestic operating insurance subsidiaries, see “Item 1—Business—Ratings,” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.  If our ratings are lowered from their current levels by A.M. Best, Moody’s, or S&P, our competitive position in the respective insurance industry segments could be materially adversely impacted and it could be more difficult for us to market our products. Rating agencies may take action to lower our ratings in the future due to, among other things, perceived concerns about our liquidity or solvency, the competitive environment in the insurance industry, which may adversely affect our revenues, the inherent uncertainty in determining reserves for future claims, which may cause us to increase our reserves for claims, the outcome of pending litigation and regulatory investigations, which may adversely affect our financial position and reputation and possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies. In addition, rating agencies have come under recent scrutiny over their ratings on various mortgage-backed products. As a result, they could become more conservative in their methodology and criteria, which could adversely affect our ratings. Finally, rating agencies or regulators could increase capital requirements for the Company or its subsidiaries which in turn, could negatively affect our financial position as well.  As customers and their advisors place importance on our financial strength ratings, we may lose customers and compete less successfully if we are downgraded. In addition, ratings impact our ability to attract investment capital on favorable terms. If our financial strength ratings are reduced from their current levels by A.M. Best, Moody’s, or S&P, our cost of borrowing would likely increase, our sales and earnings could decrease and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  As of December 31, 2007 contracts representing approximately 32% of Assurant Solutions’ and 12% of Assurant Specialty Property’s net earned premiums and fee income contain provisions requiring the applicable subsidiaries to maintain minimum A.M. Best financial strength ratings ranging from “A” or better to “B” or better, depending on the contract. Our clients may terminate these contracts or not renew contracts if the subsidiaries’ ratings fall below these minimum or other acceptable levels. Under our marketing agreement with SCI, American Memorial Life Insurance Company (“AMLIC”), one of our subsidiaries, is required to maintain an A.M. Best financial strength rating of “B” or better throughout the term of the agreement. If AMLIC fails to maintain this rating for a period of 180 days, SCI may terminate the agreement. Additionally, contracts in Assurant Employee Benefits’ Disability Reinsurance Management Services (“DRMS”) business line representing approximately 4% of net earned premiums for the year ended December 31, 2007 contain provisions requiring the applicable subsidiaries to maintain minimum A.M. Best financial strength ratings of “A-” or better. DRMS clients may terminate the agreements and recapture inforce business (generally after a recapture period) if the ratings of applicable subsidiaries fall below “A-”.    61    Table of Contents Risks Related to Our Common Stock  Given the current economic climate, our stock and the stocks of other companies in the insurance industry may be increasingly subject to stock price and trading volume volatility. The price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly and you could lose all or part of your investment.  Recently, the stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume volatility. Company-specific issues and market developments generally in the insurance industry and in the regulatory environment may cause this volatility. Our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to materially fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, including:        •    quarterly variations in operating results;        •    natural disasters, terrorist attacks and epidemics;        •    changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts;        •    operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable;        •    press releases or negative publicity relating to our competitors or us or relating to trends in our markets;        •    regulatory changes and adverse outcomes from litigation and government or regulatory investigations;        •    sales of stock by insiders;        •    changes in our financial strength ratings;        •    limitations on premium levels or the ability to raise premiums on existing policies;        •    increases in minimum capital, reserves and other financial viability requirements; and        •    limitations on our ability to repurchase Company stock.  These factors could materially reduce our stock price. In addition, broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.  Item 2.
