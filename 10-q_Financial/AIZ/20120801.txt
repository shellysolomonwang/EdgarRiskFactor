Item 1A. Risk Factors  Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and you should carefully consider them. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. For discussion of our potential risks or uncertainties, please refer to “Item 1A—Risk Factors” included in our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except as set forth in the following updated risk factor, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Our business is subject to risks related to litigation and regulatory actions.  From time to time, we may be subject to a variety of legal and regulatory actions relating to our current and past business operations, including, but not limited to:        •    disputes over coverage or claims adjudication including, but not limited to, pre-existing conditions in individual medical contracts and rescissions of policies;        •    disputes over our treatment of claims, in which states or insureds may allege that we failed to make required payments or to meet prescribed deadlines for adjudicating claims;        •    disputes regarding sales practices, disclosures, premium refunds, licensing, regulatory compliance, underwriting and compensation arrangements;        •    disputes with agents, brokers or network providers over compensation and termination of contracts and related claims;        •    actions by regulatory authorities that may challenge our ability to increase or maintain our premium rates, require us to reduce premium rates and/or result in other fees;        •    disputes alleging packaging of credit insurance products with other products provided by financial institutions;        •    disputes with tax and insurance authorities regarding our tax liabilities;        •    disputes relating to customers’ claims that the customer was not aware of the full cost or existence of the insurance or limitations on insurance coverage; and        •    industry-wide investigations regarding business practices including, but not limited to, the use and the marketing of certain types of insurance policies or certificates of insurance.  In Fall 2011, Assurant, along with other insurers and with mortgage servicers, received a request for information from the NYDFS regarding its lender-placed insurance business. In February 2012, the Company and two of its wholly owned insurance subsidiaries, American Security Insurance Company and American Bankers Insurance Company of Florida, each received a subpoena from the NYDFS requesting information regarding the lender-placed business and related document retention practices. In response to the subpoenas, depositions were conducted in late February involving designated witnesses for the Company and the foregoing subsidiaries. In March 2012, the Company received an additional request from the NYDFS for further information relating to its lender-placed insurance program in New York and responded in April. Along with other companies in the industry, the Company participated in public hearings conducted by the NYDFS on May 17, 2012 and was subsequently served with an order by the NYDFS requiring the Company to propose and justify amended rates for its lender-placed insurance products sold in the State of New York by July 6, 2012. The Company has submitted a response to the order and is engaged in discussions with the NYDFS to determine appropriate changes to the existing lender-placed insurance program in the State of New York. Proposed submitted changes to the program would affect annual lender-placed hazard and real estate owned policies issued in the State of New York, which accounted for approximately $64,000 and $36,000 of Assurant Specialty Property’s net earned premiums for the full year 2011 and six months ended June 30, 2012, respectively. The Company is committed to cooperating fully with the NYDFS on this matter.    67    Table of Contents In addition, the Company is engaged in discussions with the California DOI regarding the Company’s lender-placed insurance premium rates. In 2010, the Company submitted a proposed 10% rate decrease, which the California DOI did not approve. In May 2012, the Company re-filed proposed rates for lender-placed homeowners insurance products with the California DOI. The Company submitted a proposed 18% rate decrease, which has not yet been approved by the California DOI. The new rates would affect annual lender-placed hazard and real estate owned policies issued in the State of California, which accounted for approximately $124,000 and $54,000 of Assurant Specialty Property’s net earned premiums for the full year 2011 and six months ended June 30, 2012, respectively.  As disclosed in our 2011 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Assurant Specialty Property’s business strategy is to pursue long-term growth in lender-placed homeowners insurance and adjacent markets with similar characteristics, such as lender-placed flood insurance and lender-placed mobile home insurance. Lender-placed insurance products accounted for approximately 70% of Assurant Specialty Property’s net earned premiums for both the full year 2011 and the six months ended June 30, 2012. The approximate corresponding contributions to segment net income in these periods were 100% and 89%, respectively. The portion of total segment net income attributable to lender-placed products may vary substantially over time depending on the frequency, severity and location of catastrophic losses, the cost of catastrophe reinsurance and reinstatement coverage, the variability of claim processing costs and client acquisition costs, and other factors.  The Company files rates with the state departments of insurance in the ordinary course of business. As previously disclosed, in addition to this routine correspondence, the Company has recently been engaged in discussions and proceedings with certain state regulators regarding our lender-placed insurance business. Because assumptions used in rate filings vary by state as a result of differing regulatory requirements, expected loss experience and catastrophe exposure, the results of such reviews may vary widely. It is possible that other state departments of insurance and regulatory authorities may choose to initiate or continue to review the appropriateness of the Company’s premium rates for its lender-placed insurance products. If in the aggregate such reviews lead to significant decreases in premium rates for the Company’s lender-placed insurance products, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.  Unfavorable outcomes in litigation or regulatory proceedings, or significant problems in our relationships with regulators, could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, our reputation, our ratings, and our ability to continue to do business. They could also expose us to further investigations or litigations. In addition, certain of our clients in the mortgage industry are the subject of various regulatory investigations and/or litigation regarding mortgage lending practices, which could indirectly affect our business.    68    Table of Contents   Item 2.
