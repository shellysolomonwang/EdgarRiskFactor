Item 1A. Risk Factors.  The risk factors affecting our business are discussed in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007. Recent events in the financial markets highlight certain of these and other risks that could materialize and affect our portfolios and capital position going forward:        •    The failure, or perceived failure, of governmental attempts to stabilize specific companies or groups of companies through capital injections, to shore up markets or otherwise to spur economic recovery or growth;        •    A recession or depression in either the U.S. or world economies that adversely affects the value of corporate, municipal and asset-backed securities held in our portfolio;        •    The financial weakness or failure of one or more financial institutions that play a prominent role in securities markets or act as a counterparty for various financial instruments, such as derivative transactions, which could further disrupt the markets or cause us to incur losses if counterparties to one or more of our transactions should default;        •    Inactive markets for specific kinds of securities, or for the securities of certain issuers or in certain sectors, which could result in decreased valuations and our inability to sell a specific security or a group of securities at a reasonable price when desired;        •    Significant losses in our investment portfolios and further reductions in our capital levels could cause us to seek additional capital and/or lead to downgrades of our credit and financial strength ratings by rating agencies, which could make it more expensive for us to raise capital and present other adverse consequences for our insurance operations; and        •    In view of the turmoil in the capital markets, it is uncertain whether the markets would be receptive to an issuance of our debt or equity securities in the future if we were to seek additional capital, and whether the prices and terms available in such transactions would be favorable to us.    44      Item 2.
