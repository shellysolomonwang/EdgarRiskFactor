Item 1A. Risk Factors.As described above, on April 1, 2015, we acquired a controlling interest in ARX Holding Corp. (“ARX”). ARX’s insurance subsidiaries (referred to herein as ASI) write homeowners insurance. Many of the risks related to vehicle insurance disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 (“Form 10-K”), are equally applicable to homeowners insurance. For example, the homeowners insurance industry is highly competitive and highly regulated. The pricing of homeowners insurance and the establishment of loss reserves involve estimates and uncertainties similar to those disclosed in our Form 10-K with respect to vehicle insurance. In addition, the Form 10-K includes risks associated with and resulting from the ARX transaction, including reinsurance risk, which is described in more detail below. Our success will depend on our ability to continue to accurately predict our reinsurance needs, collect under our reinsurance contracts and reinsure our homeowners business at acceptable rates.Like many homeowners insurance companies, ASI relies on reinsurance contracts, state reinsurance funding and catastrophe bonds (collectively, “reinsurance contracts”) to reduce its exposure to certain catastrophe events. However, our claims liabilities may exceed our reinsurance coverage.In addition, although the reinsurer is liable to ASI to the extent of the ceded reinsurance, ASI remains liable as the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. As a result, ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate ASI’s obligation to pay claims. We are also subject to credit risk with respect to ASI’s reinsurers and the risk that reinsurers will dispute our reinsurance claims. Further, the availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing reinsurance market conditions (which can be impacted by the occurrence of significant reinsured events), both in terms of price and available capacity, and ASI may not be able to obtain reinsurance coverage in the future at commercially reasonable rates. The availability and cost of reinsurance could affect our business volume, our profitability or both. Our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by these risks.Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.
