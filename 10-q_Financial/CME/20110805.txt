ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  Other than as described below, there have been no material updates to the Risk Factors as set forth in Item 1A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2011. In addition to the other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, which are the risks that we believe are material at this time. These risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business in the future.  The ongoing uncertainty and volatility in the markets stemming from the U.S. budget deficit, the European debt crisis, and the status of the U.S. economic recovery may negatively impact our business.  Investors have grown increasingly concerned due to the issues related to the U.S. budget deficit, solvency problems in several European countries and the slowdown of the U.S. economic recovery. The U.S. government recently approved an increase to the debt ceiling and approved spending cuts to reduce the deficit. However, the government will need to continue to monitor its deficit including the implementation of the approved spending cuts. The rating agencies have indicated that they will continue to review the government’s fiscal policy and its implementation of the proposed spending cuts. Weakening in fiscal discipline in the future may result in a downgrade from the rating agencies, which could create additional volatility in the treasury market. To the extent the global markets continue to experience uncertainty, our business may be negatively impacted:        •    We generate revenues primarily from our clearing and transaction fees. Declines in trading volumes and market liquidity stemming from this market uncertainty would adversely affect our business and financial condition.        •    The required capital and posted collateral of our clearing firms may lose value given the volatility of the market. To become a clearing member, a firm must meet certain minimum capital requirements and must deposit a certain amount of funds to meet performance bond and guaranty fund requirements with our clearing house as collateral for their trading activity. We accept a variety of collateral to satisfy these requirements, including U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. Government Agency securities and foreign sovereign debt. Given the level of market volatility, there is no guarantee that these investments will continue to maintain their value. To the extent a clearing firm is not in compliance with our collateral requirements, it would be required to acquire additional funds, decrease its proprietary trading activity and/or transfer customer accounts to another clearing firm. These actions could result in a decrease in trading activity in our products.    30    Table of Contents   ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
