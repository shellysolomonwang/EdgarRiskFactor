Item 1A. Risk Factors  There can be no assurance that recently enacted legislation authorizing the U.S. government to purchase large amounts of illiquid mortgages and mortgage-backed securities from financial institutions will help stabilize the U.S. financial system.  On October 3, 2008, President Bush signed into law the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (the EESA). The legislation was the result of a proposal by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to the U.S. Congress on September 20, 2008 in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions. Pursuant to the EESA, the U.S. Treasury will have the authority to, among other things, purchase up to $700 billion of mortgages, mortgage-backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the U.S. financial markets. There can be no assurance, however, as to the actual impact that the EESA will have on the financial markets, including the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced. The government investment in financial services firms could also lead to new regulations and governmental oversight. The failure of the EESA to help stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions or the imposition of additional regulations in the financial services industry could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, access to credit or the trading price of our Class A common stock.  Current levels of the capital and credit market volatility are unprecedented.  The capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than 12 months. In recent weeks, the volatility and disruption has reached unprecedented levels. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers’ underlying financial strength. A significant portion of our borrowings have been issued in the commercial paper markets and, although we have continued to issue commercial paper, there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to be a reliable source of short-term financing. In the event we are unable to access the commercial paper market, we may need to draw upon our senior credit facility which is a more expensive form of financing. If current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen, there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on our ability to access capital, including commercial paper issuances, and on our business, financial condition and results of operations.    38    Table of Contents The soundness of our clearing firms could adversely affect us.  CME, our subsidiary, owns and operates its own clearinghouse, which acts as the counterparty to all trades consummated on or through our futures exchanges or on third-party exchanges for which we provide clearing services. As a result, we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely guarantee transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds, and other institutional customers. Dramatic declines in the housing market over the past year, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures, unemployment and under-employment, have negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage loans and resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions, including government-sponsored entities as well as major commercial and investment banks. These write-downs, initially of mortgage-backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative and cash securities, in turn, have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital, to merge with larger and stronger institutions and, in some cases, to fail. For example, during the past months, The Bear Stearns Companies, Inc., Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and American International Group, Inc., all of which are parent companies of one of our clearing firms, have experienced significant financial write-downs and in some cases failed. Although none of these cases resulted in a default of a clearing firm, additional companies, including our clearing firms, may encounter economic difficulties as a result of the market turmoil and the tightening of the credit market. CME has in place various measures intended to limit counterparty risk, enable it to cover any default and maintain liquidity. However, we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default. A substantial part of our working capital is at risk if a clearing firm defaults on its obligations to our clearinghouse and its margin and security deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations. Although we have policies and procedures to help ensure that our clearing firms can satisfy their obligations, these policies and procedures may not succeed in detecting problems or preventing defaults. We also have in place various measures intended to enable us to cover any default and maintain liquidity. However, we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default.  The required capital and posted collateral of our clearing firms may lose value given the volatility of the market.  To become a clearing member a firm must meet certain minimum capital requirements and must deposit a certain amount of funds with our clearinghouse as collateral for their trading activity. The funds used to satisfy these requirements may be cash or held in a variety of investments, such as regulated money market mutual funds, U.S. Treasury securities and asset-backed securities. Given the level of market volatility, there is no guarantee that these investments will continue to maintain their value. To the extent a clearing firm was not in compliance with these requirements, it would be required to acquire additional funds, decrease its proprietary trading activity and/or transfer customer accounts to another clearing firm. These actions could result in a decrease in trading activity in our products.  Current market developments may adversely affect our industry, business and results of operations.  Dramatic declines in the housing market during the prior year, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment, have resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions, including some of our clearing firms and customers. These write-downs have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital, to merge with larger and stronger institutions and, in some cases, to fail. As a result of this instability of the financial markets and the lack of readily available credit, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual and hedge funds and other of our customers have decreased their risk exposure, which has resulted in a decrease in their trading of our benchmark interest rate products. For example, quarter to date, the average daily value for CME Eurodollar options decreased by 24% to 0.8 million contracts per day in 2008 when compared with the same period in 2007.  Current trends in the global financial markets could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price.  Stock markets in general, and stock prices of participants in the financial services industry in particular, including us, have recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price for securities. The market price of our Class A common stock may continue to be subject to similar market fluctuations which may be unrelated to our operating performance or prospects, and increased volatility could result in a decline in the market price of our Class A common stock. Factors that could significantly impact the volatility of our stock price include:        •    developments in our business or in the financial sector generally, including the effect of direct governmental action in financial markets generally and with respect to futures exchanges in particular;        •    regulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our business and operations;        •    the operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us;        •    changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, stock, commodity or asset valuations or volatility;        •    operating results that may be worse than the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors; and        •    market developments that affect our customers causing a decrease in the use of our products.    39    Table of Contents Any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets.  Our long-term debt is currently rated investment grade by the major rating agencies. These rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings of our long-term debt are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. In light of the difficulties in the financial services industry and the financial markets, there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings. Our failure to maintain those ratings could adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital.  Concerns regarding the accuracy of LIBOR rates may negatively impact trading volumes of our Eurodollar contract.  Our Eurodollar futures and options on futures reflect the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) for a 3-month, $1 million offshore deposit maturing at some point in the future. The accuracy of LIBOR rates has come under scrutiny in recent months due to discrepancies in the borrowing costs in the currency forwards market and the rates reported by the British Bankers Association. As a result of this inconsistency, interest rate markets continue to reflect dislocations between Eurodollar and overnight rates. For example, as of September 30, 2008, the trading volume of our Eurodollar options contract was down 26% compared with the same period in 2007.  Our investment in BM&F Bovespa SA subjects us to investment and currency risk.  In February 2008, we purchased an interest in Bolsa de Mercadorias & Futuros S.A. which following its merger with Bovespa Holdings S.A. represents approximately 5% of the combined company, BM&F Bovespa SA (BM&F). Under the terms of the transaction, we may not sell our shares in BM&F for four years from the purchase date. As an exchange, BM&F’s ability to maintain or expand their trading volume and operate their business is subject to the same types of risks to which we are subject. There is no guarantee that our investment in BM&F will be profitable. For example, the book value of our BM&F stock was $631.4 million on February 26, 2008, the date of purchase. As of September 30, 2008, the market value of our BM&F shares was $442.4 million. Additionally, because BM&F stock is valued in Brazilian real, we are subject to currency risk. To mitigate our financial exposure to the currency risk of the investment, we purchased an option to hedge against fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Brazilian real with Lehman Brothers Special Financing Inc. As a result of the bankruptcy filing of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., our hedging arrangement was terminated and our currency exposure is no longer mitigated.  There is no guarantee that we will enter into our proposed joint venture with Citadel and to the extent that we do we may be subject to additional risks relating to a clearing firm default.  In October 2008, the company announced that it entered into a non-binding term sheet with Citadel Investment Group L.L.C. to launch a joint venture company. The joint venture would be the first electronic trading platform that is fully integrated with a central counterparty clearing facility, CME Clearing, for credit default swaps. Entering into joint ventures and alliances entails risks, including difficulties in developing and expanding the business of newly formed joint ventures, exercising influence over the activities of joint ventures and potential conflicts with our joint venture or alliance partners. We currently do not have binding documentation with Citadel relating to the joint venture and we cannot guarantee that if completed that the joint venture will be successful. Additionally, CME Clearing has not previously served as the central counterparty for credit default swaps. Although CME Clearing is developing risk management procedures to specifically provide additional risk monitoring of these products, there is no guarantee that these measures will be sufficient to protect us from a default by one of our clearing firms or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default.  We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of NYMEX Holdings, Inc.  On August 22, 2008, we completed our acquisition of NYMEX Holdings. The success of the transaction will depend, in part, on our ability to achieve the anticipated cost synergies and other strategic benefits from combining the businesses of CME Group and NYMEX Holdings. We expect CME Group to benefit from operational synergies resulting from the consolidation of capabilities and elimination of redundancies as well as greater efficiencies from increased scale, market integration and more automation. However, to realize these anticipated benefits, we must successfully combine the businesses of CME Group and NYMEX Holdings. If we are not able to achieve these objectives, the anticipated cost synergies and other strategic benefits of the transaction may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction in the amounts and times projected for a number of reasons, including that the integration may take longer than anticipated or be more costly than anticipated.  The failure to integrate successfully the businesses and operations of CME Group and NYMEX Holdings in the expected time frame may adversely affect CME Group’s future results.  Prior to the completion of the transaction, CME Group and NYMEX Holdings historically operated as independent companies. The management of CME Group may face significant challenges in consolidating the functions of CME Group and NYMEX Holdings and their subsidiaries, integrating their technologies, organizations, procedures, policies and operations, as well as addressing differences in the business cultures of the two companies and retaining key personnel. In connection with the acquisition, CME Group expects to integrate certain operations of CME Group and NYMEX Holdings, including, among other things, back-office operations, information technology and regulatory compliance. However, the combined company will continue to operate a NYMEX trading floor at its existing location or an     40    Table of Contents  alternative location in New York, New York, as long as both revenue and profitability thresholds are achieved going forward. Given that historically CME Group has not operated a trading floor in a geographic location that is remote from its headquarters in Chicago, Illinois, continuing to operate a NYMEX trading floor in New York, New York may present unique challenges. The integration of the two companies will be complex and time consuming, and require substantial resources and effort. The integration process and other disruptions resulting from the transaction may disrupt each company’s ongoing businesses or cause inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our relationships with our members and other market participants, employees, regulators and others with whom we have business or other dealings. If we fail to manage the integration of these businesses effectively, our growth strategy and future profitability could be negatively affected, and we may fail to achieve the intended benefits of the transaction.  We have incurred costs in connection with our acquisition of NYMEX Holdings and will continue to incur costs in connection with the transaction.  CME Group and NYMEX Holdings have incurred significant costs associated with transaction fees, professional services and other costs related to the transaction and we will continue to incur additional costs, including restructuring costs, in connection with the integration of the business. Specifically, through September 30, 2008, CME Group and NYMEX Holdings have incurred approximately $103.8 million for transaction costs related to the transaction. Although CME Group expects that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will offset incremental transaction, merger-related and restructuring costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all.  A key element of our strategy is to provide transaction processing, clearing and related services to third parties. Our failure to identify future opportunities to provide these services will have a negative impact on our ability to grow our business.  Providing third-party transaction processing, clearing and related services is a key element of our strategy. Pursuant to transaction-processing agreements we previously provided these services to NYMEX and to CBOT. Prior to our acquisition of these companies, we derived a significant amount of revenue from these services agreements. We cannot assure you that we will enter into additional agreements to provide processing services in the future. Our failure to identify such opportunities may have a negative impact on our ability to generate additional revenues and grow our business.      Item 2.
