Item 1A.  Risk Factors  Recent legislation regarding the financial services industry may have a significant adverse effect on our operations.  On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). The Dodd-Frank Act implements a variety of far-reaching changes and has been called the most sweeping reform of the financial services industry since the 1930s. Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will directly affect our ability to conduct our business including:        •    Imposition of higher prudential standards, including more stringent risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity and risk-management requirements, and numerous other requirements on “systemically significant institutions,” currently defined to include, among other things, all bank holding companies with assets of at least $50 billion (which would include Regions);    86    Table of Contents     •    Mandates requiring the Federal Reserve to establish standards for determining whether interchange fees charged by certain financial institutions are reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by such institution;        •    Imposition of additional costs and fees, including fees to be set by the Federal Reserve and charged to “systemically significant institutions” to cover the cost of regulating such institutions and any FDIC assessment made to cover the costs of any regular or special examination of Regions or its affiliates;        •    Establishment of a consumer financial protection bureau with broad authority to implement new consumer protection regulations and to examine and enforce compliance with federal consumer laws;        •    Application to bank holding companies of regulatory capital requirements similar to those applied to banks, which requirements exclude, on a phase-out basis, all trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred from Tier 1 capital (except for preferred stock issued under the TARP, such as Regions Fixed Rate, Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, which will continue to qualify as Tier 1 capital as long as it remains outstanding); and        •    Establishment of new rules and restrictions regarding the origination of mortgages.  Many provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act remain subject to regulatory rule-making and implementation, the effects of which are not yet known, including mandates requiring the Federal Reserve to establish compensation guidelines covering regulated financial institutions. In addition, further legislative and regulatory changes are still being considered, including the so called “bank tax” on institutions with greater than $50 billion in assets, such as Regions. The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and any rules adopted to implement those provisions as well as any additional legislative or regulatory changes may impact the profitability of our business activities, require we change certain of our business practices, materially affect our business model or affect retention of key personnel, require us to raise additional regulatory capital, including additional Tier 1 capital, and could expose us to additional costs (including increased compliance costs). These and other changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business as previously conducted or our results of operations or financial condition.  We may be subject to more stringent capital requirements.  As discussed above, the Dodd-Frank Act would require the federal banking agencies to establish stricter risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits to apply to banks and bank holding companies. Under the legislation, the federal banking agencies would be required to develop capital requirements that address systemically risky activities. The capital rules must address, at a minimum, risks arising from significant volumes of activity in derivatives, securitized products, financial guarantees, securities borrowing and lending and repurchase agreements; concentrations in assets for which reported values are based on models; and concentrations in market share for any activity that would substantially disrupt financial markets if the institutions were forced to unexpectedly cease the activity. These requirements, and any other new regulations, could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends, or could require us to reduce business levels or to raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.  In addition, recent proposals published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”), if adopted, could lead to significantly higher capital requirements, higher capital charges and more restrictive leverage and liquidity ratios. In July and December 2009, the Basel Committee published proposals relating to, respectively, enhanced capital requirements for market risk and new capital and liquidity risk requirements for banks. On July 26, 2010, the Basel Committee announced that it had reached “broad agreement” on the December 2009 proposals and published a set of amendments to these proposals. If adopted, these proposals would generally impose more restrictive eligibility requirements for Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital, including a minimum ratio of common equity to risk-based assets; more deductions from and adjustments to the common equity component of Tier 1 capital; increased capital charges for various assets and risk exposures; a more restrictive leverage ratio (capital to total assets) than currently applies to U.S. banks and bank holding companies;    87    Table of Contents  counter-cyclical measures such as provisioning for expected rather than incurred credit losses and restrictions on certain distributions such as dividends and discretionary bonus payments to the extent a bank or bank holding company does not maintain additional capital above the minimum requirements; and two new liquidity ratios designed to ensure that a bank or bank holding company has more highly liquid assets than expected net outflows in stressed conditions and access to more stable funding needed in stressed conditions.  Any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets and/or place limitations on business activities related to credit support provided to customers.  The major rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings of our long-term debt are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. Over the past 15 months, all of the major ratings agencies downgraded Regions’ and Regions Bank’s credit ratings. In addition, many of our ratings remain on negative watch or negative outlook. Negative outlook, negative watch or other similar terms mean that a future downgrade is possible. The ratings assigned to Regions and Regions Bank remain subject to change at any time, and it is possible that any ratings agency will take action to downgrade Regions, Regions Bank or both in the future. During March 2010, Moody’s Investor Services (“Moody’s”) announced, among other things, that the debt and deposit ratings of the seventeen largest U.S. banking institutions, including Regions and Regions Bank, could be negatively affected by the loss of implicit government support contained in the financial regulatory reform legislation that was then being debated in Congress. In its announcements, Moody’s stated that its current rating of Regions Bank benefits by 2 notches and its current rating of Regions benefits by 1 notch from Moody’s assumption regarding government support. After the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act in July 2010, Moody’s indicated that it is reviewing for possible downgrade the ratings of the ten largest U.S. regional banks and certain affiliated holding companies, including Regions and Regions Bank. Moody’s stated that it had incorporated extraordinary support into the banks’ ratings in 2009 when the U.S. banking system was in turmoil and the government clearly stated that there would be extraordinary support for the larger regional banks. Now that the U.S. banking system has moved beyond the depths of the financial crisis, the probability of government support for these banks could be lower, in Moody’s view. Additionally, although government authorities had the power to resolve these institutions prior to the recent enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, Moody’s believes that the new law signals the potential that government support for these banks will be reduced. A change in Moody’s assumptions regarding government support could lead to downgrades of the ratings of Regions and Regions Bank.  In general, ratings agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix and level and quality of earnings, and we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings. In addition, ratings agencies have themselves been subject to scrutiny arising from the financial crisis such that the rating agencies may make or may be required to make substantial changes to their ratings policies and practices. Such changes may, among other things, adversely affect the ratings of our securities or other securities in which we have an economic interest. Any decrease in credit ratings to a non-investment grade rating by one or more ratings agencies, could impact our access to the capital markets or short-term funding and/or increase our financial costs, and thereby adversely affect Regions’ financial condition and liquidity. Currently, Regions’ Senior ratings from Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, Fitch Ratings and Dominion Bond Ratings Service are 1, 1, 3 and 3 notches, respectively, above non-investment grade ratings. Where Regions is providing forms of credit support such as letters of credit, standby lending arrangements or other forms of credit support, a decline in short-term credit ratings may require that customers of Regions seek replacement credit support from a higher rated institution. Our counterparties are also sensitive to the risk of a ratings downgrade and may be less likely to engage in transactions with us, or may only engage in them at a substantially higher cost, if our ratings were downgraded to below investment grade. We cannot predict whether customer relationships or opportunities for future relationships could be adversely affected by customers who choose to do business with a higher rated institution.    88    Table of Contents The economic effects resulting from the recent oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico could adversely affect our earnings and results of operations.  On April 20, 2010, a deepwater oil rig located in the Gulf of Mexico caught fire and eventually sank, causing a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. A significant portion of our operations are located in the southeastern United States, including the areas bordering the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean which are or are anticipated to be affected by the environmental effects of this spill. This oil spill has adversely affected the economic environment and various industries located along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, causing many workers to lose their jobs In addition, discharges of pollutants or contaminants into the environment or improper disposal of hazardous waste generated in the course of cleanup operations may cause damage to property or collateral that could adversely affect us if not covered by insurance. The full effects of, and time required to clean, this oil spill are not yet known. Continuing economic difficulties along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico could impair our customers’ ability to timely repay their loans, requiring Regions to make additional allowances for loan losses and adversely affecting our earnings, results of operations and financial condition.  Future adverse regulatory developments could impact the carrying value of goodwill.  During the second quarter of 2010, Regions recorded a $200 million regulatory charge in the Investment Banking/Brokerage/Trust reporting unit. Future adverse developments related to the regulatory matter could develop which could negatively impact the carrying value of goodwill.      Item 2.
