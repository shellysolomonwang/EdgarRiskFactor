Item 1A.  Risk Factors  Recent legislation regarding the financial services industry may have a significant adverse effect on our operations.  On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). The Dodd-Frank Act implements a variety of far-reaching changes and has been called the most sweeping reform of the financial services industry since the 1930s. Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will directly affect our ability to conduct our business including:        •    Imposition of higher prudential standards, including more stringent risk-based capital, leverage, liquidity and risk-management requirements, and numerous other requirements on “systemically significant institutions,” currently defined to include, among other things, all bank holding companies with assets of at least $50 billion (which would include Regions);        •    Mandates requiring the Federal Reserve to establish standards for determining whether interchange fees charged by certain financial institutions are reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by such institution;        •    Imposition of additional costs and fees, including fees to be set by the Federal Reserve and charged to “systemically significant institutions” to cover the cost of regulating such institutions and any FDIC assessment made to cover the costs of any regular or special examination of Regions or its affiliates;        •    Establishment of a consumer financial protection bureau with broad authority to implement new consumer protection regulations and to examine and enforce compliance with federal consumer laws;        •    Application to bank holding companies of regulatory capital requirements similar to those applied to banks, which requirements exclude, on a phase-out basis, all trust preferred securities and cumulative preferred stock from Tier 1 Capital (except for preferred stock issued under the TARP, such as Regions Fixed Rate, Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A, which will continue to qualify as Tier 1 capital as long as it remains outstanding); and        •    Establishment of new rules and restrictions regarding the origination of mortgages.  Many provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act remain subject to regulatory rule-making and implementation, the effects of which are not yet known, including mandates requiring the Federal Reserve to establish compensation guidelines covering regulated financial institutions. In addition, further legislative and regulatory changes are still being considered, including the so called “bank tax” on institutions with greater than $50 billion in assets, such as Regions. The provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and any rules adopted to implement those provisions as well as any additional legislative or regulatory changes may impact the profitability of our business activities, require that we change certain of our business practices, materially affect our business model or affect retention of key personnel, require us to raise additional regulatory capital, including additional Tier 1 Capital, and could expose us to additional costs (including increased compliance costs). These and other changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to make any necessary changes and may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business as previously conducted or our results of operations or financial condition.    86    Table of Contents   We may be subject to more stringent capital requirements.  The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal banking agencies to establish stricter risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits to apply to banks and bank holding companies. Under the legislation, the federal banking agencies would be required to develop capital requirements that address systemically risky activities. The capital rules must address, at a minimum, risks arising from significant volumes of activity in derivatives, securitized products, financial guarantees, securities borrowing and lending and repurchase agreements; concentrations in assets for which reported values are based on models; and concentrations in market share for any activity that would substantially disrupt financial markets if the institutions were forced to unexpectedly cease the activity. These requirements, and any other new regulations, could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends, or could require us to reduce business levels or to raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.  In addition, recent proposals published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”), if adopted, could lead to significantly higher capital requirements, higher capital charges and more restrictive leverage and liquidity ratios. In July and December 2009, the Basel Committee published proposals relating to, respectively, enhanced capital requirements for market risk and new capital and liquidity risk requirements for banks. On July 26, 2010, the Basel Committee announced that it had reached “broad agreement” on the December 2009 proposals and published a set of amendments to these proposals. On September 12, 2010, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervisors of the Basel Committee, the oversight body of the Basel Committee, published its “calibrated” capital standards for major banking institutions (“Basel III”). Under these standards, when fully phased-in on January 1, 2019, banking institutions will be required to maintain heightened Tier 1 common equity, Tier 1 Capital and Total Capital ratios, as well as maintaining a “capital conservation buffer.” The Tier 1 common equity and Tier 1 Capital ratio requirements will be phased-in incrementally between January 1, 2013 and January 1, 2015; the deductions from common equity made in calculating Tier 1 common equity will be phased-in incrementally over a four-year period commencing on January 1, 2014; and the capital conservation buffer will be phased-in incrementally between January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019. The Basel Committee also announced that a “countercyclical buffer” of 0% to 2.5% of common equity or other fully loss-absorbing capital “will be implemented according to national circumstances” as an “extension” of the conservation buffer. The final package of Basel III reforms will be considered in November 2010 by the leaders of the Group of 20, and then will be subject to individual adoption by member nations, including the United States. The ultimate impact of the new capital and liquidity standards on us cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors, including the treatment and implementation by the U.S. banking regulators.  Any reduction in our credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets and/or place limitations on business activities related to credit support provided to customers.  The major rating agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings of our long-term debt based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally. Over the past approximately 18 months, all of the major ratings agencies downgraded Regions’ and Regions Bank’s credit ratings. In addition, many of our ratings remain on negative watch or negative outlook. Negative outlook, negative watch or other similar terms mean that a future downgrade is possible. The ratings assigned to Regions and Regions Bank remain subject to change at any time, and it is possible that any ratings agency will take action to downgrade Regions, Regions Bank or both in the future. During April 2010, Moody’s Investor Services (“Moody’s”) announced, among other things, that the debt and deposit ratings of the seventeen largest U.S. banking institutions, including Regions and Regions Bank, could be negatively affected by the loss of implicit government support contained in the financial regulatory reform legislation that was then being debated in Congress. In its April announcement, Moody’s stated that its rating of Regions Bank benefited by 2 notches and its rating of Regions benefited by 1 notch from Moody’s assumption regarding government support. After the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act in July 2010, Moody’s indicated that it was reviewing for possible downgrade the ratings of the ten largest U.S. regional banks and their affiliated holding companies, including Regions and Regions Bank. Moody’s stated that it had incorporated extraordinary support into the banks’ ratings in 2009 when the U.S. banking system was in turmoil and the government clearly stated that there would be extraordinary    87    Table of Contents  support for the larger regional banks. Now that the U.S. banking system has moved beyond the depths of the financial crisis, the probability of government support for these banks could be lower, in Moody’s view. Additionally, although government authorities had the power to resolve these institutions prior to the recent enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, Moody’s believes that the new law signals the potential that government support for these banks will be reduced. On November 1, 2010, Moody’s downgraded the obligations of Regions Financial Corporation and Regions Bank. As a result of the downgrade, the long-term debt rating of Regions Financial Corporation is below investment grade.  In general, ratings agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors, including capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix and level and quality of earnings, and we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings. In addition, ratings agencies have themselves been subject to scrutiny arising from the financial crisis such that the rating agencies may make or may be required to make substantial changes to their ratings policies and practices. Such changes may, among other things, adversely affect the ratings of our securities or other securities in which we have an economic interest. Any decrease in credit ratings to a non-investment grade rating by one or more ratings agencies, could impact our access to the capital markets or short-term funding and/or increase our financial costs, and thereby adversely affect Regions’ financial condition and liquidity. Currently, ratings on Regions’ parent company senior notes from Standard & Poor’s, Fitch Ratings and Dominion Bond Ratings Service are 1, 3 and 3 notches, respectively, above non-investment grade ratings. As stated above, on November 1, 2010, Moody’s downgraded the obligations of Regions Financial Corporation and Regions Bank. As a result of the downgrade, the long-term debt rating of Regions Financial Corporation is below investment grade. Where Regions is providing forms of credit support such as letters of credit, standby lending arrangements or other forms of credit support, a decline in short-term credit ratings may require that customers of Regions seek replacement credit support from a higher rated institution. Our counterparties are also sensitive to the risk of a ratings downgrade and have the ability to terminate or may be less likely to engage in transactions with us, or may only engage in them at a substantially higher cost, if our ratings were downgraded to below investment grade. We cannot predict whether customer relationships or opportunities for future relationships could be adversely affected by customers who choose to do business with a higher rated institution.  Future adverse regulatory developments could impact the carrying value of goodwill.  During the second quarter of 2010, Regions recorded a $200 million regulatory charge in the Investment Banking/Brokerage/Trust reporting unit. Future adverse developments related to the regulatory matter could develop which could negatively impact the carrying value of goodwill.      Item 2.
